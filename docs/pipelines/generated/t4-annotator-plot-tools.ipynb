 The debate over the Second Amendment rages on. Arguments continue over what a \\\"well-regulated militia\\\" is and what TRKBA means in practical terms.  However, the ONLY authority in this area, is a binding court decision on the matter.  Even a decision in this area is subject to an overturning by a higher court.  Is there anyone who has the facts of a legal precedent, preferably a Supreme Court decision on the specific meaning of the 2nd Amendment? \",\"Has anyone got multiverse to work ?

I am having the following 2 problems.  (1) Many of my Imakefile's have contructs like                 /**/#This is a makefile         at the start of lines to pass Makefile comments thru the C         preprocessor and into the Makefile.  Most of the C preprocessors that         I have used will not treat such a # as appearing at the start of the         line.  Thus the C preprocessor does not treat the hash symbol as the         start of a directive.           However the IBM cpp strips the comment and treats the hash symbol         as the start of a directive.  The cpp fails when it determines         that \\\"This\\\" is not a known directive.  I have temporarily hacked my         imake to handle this situation but would like to come up with a better         fix.  (2) Several Imakefiles use /**/ as a parameter to a macro when a particular         use of the macro does not need a value for the parameter.  The AIX cpp         gives warnings about these situations but continues to work OK.  If you are familiar with these problems and have solutions, I would appreciate information about on your solutions.  (Perhaps, this is solved in a later version of imake that I have not reviewed.)  Also, do you know of other cpp's that behave similarly?\",\"I have the following items for sale.

(Cross-posted to alt.psychology.personality since some personality typing will be discussed at the beginning - Note: I've set all followups to sci.med since most of my comments are more sci.med oriented and I'm sure most of the replies, if any, will be med-related.)     They are just responding in their natural way:  Hyper-Choleric Syndrome (HCS). Oops, that is not a recognized \\\"illness\\\" in the psychological community, better not say that since it therefore must not, and never will, exist.  :^)  Actually, it is fascinating that a disproportionate number of physicians will type out as NT (for those not familiar with the Myers-Briggs system, just e-mail me and I'll send a summary file to you).  In the general population, NT's comprise only about 12% of the population, but among physicians it is much much higher (I don't know the exact percentage - any help here a.p.p.er's?)  One driving characteristic of an NT, especially an NTJ, is their obvious choleric behavior (driver, type A, etc.) - the extreme emotional need to control, to lead, and/or to be the best or the most competent.  If they are also extroverted, they are best described as \\\"Field Marshalls\\\".  This trait is very valuable and essential in our society - we need people who want to lead, to strive to overcome the elements, to seek and thirst for knowledge, to raise the level of competency, etc.  The great successes in science and technology are in large part due to the vision (an N trait) and scientifically- minded approach (T trait) of the NT personality (of course, the other types and temperaments have their own positive contributions as well).  However, when the NT person has self-image challenges, the \\\"dark-side\\\" of this personality type usually comes out, which should be obvious to all.  A physician who is a strong NT and who has not learned to temper their temperament will be extremely business-like (lack of empathy or feeling), and is very compelled to have total control over their patient (the patient must be obedient to their diagnosis and prescription without question).  I've known many M.D.'s of this temperament and suffice to say I don't oblige them with a followup visit, no matter how competent I think they are (and they usually are very competent from a knowledge viewpoint since that is an extreme drive of theirs - to know the most, to know it all).  Maybe we need more NF doctor's.  :^)  Enough on this subject - let's move on to candida bloom.    You've helped me already by your post.  Of course, I believe that I have been misdiagnosed on the net as suffering from 'anal retentivitis', but being the phlegmatic I am, maybe I was just a little too harsh on a few people myself in past posts.  Let's all try to raise the level of this discussion above the level of anal effluent.    In my well-described situation (in prior posts), I definitely was immune stressed.  Blood tests showed my vitamin A levels were very low.  My sinuses were a mess - no doubt the mucosal lining and the cilia were heavily damaged. I also was on antibiotics 15 times in 4 years!  In the end, even two weeks of Ceftin did not work and I had confirmed diagnoses of a chronic bacterial infection of the sinuses via cat-scans, mucus color (won't get into the details), and other symptoms.  Three very traditional ENT's made this diagnosis (I did not have any cultures done, however, because of the difficulty of doing this right and because my other symptoms clearly showed a bacterial infection).  Enough of this background (provided to help you understand where I was when I make comments about my Sporanox anti-fungal therapy below).   The first question I have is this.  Can fungus penetrate a little way into poor mucus membrane tissue, maybe via hyphae, thus causing symptoms, without being considered 'systemic' in the classic sense?  It is sort of an inbetween infection.    I was concerned, too, because of the toxicity of vitamin A.  My doctor, after my blood tests, put me on 75,000 IU of vitamin A for one week only, then dropped it down to 25,000 IU for the next couple of weeks.  I also received zinc and other supplementation, since all of these interrelate in fairly complex ways as my doctor explained (he's one of those 'evil' orthomolecular specialists).  I had a blood test three weeks later and vitamin A was normal, he then stopped me on all vitamin A (except for some in a multi-vitamin) supplement), and made sure that I maintain a 50,000 IU/day of beta carotene. Call me carrot face.  :^)  Hopefully, Elaine's doctor will take a similar, careful approach and to all supplements.  I'm even reevaluating some supplements I'm taking, for example, niacin in fairly large dosages, 1 gram/day, which Steve Dyer had good information about on sci.med.nutrition.  If niacin only has second-order improvement in symptomatic relief of my sinus allergies, then it probably is not worth taking such a large dose long-term and risking liver damage.    Though I do now believe, based on my successful therapy with Sporanox, that I definitely had some excessive growth of fungus (unknown species) in my sinuses, I still want to ask the question:  have there been any studies that demonstrate candida \\\"blooms\\\" in the sinuses with associated sinus irritation (sinusitis/rhinitis)?  (My sinus irritation reduced significantly after one week of Sporanox and no other new treatments were implemented during this time - I did not have any noticeable GI track problems before starting on Sporanox, but some for a few days after which then went away - considered normal).  BTW, my doctor dug out one of his medical reference books (sorry, can't remember which one), and found an obscure comment dating back into the 1950's which stated that people can develop contained (non-lethal or non-serious) aspergillis infestations (aspergiliosis) of the sinuses leading to sinus inflammation symptoms.  I'll have to dig out that reference again since it is relevant to this discussion.    My doctor tested me (I believe a RAST or RAST similar test) for allergic response to specificially Candida albicans, and I showed a strong positive. Another question, would everybody show the same strong positive so this test is essentially useless?  And, assuming it is true that Candida can grow part-way into the mucus membrane tissue, and the concentration exceeds a  threshold amount, could not a person who tests as having an allergy to Candida definitely develop allergic symptoms, such as mucus membrane irritation due to the body's allergic response?  As I said in an earlier post, one does not need to be a rocket scientist, or have a M.D. degree or a  Ph.D. in biochemistry to see the plausibility of this hypothesis.  BTW, and I'll repost this again.  Dr. Ivker, in his book, \\\"Sinus Survival\\\", has routinely given, before anything else, Nizoral (a pre-Sporanox systemic anti-fungal, not as safe and not as good as Sporanox) to his new chronic sinusitis patients IF they have been on antibiotics four or more times in the last two years.  He claims that out of 2000 or so patients, well over 90% notice some relief of sinus inflammation and other symptoms, but it doesn't cure it by any means, implying the so-called yeast/fungus infection is not the primary cause, but a later complication.  He's also found that nystatin, whether taken internally, or put into a sinus spray, does not help.  This implies (of course assuming that excessive yeast/fungus bloom is aggravating the sinus inflammation) that the yeast/fungus has grown partway into the tissue since nystatin will not kill yeast/fungus other than by direct contact - it is not absorbed into the blood stream.  Again, I admit, lots of 'ifs', and 'implies', which doesn't please the hard-core NT who has to have the double-blind study or it's a non-issue, but one has to start with some plausible hypothesis/explanation, a strawman, if you will.    This brings up an interesting observation used by those who will deny and reject any and all aspects of the 'yeast hypothesis' until the appropriate studies are done.  And that is if you can't observe or culture the yeast \\\"bloom\\\" in the gut or sinus, then there's no way to diagnose or even recognize the disease.  And I know they realize that it is virtually impossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that cannot be easily observed since candida is everywhere in the body.  It's a real Catch-22.  Another Catch-22:  Those who totally reject the 'yeast hypothesis' say that no studies have been done (actually studies have been done, but if it's not up to a certain standard then it is, from their perspective, a non-study which should not even be considered).  I agree that the appropriate studies should be done, and that will take big $ to do it right.  However, in order to convince the funding agencies in these austere times to open their wallets, you literally have to give them evidence, and the only acceptable evidence to compete with other proposals is paradoxically to do almost the exact study needed funding.  That is, you have to do 90% of the study before you even get funding (as a scientist at a National Lab, I'm very aware of this for the smaller funded projects).  I'm afraid that even if Dr. Ivker and 100 other doctors got together, pooled their practice's case histories and anecdotes into a compelling picture, and approach the funding agencies, they would get nowhere, even if they were able to publish their statistical results.  It is obvious from the comments by some of the doctors here is that they have *decided* excessive yeast colonization in the gut or sinuses leading to noticeable non-lethal symptoms does not exist, and is not even a tenable hypothesis, so any amount of case histories or compiled anecdotal evidence to the contrary will never change their mind, and not only that, they would also oppose the needed studies because in their minds it's a done issue -  excessive yeast growth leading to diffuse allergic symptoms does not, will not, and cannot exist.  Period.  Kind of tough to dialog with those who hold such a viewpoint.  Kind of reminds me of Lister...    Aren't there also other nutrients necessary to the proper working of the sinus mucus membranes and cilia?    Again, the evidence from mycological studies indicate that many yeast/fungus species can grow hyphae (\\\"roots\\\") into deep tissue, similar to mold growing in bread.  You can continue to kill the surface, such as nystatin does, but you can't kill that which is deeper in the tissue without using a systemic anti-fungal such as itraconazole (Sporanox) or some of the older ones such as Nizoral which are more toxic and not as effective.  This is why, as has been pointed out by recent studies (sent to me by a doctor I've been in e-mail contact with - thanks), that nystatin is not effective in the long- term treatment of GI tract \\\"candidiasis\\\".  It's like trying to weed a garden by cutting off what's above the ground but leaving the roots ready to come out again once you walk away.  The $60000 question is whether a contained candida \\\"bloom\\\" can partially grow into tissue through the mucus membranes, causing some types of symptoms in susceptible people (e.g., allergy), without becoming \\\"systemic\\\" in the classical sense of the word - something in between strictly an excessive bloom not causing any problems and the full-blown systemic infection that is potentially lethal.    Also, if one is an 'anal retentive', like I've been diagnosed in a prior post, that can also provide more sites for excessive candida growth.  ;^)    As I've said in private e-mail, there are flaws in our current medical system that make it difficult or even impossible for a physician to attempt alternative therapies AFTER the approved/proven/accepted therapies don't work. For example, I went to three ENT's, who all said that I will just have to live with my acute/chronic sinusitis after the ab's failed (they did mention surgery to open up the ostia, but my ostia weren't plugged and it would not get to the root cause of my condition).  After three months of aggressive and fairly non-standard therapy (Sporanox, body nutrient level monitoring and equalization, vitamin C, lentinen, echinacea, etc.), my health has vastly improved to where I was two years ago, before my health greatly deteriorated. Of course, skeptics would say that maybe if I did nothing I would have improved anyway, but that view is stretching things quite far because of the experience of the three ENT's I saw who said that I'd just have to \\\"live with it\\\".  I'm confident I will reach what one could call a total \\\"cure\\\".  The anti-fungal program I undertook was one necessary step in that direction because of my overuse of ab's for the last four years.  (Note:  for those having sinus problems, may I suggest the book by Dr. Ivker I mention above. Be sure to get the revised edition.)    Dr. Ivker started off having chronic and severe sinus problems, and his visits to several ENT's totally floored him when they said \\\"you'll just have to live with it\\\".  He spent several years trying everything - standard and non-standard, until he was essentially cured of chronic sinusitis.  He now shares his approach in his book and I can honestly say that I am on the road to recovery following some parts of it.  His one recommendation to take a systemic anti-fungal at the beginning of treatment IF you have a history of anti-biotic overuse has been proven to him time and time again in his own practice.  I'm sure if I commented to him of the hard-core beliefs of the anti- \\\"yeast hypothesis\\\" posters that he would have definite things to say, such as, \\\"it's worked wonders for me in almost two thousand cases\\\", to put it mildly. I also would not be surprised if he would say that they are the ones violating their moral obligations to help the patient.  Maybe those doctors who are reading this who have a practice and are confronted by a patient having symptoms that could be due to the \\\"hypothetical yeast overgrowth\\\" (e.g., they fit some of the profiles the pro-yeast people have identified), should consider anti-fungal therapy IF all other avenues have been exhausted.  Remember, theory and practice are two different things - you cannot have one without the other, they are synergistic.  If a doctor does something non-standard yet produces noticeable symptomatic relief in over a thousand of his patients, shouldn't you at least sit up and take notice? Maybe you ought to trust what he says and begin hypothesizing why it works instead of why it shouldn't work.  I'm afraid a lot of doctors have become so enamored with \\\"scientific correctness\\\" that they are ignoring the patients they have sworn to help.  You have to do both;  both have to be balanced, which we don't see from some of the posters to this group.  There comes a point when you just have to use a little common sense, and maybe an empirical approach (such as trying a good systemic anti-fungal such as Sporanox) after having exhausted all the other avenues.  I was one of those who the traditional medical establishment was not able to help, so I did the natural thing:  I went to a couple of doctor's who are (somewhat) outside this establishment, and as a result I have found significant relief.  Would it not be better if the traditional medical establishment can set up some kind of mechanism where any doctor, without fear of being sued or having his license pulled, can try experimental and unproven (beyond a doubt) therapies for his/her patients that finally reach the point where all the accepted therapies are ineffective?  I'd like to hear a doctor tell me: \\\"well, I've tried all the therapies that are approved and accepted in this country, and since they clearly don't work for you, I now have the authority to use experimental, unproven techniques that seem to have helped others.  I can't promise anything, and there are some risks.  You will have to sign something saying you understand the experimental and possibly risky nature of these unproven therapies, and I'll have to register your case at the State Board.\\\"  Anyway, if my ENT had suggested this to me, I would've jumped on this pronto instead of going to one of those doctors who, for either altruistic reasons, or for greed, is practicing these alternative therapies with much risk to him/her (risk meaning losing their license) and possibly to the patient.  Such a mechanism would keep control in the more mainstream medicine, and also provide valuable data that would essentially be free.  It also would be morally and ethically better than the current system by showing the compassion of the medical community to the patient - that it's doing everything it can within reason to help the patient.  It is the lack of such a mechanism that is leading large numbers of people to try alternative therapies, some of which seem to work (like my case), and others of which will never work at all (true quackery).

Traditionally, they have used pictures, words, demonstrations,     music and dance to communicate imagery.  However, expressing     complex notions such as God and infinity or a seemingly well     defined concept such as a flower can present challenges which far     exceed their technical skills.      The explosive use of computers as visualization and expression     tools has compounded this problem.  In hypermedia, multimedia and     virtual reality systems vast amounts of information confront the     observer or participant.  Wading through a multitude of     simultaneous images and sounds in possibly unfamiliar     representions, a confounded user asks: \\\"What does it all mean?\\\"      Since image construction, transmission, reception, decipherment and     ultimate understanding are complex tasks, strongly influenced by     physiology, education and culture; and, since electronic media     radically amplify each processing step, then we, as electronic     communicators, must determine the fundamental paradigms for     composing imagery for understanding.      Therefore, the purpose of this conference is to bring together a     breadth of disciplines, including, but not limited to, the     physical, biological and computational sciences, technology, art,     psychology, philosophy, and education, in order to define and     discuss the issues essential to image understanding within the     computer graphics context.

As for 'Cyprus', In 1974, Turkiye  stepped into Cyprus to preserve the lives of the Turkish population  there. This is nothing but a simple historical fact. Unfortunately,  the intervention was too late at least for some of the victims. Mass  graves containing numerous bodies of women and children already showed  what fate had been planned for a peaceful minority.  The problems in Cyprus have their origin in decades of  oppression of the Turkish population by the Greek Cypriot  officials and their violation of the co-founder status of  the Turks set out in the constitution. The coup d'etat  engineered by Greece in 1974 to execute a final solution  to the Turkish problem was the savage blow that invoked  Turkiye's intervention. Turkiye intervened reluctantly and  only as a last resort after exhausting all other avenues  consulting with Britain and Greece as the other two signatories  to the treaty to protect the integrity of Cyprus. There simply  was not any expansionist motivation in the Turkish action at  all. This is in dramatic contrast to the Greek motivation which  was openly expansionist, stated as 'Enosis,' union with Greece.  Since the creation of independent Cyprus in 1960, the Turkish  population, although smaller, legally had status as the co-founder of the republic with the Greek population.  The Greek Cypriots, with the support of 'Enosis'-minded Greeks in the mainland, have consistently ignored that status and portrayed the Island as a Greek island with a minority population of Turks. The Turks of Cyprus are not a minority in a Greek Republic and they found the only way they could show that was to assert their  autonomy in a separate republic.  Turkiye is not satisfied with the status quo. She would rather not be involved with the island. But, given the dismal record of brutal Greek oppression of the Turkish population in Cyprus, she simply cannot leave the fate of the island's Turks in the hands of the Greeks until the Turkish side is satisfied with whatever accord the two communities finally reach to guarantee that history will not repeat itself to rob Turkish Cypriots of their rights, liberties and their very lives.

The answers I received at that time allowed me to get a prototype of my project working. However, during this process I have come up with new problems.  1) There seems to be a limit of 255 characters for a DDE Topic string. Is this inherent in all DDE systems or just peculiar to MSACCESS or VB?  2) It is easy to query an Access database from VB using the DDE SQL command, (provided the above limitation is overcome by using short field and table names) but how is one meant to update a database?    a) A DDE SQL UPDATE command does not seem to work.    b) Initiating an Access macro using a DDE Execute command from VB cannot       be used because when the macro requests information from VB using a       second DDE channel the programs dead lock until time- outs occur.       (The VB to Access channel has to close before the Access to VB channel       is initiated, I guess.)    c) Access does not allow VB to DDE POKE the information.      The way I eventually managed to update a database was by sending key-    strokes from VB to Access using the SendKeys command. This technique has    the problem that Access cannot be minimised and it must always be in a    state ready to respond to the sequence of key-strokes VB sends.  Are all the above statements correct or have I made incorrect assumptions? Are there any better work arounds to the above?

Unless I am badly mistaken, Rohit is suggesting that protecting boys from men is different than protecting girls from men. There are situations in which boys and girls are apart from members of the *opposite* sex (due to social convention or whatever) and thus are safe (in at least some sense). These same situations don't (necessarily) protect the children from abuse by members of the *same* sex.  If we can understand that, it's not such a tremendous leap to suggest that if we all think about it hard, *someone* may come up with a practical solution (or even a partial solution) to some of the situations in which children are made vulnerable to homosexuals who wish to abuse them. By working together \\\"with good will on both sides\\\", we may be able to start solving problems without restricting anyone's freedoms.  Mr. Walz on the other hand is using Rohit's post as an excuse for personal attacks on Mr. Cramer. While Mr. Walz hasn't (by a *long* stretch) been the only one to flame Mr. Cramer, it is no less childish and it only serves to weaken any other arguments he may make in the future. \",\"Sorry if this is a FAQ.

Why would any private sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that was KNOWN to be at least partially compromised? (Key escrows in this instance)  Why would any private sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that had not been properly evaluated?  (i.e. algorythm not publically released) The answer seems obvious to me, they wouldn't.  There is other hardware out there not compromised.  DES as an example (triple DES as a better one.)  My suspicion is that the prices will drop dramatically on these non clipper systems.  If not we're in trouble.  Given that the Clinton administration is not entirely stupid (although we'd like to think so) I cannot believe that they have failed to realize this. They know their initiative will fail, much as crippled DES was never taken seriously.  The only way their moves can work is by coercion.  You know little about politics if you don't realize that this is just a first step in the next move, it makes NO sense otherwise.  The next move, banning or SEVERLY crippling crypto not using the \\\"Clipper\\\" system is easily justified \\\"Why would anyone want other encryption unless they were trying to subvert the government?  We've provided you with a very secure alternative so use it or go to jail/be fined/whatever.\\\" How can you reconcile the administrations self proclaimed purpose of providing law enforcement with access to encrypted data without making the clipper system the only crypto available in the U.S... ?  You simply can't, and the administration knows it.  Anyone who wanted to keep the govt. out of their hair, be it for drug dealing or whatever, would just buy still available non-clipper systems.  Don't sell our crafty Clinton types short, they can't be THAT stupid. Either banning non clipper crypto is the next answer or the administrations collective I.Q. is about that of a potato.  Why do you think AT&T jumped on so fast?  They know it's going to be big, and NOT because it's better.  Right on the face of it, noone will buy the stuff that doesn't have to.  AT&T must know this too, THINK MAN, why the hell would they jump the gun?   I really wonder.  To wit:  The letter I just sent to Clinton:  The White House Office of the Press Secretary c/o: Presidential Comment Line (fax) (202) 456-2461   April 17, 1993   Sir and/or Madam:     I must object most strongly to the administrations evolving position on encryption and cryptography.  I am shocked at the Clinton regimes increasing lean towards a authoritarian approach with regard to privacy and freedom from government oversight in day to day life.   It is apparent to me that those who drafted the \\\"Clipper Chip Proposal\\\" (which is, incidentally, gaining notoriety as the \\\"Big Brother Proposal\\\") are either incredibly ignorant or very sly indeed.  Anyone knowledgeable in the nuances of cryptographic development and research must understand that a key step in the development of a new algorithm, especially one destined for standardization, is the full disclosure of the algorithm to the private and academic sectors.  The proper evaluation of an algorithm dep      ends on careful scrutiny by these sectors, and only such scrutiny can provide true public confidence in the security of the algorithm.  The assumption that a new algorithm will be accepted based on assurances from \\\"experts\\\" without full disclosure is plain ignorance.   In addition, the assumption that an algorithm will be marketable over other technology, such as DES, when it is characterized by key escrow is lunacy.  It seems an easy step in the logic chain that probable consumers will prefer to purchase equipment not crippled by government key escrow, no matter how \\\"tamper proof\\\" the key escrows might be.   I cannot believe that even the least educated policy maker would have failed to realize these flaws.  I can only assume then that the drafters of the \\\"Clipper Chip Proposal\\\" knew very well the difficulties of selling a crippled system to the private sector.  The only way this proposal makes any sense, or has any chance of succeeding is in coercion.  Even the language of the proposal makes it painfully clear that the next logical step is the outlawing of other encryption devices and hardware that do not uti      lize the \\\"Big Brother Chip.\\\"   Unfortunately the public at large is not educated enough on the issue to realize what they are losing.  I expect the Big Brother proposal to encounter little resistance from the American people who you will have so efficiently duped once again with pretty words like \\\"harmony,\\\" \\\"right to encryption,\\\" and \\\"voluntary.\\\"   It mortifies me that the phrase that seems to be used more and more often to characterize the Clinton administration is \\\"I can't believe it's happening here.\\\"  More startling is a question a colleague of mine posed and the realization that everyday it becomes more and more relevant; \\\"When is the Reichstag fire planned for?\\\"           Most Concerned,         [Signature]       Shaen Logan Bernhardt I uni@acs.bu.edu \",\": >The Selective Service Registration should be abolished.

The historical evidence proves that during  the period of 1914 to 1920, the Armenian Government ordered, incited,  assisted and participated in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people  because of race, religion and national origin. Armenians perpetrated acts  of sabotage, destroyed telephone cables, blew up bridges, blocked passes,  set up ambushes, attacked security stations and small Turkish outposts  behind the Ottoman Army lines on the one hand, and on the other ruthlessly  attacked Turkish and Kurdish villages, slaughtering the Turkish population  indiscriminately, women, children, old and young alike. Innocent  Muslims were one by one cruelly bayonetted to death, or massacred with  axes and swords, or else shut up in mosques or in schools and then burnt alive as can be seen below.  Widespread Armenian massacres of innocent Muslims took place in regions  of Van, Kars, Sivas, Erzurum, Bitlis, Erzincan, Mus, Diyarbakir and  Maras. The Ottoman Army, while fighting to prevent the Russian invasion, also had to deal with Armenian genocide squads who cowardly hit from  behind. The Armenian genocide of the Muslims spread to all parts of  Eastern Anatolia. Starting from late 1914, Armenians committed  widespread massacres and genocide in Eastern Anatolia, because the arena was left to the Armenians. Almost every Turkish town and village from  Erzincan up to Azerbaidjan suffered large scale massacres and genocide  by Armenians and the Turkish genocide has been documented by Armenian,  Russian, American, British, Ottoman, German, Austrian and French  journalists and officers who observed the first genocide of this century committed by the blood-thirsty Armenian genocide squads.  The Ottoman Army, liberating Trabzon, Bayburt, Erzincan, Erzurum,  Kars and other regions from the Russians, saw that the cities and their  villages had been destroyed and burnt, people slaughtered, massacred. The massacres conducted by Armenians, which became a black stain for humanity, shocked and disgusted even the Russian, British, German, Austrian, French and American authorities.  Almost every Ottoman document is related to Armenian massacres and  cruelties. The inhuman treatment, cruelties, atrocities, genocide by  Armenian genocide squads perpetrated against innocent Moslem Turkish  and Kurdish people, are sufficiently reflected in historical documents.  Even today over seventy-five years later, the terrifying screams of  the victims of these cruelties can be heard.

How's the Fund coming along? \",\" Looking at [1] we find that during Roman times \\\"Tyre vied with Sidon for first place in the intellectual life of the period\\\"; that Tyre was the seat of a Christian bishop, eventually with 14 dioceses under it; that \\\"the most magnificent church of its kind in all Phoenecia\\\" was the basilica built in Tyre ca. 314; that Tyre was well known for its exports of glassware, wine, white marble, and dyed cloth; that Tyre, along with other seaports, \\\"provided outlets for South Arabian, Indian and even Chinese trade\\\"; that Tyre had to accomodate its growing population by \\\"following a perpendicular, rather than horizontal, line of growth\\\" (because it was running out of land to build on); that Tyre established colonies of its own.  None of this sounds like a \\\"small fishing village\\\" by any stretch of the imagination.  Centuries later, under the Abbasids, Tyre had \\\"opulent and flourishing bazaars\\\" and buildings of 5-6 stories.  During this period, Tyre was \\\"noted for its export of sugar, beads, and, as of old, glassware.\\\" During the Crusades, Tyre was the second-most flourishing city held by Franks.  (There is a lot more, but I got tired of writing.)  In [2] we read the following description of modern Lebanon: \\\"other *major cities* in Lebanon include Tripoli, Sidon, Tyre, Baalbek and Zahlah.\\\"  [my emphasis]  This source also discusses the impact of the Lebanese Civil War, and the Israeli military actions (1978, 1982) on the trading ports of Tyre and Sidon.  It notes that after Israel's withdrawel in 1984, \\\"Tyre appeared to enjoy a revival of its local economy.\\\"  If Tyre is such an insignificant little fishing village at present, why is it always called a city (or, above, a \\\"major city\\\")?  Why does it show up on all the maps?   When population figures for cities in Lebanon are given, why is Tyre always one of the cities on the list (even if the list is only a dozen cities long)?  [1] Philip K. Hitti, _Lebanon in History: From the earliest times to the present_, NY, St. Martins, 1967.    [2] Federal Research Division, Library of Congress, _Lebanon: a country study_, edited by Thomas Collelo, 1989.   A one-horse town?  Sounds like a lot of work for one horse. (Anyway, Tyre is connected by roads to the mainland.  They may even use cars these days. :-)   The 1991 Encyclopedia Britannica says \\\"Pop. (1982 est.) 23,000.\\\"   Most other references give figures in the 14-17 thousand range. (One atlas gives the population of Tyre as 60,000; the same source give comparatively high figures for Sidon and Beirut, also, so I doubt that it is a typo.  Perhaps these were figures for the cities and their surrounding areas.)  I don't doubt that the population of Tyre has fluctuated over the last few decades.  In particular, the 1982 Israeli military action hurt Tyre quite a bit.      I thought you were talking about times that Tyre was destroyed. Don't most, if not all, of these apply not just to Tyre but to  the other cities in the area?  Sidon, for example?  Can you make a case for Tyre having been singled out?   They had a good deal of autonomy under the Seleucids. From [2]: Tyre \\\"receiv[ed] the rights [of autonomy] from Antiochus Ephiphanes and from 125 BC onward enjoy[ed] complete autonomy. She started a large series of coins, occasionally in gold ...\\\"  The descriptions of Tyre under the Romans don't seem to fit your characterization, either.  And under the Abbasids it seems to have been allowed to flourish.  I still think you are stretching when you try to describe Tyre as having been nothing but a small fishing village.   A Christian apologist whose standards of scholarship are quite low. He happens to quote the same source you quote (Nina Jidejian, _Tyre through the Ages_, Beirut, Dar El-Mashreq Publishers, 1969). The same sentence, in fact.  He defends the fulfillment of the prophecy using the same argument you are using, an argument that I haven't seen in print anywhere else, which is why I jumped to the conclusion that you were quoting Josh.  (I tried to find the Jidejian book, but it isn't listed in Books in Print.  Can you tell me more about it? Her descriptions are so much at odds with everything else I've read; I'm curious to know why.)\",\" Carrying a pistol, loaded or unloaded, in the glove compartment, is considered carrying a concealed weapon in Colorado and is illegal without a concealed weapons permit.  Unless the law has been changed recently, carrying a weapon openly is legal in Colorado but concealing it is illegal. I read a newspaper account last year where police stopped a car on a traffic infraction and observed a .357 magnum revolver sitting on the seat.  The driver could not be cited for possessing or carrying the weapon because it was not concealed.  The article stated that if the gun had been discovered in the glove box, it would have been considered a crime. \",\"The parable of the Prodigal Son is not about who is and who isn't an immoral person. It is about grace and the love of God. Most people would agree with that concerning the younger son. The elder son is simply a negative example of the some thing. He thinks that he must earn his father's love, that he has earned it, that he is entitled to it. His father tells him that he is on the wrong track. He has always been loved--for the same reason his brother has always been: he is his father's son.  We are too performance oriented to consistently get the point.

TRANSLATION   The Vedas deal mainly with the subject of the three modes of material nature. O Arjuna, become transcendental to these three modes. Be free from all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and safety, and be established in the self.                                    PURPORT   All material activities involve actions and reactions in the three modes of material nature. They are meant for fruitive results, which cause bondage in the material world. The Vedas deal mostly with fruitive activities to gradually elevate the general public from the field of sense gratification to a position on the transcendental plane. Arjuna, as a student and friend of Lord Krsna, is advised to raise himself to the transcendental position of Vedanta philosophy where, in the beginning, there is brahma-jijnasa, or questions on the supreme transcendence. All the living entities who are in the material world are struggling very hard for existence. For them the Lord, after creation of the material world, gave the Vedic wisdom advising how to live and get rid of the material entanglement. When the activities for sense gratification, namely the karma-kanda chapter, are finished, then the chance for spiritual realization is offered in the form of the Upanisads, which are part of different Vedas, as the Bhagavad-gita is a part of the fifth Veda, namely the Mahabharata. The Upanisads mark the beginning of transcendental life.   As long as the material body exists, there are actions and reactions in the material modes. One has to learn tolerance in the face of dualities such as happiness and distress, or cold and warmth, and by tolerating such dualities become free from anxieties regarding gain and loss. This transcendental position is achieved in full Krsna consciousness when one is fully dependent on the good will of Krsna.  Bhagavad-Gita As It is Books of A.C.

The next day, FBI agents were insisting that they saw Davidians setting the fire. The FBI was also adamantly denying that it was possible their battery of the compound's wallks could have accidentally set the blaze, while also saying they hadnt been able to do much investigating of the site because it was still too hot.

If you were using a IIfx, that might be another story.  Make sure there is only one terminator in the cabling and it must be at the end.  Some boxes have internal terminators; some can be switched out and others are socketted.  These count.  If the box with internal terminations cannot be put on the end to terminate the cabling, they have to be disabled, ie, switched out or pulled out of their sockets.  If you have 2 boxes with internal terminations, the terminations in one box has to be disabled...., etc.  I am sure that this has been covered by the \\\"experts\\\".  My experience with SCSI boxes that connect to the Mac indicates that they must have some software package for the Mac to 'talk' to them.  My PLI MO drive and Sharp scanner has one for each.

My guess is that it may come sooner if Apple decides to  change the price structure upon release of the multimedia units this summer.  Your price looks pretty good at about $50 more then I payed for mine last month.  I would have rather waited for one of the new machines this sommer (like the Cyclone) but the resale value of my IIci would have not been squat by then.  Thus, financing forced me to purchase now.  I'm happy with the machine and won't feel betrayed at all when Apple cuts the price to less then $1000 next week (heh).  Bottome line:  If the C650 does what you want, buy it.  If you wait until the Cylcones come out for a price break then you might as well wait for the PowerPCs to come out for another price break and then the units which follow them.  You may save some money but you've lost a lot of time when you could have been using the computer.  Face it, Apple's prices are going to be in a continuous state of flux.  At least they aren't going to try raising them again (grin).\",\"I recently published a new privacy-protecting off-line electronic cash system as a technical report at CWI. Being a PhD-student at David Chaum's cryptography-group, our group has a long history in research in the field of privacy-protecting cash systems.  The report is called CS-R9323.ps.Z, contains 77 pages, and can be retrieved from  ftp.cwi.nl   (192.16.184.180)  from the directory pub/CWIreports/AA. The postscript-file is suitable for 300dpi laserprinters.  ==================================================================== ABSTRACT (from coverpage): We present a new off-line electronic cash system based on a problem, called the representation problem, of which little use has been made in literature thus far. Our system is the first to be based entirely on discrete logarithms.  Using the representation problem as a basic concept, some techniques are introduced that enable us to construct protocols for withdrawal and payment that do not use the cut and choose methodology of earlier systems. As a consequence, our cash system is much more efficient in both computation and communication complexity than any such system proposed previously.    Another important aspect of our system concerns its provability. Contrary to previously proposed systems, its correctness can be mathematically proven to a very great extent. Specifically, if we make one plausible assumption concerning a single hash-function, the ability to break the system seems to imply that one can break the Diffie-Hellman problem.     Our system offers a number of extensions that are hard to achieve in previously known systems. In our opinion the most interesting of these is that the entire cash system (including all the extensions) can be incorporated in a setting based on wallets with observers, which has the important advantage that double-spending can be prevented in the first place, rather than detecting the identity of a double-spender after the fact. In particular, it can be incorporated even under the most stringent requirements conceivable about the privacy of the user, which seems to be impossible to do with previously proposed systems. Another benefit of our system is that framing attempts by a bank have negligible probability of success (independent of computing power) by a simple mechanism from within the system, which is something that previous solutions lack entirely. Furthermore, the basic cash system can be extended to checks, multi-show cash and divisibility, while retaining its computational efficiency. ====================================================================  Cryptographers are challenged to try to break this system!    I made a particular effort to keep the report as self-contained as possible.  Nevertheless, if you have any questions, please e-mail to me and I will try to reply as good as I can. Any comments are also welcome!

A reference station with a very exactly known position computes the errors in the incoming GPS signals.  These errors are due to several factors including atmospheric distortion, SA (Selective Availability) time dithering, etc.  The reference unit contains complex computational  equipment to \\\"back out\\\" the errors in its position (since it knows where it is already).  It then transmits these corrections on a  broadcast which is available to any number of relatively local receivers.  If the receivers are nearby (<300km) and are using the same satellites as the reference unit, the errors should be very similar for the reference unit and the receiver unit.  Thus, the receiver unit may apply the corrections calculated by the reference unit.  The US Coast Guard is currently (as far as I know) installing a series of coastline transmitters for differential GPS.  These stations will use existing radio towers.  I believe the frequency is to be approximately 305 kHz.  There are many other private corporations offering DGPS signals on different frequencies.  For example, PinPoint ((310)-618-7076) offers correction signals and receiver units using an FM broadcast system which has stations all across the US.  The correction codes are usually transmitted using the RTCM 104 format. Advertised accuracies espouse 1 to 5 meter errors.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------- John P. Baker                   | My opinions are my own.

Given about $10k in lab equipment and chemicals (which are commercially available) and given the knowledge that I have (graduating BS, Ch, 1993) I could  synthesize enough of these compounds to make a serious dent in the population of several major US cities.  As also noted, the knowledge is there for the production of nuclear weapons.  It's not even that restricted.  The only thing is the expense.    Now I'm not going around making these things, but it's not 'cause of any law; I simply don't get any marginal benefit out of killing anyone.  Any law you enact in this respect is only going to give you the ability to  add a charge against someone who does make and use said weapons.  In the case of chemical agents, I seriously doubt that you would even know that someone had set up a lab until after the weapons had been used.    Part of the trouble with the chemical-weapons ban treaty between the US and the USSR is that many of the precursors to chemical weapons such as GB and Sarin, etc., is that they have very valid commercial uses, and  it is very easy to divert those precursors to chemical weapons manufacture without anyone knowing about it.   \",\" Probably within 50 years, it will be possible to disassemble and re-assemble our bodies at the molecular level.

I further believe that they did this as agents of the Israeli government, or at least in agreement with them. At least some of the information collected by the ADL was passed on to Israeli officials.  In some cases it was used to influence, or attempt to influence, people's access to jobs or public forums.

Used printers are fine, non-apple printers are fine, but whatever printer I get must fit the following:  Required features:  - PostScript  - 300 dpi  - emough memory to download fonts  - The cheaper, the better.  I'd prefer under $1000.   Nice things:  - anything over 4 pages per minute  - scsi output for a font disk  - smallish footprint    Don't Care About:  - PostScript Level II  - networking (its just for me, and always will be)  - color   I know about Freedom of Press, but I've also heard that its painfully slow. I can tolerate about 4 ppm, but anything slower than that and I'm not going to consider the price savings worth it.  I'd be curious to hear people's experience with it, tho.   I also infinitely prefer laser over ink; I used to use HP deskjets in my last job and wasn't impressed with the quality.

Of course, I said \\\"No problem\\\" and went to work. Unfortunately, the DRDOS refuses to recognize the hard drive during  installation, even though I am still able to boot off of the hard drive using the old DOS.  After openning it up I discovered it was using an 8-bit  Seagate SCSI controller on a ST-157N SCSI 40Mbtye drive.  I then booted  with DRDOS 6.0 off of the floppy a second time and ran fdisk to see if  I could access the drive.

I then tried  to remove the primary partition, which it wouldn't allow me to do.

I inject on my legs and gut, and prefer the gut.  I can stick it in at a 90 degree angle, and barely feel it.  I'm not fat, just have a little gut.  My legs however, are muscular, and I have to pinch to get anything, and then I inject at about a 45 degree angle,and it still hurts.  The rate of absorbtion differs for subcutaneous and   muscular injections however--so if it's a daily thing it would be best not to switch places every day to keep consistencey.  Although some suggest switch legs or sides of the stomach for each shot, to prevent  irritation.  When you clean the spot off with an alcohol prep,  wait for it to dry somewhat, or you may get the alcohol in the puncture, and of course, that doesn't feel good.  A way to prevent irratation is to mark the spot that you injected.  A good way to do this is use a little round bandage and put it over the  spot.  This helps prevent you from injecting in the same spot, and spacing the sites out accuartely (about 1 1/2 \\\" apart.)  This is from experience, so I hope it'll help you.

If most people }use scissors to cut paper, shouldn't Consumer's Reports }test scissors for paper-cutting ability, even though }scissors may have been designed originally to cut cloth?  That's possibly a good way to judge the use of the Bible in teaching Jewish morality today, but it hardly seems fair to claim that this highly-interpreted version is what was \\\"enlightened for its times\\\".

It was created to meet to the daily research needs of scientists  conducting climate investigations using satellite data and remote sensing techniques.        Intuitive Graphic Interface   Sphinx features an interactive interface with pop-up menus and  point-and-click dialog boxes which makes image processing and analysis simple and fast.  This accessible menuing enables you to build attractive image  layouts quickly while also providing you the flexibility of returning to the main menu to conduct other image analysis and processing operations.        Image Format Compatibility   Using smart read/write functions, Sphinx allows you to easily open and save image files in a variety of formats using bit, integer or real data values.  Sphinx also reads and writes the common TIFF and GIF formats as well as compresses and decompresses image formats to save disk space.        Image Analysis & Processing   For image and pixel analysis, the Sphinx package includes an assortment of processing tools that perform useful statistical and  mathematical filtering operations, such as Fourier transforms, convolution  product or principal component analyses. An interactive interpreter for both algebraic equations and images allows the user to manipulate and combine individual data channels interactively. Standard FORTRAN notation is used for formula entry and for trig onometric and transcendental functions.        Satellite Spectra & Orbit Analysis   Sphinx possesses functions to simulate satellite signal sensitivity for various meteorological satellites (e.g., GOES, METEOSAT, NOAA, Spot etc.). The simulations are conducted for a selection of standard atmospheric and surface conditions and instrument spectral bands. A geometry model computes the solar zenith angles, warping, orbit simulation, and 3-D image projection.        Easy External Program Interfacing   Sphinx allows users the flexibility to integrate externally developed software algorithms for processing and converting satellite observations.  Sphinx exports and imports image files and image parameters to external programs using special interface functions.        Quick Quality Presentation   Sphinx rapidly displays, manipulates, and enhances high-resolution multispectral images and color tables.  Using six 8-bit 1024x1024 image planes and one graphics plane, the package conveniently combines color images, graphics and text to generate sharp digital images for articles and reports. Sphinx's 2-D and 3-D graphics editor provides complete flexibility for modifying and integrating vector graphics and analysis plots with images, such as  histograms and radial graphs.  The package supplies color and gray scale output for standard inkjet and laser printers.  Other Capabilities Sphinx also performs image animation, external  graphics importing, mosaic fitting... what else?        Software Support & Development    Sphinx was developed at the Laboratoire d'Optique Atmospherique (LOA)  of the Universite de Lille, France. The package has received critical feedback and support from scientists at the French national laboratory, Centre National de Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), and the French space agency, Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES). At LOA, Sphinx undergoes continued refinement and development to meet changing research needs and advances in computer technology.  The package, which features on-line help, is supported by an Internet address   sphinx@loasil.citilille.fr through which questions can be answered and  version updates provided without delay.        Performance Tested    CNES has selected Sphinx to analyze and process the satellite data  collected during the upcoming ADEOS/POLDER satellite mission.  Today, the Sphinx package is in use at the NASA - Goddard Space Flight Center and is widely used in many French laboratories, including the Centre de Recherche en Physique de l'Environnement, Ecole Normale Superieure , Laboratoire d' Etudes et de Recherches en Teledetection Spatiale,  Laboratoire  de Meteorologie Dynamique.

If you are caught with one it will be confiscated on the spot and will not be returned until after you appear in court and pay your fine.  The fine for having a radar detector accessible in a motor vehicle (even if it is not on) is $250.00.  Sorry, tourist, ignorance of the law is no excuse - they will get you too!  It used to be that the only way the law could be enforced was for an officer to actually see the radar detector.  Not any more!  Many law enforcement agencies are now using radar detector detectors.  Right, a super sensitive receiver that is capable of picking up RF from the radar detector itself.  My first reaction was \\\"no way!\\\"  But, guess again, these little buggers really work and the police are writing citations right and left for people using radar detectors.  One news story quoted an officer as saying that he had found the radar detector in all of the cars he stopped except one, and he could never figure out where it was - but he knew it was there.  This tends to make one assume there are few false arrest.  Now, before I get flamed, please understand that I do drive at or near the speed limit.  I do not need a radar detector to keep me from getting a speeding ticket.  But, I do like to know when my speed is being clocked or a speed trap is functioning.  My radar detector now stays locked in my trunk when I am in Virginia (which is what they want - and yes, what the law says, and I intend to obey the law!) and is only used in states where it is legal.  For my fellow hams, I am not a microwave person - my mind only works in the HF spectrum between 10 and 80 meters.  Microwave enlightment may be necessary.  So, the questions are -   What do the radar detector detectors actually detect?   Would additional shielding/grounding/bypassing shield stray RF generated by   a radar detector, or is the RF actually being emitted by the detector   antenna?   Are any brands \\\"quieter\\\" than others?\",\"Philadelphia at Chicago:  Teams tied for 1st after Sunday      Dick Redding battled Chet Brewer in the first game of a dramatic four game series.  One Friday, one Saturday, and a good-old Sunday doubleheader. \\\"What could be better,\\\" declared Ernie Banks.  Perhaps the fact that the Cubs are challenging?      \\\"It's pitching, it's always been pitching that we've lacked,\\\" announced Ryne Sandberg.  \\\"If we can get by Brewer, then beat Carlton, Alexander, or Bunning - preferrably 2 of the last three - we'll know we might be able to win.      \\\"Lord, I hope we pull it off.\\\"      The Phils scored once in the top of the first; Richie Ashburn singled, Pete Rose followed with a hit, sending Ashburn around second.  Kiki Cuyler cut the ball off in left center, and threw a bullet in to Ernie Banks, who threw to Ron Santo to get Ashburn at third.  Rose went to second on the play.      Christobel Torrienti lifted a long fly to center, moving Pete Rose to third.  Schmidt was walked - the Cubs were absolutely refusing to let him beat them.  Both Torrienti and Schmidt will likely draw 130-150 walks this year.  Chuck Klein is starting to hit very well, and he lashed a double into a gap in right-center.  \\\"Cool Papa\\\" Bell's speed allowed him to cut the ball off and prevent Schmidt from scoring.  Nellie Fox was walked, and Bob Boone grounded out to second, ending the threat.        \\\"Teams are starting to realize that you don't have to pitch to Schmidt or Torrienti, and that is lowering their run total.  It puts a lot of pressure on Klein and Dick Allen (who platoons with Chuck Klein and occasionally spells Rose at first), and it's a credit to the Phillies that they've been able to sustain their pace.  The picthers have slumped at times.\\\"  So came the analysis from Frank Chance.      The Cubs got that run back when Bell bunted for a hit, Thomas' grounder moved him to second, and - after Sandberg made out - Billy Williams singled home a run.  In the sixth, Ron Santo launched a two-run homer to make it 3-1.  Dick Redding got in trouble in the eighth, as Schmidt singled and Klein singled him to third.  Ed Reulbach entered to face Fox, but Dick Allen popped out of the dugout to hit.  Allen doubled to right, but luckily for the Cubs, Williams had moved to left and Andre Dawson had been inserted for defense. He fired a bullet to home plate to keep Klein at third.  Lance Parrish, hitting for Boone, was walked, and Bruce Sutter entered.  Larry Bowa grounded into a 1-2-3 double play, but Ed Delahanty walked as a pinch-hitter.  Desiring a strikeout, since Ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quick Trillo pinch-running at third, Chance brought in Lee Smith, who induced a pop-up to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder, ending the inning.  The Cubs took the win, 3-2, moving a game behind the Phillies.      Steve Carlton was called upon to battle 3-Finger Brown Saturday.  To get another righthander in the lineup, Ron Santo moved to first and Bill Madlock played third.  Unfortunately, Brown allowed six doubles, and the Cub bullpen was worn down even more, as the Cubs tried to maintain a lead against Lefty.  Madlock, batting sixth, had knocked two doubles of his own, driving home four runs.  Gabby Hartnett hit two home runs, and Cuyler added another, and the score was 8-6, Cubs after six innings.  The Phillie bullpen had more troubles in the bottom of the eighth, as the Cubs grabbed 3 more runs to ice an 11-7 triumph.      Sunday's twin bill saw Cool Papa Bell gather seven straight hits at one point, including a rare outside-the-park home run in the second game, off Robin Roberts.  Grover Alexander of the Phils took the first contest, 4-2, but the Cubs captured the second one 5-4, with Waddell gaining the win.  Bruce Sutter tossed two innings for the save, though he allowed one run in the eighth.  The Cardinals stood half a game behind these co-leaders, and would conclude their series with the Expos on Monday. -------------------------------------------------------------------      Montreal at St. Louis(August 3-6): 3-way tie for 1st      Dennis Martinez is on a roll, and he continued it versus John Tudor Friday. The Expos have a wide variety of hitters, and - while they aren't among the all-time greats, they are getting the job done.  After winning their first first two games, they suddenly found themselves only 2 1/2 games out of first in this wacky season.      Martinez triumphed 5-3 on Friday, and WIlliams outdueled Dizzy Dean 3-2 Saturday.  However, the Cardinals refused to give up, winning 6-2 on Sunday. The Cards captured Monday's game, too, as Steve Carlton outdueled Steve Rogers 3-2.  \\\"We're really good against ground ball pitchers because of our team speed,\\\" remarked Lou Brock.  \\\"I don't see why we can't win this division.\\\"      The Phillies and Cubs may have some reasons for them.  Two-thirds of the way through the season, there is a 3-way tie for first. -------------------------------------------------------------------      New York at Pittsburgh(August 3-6): 3 straight 3-2 wins for Bucs, now 2 back - but in 4th!     \\\"When your team is in a slump like we are, the worst thing is to play in a pitcher's park like this,\\\" spoke Gil Hodges before the series.  Keith Hernandez added that \\\"their defense takes away quite a few runs per year, and it must be giving them an extra 6-7 wins.\\\"  The Pirates have made only 26 errors all season, 6 ahead of the second place Dodgers.  Error totals tend to be around 50 for the best defensive All-Time teams.      Rube Foster defeated Sid Fernandez 5-2 Friday, and Candelaria outshone Seaver 3-2 Saturday, in a game featuring some outstanding defense.  When Nolan Ryan and two relivers 6-hit the Mets in another 3-2 win Sunday, the Pirates could once again look forward to a victory getting them back to the .500 mark.  They had been unable to several times in the past month.  Bert Blyleven met Dwight Gooden in the afternoon game.  Both pitchers possessed fantastic stuff, and the only runs scored through eight innings were on home runs - a solo shot by Rusty Staub of the Mets and a two-run blast by Ralph Kiner for the Pirates.  The Mets' Darryl Strawberry singled home a run in the top of the ninth off Jesse Orosco, working his second inning, after Mookie Wilson pinch-ran for Gary Carter at second.  With one out and a runner on first, Lee Mazilli was sent in to pinch-hit.  The Pirates countered with Kent Tekulve, placing him in the fifth spot in the order and putting Barry Bonds in left field as the ninth place hitter.  Tekulve induced a groundout forcing Strawberry at second.  He slid hard into Honus Wagner, preventing the Pirates from turning their fifth double play of the afternoon.  Tekulve allowed a hit, but Clemente threw Mazilli out at third from near the right field line, ending the inning.  Tug McGraw relieved Randy Myers, who entered to pitch the eighth, and got one out before Bonds launched a rocket to deep center, running through the stop sign at third to score an inside-the-park homer to win.  The Pirates had scored an improbable 3 straight 3-2 wins, and had moved to within 2 games of first place, with seven weeks to go. ------------------------------------------------------------------      San Francisco at Boswaukta(August 3-5):      Another Sunday doubleheader appeared on the schedule, as the Giants managed to close the gap on the other teams thanks to some starting pitching that just wouldn't tire.  In fact, reported manager John McGraw, \\\"once this rough part of the schedule is over, maybe as early as this coming week, we may shift to a 4-man rotation again for a little while.\\\"      Juan Marichal continued his hot pitching Friday, beating Lew Burdette and the Braves 4-1.  Willie Mays had all four r.b.i.s on 3 hits.  Rick Reuschel faced Joe Niekro Saturday in a slugfest.  The Braves' park had been a homer haven, but this took the cake, as the Giants won a seesaw affair 16-13. Willie Mays had three homers, Willie McCovey, Eddie Matthews, and Don Baylor had two, and Hank Aaron, Ernie Lombardi, Biz Mackey, and Mel Ott had one each.  The Braves had collected 149 home runs going into Sunday's doubleheader, putting them on a pace for 223, which would be 4 short of the National League record.  They were still a tad behind the '61 Yankees' pace. They had allowed over 120, though.  Vida Blue actually got the win after retiring 2 batters in the fifth.  He allowed only a run in the sixth, but faltered in the seventh.  Joe McGinnity earned the save.      In the doubleheader, the Braves' Hoyt Wilhelm failed to hold a lead in the first game, but Hank Aaron homered off Bill Foster in the eighth as the Braves won, 4-3.  The Giants took the second game, however, by a 6-2 score. The homer by Aaron was a magical #150 by the Braves; however, they fell to three game below .500, making a comeback extremely unlikely. -------------------------------------------------------------------      San Diego at Cincinnati(Aug. 3-5):  Randy Jones faced Ewell Blackwell in the first of this 3-game series, and the Padres felt rather good.  With Don Mattingly straining his back in the last Cleveland game, the trade looked even better.  McGriff's batting average was even rising.  Of course, the bench was very poor, and Joe Gordon was only adequate in the outfield, but these were minor problems, since the pitching was holding up.      Jones pitched a good game Friday, and won 6-3.  McGriff launched two home runs.  Mel Harder earned a win with the help of Mark Davis and Ray Narleski Saturday; 5-4 was the final score.  Tom Candiotti battled Satchel Paige to a 3-3 tie through eight innings before departing.  The game was scoreless for 4 more innings until the thirteenth.  Paige had departed after 10, and John Franco hurled a scoreless inning.  Tom Browning was working his second scoreless inning, when Dave Winfield doubled with one out and Joe Gordon was pitched around.  Thurm Munson doubled both runners home, and the Padres gamed a 5-3 win.  The three-game sweep had pulled the Giants into a tie with the Reds.  Though the Reds denied it, the highly emotional series with the Dodgers may have taken too much out of them. -------------------------------------------------------------------      Brookangeles at Houston(August 3-5):      Another series capped off by a weekend doubleheader took place in the wide open plains of the Astrodome.  The Astros sent Joe Niekro to the hill in the first game, opposite Don Drysdale.  \\\"Normally,\\\" Drysdale remarked, \\\"I would be challenging hitter by being ready to throw at them.  I can't afford to with this team, though; we have to get our own runners going; we can't Davis will get decked once.\\\"      The fact that Glenn Davis leads the team in homers with six (!) is primarily why he would be decked, but it should be understood that his current pace would give him nine for the season.  The hitting on this team is a little better, but the power is all doubles and triples.  Still, Carl Furillo is the main reason no Astro home runs were hit over the weekend, as he threw two runners out trying for inside-the-park homers.  For those unaware of the nastness of the Astros' park, they have a 23-foot high gray wall all around the outfield; balls must be hit into the seats to be home runs.  The foul poles are 355 feet from home plate, but the alleys are 400 feet away, with center field at 420 feet.  \\\"It's as if some three-year-old threw a tantrum and told his playmates: 'If I can't hit home runs, nobody will hit home runs',\\\" remarked Roy Campanella.      The Dodgers stole five bases Friday, but the Astros decided to revitalize the Baltimore chopping that had failed 6 weeks before; for tonight, anyway, Davis, Jim Wynn, and Jose Cruz did not have to mess with their swings, according to the manager.  After Poles and Willie Wells reached base via the Baltimore chop, Drysdale decked Jose Cruz with a pitch.  He responded with a two-run double, but Wynn - playing first for Davis - popped up, and the Astros didn't score any more in that inning.  They did score 3 in the fourth to erase a 3-2 deficit, and the Astros wound up winning 6-4.  They threatened to do even better the next game, as Tommy John would be their opponent. Walt Alston met privately with the starters at 6 A.M. before the game.      \\\"I think I know how we can beat the Baltimore Chop,\\\" he explained.      \\\"How can we do that,\\\" Pee Wee Reese wondered.      \\\"They're going to be beating the ball down, so we've got to be ready to throw on the run.  Steve will start at first to dig balls out of the dirt, but I want all of you to practice your barehanded picks and throws.  We'll go with a shallow infield almost the whole time.\\\"      The plan almost worked.  Mike Scott allowed only two runs through eight innings, but the Astros got three; two of them scored when Bill Doran pushed a bunt into the outfield in the fourth with runners on second and third.  3-2 Astros was the final, with Dave Smith earning another save.  The Dodgers scored a victory in the first game of the twin bill Sunday, as Nolan Ryan walked five, three of whom scored in a 4-1 Dodger win.  Fernando Valenzuela lost the second game 4-2 to Don Sutton, however, as the Dodgers' thirteen stolen bases in the series proved to not be enough.      \\\"We're mostly a power team,\\\" remarked Ron Cey.  \\\"Jackie and, when he plays, Maury Wills are our only real speed demons, though a couple other plays can do it now and then.  We're sunk in a place like the Astrodome.  I guess that's why they're so successful there.\\\"  Indeed, it seems that basestealing teams give them the most trouble in the dome.  The 'Stros swiped 12 bases in 16 attempts, giving them 230 on the season.

He is trying to explain the Immaculate Conception and the Assumption of Mary.]   If this is true than why in the Genesis story is God concerned that Adam and Eve might also eat from the Tree of Life and live forever and be like gods?  Eating of the tree of life would not take away the effects of eating of the Tree of Knowledge.  Is there any reason to assume that they had already eaten of the Tree of Life and so had already attained to eternal life?  If so, what basis is there for saying that this was taken away from them?  To me the wages of sin are a spiritual death, not necessarily a physical death.  I can attest to the truth of this interpretation from my own experience. I suspect that many others could attest to this as well.   Peace Will  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- \",\"{Send follow ups to comp.sys.mac.advocacy.

CPUs Comparison List As a general rule of thumb Motorola chips are faster than Intel chips at the  same frequency {030/25 ~= 386/33; 040/25 ~= 486dx/50}, but Intel has chips at  higher frequencies than Motorola, so this evens out.  The Macintosh Bible 4th  ed. supports the comparisons between Intel and Motorola chips for the 68020  and above.  <=80186    ~ 68000 {16-bit vs 16/24/32-bit chip [data path/address  lines/data & address registers].  The 4MB limit on the 68000 Macs brings it  down to the 80186 and lower chips, otherwise it would compare to the 80286.}  286        ~ 68020 {hardware segmenting vs. 68020's 32-bit ALU and these chips  come have no usable built-in MMU unlike their successors [80386, 68030].  The  hardware segmenting's protected mode is used by OS/2 1.0 => and Windows 3.X.  The use of the hardware segmenting and their 16-bit nature put the 286 between  the 60000 and 68030 in features and the LC's 16-bit data path strenghthens the  286 ~ 68020 comparison.}  386       ~ 68030 {Two 32-bit chips with MMUs, and protected memory.  A/UX 3.0  is at present the only Mac OS to use the 68030's protected memory feature for  apps.  System 7.x uses this feature to protect a RAM disk created by the  Memory control panel but this is supported only on Powerbooks and Quadras.   The Color Classic and LCII 16-bit hardware data paths makes the 68030s in them  comparative to 386sxs.}  486sx   ~ 68LC040 {same as 486 and 68040 without the FPU; used as a low cost  solution for people who do not need the FPU.

These chips may flounder against the cheaper (PC Week 3/08/93;  4/12/93; PC Mag 4/27/93:110), earlier released (PC Week 12/7/92; MacWeek  12/14/92; PC Week 2/08/93), less leat producing {160 degrees F for Pentium (PC Mag 4/27/93:118)}, and partly ported to PowerPC chips.}   PowerPC   = PowerPC {This CPU line is planned to run programs from DOS,  Windows 3.x, OS/2 and Mac OS on top of PowerOpen-A/UX 4.0 [UNIX] and later  Pink [Taligent OS] by using emulators or, if necessary, the OSes themselves in  a 'shell' a.k. how SoftPC or OS/2 does DOS.}  Hardware  {In an effort to remove the 'reconfiguring the system almost every time you  add something' requirement for add-in cards, drivers, video, and operating  systems in the IBM world, Intel, Microsoft and 12 other hardware and software  developers are working out 'plug and play' standards (PC Week 03/08/93).} Color Support/Display  Mac: 30.24 MHz Pixel Clock standard.  All present Macs support the use of  32-bit color through 32-bit color QuickDraw in ROM.  32-bit color QuickDraw  allows an almost transparent capability to display and edit X-bit images in Y- bit color and retain ALL the colors of Y-bit color [Where X and Y  independently are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32] regardless of monitor resolution {63  dpi [12\\\" color] to 94 dpi [PaletteBook]} or monitor type {including  autosynchronous VGA, MCGA and SVGA monitors with ranges including 66.7 hz  vertically and 35 kHz horizontally and only a hardware video adaptor (MacUser  Aug 1992: 158-176).  Older machines that supported color {SE/30, II, IIX, and  IIcx} had only 8-bit color in ROM and needed a software patch to use 32-bit  color (MacUser Special 1993:28-29).   To keep costs down and speed up most Macs have only 8 or 16 bit display  capability built-in, but most of those can be expanded to display 24-bit  color.    Presently QuickDraw is optimized for 72 dpi display; QuickDraw QX  will change this. In addition, QuickDraw allows, in Macs with a NuBus slot, more then one  monitor to be used in any combination, from two monitors showing the same  thing to multiple monitors acting as one large large monitor with any degree  of overlap of the pictures. VRAM: Video RAM.  Standard for present non-PowerBook Mac's handling of   built-in video {from a 32-bit color palette}. VRAM provided runs a 8-bit  color 640x480 display; expandable to 16-bit color or a 8-bit 832x624 display.  Sound output:  Standard in all Macs since the 128K.  Stereo sound became   standard with the SE/30.  IBM:  Even though PCs have ROM BIOS definitions of how the operating system  interacts with the video hardware (Nan Zou), the use of drivers bypassing  BIOS, video hareware inconsitancies {see Super VGA below} and nonstanderzation of clone BIOS have left resolution of video display hardware, OS and program  interaction up to the OS and video hardware in question (Faisal Nameer  Jawdat). In addition, IBM and clone makers never bothered to provide a  standard hardware mechanism for software to determine what display mode is  actually present (Matt Healy) nor a standardized screen-drawing toolbox {like  Mac's QD}. As a result the OS must be very well written to detect some modes,  especially with some third party cards or to use them consitantly {At present  things are so dependent on the interaction of the program, OS, print driver  and monitor card that editing 32-bit pictures regardless of color mode, OS,  and monitor type/card combination as one can do on the Mac is impossible with  an IBM.  For example, one cannot edit a 32-bit color picture done on a OS/2  486 with a SVGA monitor on a 386 with VGA {18-bit color palette} and DOS 5.0  and still have ALL the colors one started out with}. Later IBM machines will have integrated graphics accelerators, faster  processors, and modular upgradeability and may have built-in sound cards, CD  ROM, and Ethernet (PC Week 12/14/92).   MDA: Monocrome Display Adapter  original character-mapped video mode, no graphics, 80x25 text. CGA: Color Graphics Array  320x200 4 colors or 640x200 b/w, 16 color palette, bad for the eyes. EGA:  Enhanced Graphics Array  640x350 16 colors from 64 color palette [and some lower res]; some versions   could run at 256 colors, bearable on the eyes. VGA:  Video Graphics Array*  320x200 at 256 colors, 640x480 at 16 colors, and some others, these two are   the most commonly used.  All modes have a 256K CLUT, from a   18 to 24-bit {IBM} or a 32-bit {Mac} color palette.  25.175 MHz Pixel Clock  (Mel Martinez).  Monitors use analog input, incompatible with TTL signals  from EGA/CGA etc.  MCGA:  Multi-Color Graphics Array*  subset of VGA that provides all the features of MDA & CGA, but lacks some EGA   and VGA modes, like VGA 640x480x16 (Dictionary of Computer Terms-DCT).    Common on the initial PS/1 implementation from IBM and some PS/2 Models. SVGA:  Super VGA*  This is not a standard in the way the others were, but instead was a 'catch   all' category for a group of video cards.  As such, with each manufacturer   using their own implementation scheme, SVGA was chaos with people debating  as to what is SVGA and what is not.  In an effort to make SVGA more of a   standard VESA was established and is used in the newer units, but things  are still a mess.  Video is either 512K [~1990] or 1M [today], resolution  of 800x600 and 1024x768 at 16 and 256 colors are common, newer ones [since   1990] have the Sierra HiColor RAMDAC, giving 15-bit 32,768 colors at 800x600,   some of the very newer ones [~6/92] can do 24 bits per pixel [usually   at 640x480].  Speedwise, too much variation, some very slow [Western Digital   Paradise based, for example], some very fast [S3 86C911 based, for example],   some are so-so [like Tseng ET4000, a very popular chipset].  Some limiting   factors overcome by 40MHz VL Bus & 386's linear address mapping were:   8.33 MHz ISA bus, AT architecture where the CPU looks at the card through a   64K \\\"window\\\", etc. Other non-SVGA standards:  8514/a:  IBM's own standard, interlacing graphics accelerator with graphics functions   like linedraw, polygon fill, etc. in hardware. Some clone implementations   from ATI are the fastest video available today, though some clone models do   not have interlacing.  TMS34010/34020: high end graphics co-processors, usually >$1000, some  do 24-bit, speeds up vector-oriented graphics like CAD. XGA:  eXtended Graphics Array  newer and faster than 8514/a, only available for MCA bus-based PS/2s, clones   are coming out soon.  Emulates VGA, EGA, and CGA (DCT).  Max resolution at   1024x768x8b, same as 8514/a, also some 16 bpp modes. XGA-2  Accelerates graphics functions up to 20 times faster than standard VGA in  Windows and OS/2, including line draws, bit and pixel-block transfers, area  fills, masking and X/Y addressing. Has an intelligent way to detect and co-  exist with other XGA-2 cards, so multiple desktops like on the Mac may not be   far away.  Since this is an architecture, its resolution and color depth   isn't fixed {IBM implements only 16-bit [65,536] color, while other   companies can have 24-bit color through IBM technical licenses}. Refresh   rates up to 75 Hz, ensures flicker free, rock solid images to reduce visual   discomfort, and is VGA compatible. Up to 1280x1024 on OS/2. *some monitor types usable by Mac-See Mac section above for specific details.  Expansion Both Mac & IBM SCSI: only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM.  Allows the use of any device: hard drive, printer, scanner, Nubus card   expansion {Mac Plus only}, some monitors, and CD-ROM.    Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal   terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port   {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and at the   end.  Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}.  SCSI-1:  7 devices per SCSI controller.  8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}  and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfers.  Difference is due to SCSI-1 software  drivers.  \\\"Fast SCSI-1\\\" is a misname for 8-bit SCSI-2 in SCSI-1 mode  {see SCSI-2 for details}. SCSI-2: 10 devices per SCSI controller in SCSI-2 mode.  SCSI-2 is fully  SCSI-1 compliant and 8-bit SCSI-2 tends to be implemented as a very fast  SCSI-1 since it does not require the different controller interfaces in    hardware and software that 16 and 32-bit SCSI-2 do.  Transfer speeds are  4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and  15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst {32-bit/wide and fast}.  Since 8-bit SCSI-2 can  use SCSI-1 software drivers and hardware at 8-bit SCSI-2 speeds and as such  is limited to 7 devices sometimes it is mistakenly called \\\"fast SCSI-1\\\".   16-bit fast SCSI-2 requires a SCSI-2 software driver and SCSI-2 electronics  but can still use the SCSI-1 ports.  Wide 16-bit and 32-bit SCSI-2 require a  different SCSI port, electronics, and software driver from SCSI-1 {Which  makes them more expensive than other SCSI interfaces}. Mac SCSI: asynchronous SCSI-1 built-in standard since the Plus.  Even though   Apple developed some specifications for SCSI controlers, the OS SCSI Manager  needs to be rewritten to take full advantage of the features of both SCSI  interfaces.  As a result present SCSI-2 Macs use 8-bit SCSI-2 as a fast   asynchronous SCSI-1.  Presently Quadras are the only Macs with a SCSI-2  controller chip built-in (Digital Review, Oct 21, 1991 v8 n33 p8(1))   though they lack some other parts of the hardware, like the wide SCSI-2 port   interface.  Since other Macs require a NuBus card to use SCSI-2, older NuBus   Macs had a bottleneck due to the speed of the NuBus and CPU.  Rumor-some  Cyclone Macs {June} will come with a wide & fast SCSI-2 port standard   and have a rewritten OS SCSI manager. IBM SCSI:  SCSI-1 is not too wide spread yet, generally not bundled with   systems, except as add-on {EISA and VESA Local Bus adapters avalable}.  Like the Mac, 8-bit SCSI-2 is used as a very fast SCSI-1 by most controllers  out there.  Unlike the Mac, IBM has no exact SCSI controller specifications  which results in added incompatibilities for SCSI.  Mac Memory expansion: with a few exceptions the Mac has used non-parity 30-pin   8-bit SIMM memory expansion since the Plus.  While 32-pin 9-bit parity SIMMs  could be used in these Macs, only special IIcis could make use of the parity   feature {By convension both SIMM types are called 32-pin SIMMs}.  The IIfx   used 64-pin parity SIMMs.  The LC III, C610/650 and Q800 all use a new   72-pin SIMM that is accessable by 32-bits at a time and is used in IBMs.  The Mac does a complete memory check at startup by writing/reading every  memory location; if something is seriously wrong with a SIMM the Mac will  not boot and give a sound chord indicating what the problem is.  Since Macs made before Feb 15, 1993 managed memory baced on data path, SIMMs   had to be installed in pairs {16-bit} or in sets of 4 {32-bit}.  The Centris   650 and Quadra 800 eliminate this with a new memory management setup that   allows memory to be upgraded one SIMM at a time.  If the SIMMs are the same   size are used then the memory is 'interleaved' across the two SIMMs resulting   in a 10-15% performance boost on RAM access (MacWorld Apr 93: 108-109). Printers, ADBs, and modems: built-in interfaces standard. Monitor interface and sound input: built-in on most present macs.  PDS: Available in SE & all present non-Powerbook Macs. 16-bit {SE,   Portable, LC, LC II, Classic line} and 32-bit.  Operates at CPU's MHz.    Maximum through put: data path in bytes*CPU's MHz {Q700/900 & C650:   4 * 25Mhz = 100MB/s; Q800 & Q950: 4 * 33Mhz = 132MB/s}. Standardized with  the LC and 040 bus designs.  With an adapter one NuBus card can be used in   IIsi and C610.  Problem: some cards have timing dependency which slows   through put down. NuBus Mac II: 32-bit, 10 MHz bus clock, 1-to-1 transaction/bus cycle ratio,  and contiguous, hand-shake transactions at ~10-20MB/s; theoretical peak:  40MB/s.  Built-in on all Modular Macs except the LC series, C610, and   Performa 400.  The SE/30 could be adapted to use this and there was even a   Mac Plus SCSI NuBus.  Supports every possible expansion from CPU to Ethernet   to DMA. NuBus 90: NuBus Mac II back compatable. 20MHz bus clock, avg throughput:  ~30MB/s; burst mode: 80MB/s.  Future card designs will be 7\\\" instead of the   old 12\\\". QuickRing:  A peer-to-peer bus used in parallel with NuBus 90.  Apple's   VLBus - \\\"Architecture is identical to that of VLBus\\\" (Byte 10/92:128).  Burst mode: 350MB/s (Byte 10/92:128). In development. CPU expansion: handled either through the PDS or the NuBus.  Unlike PDS,    Nubus CPU cards {example-Radius Rocket} allow use of multiple processors at   the same time.  This is like having two or more Macs in the same box able to   dual task or joinly process depending on the card or software involved {Each   NuBus card needs its own memory but most NuBus cards of this type come with   8MB RAM SIMMs on the card standard}.  IBM Memory expansion:  parity SIMMs, non-parity SIMMs {some newer models do a Mac- like SIMM memory check}, or a dozen or so different types of memory boards.  HD Interfaces {limited to hard drives by design or lack of development}:  MFM:  Modified Frequency Modulation, RLL:  Run Length Limited  only used with smaller [\\u00b2 60mb] hard drives. IDE:  Integrated Device Electronics   Asynchronous {~5MB/s max} and synchronous {8.3MB/s max} transfer.  currently the most common standard, and is mainly used for medium sized   drives. Can have more than one hard drive.  ESDI:  Enhanced Small Device Interface  ~1.25MB/s throughput. generally considered better interface than SCSI-1 in  many ways but not common enough for practical consideration.  Outside of  hard drives, device choices are very limited compared to SCSI-1.   BUS interfaces {New 'plug and play' ISA and EISA compatable cards may have problems working  with old cards (InfoWorld; PC Week 03/08/93; Vaporware 4/93).} ISA  8 & 16-bit interfaces common. Has 24-bit data path limit {which produces a  16MB limit for which there are software workarounds} (PC Mag 4/27/93:105).  1.5 MB/s (Byte 3/93:132).  Uses edge-triggered interrupts, can't share them,  hence comes the IRQ conflict.  Limited busmastering capabilities, some cards  aren't bandwidth limited {COM  ports, LPT ports, game ports, MIDI card, etc.}  while others are {video and disk controllers}.  Dominant factor, but it's  showing its age.  Most ISA motherboard designs are 16-bit  (PC World Feb 1993: 144-5)}.   MCA {Micro Channel}  IBM's 16 and 32-bit bus; \\\"allows use of more than one CPU in a computer\\\"   (DCT) and anything can talk to anything, as fast as the two components   involved can handle it. Never took off because it was incompatible with ISA   and EISA.  Planned to be bus interface of IBM PowerPC 601 (Carl Jabido). EISA {NuBus Mac II is closest Mac equivalent}  32-bit, 8.33 MHz, burst mode: 33MB/s.  It also has the ability to   self-configure cards like MCA and allows multiple bus masters, sharable   interrupt and DMA channels and multiple CPU use. VESA Local Bus: VLB {Sometimes mistakenly refereed to as PDS}  Local Bus standard. Runs at CPU clock rate,  Burst modes: ~130 MB/s{32-bit}  250 MB/s{64-bit} (Byte 10/92:128).  Limited to three slots but allows bus   mastering and will coexist with either ISA or EISA. Consitered ideal for   video and disk I/O.  DELL has filled a claim that this violates one of  their patents (Mel Martinez). QuickRing: Apple's faster {350 MB/s burst} version of VLB architecture  (Byte 10/92:132).  Might show up in some IBM and PowerPC machines  (Byte 10/92:132-133). In development. PCI  Intel's version of Local Bus that is intended to totally replace   ISA/EISA/MCA.  In development.  OSes {assumes full installation [print drivers, fonts, Multifinder, etc.] and multiple application use.} Mac 512K to 1MB of OS and hardware commands have been put into ROM.  This allows  Apple to control its machine by putting key hooks for the Mac OS {QuickDraw,  menu commands, print, mouse, SCSI & sound drivers, etc} in ROM, which require  clone makers to use the ROM chip or read ROM on to disks {Which requires  access to the proper Mac since different Macs have slightly different ROM  chips; Plus vs Classic for example.}  With key hooks for the OS support  interface in ROM, programers do not have to worry as much whether the disk OS  has the necessary hardware commands or that those commands are consitant and  therefore can write smaller programs.  This also allows Apple greater control  over hardware-software standards and that the disk OS can be smaller and, with  some of the tookbox command code in ROM, with lower RAM requirements then a  totally disk based OS.  Macs use Masked ROM which is as fast as DRAM (Jon  Wtte). 6.0.7: Single program usage base requirements: 1 MB and DD floppy,   cooperatively-multitasking base requirements: 2MB and HD floppy.    Features a GUI, cooperative-multitasker [MultiFinder], standard program   interface, & standard stereo sound support [snd]. Network receiving part of   AppleShare software is bundled with the OS. Has a 8MB RAM barrier and is a   24-bit OS. Some third party products allow 14MB of Virtual Memory as long as   real RAM is below 8MB. 6.0.8: 6.0.7 with 7.0.0 print drivers. 6.0.8L:  System 6 for some Macs that require System 7.0.X. 7.0.X: Base requirements: 2MB, 40MB Hard Drive, and 68000; De-facto standard   to run all features well: 4MB, 80MB Hard Drive, and 68030 {lowest present   non-portable Mac configuration}.  Using up to 10.08MB {This is EVERYTHING on  system disks} of hard disk space this has 6.0.7 features plus program linking   within and between computers [IAC], built-in server capabilities {Filesharing   can be used by older OSes using AppleShare Client software and can be   accessed by 10 macs max; 4-5 is more speed practical, IAC requires 7.X},   Virtual Memory in machines with MMU{1.6 times real RAM for least noticeable   IIsi speed degradation}, drag and drop, QuickTime & built-in TrueType   support.  Supports sound input [AIFF and snd formats] for most present   machines.  Can access up to 1GB of true RAM and 4GB of virtual memory and is   both a 24 and 32-bit OS.  To use real RAM beyond 8MB it must be in 32-bit   mode and on older machines requires the 'Mode 32' extension.  Apple's last   'free' OS. 7.1.0: 7.0.1 with WorldScript support, speedier, and less RAM usage than   7.0.dot (MacWeek 8/24/92; 9/14/92; PC Week 9/7/92). To run in 32-bit mode   on older machines it requires the 'Mode 32' or '32-Bit Enabler' extension.   Marks the start of Apple saling its Mac OS instead of allowing free upgrades  {Bundled with new machines, $49 for 7.0.X upgrades, $99 otherwise}.  [The installer has a bug that when upgrading it may keep some old system   fonts from the previous system inside the system file.  This can eat up any   RAM benefits and cause other problems.  Apple itself recommends removing all   fonts from the system file.] A/UX 3.0 [UNIX]: Needs 8MB RAM {12-20MB suggested}, 160MB hard drive, and   a 68030 or 68040 equivalent to run.  This 32-bit preemptive multitasking OS   is large due to being UNIX and needing translators between it and the Mac   ROMs.  Price: $709. Note: sound output was supported in OSes 3.2 to 6.0.5 by many formats  including the following:  snd, WAVE, ASND, FSSD, QSSN, SMSD, SOUN, dc2d, and  DCFL.  In 6.0.7 the sound manager was optimized for the sound standards 'snd'  and AIFF which causes some playback problems for the old formats, though most  still play.  IBM  Machiness have little GUI code, data, and hooks present in hardware for  programmers to work with, so most of the coding must be provided in the OS.   Since hard disks were slow the disk OS code is read into RAM.  In addition,  what little ROM code there is also read into RAM {a process called Shadow ROM}   This results in faster implementation since RAM is faster then PROMS or  EPROMS.  Having most of the OS code on disk has the advantage of being able to  better optimize the code given a certain piece or collection of hardware which  is harder with a ROM based system due to the 'patches' needed.  In addition it  reduces the need for and size of patches if a major revision of the hardware  support is needed. Side note:  The FTC charged that MicroSoft formed a OS trust by not providing  all feature documentation for its OSes to developers outside MS and designing  its Windows and DOS apps to fail under OS/2 (\\\"Undocumented Windows\\\") and  \\\"There is deliberate code in [Windows] NT Beta which causes the install to  abort if OS/2 Boot Manager is present\\\" (Gregory Hicks, Info-IBMPC Digest V92  #201).  Due to a conflict of intrest by one member the vote of the FTC  judicial council for action against Microsoft was a tie which resulted in no  action.  Rumors-the FTC will presue the matter, likely to the point of  choosing a new member or whole new council.  In addition the government has  turned down Microsoft's copyright of \\\"Windows\\\" which would allow it to charge  a fee for developers using their hooks (PC Week 03/08/93). MicroSoft OSes DOS 5.0: Has a 640K barrier with its own memory manager, a 1 MB barrier   with third party memory managers.  This 16-bit OS requires that each program   must provide its own print drivers and be 16-bit {Programs need to be DOS   Protected Mode Interface (DPMI) compliant and running on a 386dx [32-bit   Protected Mode] to break these barriers}.  Contains the GUI shell present in  DOS 4.0. DOS 6.0: DOS 5.0 with the added features of a built-in file compresion, disk   defragmenter, debugger for the CONFIG.SYS file. It needs a $80 module for   networking {Cost: $50 through 5/93, after that $129.99}   (Byte April 1993:44-46). DOS 7.0: 32-bit DOS. In development (PC Week 04/05/93). Window 3.0: Runs on top of DOS.  Breaks 640K and 1M barriers but still has to   deal with DOS file structure.  Base requirements: 1MB, floppy and 286; to  run well 2MB, hard drive, 386sx and fast display adapter {> 8-bit}.  Has the  equivalent of Mac's QD called Windows GDI [Graphics Device Interface].  This does not have a consistent application interface {Like early Mac  programs  (1984-1985)} nor a very large program base {compared to DOS} and  still tends to slow the machine down (Info-IBMPC Digest V92 #186) with speed  is more dependent on the display adapter then on the CPU (Bill Coleman).  Window programs tend to be disk and memory hogs compared to their DOS  counterparts (Byte April 1993:98-108). Window 3.1: A faster version of Window 3.0 with better memory managment. Base   requirements 1 MB, hard drive and a 286 ;to run well 2MB, hard drive, 386sx.   Apple plans to release its print drivers for this (PC Week 12/28/92). Windows for Workgroups:  To run well: 4MB RAM and 386dx (PC World Feb/93:160).    Intermediary between Win 3.1 and Windows NT.  It is basically Windows 3.1   with built-in peer to peer networking support. Windows NT:  Beta release takes about 50MB of disk space [including the   swap file], and 12MB RAM {Betas are notorious for RAM usage especially in   the interaction between debuging code and program compliers, hence the   reports of 24MB requirements}.  Released version supposed to need 8MB RAM   but, Gates himself now recommends 16MB RAM (PC Week 04/15/92).  This 32-bit OS has Protected mode multitasking, multithreading, symmetric   multiprocessing, a recoverable file system, and 32-bit GDI.  Has built in  networking that is OSF DCE compliant and can handle up to 4GB of RAM.  Even  though some people see a July 4 release date (InfoWorld Nov 16/92), rumor  is that the final version will not be available before Oct 1993  (InfoWorld May 25/92; July 6/92; Vaporware 07/92; 08/92) or 4th quarter 1993  (PC Week 09/28/92). Windows upgrades will be $295, otherwise $495  (PC Week 04/15/92; 03/15/93). Other OSes PC-DOS 6.0: IBM's version of DOS 6.0.  It runs Windows much faster then DOS   6.0 due to faster file I/O and video handling (InfoWorld Feb 1, 93). DR DOS 6.0: same as DOS 5.0 with some extras {like built-in data compression}   and memory management enhancements. Still has 640K/1MB barrier.  A later   version {Novell DOS} of this may use a version of the Mac finder and Apple   file management system (PC Week 12/14/92; InfoWorld Dec 14/92). OS/2 2.0: Unix like features and unix like requirements; 8-16MB RAM,  60MB {uses 17-33MB} hard drive, and 386dx CPU. This 32-bit multithreaded,   multitasking OS can address up to 4GB of RAM but has to use a fast swap file   to use more than 16 MB RAM on ISA systems using DMA {Direct Memory Access}.   IBM plans to use Taligent's OOPS in future versions of this   (InfoWorld Oct 26/92). AIX:  IBM's UNIX system, planned to be a subset of PowerOpen and Taligent OS. NeXTStep: GUI UNIX to provide NeXT features on IBM machines.  Beta out, final   version to be out by May 25, 1993. Solaris OS for x86: a SunSoft port.  A 32-bit OS with symmetric   multiprocessing and multithreading, built-in networking capabilities with   tools to allow remote configuring and adminstration features, and   communication package.  Client: $795,  50 users server: $1,995, 1000s users  server: $5,995.  Developer kits-software: $495, hardware: $195. Mac 7.1 [working name: Star Trek]:  Apple had System 7.0 running off Intel   Chips and is looking at making a 7.1 version available for IBM   (ComputerWorld Nov 2/92; MacWeek 03/22/93). At present this is planned to run   on top of Novell's DR DOS, require a 486 or equivalent to run and that apps   will need to be recompiled (MacWeek 03/22/93).  Viewed as Novell's answer to   Windows NT.  The complexity of PC hardware set ups is one reason for slow   progress {This seems to Apple/IBM's way of leading to the PowerPC line out in   late 1993/early 1994 and Pink OS in late 1994-early 1995.}  PowerPC Rumor-IBM will build its PowerPC 601 by late 1993 (InfoWorld June 8 & 15, 92;  MacWeek 7/13/92; PC Week 3/15/93).  It will have MicroChannel bus and XGA  video (Carl B Jabido), and will run native version AIX and Mac apps (PC Week  3/15/93); there have been no comments on compatablity of DOS or Windows apps. Apple's PowerPC 601 machine {Tesseract} is planned to be out Jan 24, 1994 and  to have MC98601/50 MHz, 4/8MB RAM, a 2.8-Mbyte floppy drive and expected to  sale near LC line prices {~$2000, down from projections of ~$3000 (MacUser  9/92:146)} (MacWeek 3/22/93). PowerOpen [A/UX 4.0]: A 32-bit preemtive multitasking OS planned to run on  PowerPCs and 68030/40 Macs (MacWeek 7/13/92).  Intel compatibility uncertain  (See Mac 7.1 above).  Planned base requirements:  68030, 8MB RAM, 80MB hard  drive (MacWeek 4/19/93). Rumor-ahead of schedule; COULD be out by mid 1993.  Rumor-this could be the OS for IBM's PowerPC 601 which is due by late 1993. Pink [Taligent OS]: Expecting delivery in 1994 (Wall Street Journal 1/12/92)   and may have some parts shipping in OS/2 and AIX in 1993 and Mac OS and   PowerOpen with the PowerPCs (MacWeek 01/25/93). Windows NT: Possible port (MacWeek 04/05/93).  See IBM OS section for details. Solaris OS: Version of this Sun Microsystems Inc UNIX OS to run on the  Power PCs in 1994 (MacWeek 04/05/93).  One of the few OSes to directly state   that it will run Windows/DOS programs.  IBM OS section for details NeXTStep: possible port see IBM OS section for details.  OS Number Crunching (Mel Park) Mac  Arithmetic is done in a consistent numerical environment {SANE or Standard  Apple Numerics Environment}. Floating point numbers are 96 bits long when an  FPU is present and 80 bits otherwise. Exceptions, such as dividing by zero or  taking the square root of a negative number, do not cause an abort but are  handled in a logically consistent manner. 1/0 produces the internal  representation for infinity (INF).  1/(1/0) produces zero. The above treatment  of 1/(1/0) occurs in an FPU-equipped machine even when SANE is bypassed and  the FPU programmed directly.  IBM  Floating point numbers are 80-bits with a hardware FPU, 64-bits when  emulated.  The way they are handled is dependent on the coding of whatever  compiler or assembler was used for a program. On older DOS complilers  exceptions could cause program aborts; 1/0 and 1/(1/0) would abort to the DOS  prompt at the point where they occured.  Most present compilers handle this  better.  Result: there is little consistent handling of numbers between DOS,  Windows and OS/2 programs nor between programs for just one OS.  Networking [Includes printing] WYSIWYG printing can be a problem with either Mac of IBM machines especially  if one sends TrueType fonts to a older style PostScript printer. Mac Hardware: Built-in LocalTalk network port and a built-in printer port.   LocalTalk has moderate speeds (230.4 Kb/s) requires special connectors for  each machine ($15 and up) and can be run off of either the printer port {to  include very old macs} or the network port {standard today}.  Built-in  Ethernet is becoming common but many older Macs require a PDS or Nubus card at  about $150-$300 for each machine.  These cards provide three connectors and  transceivers {thick, thin, and 10BaseT} for Ethernet. The Macintosh Quadra family and some Centris models includes Ethernet  interface on motherboard, with transceivers available. TokenRing has been a  network option since 1989. Software: AppleTalk {the suite of protocols} standard with Mac OS, which can  use variety of media types.  AppleShare client software included with the OS  as well and can connect to file servers such as Novell Netware, 3Com 3+Open,  Banyan Vines, DEC Pathworks, Apple's AppleShare servers, System 7 File Sharing  machines, and AFP servers running on variety of UNIX hosts.  MacTCP allows  typical TCP/IP communications (telnet, ftp, NFS, rlogin).  A later version  will have Unix X/Open Transport Interface (XTI) built-in by the end of 1993  (MacWeek 04/12/93).  Third-party software to connect to NFS servers.  DEC  Pathworks provides DECnet support.  Peer-to-peer file sharing software  built-in to System 7.1 (See OS section).  Full server software is extra.  Printing requires connection of the printer and the printer being selected in  the chooser.  Changing printers is by selecting a different name in the  chooser.  The same is true of connecting to servers. Printing bugs:  Monaco TrueType font is different then the screen bitmap font.  {QuickDraw QX is suppossed to fix this and similar problems.}  IBM   Hardware: LocalTalk [not widely used], Ethernet,  and TokenRing. Software: Novell Netware, Banyan Vines, DECNet, Windows/Work Groups, AppleTalk  protocols, and AppleShare {subset of AppleTalk}. Each of the MS-DOS networking schemes are, in general, totally incompatible  with the others. Once you have chosen one, you are pretty much locked-in to  that product line from then on.  Windows/Work Groups is a little more  forgiving and removes some of this problem.  Novell Netware is the biggest,  {~80 percent of the corporate market.} and in general is more powerful and  offers better control/management/security than AppleShare, but it's also more  complex to set up and manage.  This will change due to the use of the Mac  finder and file management system by Novell. (PC Week 12/14/92 & 12/28/92;   InfoWorld Dec 14/92; MacWeek 3/22/93) Printing {Very OS dependent} DOS: If it's a single user, then you plug the printer into the parallel port,   and don't worry about it {Tweeking may be needed with poorly written   software}.  Network Printing is not controlled by the system, but is mostly   implemented by the actual program, therefore performance varies from one   software program to the next. Windows 3.x: supports standard drivers and can do a good job of showing \\\"jobs\\\"   in the print queue, but it always lists printers as \\\"active\\\"... even if they   are not.  This becomes a problem if there are several incompatible printers   on the same net, because there's no way for software to reliably determine   which printer is active right now.  Windows for Workgroups is more Mac-like   and intelligent about this. OS/2: Mac-like; the os deals with printers, with apps making calls to the OS. Printing bugs: due to poor programing some programs for all the above OSes do  not have WYSIWYG printing.  This is the fault of the programs in question and  not that of the OS involved.  Price issue: This is very dynamic with Mac providing more build-in features  than IBM and IBM being more 'get only what you need' then Mac and price wars  by both worlds. The IBM machines' modualar nature prevents any kind of true hardware  standarization, which in turn requires OSes and programs to be very complex to  handle ALL the variation in hardware.  When one adds all the standard Mac  hardware features to an IBM {built-in input/output sound support, SCSI, PDS,   built-in monitor support, built-in networking, standard mouse interface, and  NuBus 90 in higher machines} the Mac tends to be cheaper then an equivalent  equipted IBM machine {Especially since some IBM monitors can be used with Macs  which cuts some more of the Mac's cost (MacUser Aug 1992:158-176)}.  Some prices using some of the info in this sheet and MacUser April 1993. All Macs below come with a PDS slot, VRAM, and SCSI-1 built in.  Except where  noted, monitor is extra and a built-in monitor interface is provided {no card  needed except for 24-bit color display}. IBM planned a $1,200 386SLC/25MHz model with a 60MB hard drive and color VGA  monitor {~VRAM} (MacWeek 8/17/92) {sounds like a Color Classic without SCSI-1,  sound support, built-in network support, FPU socket, built-in expansion to  16-bit color, etc}. Color Classic:  $1,389 - 030/16MHz with 16-bit data bus {~386sx/20MHz  equivalent}, 4/80, FPU socket, and built-in monitor. LCIII: $1,499 - 030/25MHz {~386dx/33MHz equivalent}, and 4/160. Centris 610: $2,899 - 68LC040/20MHz {Depending on the program ~486sx/40 or  ~'486dx2sx'/20[40]MHz equivalent}, 8/230, built-in ethernet, 300i CD-ROM, a  PDS/NuBus 90 slot and VRAM for 16-bit color. Centris 650: 040/25MHz {Depending on the program ~486dx/50 MHz or 486dx2/50  MHz equivalent} with a PDS and 3 NuBus 90 slots. $3,189 {ethernet, 8/80};  $3,559 {ethernet, 8/230}; $3,999 {ethernet, 8/230, CD-ROM, VRAM for 16-bit  color}  Bibliography notes 'Vaporware' is available in the digest/vapor directory by FTP on sumex- aim.stanford.edu [36.44.0.6] and was by Murphy Sewall {last issue: April 93.} 'Info-IBMPC Digest' back issues are available from wsmr-simtel20.army.mil in  directory PD2:<ARCHIVES.IBMPC> 'Dictionary of Computer Terms 3rd ed.'

Wouldn't it just make more sense to find some way to cut down on the cost of malpractice insurance?  And maybe that's not such a good thing.

Oh no. Don't let the AMA know about this. They have enough power as it is. Ask most Americans whether they'd like the doctors' lobby to get more powerful.   Well, yeah, tell us about the National Defense Medical Centre outside Ottawa. Theoretically it's limited to service personnel, but some studies I've heard about have suggested that about half the patients there are civilians who not only have connections but aren't \\\"urgent\\\" at all.  The problem is, in a system where hospitals' annual budgets are approved by the government, how do you keep political considerations out of medical decisions? I bet that if you're an MP or MPP, or good friends with one, you're put on any hospital's \\\"urgent\\\" care list no matter how minor your problem. Which is OK  unless you're someone who gets bumped off the list for some bigshot.   Hmm. How much difference would it make in the figure of percentage of GNP spent on health care if dentistry and optometry were included in the accounting?  Maybe Canada spends proportionately just as much on health care as we do.   So what happens if the health care systems financially collapse.

He didn't say so, but I knew he meant the OHIP. What would happen if his warning turned out to be the  truth? Would the private insurers take up the slack? They'd be under no  obligation to. Of course, they could eventually make money again, but if what you say is true, they'd be loathe to do so (and out of practice in handling  such basic services, too).   Would that it were free.

In some environments (entry level R3000 Indigo w/ 4.0.5) all windows are getting properly connected to their designated color maps, but on others (an IRIS 4D 240/GTX; also a different entry level Indigo) the color mapping is unreliable and changes behavior when I compile at different times.  The most common problem is that all non-top-level windows fail to be displayed according to their colormap.  My application starts out by creating three top-level windows; in some cases all but the first of these also fail to be displayed by their colormap.  This is spectacularly aggravating.  I would dearly appreciate   1. an explanation of the standard, RIGHT, CORRECT way to give a window   a colormap such that the Window Manager will Honor and Obey it;    2. any advice about problems that could cause my failure to get my   desired colormaps.  By now I have exhausted my own attempts on this, having tried everything reasonable or imaginable.  Below is example code giving the schematic for how I have been *TRYING* to do this.

A not-overly critical but still useful overview of 32 alternative health therapies.]    ...the Russian engineer Semyon Kirlian and his wife Valentina during the   1950s.  Using alternating currents of high frequency to 'illuminate'   their subjects, they photographed them.  They found that if an object   was a good conductor (such as a metal) the picture showed only its   surface, while the pictures of poor conductors showed the inner   structure of the object even if it were optically opaque.  They found   too that these high frequency pictures could distinguish between dead   and living objects.  Dead ones had a constant outline whilst living ones   were subject to changes.  The object's life activity was also visible in   highly variable colour patterns.    High frequency photography has now been practised for twenty years in   the Soviet Union but only a few people in the West have taken it up   seriously.  Professor Douglas Dean in New York and Professor Philips at   Washington University in St Louis have produced Kirlian photographs and   others have been produced in Brazil, Austria and Germany.    Using Kirlian photography it is possible to show an aura around people's   fingers, notably around those of healers who are concentrating on   healing someone.  Normally, blue and white rays emanate from the fingers   but, when a subject becomes angry or excited, the aura turns red and   spotty.  The Soviets are now using Kirlian photography to diagnose   diseases which cannot be diagnosed by any other method.  They argue that   in most illnesses there is a preclinical stage during which the person   isn't actually ill but is about to be.  They claim to be able to   foretell a disease by photographing its preclinical phase.    But the most exciting phenomenon illustrated by Kirlian photography is   the phantom effect.  During high frequency photography of a leaf from   which a part had been cut, the photograph gave a complete picture of the   leaf with the removed part showing up faintly.  This is extremely   important because it backs up the experiences of psychics who can 'see'   the legs of amputees as if they were still there.  The important thing   about the Kirlian phantoms though is that the electromagnetic pattern   can't possibly represent a secondary phenomenon -- or the field would   vanish when the piece of leaf or leg vanished.  The energy grid   contained in a living object must therefore be far more significant than   the actual object itself.    [...]    Kirlian photography has shown how water mentally 'charged' by a healer   has a much richer energy field around it than ordinary water...   From the incredulous side: [MacRobert, Alan, \\\"Reality shopping; a consumer's guide to new age hokum.\\\", _Whole Earth Review_, Autumn 1986, vNON4 p4(11).  An excellent article providing common-sense guidelines for evaluating paranormal claims, and some of the author's favorite examples of hokum.]    The crank usually works in isolation from everyone else in his field of   study, making grand discoveries in his basement.  Many paranormal   movements can be traced back to such people -- Kirlian photography, for   instance.  If you pump high-voltage electricity into anything it will   emit glowing sparks, common knowledge to electrical workers and   hobbyists for a century.  It took a lone basement crank to declare that   the sparks represent some sort of spiritual aura.  In fact, Kirlian   photography was subjected to rigorous testing by physicists John O.   Pehek, Harry J. Kyler, and David L. Faust, who reported their findings   in the October 15, 1976, issue of Science.  Their conclusion: The   variations observed in Kirlian photographs are due solely to moisture on   the surface of the body and not to mysterious \\\"auras\\\" or even   necessarily to changes in mood or mental state.  Nevertheless,   television shows, magazines, and books (many by famous   parapsychologists) continue to promote Kirlian photography as proof of   the unknown. \",\": >After agreeing to terms I signed the contract and drove home in my new : >car.

While I don't know the full scope of the activities of the EFF,  from what little I've seen I think it would be better to lobby for  strong cryptography through a distinct organization.  The EFF has been associated with efforts to prevent the banning of sex and pictures newsgroups at various universities. Horror stories about the contents of those groups (e.g. exploitative pictures of possibly underaged models) have already surfaced in the press. The White House bulletin already raised the specter of drug-dealing and terrorism, which is only one step removed from the old \\\"crypto-wielding child molester\\\" argument.  An EFF lobbying effort for cryptography would be too easily derailed by the connection to child pornography and the like.  Similarly, LPF is connected with Stallman and his Gnu project.  In light of, say, the Gnu Manifesto, this means that in a public debate it stands to be labelled as \\\"communist\\\", \\\"anarchist hackers\\\", radical, etc.    I don't know about CPSR, but if it is an offshoot of Physicians for Social Responsibility (best known for Helen Caldicott and her hysterical antinuclear lobbying) then it probably also carries unwelcome political baggage.  Perhaps for practical reasons a lobbying organization for cryptography would best be formed under the umbrella of EFF or some other existing group, but its charter should then be distinct, independent, and limited to advocacy for the right to cryptography.  To reiterate Dan Bernstein's question: does any suitable organization exist?  If not, what are you going to do about it?  Having mentioned the possible dangers of unwelcome political associations, I would be remiss not to suggest something in the opposite direction: gathering the support of the NRA by emphasizing the RKBA side of the issue as well as the First-Amendment side.  \",\"I tried to e-mail you but it bounced so...

We don't tell people anymore, that there's such a thing as sin or that there's such a place as hell.    As Jayne has said, this doesn't mean we have to come on so strong so as to hit people over the head with a baseball bat.  Yet the fact remains, there is a place called hell.  A place so fearful that God died to save us from having to experience it.  Whatever you or I, as Christians, do, we should do whatever we can to win people to the Lord, if for no other reason, to keep them from going to \\\"outer darkness.\\\".    Jesus, in Mt. 25, tells us that He didn't prepare hell for people.  He prepared it for the Devil and his angels.  No where in the Bible do I read -anywhere, that God predestined anybody to go to hell.  D.L. Moody use to say that the elect are the \\\"whosoever will\\\" and the nonelect are the \\\"whosoever wont's.\\\"  Whether or not that's theologically sound, I couldn't defend, but its practical.  Jesus said to the people of Israel, \\\"Ye would not.\\\"    Now, some of you may not be students of the Bible, heck -some of you may not be Christians.  Have you ever said to somebody, \\\"I don't believe in hell.  I believe in the religion of Jesus.\\\"  But did you know that Jesus talked more about hell than He did about heaven!  \\\"Oh I believe in the religion of the sermon on the mount.\\\"  You find hell taught by Jesus in the sermon on the mount.  You'll read that Jesus talked about the tree being cast into the fire.  Several times he talks about hell and about judgment.  In fact, over and over in the synoptics, Matthew, Mark and Luke, Jesus talks about hell.  Not Isaiah.  Not Moses.  Not John the Baptist, though he did, but Jesus, the Son of God.  The great Beloved One preached about hell because He loved people and didn't want to see them go there.  Now, if there is no hell then Jesus preached in vain.  It was our Lord Jesus, not some angry Baptist preacher, that said, \\\"where the worm never dies, and where the fire never goes out.\\\"  Jesus said that.  It was Jesus who called hell a \\\"furnace of fire.\\\"  It was Jesus that used the word, \\\"condemnation.\\\"  \\\"And this is the condemnation, that men love darkness rather than light because their deeds are evil.  Jesus said that.    How can we get it across to you that a loving, dying Jesus preached about hell?  Not only that, but He went through hell.  That's what Calgary was all about.  When my Lord was on the cross, darkness fell.  He called hell, \\\"outer darkness.\\\"    Do you have this idea that hell is a place where the gamblers are gambling over here, the drunks are getting drunk over there, and the prostitutes are prostituting their bodies over there?  That's not what hell is.  Hell's not a party.  There's no fellowship there.  He called it \\\"outer darkness.\\\"  \\\"Outer\\\" -away from God.  \\\"Darkness\\\" -God is light.    No when He was on the cross, He was made sin for you and for me.  God treated Jesus the way sinners have to be treated.  That's is a sobering thought.  As my son would say, an \\\"awesome\\\" thought.    \\\"My God, My God why hast Thou forsaken me?\\\"  Hell is isolation.  There's no fellowship in hell.  There's no friendship in hell.  There's no loving embrace in hell.  There's no hand shake in hell.  There's no word of encouragement in hell.    \\\"I thirst.\\\"  It goes much deeper than physical thirst.  Hell is eternal craving with no satisfaction.  The man whose life was lived for drugs, will crave it eternally.  The man whose life was lived for the lust of a woman's body, will crave it eternally -and not be satisfied.  One theologian has put it this way and I think it deserves merit.  What is hell?  Hell is just the kind of environment that matches the internal condition of the lost.    In a recent post, I was trying to remember the founder of The Word of Life ministries.  I've remembered his name, Jack Wertzen, and found that the illustration that I gave wasn't his.  His illustration was that he was talking to his barber and his barber's wife and daughter had just recently been saved and he was commenting about it to Jack.  \\\"They sing these songs and read Bible verses, and their praising this and that -I can't stand it!  Jack, do you think God would send me to hell?\\\"  Jack answered by saying, \\\"Yes I think he would!\\\"  Of course the barber said, \\\"What do you mean by that.\\\"  \\\"Well if you can't stand living at home with your wife and daughter who sing hymns and praises to God now, what would you do in heaven where they'll do it for eternity?  You'd be miserable.  Because God loves you, He'd put you where it would match what you really are.\\\"   It makes a man think.  The crucifixion of Jesus Christ is a fact that necessitates the eternal existence of hell because on the cross He performed an eternal act.  Don't ask me how, I don't know.  But He is God and He is the infinite/eternal and when He died, He died an infinite/eternal death.  It is by that eternal act that He purchased eternal life for the \\\"whosoever wills.\\\"  He suffered eternal judgment.    A lot of people would like to detour around hell by saying \\\"Everybody is going to be saved eventually.\\\"  -universalism.  My Bible says no, He'll separate them.  The sheep from the goats.  \\\".After you die there's a probationary period in which God prepares you for heaven.\\\"  No, my Bible says that \\\"It is appointed unto men once to die and then comes judgment.\\\"  Some of the cultist believe in annihilation.  After you die, sssswish.  Just like a mosquito you're squished out.  No, in Rev we are told that their is eternal existence in hell just as there is in heaven.    I don't enjoy making these kind of statements and maybe you don't enjoy listening to them, but we have to preach the entire Word of God.  -There is a place called hell.  If I could give one verse of Scripture that could give any hope that people aren't going there, I'd give it to you, but I haven't found it.  That fact that there is a place called hell, the fact that our God is a God of holiness and must judge sin, the fact that He has made us the kind of creatures we are and therefore we're responsible, the fact that He has placed us in a \\\"uni\\\"verse that has purpose and design behind it, the fact that sin is such an awful thing and the fact that God Himself went through hell to save us from hell leads us to two applications.  1)  As I've already mentioned.  If you are a Christian, you must worn others.  Its not good enough to stop and fix their flat tire and not tell them that just around the bend the bridge is out.  \\\"Knowing therefore the terror of Lord, we persuade men.\\\"  2)  If you haven't accepted Jesus are your Savior, you're taking an awful chance.  As I say to the Jehovah Witnesses (who no longer frequent my door), if you are right and I am wrong, then I will have lived a good life and will die and cease to exist, but if I am right and you are wrong, then you will die and suffer eternal damnation.  I don't mean to make fun at this point, but its like Dirty Harry said, \\\"You've got to ask yourself, 'Do I feel lucky?'  Well do you?\\\"  \\\"A man's got to know his limitations.\\\"  Don't be one of the \\\"whosoever wont's.\\\"  \",\" Would if only it were true ...

Blammo.) \",\" [...stuff deleted...]  Andy-- I think we do agree, given your clarification of how we were  each using the terms fact and theory.  I'll only add that I think perhaps I feel more strongly about separating them, though your usage is quite valid.   I'll add here that any falsification or rejection does not in any way reduce its current usefulness.  So long as it accurately predicts or  describes things we can observe.  Not to be a pain in the ass, but is there any reason you don't just say _the theory of evolution_ rather than the _fact of evolution is still a theory_.  I'm asking because this whole thread got started because I was bothered by a post that referred to _the fact of evolution_, basically leaving off the phrase _is still a theory_.  Without a  clarification, like the one you just gave, just saying _the fact of evolution_ has a very different meaning to me.  I'm not sure I agree here.  Again, it may be because I feel stronger about separating terms.  I was trying to say that the _theories_ proposed to explain the _mechanisms_ and the _mechanisms_ themselves are the only realities here.  It is the existence of mechanisms, not  the things themselves, that are so predictive as to be considered  fact (as you would say).  There aren't really little planetary particle  systems called atoms out there.  Or I should say, and more to my original  point, it would be a leap of faith to say there are, because we observe only  the mechanisms.  There is no need to _believe_ there are _actually_ atoms out there as we have decided to think about them.  It's enough to discuss the mechanisms.  At any rate, I'm not sure I am being  any clearer than before, but I thought it was worth a shot.  The bottom line, though, is I think we agree on two fundamental ideas:     1. --evolution is a theory supported by observational evidence (my way)       --the fact of evolution is a theory supported by observational         evidence (your way)     2. --creation is just an opinion.  If a theist wants to call it         a theory then he can.  I won't:  it has no supporting evidence   and it neither predicts nor supports any observations that can         be made.  With no mechanisms to talk about, there really isn't  much to say.  Do you agree? \",\"As the subjects says, Windows 3.1 keeps crashing (givinh me GPF) on me of   late.  It was never a very stable package, but now it seems to crash every   day.  The worst part about it is that it does not crash consistently: ie I   can't reproduce crashes, and they are not always GPF's in the same   application. Sometimes I can recover by simply closing the application   that caused an error, but other times, windows acts very strange, and I   need to re-boot.  Some background:  I have a Leading Edge 486sx25 with Phoenix BIOS.  When I   first got it it had 4Mg of memory.  It ran windows fine (not too many   GPF's).  Then, a couple of weekends ago, I installed Lotus 123 for windows   (with ATM), a game card and an additional 4  1Mg SIMMS.  The Leading edge   machine is kind of strange, in that it has the IDE controler built into   the motherboard, the CPU is actually on a sparate board that plugs into   the motherboard and the SIMMS it uses are Macintosh SIMMS! Apparently I   was told that the Leading Edge had the parity bit built into the mother   board.  The original 4Mg 80ns SIMMS where of the 2 chip variety from   SAMSUNG, and the ones I installed are 8 chip SIMMS. They are recognized   fine by the BIOS RAM check. The game card is a generic $20 gamecard.  The reason why I mention the hardware like this is that sometimes   rebooting the machine using the reset button or ctl-alt-del still leaves   the machine kind of flaky, but turning it on and off doesn't.   I haven't tried taking out the RAM or the game card, because as I said   these GPF are not reproducible at will.  I have gone through and entire   day using the computer with no problems and then I might get 5 or so GPF's   in the sppace of 20 minutes?  What can I do.  This situation is most annoying... Are there any good   diagnostic tools for hardware? Do you think that this might be a software   problem (ie EMM386 etc.)? If it helps, i have manage to get GPF's on After   Dark, quicken, Paint shop pro. A lot of them have been in user.exe or   gdi.exe.

WSM is a compilation of submissions from shareware/freeware authors in a single Windows .HLP (Help System) file.  All types of software may be submitted for entry in WSM - utilities, applications, games, programming tools, etc.  WSM benefits Windows shareware/freeware authors by allowing them to publicize their software releases, inform users of updated versions, and to increase their installed base of users.  Those searching for specific Windows software will benefit by having a complete list of available software available at their fingertips - complete with feature lists, current prices, and any other relevant information.  Windows software authors may submit entries to Windows Shareware Monthly in the following manner:  1. Compose a short summary of the function of the software.  Include all    special features which are unique to your product and which set it apart    from other programs in the genre.  Be sure to include specific details    such as: the current release version, where the software is available,    how much the registration fee costs, how much disk space is required, any    special requirements (e.g. sound card, or VBRUN200.DLL, etc.), how the    author may be contacted, etc.  Because text is highly compressible, the    summary may be as long as is necessary, however, it is best to keep it    short.  A good guideline is a single screenful of 12-point text at 640x480    resolution.  Order forms and other such addendum may be included if desired.    All submissions whould be in plain text (ASCII) format.  Formatting will    be exactly as it is submitted - I will simply cut and paste text files    into a Help Authoring system.  If you require special formatting     conventions - such as boldface text or italics, or a larger font size,    indicate so CLEARLY within the text file.  For best results, use Windows    NotePad to create the .TXT file.    2. Include up to 100k of Windows-format .BMP (bitmap) screen-shots which    display the workings or special features of each program.  Special cases    (rendering applications for example) which require 256-color bitmaps may    submit up to 250k of .BMP files - all other should observe the 100k limit    and use 16-color format.  For maximum compatiblity with the software which    will be used to create the WSM .HLP file (Stefan Olson's Help Writer's    Assistant for Windows), please save the bitmaps with Windows Paintbrush or    WinGIF.   3. Include a 16-color .BMP of the program's icon (.ICO file).  Many programs    are available to convert .ICO to .BMP format, or Windows Paintbrush may be    used.  The .BMP will be embedded in the summary text.  4. Double-check for spelling errors, formatting corrections, etc.    5. Compress the .TXT file, the .BMP of the program icon, and any additional    .BMPs into a single file using PKZIP (any version).  6. Submit the entry by UUENCODING the .ZIPfile, and e-mailing it to:        DAA7365@TAMUTS.TAMU.EDU     if submitting via the Internet or Compuserve. If submitting via America    Online, send a brief message indicating submission, and append the .ZIP    file, then e-mail to:     DiegoAA  7. If any changes are required, or a new version is released, complete    the above procedures again.  Send all submissions to the @TAMUTS address,    and any comments, suggestions, criticisms, to DAA7365@RIGEL.TAMU.EDU.  All entries received before the deadline will be included in the subsequent edition of WSM.  The editor will not be held responsible for any errors, and we reserve the right to make changes to the entries.  WSM is not limited to shareware/freeware software.  A special area will be devoted to commercially available Windows 3.x and NT software.  Commercial software authors should follow the same steps above, with the exception of the limitations on size - the .TXT file and .BMPs may be as large as required (and as large as is practical for transmission over phone lines).  There is no charge for the publishing of either shareware/freeware or commercial product entries.    Advertisements for computer hardware, software, bulletin boards, etc. may be submitted as well. Again, the same procedures apply, with the exception of the size limitations.  There is no charge for advertising space.  The first ten advertisements submitted each month will be included; subsequent submissions will not be included due to size constraints.  WSM is currently looking for persons willing to devote the time to author columns within WSM.  A C/C++ programing section, a Visual Basic section, and two Windows-specific opinion/advice columns are envisioned.  All work will be on a voluntary basis.  If you wish to aid WSM and author a monthly column on one of the above topics, please send us mail at DAA7365@TAMUTS.TAMU.EDU or DiegoAA on America Online.\",\" You are nto alone.

Simpler shading models are implemented already, f.i. in x3d (ask archie where to get the latest version). For Gouroud, a fast implementation will be possible utilizing some extension only, either MIT-SHM to do the shade in an image and fast update the window with it, or PEX/OpenGL which should be able to shade themselves. The portable 'vanilla X' way would be to shade in a normal XImage and use XPutImage(), what would be good enough to do static things as f.i. fractal landscapes or such stuff.

It's more likely that the Moon will never be the site of major commercial activity. As far as we know it has no materials we can't get cheaper right here on Earth or from asteroids and comets, aside from the semi-mythic He3 that *might* be useful in low grade fusion reactors. Exploring it would satisfy a curiosity itch,  and it's position in the gravity well of Earth coupled with it's heat  sink capacity could offer some military utility for \\\"high ground\\\" military weapons systems, but it holds very minute commercial value. If space  travel becomes cheap enough, it might become a tourist attraction as  Mt. Everest and the Antarctic have become, but that's a very minor  activity in the global scope of things.  Luna has an inconvienent gravity field. It's likely too low to prevent calcium loss, muscle atrophy, and long term genetic drift. Yet it's too high to do micro-G manufacturing. Space based colonies and factories that can be spun to any convienent value of G look much better. Luna has a modest vacuum and raw solar exposure two weeks a month, but orbital sites can have better vacuums and continous solar exposure. Luna offers a source of light element rocks that can serve as raw materials, heatsink, and shielding. The asteroids and comets offer sources of both light and heavy elements, and volatile compounds, and many are in less steep gravity wells so that less delta-v is required to reach them.  We don't use 2/3rds of the Earth now, the seafloors, and we virtually ignore Antarctica, a whole continent. That's because we don't have to deal with those conditions in order to make a buck. Luna is a much more expensive place to visit, or to live and work. I think we'll use the easier places first. That pushes Lunar development back at least a few centuries, if not much longer.  Luna's main short term value would be as a place for a farside radio astronomy observatory, shielded from the noisy Earth. Or as the site of a laser, particle beam, or linear accelerator weapons system for defending Earth, or bombarding it as the case may be. The first is unlikely because of the high cost for such a basic science instrument. The second is just as unlikely because conventional nukes are good enough, and the military would really rather see the Earth safe for conventional warfare again. There's little glory in watching from a bunker as machines fight each other over continental ranges. Little ultimate profit either.

Were the two tapes that it unwound of the same type from the same batch?  The reason I ask is that I bought some generic tapes that did this and found that the tape markers were not fully punched out and had closed the little marker hole.  It was only on a few tapes of a set.  Did you open up the tape cartridge and put the tape back on the reels?  If you have not yet, open it up by removing the two screws on the bottom of the tape cartridge and snap the plastic shell away from the metal base.   As you are pulling the tape through the assembly try not to touch any more  than you have to.  As you are doing it, look for a couple of little holes in  the tape.  These are the marker holes which let the tape drive know when it is  at the end of the tape.  The holes are spaced a couple of inches apart.  My best guess is that the drive finds the first marker and then stops on the second marker?    Anyhow, If the tape has the holes, then check to see if the mirror on the tape is clean.  The function of the mirror is to detect the marker holes.  The tape drive shines a light at the mirror and has a pickup in the area where the reflection would come out.  When the hole goes by, the pickup detects the  light that was allowed to pass and it knows when to stop.  If the mirror is dirty or out of alighment (unlikely since it is made into the case) you might have a problem detecting the end of the tape.  If the tape drive does it on all tapes and the tapes all look good, then either the pickup or the LED of the sensor system has failed or is dirty.  If you open the drive door you will see the sensor assembly to the left of the R/W head assembly.  If it looks clean and nothing is in its way, then the drive may need to be serviced.  It is possible that the LED is burned out or the sensor is out.   If it is still in warranty, you might be able to send it back to CMS for repair.   --- Scott Hiles whiles@relay.nswc.navy.mil\",\"From the Santa Rosa (Cal.) Press-Democrat, April 15, 1993, p. B2:      Male sex survey: Gay activity low      A new natonal study on male sexual behavior, the most thorough     examination of American men's sexual practices published since     the Kinsey report more than four decades ago, shows about 2     percent of the men surveyed had engaged in homosexual sex and     1 percent considered themselves exclusively homosexual.      The figures on homosexuality in the study released Wednesday     by the Alan Guttmacher Institute are significantly lower than     the 10 percent figure that has been part of the conventional     wisdom since it was published in the Kinsey report.  The article also contains numbers on the number of sexual partners. The median number of sexual partners for all men 20-39 was 7.3. Compared to the table I have already posted from Masters, Johnson, and Kolodny showing male homosexual partners, it is apparent that homosexual men are dramatically more promiscuous than the general male population.  It's a shame that we don't have a breakdown for straight men vs. gay/bi men -- that would show even more dramatically how much more promiscuous gay/bi men are.\",\"I am selling my Macintosh Classic and Stylewriter 1 to the highest bidder.

The parts are mostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest. We don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask. Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.  The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu  as /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography  FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers  every 21 days.   Contents:  * What is the National Security Agency (NSA)? * What are the US export regulations? * What is TEMPEST? * What are the Beale Ciphers, and are they a hoax? * What is the American Cryptogram Association, and how do I get in touch? * Is RSA patented? * What about the Voynich manuscript?   * What is the National Security Agency (NSA)?    The NSA is the official security body of the U.S. government. It   was given its charter by President Truman in the late 40's, and   has continued research in cryptology till the present. The NSA is   known to be the largest employer of mathematicians in the world,   and is also the largest purchaser of computer hardware in the   world. Governments in general have always been prime employers of   cryptologists. The NSA probably possesses cryptographic expertise many   years ahead of the public state of the art, and can undoubtedly break   many of the systems used in practice; but for reasons of national   security almost all information about the NSA is classified.    Bamford's book [BAMFD] gives a history of the people and operations of   the NSA. The following quote from Massey [MAS88] highlights the   difference between public and private research in cryptography:    ``... if one regards cryptology as the prerogative of government,   one accepts that most cryptologic research will be conducted   behind closed doors. Without doubt, the number of workers engaged   today in such secret research in cryptology far exceeds that of   those engaged in open research in cryptology. For only about 10   years has there in fact been widespread open research in   cryptology. There have been, and will continue to be, conflicts   between these two research communities. Open research is common   quest for knowledge that depends for its vitality on the open   exchange of ideas via conference presentations and publications in   scholarly journals. But can a government agency, charged with   responsibilities of breaking the ciphers of other nations,   countenance the publication of a cipher that it cannot break? Can   a researcher in good conscience publish such a cipher that might   undermine the effectiveness of his own government's code-breakers?   One might argue that publication of a provably-secure cipher would   force all governments to behave like Stimson's `gentlemen', but one   must be aware that open research in cryptography is fraught with   political and ethical considerations of a severity than in most   scientific fields. The wonder is not that some conflicts have   occurred between government agencies and open researchers in   cryptology, but rather that these conflicts (at least those of which   we are aware) have been so few and so mild.''  * What are the US export regulations?    In a nutshell, there are two government agencies which control   export of encryption software. One is the Bureau of Export   Administration (BXA) in the Department of Commerce, authorized by   the Export Administration Regulations (EAR). Another is the Office   of Defense Trade Controls (DTC) in the State Department, authorized   by the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). As a rule   of thumb, BXA (which works with COCOM) has less stringent   requirements, but DTC (which takes orders from NSA) wants to see   everything first and can refuse to transfer jurisdiction to BXA.    The newsgroup misc.legal.computing carries many interesting   discussions on the laws surrounding cryptographic export, what   people think about those laws, and many other complex issues which   go beyond the scope of technical groups like sci.crypt. Make sure to   consult your lawyer before doing anything which will get you thrown in   jail; if you are lucky, your lawyer might know a lawyer who has at   least heard of the ITAR.  * What is TEMPEST?    TEMPEST is a standard for electromagnetic shielding for computer   equipment. It was created in response to the discovery that   information can be read from computer radiation (e.g., from a CRT) at   quite a distance and with little effort.    Needless to say, encryption doesn't do much good if the cleartext   is available this way.  * What are the Beale Ciphers, and are they a hoax?    (Thanks to Jim Gillogly for this information and John King for   corrections.)    The story in a pamphlet by J. B. Ward (1885) goes: Thomas   Jefferson Beale and a party of adventurers accumulated a huge mass   of treasure and buried it in Bedford County, Virginia, leaving   three ciphers with an innkeeper; the ciphers describe the   location, contents, and intended beneficiaries of the treasure.   Ward gives a decryption of the second cipher (contents) called B2;   it was encrypted as a book cipher using the initial letters of the   Declaration of Independence (DOI) as key. B1 and B3 are unsolved;   many documents have been tried as the key to B1.    Aficionados can join a group that attempts to solve B1 by various   means with an eye toward splitting the treasure:    The Beale Cypher Association   P.O. Box 975   Beaver Falls, PA 15010    You can get the ciphers from the rec.puzzles FAQL by including the   line:    send index    in a message to netlib@peregrine.com and following the directions.   (There are apparently several different versions of the cipher   floating around. The correct version is based on the 1885 pamphlet,   says John King <kingj@hpcc01.corp.hp.com>.)    Some believe the story is a hoax. Kruh [KRU88] gives a long list of   problems with the story. Gillogly [GIL80] decrypted B1 with the DOI   and found some unexpected strings, including ABFDEFGHIIJKLMMNOHPP.   Hammer (president of the Beale Cypher Association) agrees that this   string couldn't appear by chance, but feels there must be an   explanation; Gwyn (sci.crypt expert) is unimpressed with this   string.  * What is the American Cryptogram Association, and how do I get in touch?    The ACA is an organization devoted to cryptography, with an emphasis   on cryptanalysis of systems that can be attacked either with   pencil-and-paper or computers. Its organ ``The Cryptogram'' includes   articles and challenge ciphers. Among the more than 50 cipher types in   English and other languages are simple substitution, Playfair,   Vigenere, bifid, Bazeries, grille, homophonic, and cryptarithm.    Dues are $15 for one year (6 issues); more outside of North America;   less for students under 18 and seniors. Subscriptions should be sent   to ACA Treasurer, 18789 West Hickory St., Mundelein, IL 60060.  * Is RSA patented?    Yes. The patent number is 4,405,829, filed 12/14/77, granted 9/20/83.   For further discussion of this patent, whether it should have been   granted, algorithm patents in general, and related legal and moral   issues, see comp.patents and misc.legal.computing. For information   about the League for Programming Freedom see [FTPPF]. Note that one of   the original purposes of comp.patents was to collect questions such as   ``should RSA be patented?'', which often flooded sci.crypt and other   technical newsgroups, into a more appropriate forum.  * What about the Voynich manuscript?    nelson@reed.edu (Nelson Minar) says there is a mailing list on the   subject.  the address to write to subscribe to the VMS mailing list   is: <voynich-request@rand.org>    the ftp archive is: rand.org:/pub/voynich\",\"jayson stark (i trhink that's him) fits perfectly in this category.  anyone who writes \\\"dean palmer has 2 homers  - at this pace, he'll  have 324 home runs!\\\" should be shot.  if, at the end of april, he has 11, and anyone writes \\\"at this  pace, he'll have 100+ homers!\\\" they shouldbe shot too.\",\"From:  Kayhan Havai # 1026 --------------------------                                                o Dr. Namaki,  deputy minister of health stated that infant   mortality (under one year old) in Iran went down from 120    per  thousand before the revolution to 33 per thousand at   the end of 1371 (last month).      o Dr Namaki also stated that before the revolution only   254f children received vaccinations to protect them   from various deseases but this figure reached 93at   the end of 1371.      o Dr. Malekzadeh, the minister of health mentioned that   the population growth rate in Iran at the end of 1371   went below 2.7     o During the visit of Mahathir Mohammad, the prime minister   of Malaysia, to Iran, agreements for cooperation in the   areas of industry, trade, education and tourism were   signed.

And one recalls that the Jews took up their abode in 'fanatic' Turkey  when they were expelled from Europe, especially Spain, by Saintly Christians,  and they have lived here for centuries in at least as much tranquility and  liberty as their fellow Turkish subjects, all being exposed alike to the  rapacity of their common rulers. To one brought up, as most Americans have   been, in the Gladstonian and foreign-missionary tradition, the condition of   the Jews in Turkey is almost a mathematical demonstration that religious  differences have had an influence in the tragedy of Turkey only as they  were combined with aspirations for a political separation which every   nation in the world would have treated as treasonable.

Shaw  (History),  who  recently completed  two books:  The Jews  of  the Ottoman  Empire and  the Turkish Republic, and Turkey and  the Holocaust: Turkey's Role in Rescuing  Turkish  and  European  Jewry  from  Nazi  Persecution, 1933-45. Shaw  chairs the undergraduate  interdepartmental degree program in Near Eastern Studies and has organized the Program for the Study of Ottoman and Turkish Jewry. He is affiliated with the G. E. von Grunebaum Center for Near Eastern Studies.  Editor: How did  you come to write these two  books on Turkey and European and Turkish Jews?  Shaw: Basically, I'm  an Ottoman historian, but  I'm also Jewish. I've  spent twenty-five  years studying  Ottoman history,  and as time went along, whenever I  found materials on the Ottoman Jews, I collected  them. But  I never  did anything  with them  until a couple of years  ago, when I suddenly realized that  1992 was the 500th  anniversary of  the  Jews being  expelled  from Spain  and coming  to Turkey.  Then the  Sephardic Temple  down on  Wilshire Avenue invited me  to give a series of three  lectures on Ottoman Jewry.  These lectures  were  greatly appreciated,  and I  became motivated to  undertake further research  to develop a  book, The Jews of the  Ottoman Empire and the Turkish)  Republic. This book is quite different from the  works of most Jewish historians, who tend to look  at the Jews in any country  more from the viewpoint of the Jews  and the Jewish community, and rely  mainly on Jewish sources.  I  view my  subject  as  an  Ottoman historian,  and  I approach the Jews of the Ottoman Empire largely from the point of view of Ottoman  society, using largely Ottoman  sources. After I finished  this book  and  sent it  to the  press,  I came  across additional documents  relating to  Turkish Jews during  World War II. In the completed book, I had said that Turkey had done a good deal  to rescue  the Jews  during  World War  II, but  I did  not actually have many details. Then I  found a batch of documents in the Foreign Ministry archive relating to actions taken by Turkish diplomats to  help the Jews  before and during the  Holocaust. It was too late to add this new information to the book in press, so I decided to  write a second book. I  conducted further research, mainly in the archives of the  Foreign Ministry in Ankara and the Turkish Embassy and Consulate in Paris. The result was the second book, Turkey and  the Holocaust, which details  how Turkey helped rescue Jews from the Nazis.  - How exactly did they do this?  The story takes  place over a number of years.  The book presents the material in three parts, first of which deals with the period before the Holocaust. When the Nazis  came to power in Germany in 1933,  they immediately  started  dismissing  Jews and  anti-Nazi Germans from universities,  hospitals, scientific institutes, and the like. Turkey at that moment was just beginning the process of reforming its  universities, and it  saw in these Jews,  who were being fired from their positions in Germany, a good source of new talent to  help modernize the Turkish  universities. Within three months  after the  Nazis  started dismissing  these Jews,  Turkey arranged to take many of them in. They were brought to Turkey and were   given   appointments   as  professors   in   the   Turkish universities, as  heads of scientific institutes,  and as medical personnel in hospitals. About 300  to 500 major Jewish professors came to  Turkey in  the 1930s. Ernst  Reuter, a  German political scientist,  spent the  war  years teaching  political science  in Turkey. After  World War II,  he was  mayor of Berlin  during the Berlin Airlift.  Fritz Neimark, a major  German Jewish economist, came to Turkey and helped  establish a modern school of economics in Istanbul.  A man named  Reichenbach, who was rescued  from the Nazis by  Turkey and  spent the war  years in  Turkey, eventually came to  UCLA, where he  became a professor of  philosophy. Other German Jewish  emigres engaged in cultural  activities in Turkey. One  such was  Karl  Ebert,  who had  been  a leading  theatrical producer in Berlin until he was expelled by the Nazis. He went to Turkey, where he  organized the Turkish National  Theater and the Turkish National Opera  Company in Ankara, with the  help of Paul Hindemuth. So  the first  section of the  book covers  this first phase, when Jews were being  persecuted in Germany and rescued by Turkey.  Oddly enough,  the  German emigres,  when  they were  in Turkey, did not seem to think too badly of Germany. They regarded themselves more  as Germans than Jews,  and they did not  join in the anti-Nazi activities of the local Turkish Jewish community. I even  found  letters  from  the Nazi  representatives  to  Turkey praising these German Jewish refugees for their work in promoting the idea  of German  culture. Even though  these people  had been persecuted by the Nazis and rescued by the Turks, they shared the Nazis' feelings of  Aryan racial superiority over  the Turks. The second part of the book deals  with the Holocaust, which began in 1940 when the Nazis occupied France.  In Europe at that time, and especially in France, there were  about 20,000 Turkish Jews. They had migrated to Europe for various reasons from about the turn of the century onward. Most of them had settled in Europe during the Turkish war for  independence after World War I,  when Greece was threatening to overrun Turkey. The Greeks had persecuted the Jews throughout the nineteenth century, and the Jews feared what might happen to them if the Greeks  took over in Turkey. Many Jews fled to France during  the 1920s and 1930s. Many  also abandoned their Turkish  citizenship and  became  French  citizens. Suddenly  the Nazis invaded France in 1940 and started introducing all sorts of anti-Jewish laws.  The Turkish  Jews soon found  that it  was not worth very much to  be a French Jew, but that it  was worth a lot to be a Turkish Jew.  - How so?  Turkey remained neutral through most of World War II. It retained its embassies  and consulates in all  the Nazi-occupied countries until it finally entered the war on the side of the Allies at the end of 1944. During the war,  therefore, Turkey was in a position to  defend its  citizens  against anti-Jewish  measures, and  the actions that  Turkish diplomats took  form the second  chapter of the  book. Turkish  diplomats  who were  stationed  in France  in particular intervened to protect Jews of Turkish citizenship from the Nazis. For those Turkish  Jews who had retained their Turkish citizenship,  there  was  generally  no  problem.  If  they  were arrested and sent to a  concentration camp, the Turkish diplomats would  communicate with  the  commanders of  the  camp and  other officials and say in effect:  \\\"These people are Turkish citizens. You  can't do  this  to  them.\\\" And  the  Turkish  Jews would  be released.  If  their  businesses were  confiscated,  the  Turkish diplomats would protest and the businesses would be restored.  The Nazis  in general  wanted to keep  the friendship  of Turkey. They hoped to be able to use  Turkey as a gateway for an invasion of the Middle  East, and they also wanted to  obtain chromium and manganese from Turkey. In order  to keep Turkish friendship, they usually accepted  these interventions on behalf  of Turkish Jews. The Turkish  diplomats sometimes went to  the concentration camps to secure the release of Turkish Jews. At times they even boarded trains hauling  Turkish Jews  to Auschwitz for  extermination and succeeded in getting them off the train. Most of the foreign Jews were sent  to a concentration  camp at  a place called  Drancy in Paris,  and that's  where  most of  the  intercession by  Turkish consuls took place.  The greater problem came with  the Turkish Jews who had abandoned their  Turkish citizenship  and had  become French  citizens. The consuls couldn't declare that  these people were Turkish citizens because  they were  not.  My book  includes  photographs of  Jews lining  up in  front  of  the Turkish  consulate,  either to  get passports to  return to Turkey or  to get a restoration  of their Turkish  citizenship.   This  was   a  bureaucratic   matter,  so processing the application would take  some time. In the meantime it was a  real emergency, because the Nazis would  arrest Jews on the streets for almost nothing.  The Nazis would even arrest them if they  had radios  or telephones  in their  apartments, because radios and  telephones were  forbidden to Jews.  To take  care of these  former  Turkish Jews,  the  Turkish  diplomats invented  a document called  gayri muntazem  vatandash, or  \\\"irregular fellow citizen.\\\" The  document said in  effect \\\"This person is  a former Turkish  citizen  who has  applied  for  the restoration  of  his Turkish citizenship.  In the meantime  we would appreciate  it if you  would treat  him  as  if he  were  a  Turkish citizen.\\\"  The diplomats wrote  the document in  Turkish and put their  seals on it. Since  the Nazis could  not read  Turkish, on the  whole they accepted  these papers  as certificates  of citizenship.  By this means, the  Turkish diplomats were  able to rescue many  Jews who had relinquished their Turkish citizenship.  Actually the Nazis were of two minds about the Turkish defense of Jews. On the one hand the  Nazi Foreign Ministry, which wanted to retain the friendship of Turkey,  was in favor of accepting these interventions. On the other hand, Himmler and Eichmann wanted all Jews exterminated.  At times  Himmler and  Eichmann were  able to prevail and some  of the Turkish Jews were sent  off to Auschwitz before the Turkish consuls could do anything.  - Do you have statistics on how many Turkish Jews were rescued?  There were about  20,000 Turkish Jews in Europe  before world War II,  about 10,000  of whom  were living  in France.  Most of  the information in this section of  the book relates to the situation in France. I have published  the letters that the Turkish consuls sent to  the Nazi  officials and  the letters  that came  back in reply. Generally the Nazis said  that if the Turkish consul would present  documents  certifying   that  arrested  individuals  are Turkish citizens,  and promise  to send them  out of  France, the Nazis would release them from the concentration camp. The Turkish consuls also organized  special trains to take  Turkish Jews from Nazi-occupied  territory   back  to  Turkey.  These   trains  ran regularly in 1943 and 1944. The Nazis gave the Turkish Jews visas so they  could pass out  of Nazi  territory, but the  trains were often  held  up by  the  Nazi-influenced  governments of  Eastern Europe  -   Croatia,  Serbia,   and  Bulgaria  -   because  these governments really didn't want the Jews to escape. As a result of the Turkish consuls' efforts, about 3,000 to 4,000 of the Turkish Jews  in  France were  saved.  Another  3,000  were sent  off  to Auschwitz, where  most of them  died. The remaining  3,000 either escaped  across the  border into  Spain or  fled to  the area  of southern France occupied  by the Italians, who  treated Jews much better than  the Nazis did.  At the  end of 1943,  however, Italy fell out of the war, and that was the end for those Jews as well. Incidentally, the Turkish diplomats  in Nazi-occupied Greece also worked to rescue Jews in that country.  - The second part of your  book then deals with Turkish diplomats acting to  rescue Jews of  Turkish citizenship or  Turkish origin from Nazi persecution.  Yes,  and  there  is  an  aside   I  might  add  here:  In  their interventions on  behalf of Turkish  Jews, the Turks  cited their treaty with Germany which stated  that Turkish citizens in German territory would be treated the same as German citizens in Turkey. On  that basis  the Turks  maintained  that the  Nazis could  not discriminate  against Turkish  citizens who  are Jews.  The Nazis claimed  (and the  Vichy government  agreed) that  they were  not discriminating  because  they  were treating  all  Jews  equally. Turkey  protested,   saying,  \\\"You  are  dividing   our  citizens according to religion, but the Turkish constitution requires that all  citizens   be  treated  equally,  regardless   of  religion. Therefore, you cannot single  out Turkish Jews.\\\" American consuls in  Paris,  by contrast,  accepted  the  Nazi argument  and  told American Jews  who were being  persecuted by the Nazis  that they couldn't do  anything about  it, because  the American  Jews were being treated the same as other  Jews. The third part of the book takes place in Turkey, which  was the principal center during the Holocaust for activities aimed at  the rescue of Eastern European Jews. The  kwish Agency, an  organization established by  Jews in Palestine to help resettle Jews to Palestine, set up an office in Istanbul  in 1940  under the  leadership of  Chaim Barlas.  Other Jewish organizations in Palestine, especially the kibbutzes, also sent representatives  to Istanbul  to set up  headquarters. These groups first tried to contact Jews  in Eastern Europe to find out what was  happening. Today  we know about  the Holocaust,  but at that  time people  didn't know  what  was going  on. They  didn't imagine the Nazis could do the things they were doing. And so the first step was to get information, and the Turkish government let them use the Turkish mails to send letters to their relatives and friends  in Eastern  Europe. The  Jewish organizations  found out what was happening when they  received replies. Later on when the Nazis  began  to  intercept   such  letters,  the  Jews  received assistance  also from  the  Vatican nuncio,  Angelo Roncali,  who served as  the Vatican  representative in  Istanbul from  1935 to 1944  and   later  became  Pope   John  XXIII.  As   the  Vatican representative  during the  war, he  used the  facilities of  the Catholic  Church to  supplement what  the Turkish  government was doing to  assist Jewish  agencies in  contacting Jews  in Eastern Europe.  With the  cooperation of  the Turkish  government, these agencies  then  sent  hard  currency, food,  clothing,  and  even railroad  and  steamship  tickets   to  Jews  in  Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary. They weren't able to help much in Poland because  by then the  Nazis had  wiped out almost  all the Polish Jews.  Whenever possible the rescue  agencies arranged for the Jews to get out of Eastern Europe either by train through the so called  Orient Express route  to Istanbul, or by  boat through the Black Sea to Istanbul.  Turkey was not eager for all  these refugees to remain within its borders during  the war, because  it was being blockaded  and was suffering   terrible  shortages   of  food   and  clothing.   The government,   therefore,   facilitated   the  movement   of   the non-Turkish Jewish  refugees from Turkey to  Palestine, either by the Taurus  Express Railroad through  the mountains to  Syria and Palestine,  or by  small boats  across the  eastern Mediterranean from southern  Turkey to  Palestine. These efforts  were bitterly opposed not only  by the Nazis, but also by  the British, who did not want  any more Jewish  immigration to Palestine  because they feared it would hurt their  relations with the Arabs. The British constantly pressured the Turkish  government to stop this traffic and send those Jews back. In  a few cases the Turkish government, yielding  to  British pressure,  did  send  the boats  back.  For example, in  one incident,  the steamship  Struma, with  some 700 Jewish  refugees  from Romania,  was  sent  back by  the  Turkish government  as  a  result  of the  intervention  of  the  British ambassador. When  that ship was  sunk by a Soviet  submarine, all were lost except one person.  Nevertheless, all told, the Turkish government allowed no fewer than 100,000 Eastern European Jews to pass through  Turkish territory and  move on to  Palestine during the Second World War. The Turkish authorities also provided these refugees with facilities  and money, and gave  them permission to send money and food out of the country.  - Many  of these  Jews who  passed  through Turkey  may still  be living in Israel.  Yes, and  their children. But  let's return  for a moment  to the first group, the Turkish Jews who  came from Europe. They did not go  on  to   Palestine;  they  stayed  in  Turkey.   It  was  the non-Turkish, Eastern  European Jews who passed  through Turkey en route to Palestine. Their story is very interesting.  - And you have rescued it from obscurity.  Many studies have been made of the Holocaust, but most of them do not focus on the Eastern European or Middle Eastern Jews. Most of the scholarship  has centered  on the  Western European  Jews, of whom 6 million were massacred by the Nazis. My study deals with a much smaller  number of  people. I  have tried  to round  out the picture,  and I  hope my  book  will persuade  other scholars  to undertake further investigations in the history of Eastern Jews.  When it  comes to numbers,  the German Jews were  also relatively small in number. Most of the millions slain were Polish Jews. The rescue  of  100,000  Eastern  European   Jews  may  not  seem  so significant  compared  with  the  total of  6  million  who  were murdered, but it meant a lot to those who were saved.  About  three-fourths   of  the  book  consists   of  documents  - translations  of many  documents. They  are included  because the story is not well known. Not  only are people in the West unaware of  the courageous  actions of  the Turkish  diplomats; even  the people of Turkey  did not know the story. I  felt that they would not  fully understand  this  remarkable  achievement unless  they could see the documents.  - What languages are used in the documents?  Most of them are in Turkish  or French; some are in Hebrew. There is a great  deal of material in Hebrew about  the organization of the boats  going to Palestine, the  passengers, and so on,  but I did not go into those details extensively. I describe mostly what Turkey did, so  most of my documents are in  Turkish or French. A few documents are  in English. The Jewish groups  in Istanbul did not necessarily  cooperate with  one another  to rescue  Jews; in fact, they often fought with  one another. They took turns trying to  get  the  Turkish  government to  deport  rival  groups.  For example, some of  the kibbutz groups felt that  the Jewish Agency was  run by  Western European  Jews who  were interested  only in helping  Western  European  Jews.  Finally,  in  1944,  President Roosevelt sent a personal  representative, Ira Hirschman, who had been an executive of Bloomingdale's  department store in New York City, and  Hirschman managed to reconcile  their differences. The documents related to his mission are in English.  I also obtained many documents  from Serge Klarsfeld, a Holocaust historian in France,  who mainly worked on the  French Jews. (His father was  killed by  the Nazis.)  He gave  me materials  he had gathered in the German archives on  the Turkish Jews, so I didn't personally consult the German archives.  I believe that much more can  be learned  from the  German  archives, and  I hope  someone someday will make the effort.  - This new book fits in well with your teaching, doesn't it?  Right. I'm  giving a  course on  the history of  the Jews  of the Ottoman  Empire.  I first  gave  the  course  two years  ago.  In addition to  research, writing, and teaching,  I've been actively involved in  the commemoration  of the  500th anniversary  of the coming of the  Jews to the Ottoman Empire. Among  other things, I helped organize  a large international conference  on the subject which was held in Istanbul in 1992.  - Now that your  books are finished and the  conference has taken place, what do you plan to do next?  I'm working on two new books. One is a history of the Turkish War for Independence, which took place  after World War I, during the years  1918 to  1923. The  Turks warded  off the  efforts of  the victorious  European   powers  to  occupy  Turkey   and  end  its independence. The  second book is  a study of Sultan  Abdul Hamid II, the last major sultan, who ruled from 1876 to 1909. He was an important modernizer in his own  way, although he also suppressed all sorts of political movements.  Stanford  J. Shaw  received  a B.A.  in History  and  an M.A.  in British History. He then shifted to Near Eastern History, earning a second M.A.  and a Ph.D. at Princeton. As  a doctoral candidate at Princeton, he  spent two years abroad, studying  at the School of  Oriental  and  African  Studies, University  of  London;  the University of  Cairo, the American  University at Cairo,  and the University of  Istanbul. He  taught at  Harvard before  coming to UCLA in 1966. His postdoctoral research has been supported by the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation, the American Research Institute in  Turkey, the  Social  Science Research  Council, the  National Endowment for the Humanities, the Fulbright Program, and ISOP. He has  received  honorary  degrees   from  Harvard  University  and Bosporus University, Bebek, Istanbul, Turkey, and medals of honor for lifetime contributions  to the fields of  Islamic and Turkish studies from the Center for Research in Islamic History, Art, and Culture in  Istanbul and from  the American Friends of  Turkey in Washington,  D.C. In  addition to  undertaking many  professional service activities and public lectures  in both the United States and Turkey,  Shaw has  also produced eight  books and  one edited volume. His  History of  the Ottoman Empire  and Modem  Turkey (2 vols.)  has been  published  in many  editions  (six editions  or reprints  from 1977-1991),  and  translated  into Turkish  (1983, 1991) and French (1984). His book  The Jews of the Ottoman Empire and  the  Turkish  Republic  (MacMillan,  London,  and  New  York University Press, 1992) will  be published in Turkish translation by the Turkish  Historical Society, Istanbul. His  Turkey and the Holocaust: Turkey's  Role in Rescuing Turkish  and European Jewry from Nazi  Persecution, 1933-1945 will be  published by Macmillan Publishers,  London, and  New York  University Press  in 1993.  A pamphlet summarizing the book was published in Ankara, Turkey, in 1992.  Serdar Argic\",\": It is a dead and useless faith which has no action behind it.  Actions : prove our faith and show the genuineness of it.  A good example of this is Abraham (referred to in the James passage). Hebrews says that Abraham was justified by faith -- but his faith was demonstrated through his works (i.e., he obeyed what God told him to do).  Reading Abraham's ``biography'' in Genesis is very instructive. He was a man beset by *lack* of faith a lot of the time (e.g. lying about Sarah being his wife on 2 occasions; trying to fulfil God's promise on God's behalf by copulating with Hagar). . . yet it seems that God didn't evaluate him on the basis of individual incidents. Abraham is listed as one of the ``heroes of  faith'' in Hebrews 11. i.e., when it really came to the crunch, God declared Abraham as a man of faith. He believed God's promises.  This gives us confidence. Although real faith demonstrates itself through works, God is not going to judge us according to our success/failure in performing works.  ``Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy he saved us, through the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Spirit.''

For providing me this forum I would sincerely like to thank the U.S. Space Foundation.  My topic today is the Single Stage Rocket Technology rocket or SSRT.  By I intend to speak of more.  How to lower the cost and make rapid progress.  SSRT is to my mind -- and I hope to convince you -- the erupting a new rallying cry for our generation in space -- Faster, Cheaper, and Better.       Faster, Cheaper, Better and SSRT represent the passing of a torch from one technical generation to another.  It is a new thing to be sure -- but it is also a relearning of old things from past masters.       When we rolled out the SSRT baby two weeks ago, so called experts told us it violates the laws of physics -- it made no sense.  For example, Dr. Eberhart Rachtin - former president of the Aerospace Corp., said of SSRT in the L.A. Times that it, \\\"defies the best principles of launching payloads into space.\\\"  Well Dr. Rachtin -- you've made us mad!  What are these principles that SSRT defies?       Well I'll tell you.  It violates the principle that you need a giant program office to build space hardware.  It violates the \\\"fact\\\" that it takes 20 years to build something new.  And it violates the truism that you cant do anything significant for less than many billions of dollars.       It took some of the last generation's experts to teach us some new/old lessons.  Werhner Von Braun's first rocket was not a Saturn V.  General Schriever's ICBM's didn't take ten years to demonstrate.  And the X-1 airplane didn't cost $1 billion.       It took one of the great engineers of the 1950's to remind us of these truths -- Max Hunter.  Max, to remind you, was a senior engineer in the Thor IRBM program, and old faster, better, cheaper success story.  Max has been persistent in a vision of a single stage reusable space launch system since the 1960's.  Because he knew it had to be done in affordable steps - Build a little, Test a little.       Next he persuaded us to do a technology demonstration.  We didn't solicit a bunch of requirements -- they'd just change every few years anyway.  [ not included in the speech -- The ALS/NLS has such ephemeral requirements that it would better known as \\\"Shape Shifter\\\" than \\\"Space Lifter.\\\"  We didn't spend a lot money -- this X-Rocket only cost $60 million.  When's the last time we even built a new airplane for that?  And it didn't take a lot of time to build -- McDonnell Douglas completed it in 18 months.  Finally, the government program office consisted of one very over-worked Air Force Major -- motivated in part by the threat that he'd get to ride on it in a strapped-on lawn chair if it ran over cost or schedule.       As I described what SSRT is -- and isn't keep in mind its only a first step.  There are several more steps -- and steps that can easily fail -- before the U.S. can field an SSTO.  But each step should follow the same principles -- a small management team -- a few years technology demonstration -- and a modest budget.       Let me show a few details on SSRT and how it might evolve: (See charts)       I'm embarrassed when my generation is compared with the last generation -- the giants of the last great space era, the 1950's and 1960's.  They went to the moon - we built a telescope that can't see straight.  They soft-landed on Mars - the least we could do is soft-land on Earth!       But we do have an answer.  We can follow their build a little, test a little philosophy to produce a truly affordable and routine access to space.  I know there are nay sayers among you -- those who say SSRT is a stunt.  It needs more thermal protection, the engines are wrong, it would be better to land horizontally, etc, etc.       I say to you -- we'll see you at White Sands in June.  You bring your view-graphs, and I'll bring my rocketship.  If we do what we say we can do, then you let us do the next step.  [ not included in the speech:  If we fail -- you still have your program offices, staff summary sheets, requirement analyses, and decade long programs.]\",\"From: pmetzger@snark.shearson.com (Perry E.

Biblical teaching expects us to celebrate the resurrection of Christ not once a year but every time someone is baptized.  Col. 2:12-Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead.\\\"  Rom. 6:4-Therefore we are buried with him in baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.\\\" Those really want to celebrate the resurrection should by faith walk in newness of life after baptism.  It is not necessary to celebrate a pagan goddess in the process.  Paul answered your question in Romans 9.  In v. 4 he stated that the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the service of God, and the promises were given to the Israelites.  It is a package deal.  He goes on to identify those who are true Israelites.  Vs 6-8 makes it plain that the true Israelites are not those who are born that way but those who accept the promise of God.  Paul continued to emphasize that he was an Israelite in 2 Cor. 11:22, then in Gal 3:29 he says that all those who belong to Christ are Abraham's seed, and heirs to all the promises given to the Israelites.  The promises come with the law.  It is all or nothing.  Why is it that you only want to discard one part of the law?  Certainly you would want your husband to be faithful to you.  Or do you believe that adultery is no longer forbidden?  Same law.  BTW  please give a reference for your statement that the Gentiles are only required to observe the basis commandmants.  Could you list those please.  Acts 15 deals with circumcision and the law of Moses which was added because of transgression of God's eternal law (Gal 3:19; Rom 4:15)\",\"  Are you for real?

The name of the company is Secure Communicatiions Technology (Information will be given at the end of this message on how to contact them).     Basically they are disturbed about the announcement for many reasons that we are. More specifically however, Mr. Bryen of Secure Communications brought to light many points that might interest most of the readers.     His belief is that AT&T was made known of the clipper well before the rest of the industry. This is for several reasons, several of which are:   - A company of AT&T's size could never be able to make a decision to use    the new chip on the SAME DAY it was announced.   - Months ago they proposed using their own chip for AT&T's secure telephone    devices. AT&T basically blew them off as being not interested at all.    This stuck them as strange, until now...      Also I spoke with Art Melnick, their cryptographer, he expressed several concerns over the new Clipper Chip:    - The obvious backdoor will be able to let many people decrypt the code.    - Once the key is released to authorities the security of the crypto     system is lost forever. These keys can end up in the hands of any agency     of the government.    - The fact that the escrowed keys never change means that the algorithm     is vulnerable over time to an attacker.    - The classified algorithm may hide another backdoor. But he feels that     it is probably to keep people from forging fake serial numbers, or     changing the keys themselves.    - Additionally he feels that the NSA has probably spent enough time and     money in working on a way to keep this chip from being reversed     engineered, that he feels that reverse engineering it will be very     difficult to do. He feels that they have developed a suitable technique     to protect the chip from this attack. Also he feels that the chip is     hardware encoded with the algorithm and not microcoded onto the chip.  Additonally I spoke with Mr. Melnick about their algorithm. He couldn't tell me much about their new agorithm because it hasn't been patented yet. However he told me a little:   - The algorithm will be released for public review after patents have been    granted for it. This is so the crypto community can see that it is    secure.   - The algorithm is called NEA for New Encryption Algorithm.    The details were sketchy because now it is held as a trade secret    until the patent was issued, but I was told that it will incorporate    the following:      - It will have fast encryption of data (Exact specs not given, but       Mr. Melnick stated \\\"Much faster than what an RS-232 can put out.\\\")      - It is a symmetric cipher, just like IDEA and DES.      - It will use 64 bit data blocks for encryption (like DES and IDEA).      - The key length was not given to me, but Mr. Melnick states that       it is _adujustable_ and is \\\"More than adequate for security.\\\"      - The algorithm is written in C and Assembler in software form, and       can be ported to many platforms (Unlike the the Clipper Chip which       is hardware ONLY and cannot be made into software) This I       consider a definite plus for the NEA for widespread use.      - The algorithm will accomodate public key distribution techniques       such as RSA or Diffie-Hellman. This will also be supported in the       hardware chip.      - Right now the projected cost of the NEA chip will be about 10 dollars       for each!! (Clipper will run 25 each chip [that is if it is produced       enough, which probably won't happen]).      - They currently sell a program called C-COM that uses the algorithm       and a special streaming protocol that does not divide the encrypted       data into \\\"blocks.\\\" This could prevent plaintext attacks if you know       what the block header is. This program operates at all supported       RS-232 speeds and uses the software implementation of the algorithm.      - Most importantly: IT DOES NOT HAVE A BACKDOOR!!    Right now the company is afraid that the new clipper chip will put them out of business. This is a very real possibility. So they really need help in stopping the clipper chip from becoming a standard. If you want to contact them, they can be reached at..

You can keep a guy on the 15-day for as long  as you want, IF he's still certified as injured.  The player must be  periodically re-evaluated to determine if he's still injured (thus you  cannot park a player on the DL who maybe is out of options and you do not  wish to expose to waivers).  If you get someone qualified for the 60-day  that reduces the frequency of re-evaluations.  There is no longer, I  believe, any limit to the number of players you can place on the DL.

Genesis 15:6, \\\"And he (Abram) believed the LORD; and He reckoned    it to him as righteousness\\\".     I don't find anywhere that God restricts heaven to particular    ethnic groups or religious denominations or any other category    that we humans like to drop people into. But He does REQUIRE    that we believe and trust Him. In Hebrews it says that God spoke    of old by the prophets (the old testament), but in these last days    he has spoken to us by His son Jesus Christ. And we learn of    Him through the pages of the New Testament. The Bible tells us    what we need to believe.

It should be able to detect the presence of a single pixel at 65 MHz, which would mean detecting a 15 NS pulse.  It should also be able to tell the difference between a blank screen (about 300 mv) and a dim screen (say, around 310 mv).  Oh yes, it also needs to be cheap.    My first circuit was a dismal failure.  I used 3 compariators; each compariator had the + input going to one of the guns, the - input went to a reference created by a voltage divider(a potentiometer).  The first problem was that the compariator was way too slow.. I needed to get several pixels in a row before it would fire the compariators, so I could have a whole screen full of text, but my circuit would not detect it.     The second problem is that there was more noise on the reference then the smallest difference between a blank screen and a dim screen.  In fact the difference between completely black and completely white is only 650 mv.  I am wondering if I am going to have to amplify the video signals to make this work.    There are faster compariators, but they are expensive, and require  split supplies.

Jewish religion was the foundation for Christianity and Islam.  In other words Judaism has fathered both religions. Now Islam has turned against its father I may say. It is Ironic that after communizem threat is almost gone, religion wars are going to be on the raise.  I thought the idea of believing on one God, was to Unite all man kind. How come both Jews and Islam which believe on the same God, \\\"the God of Ebrahim\\\" are killing each other? Is this like Dr. Frankenstien's story? How are you going to stop this from happening? How are you going to deal with so many Muslims. Nuking them  would distroy the whole world? Would God get mad, since you have killed his followers, you believe on the same God, same heaven and the same hell after all? What is the peacefull way of ending this Saga?   Man kind needs religion, since it sets up the rules and the regulations which keeps the society in a healthy state. A religion is mostly a sets of rules which people have experienced and know it works for the society. The praying, keeps the sole healthy and meditates it. God does not care for man kinds pray, but man kind hopes that God will help him when he prays. Religion works mostly on the moral issues and trys to put away the materialistic things in the life. But the  religious leaders need to make a living through religion? So they  may corrupt it, or turn it to their own way to make their living. i.e Muslims have to pay  %20 percent of their income to the Mullahs. I guess the rabie  gets his cut too!   Is in it that religion should be such that everybody on planet earth respects each other, be good toward each other helps one another, respect the mother nature. Is in that heaven and hell are created on earth through the acts  that we take today?  Is in it that within every man there is good and bad, he could choose either one, then he will see the outcome of his choice.  How can we prevent man kind from going crazy over religion. How can we stop another religious killing field, under poor Gods name? What are your thoughts? Do you think man kind would to come its senses, before it is too late?   P.S. on the side  Do you think that Moses saw the God on mount Sina? Why would God go to top of the mountain? He created the earth, he could have been anywhere? why on top the mountain? Was it because people thought to see God you have to reach to the skies/heavens? Why God kept coming back to Middle East? Was it because they created God through their imagination?  Is that why Jewish people were told by God, they were the chosen ones?  Profit Mohammad was married to Khadijeh. She was a Jewish. She taught him how to trade. She probably taught him about Judaism. Quran is mostly copy right of Taurah (sp? old testement). Do you think God wrote Quran? Makeh was a trade city before Islam. Do you think it was made to be the center of Islamic world because Mohammad wanted to expand his trade business? Is that why  God has put his house in there?   I think this religious stuff has gone too far. All man kind are going to hurt from it if they do not wise up. Look at David Koresh, how that turned out? I am afraid in the bigger scale, the Jews and the Muslims will have the same ending!!!!!!!!  Religion is needed in the sense to keep people in harmony and keep them doing good things, rather than plotting each others distruction.  There is one earth, One life and one God.

What exactly did I claim?      --------------------------------------------------     \\\"I've heard eye-witness descriptions of tanks using their main guns   to respond to sniper fire.  Quite effectively.\\\"      --------------------------------------------------        I wasn't wrong . . . I've heard those descriptions.  If you're   paying attention, I've mentioned that I saw the tanks with my own   eyes, but the main gun firing was an account I heard.  That helps   people judge whether or not to kick in the, to use your words,   \\\"bullshit filters\\\".  Stating that I *claimed* this is a falsehood.    Later in the same post:      Another part of my memories was that while most damaged building   were burnt, some were in rubble.  Based on what I remember, I was and   am inclined to believe an old sarge or two.  Fine, *now* you are stating that you believe their claims (or that you are \\\"inclined\\\" to.  See below for a stronger statement of your beliefs).  Those claims are still ludicrous, however.  Previously Awesley had written:   You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers.  Prompting me to write:   To fire fragmentary grenades?  I doubt that as well.  To fire concussion   grenades?  Perhaps.  To fire tear gas?  Certainly.  But you would be   perfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags, wouldn't you, since   it makes your other claim seem more plausible.  To which Awesley replied:   John, again, strawman techniques.  Do you feel you're losing it so you   have to stretch what I said and knock that down?  What I read said   nothing about what they fired.  And so I put nothing in there.  If you   need some help, let me know and I'l take your side of this for a   while.  You're not scoring here, you're boring here.  But why did you mention grenade launchers at all?  Because it supports the notion that the tanks shelled buildings.  And it supports that notion because it conjures images of troops launching fragmentary grenades.  But that too is ludicrous.    If tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit, people would have been   screaming about it for the past two and half decades.  I would know about   it.   Awesley relied:      Glad to know you're such an expert.  Nice to hear some an   authority.  I especially appreciate your basis of knowledge -- if it   had happened, you would have know it.  Since you are such an   authority, you probably know that people did scream about an alleged   massive cover-up in the number of people killed in the Detroit riot.   Some claimed 100+ dead, others said 300.  The offical number is 43 but   the Concise Columbia Encyclopedia says it was \\\"several\\\".  I've also   heard some things about that but I won't dare repeat them.  You'd   assert that I claimed they were truth.  Yes, if it happened I would have heard about it.  Everybody would have.  Army tanks don't fire their cannons in American cities in the 1960's without it becoming common knowledge, without minority leaders seizing on it and condemning it over and over again, without civil libertarians saying \\\"this has gone far enough.\\\"  So, yes, my never hearing of it was the basis for my disbelieving the claim.  Now I have more reasons to disbelieve it.  Not one poster has written to say, yes, I lived in Detroit at that time and everybody knew that the tanks had fired shells.  This is the UseNet.  If it had happened, somebody here would remember it.  Furthermore, your own research failed to come up with any support for the claim.  The claim is extraordinary and it has no supporting evidence, extraordinary or not.  Unless you count the brags of a couple of guardsmen shooting the shit.  I do not.    Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up.        Taking the tour after the riots, it was pretty easy to tell the    difference between Army and Guard troops.  Or so I recall from 26    years ago.  And I seem to recall it was the Army running the tanks.   So it would have been an Army cover-up.  Quibble.  Fine, it was an Army cover-up.  Six years in the Reserves has taught me the difference also.  But do you think that in two and half decades not one guilt-ridden participant has come forward and said \\\"yes, I shelled Americans,\\\" or \\\"I gave the orders to fire the cannons,\\\" or \\\"I helped cover it up\\\"?    If your mind is open enough to believe that, well, good for you.  I prefer   to live in reality.   And here in reality, I find it hard to believe that   those tanks even had any shells, much less fired them.  Awesley replied:     Given the level in destruction in Detroit, I'm quite willing to believe   that they did fire their guns.  Good.  Then we can drop the junk about you not claiming that they did.  Your belief fails a basic reality check: why isn't it known?  Awesley concludes:      Now then, we've bored the shit out of anyone whose bothered to read   this far and all you've managed to say is that you don't believe the   account I cited.  Actually, now we have established that I don't believe what you believe, as well as why I don't believe it.  And if it's boring, then I yield the last word to you, if you want it.

I've been using the standard Windows VGA driver with other similarly configured computers.  I am thinking that my problem is with the way Windows refreshes it's screen.  The problem is that once Windows has been envoked, the colors start changing themselves.  At first I thought it was hardware, but if you open a full screen DOS program from within the Windows session, you don't have any problems until you get back to Windows - however, when you initially return to Windows, the original colors get refreshed properly.  Also, it is not a uniform color change - so if you are in solitaire, the design on the back of the card maintains it's original color scheme, but the white fronts of the cards will turn grey, then blue, etc.  The color changes keep getting darker until finally everything is a dark purple-ish black.  If you pop out to DOS and exit back to Windows - the screen gets refreshed again.  If I don't log into Windows and just do DOS things from the Novell network, everything is fine.  I originally loaded the software by bouncing it down to the net from the other machine I had just finished configuring, then from the net to this machine.  When I ran into problems, I deleted everything on this machine and the net, and tried bouncing it again.  When that didn't work, I tried reloading Windows to no avail.

In the Brock2 model, Bill James calculated predicted RBIs as RBI=.235*(Total Bases) + Home Runs.  This  completely ignores the context, which was all that Brock2  could do, since context was unknown to it.  So I thought I'd take that idea as a starting point and look how good a fit to the data you get by comparing (RBI-Home Runs) to SLG*RISP.  I've started with team data, using data from the Elias's that I've picked up over the years when a) I could afford them and b) I could stomach the thought of increasing Elias's profits. That gave me the years 1984-1986, 1988, and 1990.  (I don't  have team RBIs for '87 or I could add that year.)  If you run a simple least squares fit to the data you get   (RBI-Home Runs) = 0.81*SLG*RISP.  The correlation between the LHS and the RHS is 0.86, which is significant at a ridiculously high level.  So, I feel like the fit is good at the team level.  I've no started to move on to  the player level and have looked at 4 players (Will Clark, Ozzie Smith, Joe Carter, and Don Mattingly).  I hope to  add quite a few more during my copious free time this year.  It doesn't do too badly, except the equation underpredicts the low HR hitter (Smith), which may be a fault of the model or it could just be Ozzie.  The results:                             RBI-HR          Years        Actual   Predicted Carter  (84-88,90)     400       402.6 Clark   (87,88,90,92)  269       269.6 Matt'ly (84-88,90)     471       460.8 Smith   (84-88,90)     317       280.6  I think we can make a case (and I hope to make it stronger) that RBIs can be predicted simply from knowing how a player slugs overall and how many men are in scoring position when he comes up.  More later, Harold\",\"   Well they don't export anywhere near 50% of their GNP. Mexico's perhaps but not their own. They actually export around the 9-10% mark. Similar to most developed countries actually. Australia exports a larger share of GNP as does the United States (14% I think off hand. Always likely to be out by a factor of 12 or more though) This would be immediately obvious if you thought about it.   It is their import routes that count. They can do without exports but they couldn't live without imports for any longer than six months if that.   Too true! But one that is unstable and hence a source of serious worry.

We are doing a bible study (at my college) on Revelations.  We have been doing pretty good as far as getting some sort of reasonable interpretation.  We are now on chapters 17 and 18 which talk about the woman on the beast and the fall of Babylon.  I believe the beast is the Antichrist (some may differ but it seems obvious) and the woman represents Babylon which stands for Rome or the Roman Catholic Church.  What are some views on this interpretation?  Is the falling Babylon in chapter 18 the same Babylon in as in chapter 17?  The Catholic church?

The assertion was made, unequivocally that no Christian ever sufferred for their faith by believing in the Resurrection.  Luke's account suggests otherwise, and in the absence of direct eyewitnesses who can claim that Luke is mistaken, then I suggest that this unequivocal assertion is suspect.    --  John G.

It was an answer to the claim that the witnesses couldn't be lying because they were willign to suffer for their beliefs. Thus it's not necessary to show that no Christian ever suffered for believing in the Resurrection.  Rather the issue is whether those who witnessed it did.  I do agree that the posting you're responding to shows that there can be liberal as well as conservative dogmatism.\",\"Archive-name: rec-autos/part5  [this article is one of a pair of articles containing commonly asked automotive questions; the other article contains questions more geared to the automotive enthusiast, and so is not crossposted to misc.consumers.  -- rpw]     [changes as of 14 April 1993: revised brake fluid section, as     non-silicone DOT-5 fluids are now apparently available -- rpw]                   Commonly Asked Automotive Questions   Tire Questions:  Q:  What do the funny numbers on the sides of my tires mean?  A:  Typically, you will see something like 195/60HR14.  the 195 is the     overall width of the tire in millimeters, the tread is usually     narrower.  The 60 is the `aspect ratio'; it indicates the height of the     sidewall of the tire relative to the overall width.  Our example tire     has a sidewall height of 0.60 * 195 ~= 117 mm.  The 14 is the wheel     diameter in inches; there are also some special tires called `TRX'     tires which have three digit metric wheel diameter designations, like     390, which is in millimeters.  The R means Radial, and the H is a speed     rating indicating the highest speed at which the tire, when properly     inflated and carrying an appropriate load, may safely operate.  Common     speed ratings are S (112MPH), T (118MPH), H (130MPH), and V (up to     150MPH.)      Recent changes to the method for specifying tire sizes move the speed     rating to a different part of the designation; you may therefore find     designations like 195/60R14 85H; the 85 indicates the per-tire load     associated with the speed rating -- exceeding this load in continuous     operation at the rated speed is dangerous practice.  What follows is     a table showing a number of `load indices' and corresponding maximum     per-tire loads:      Load Index       50   51   88   89   112   113   145   149   157     Max Load (Kg)   190  195  560  580  1120  1150  2900  3250  4125      Note that the usual mass vs. weight confusion occurs in this table.      In some cases, the letters P or LT may be found in front of a tire     size; the LT designation indicates Light Truck, and the P designation     indicates Passenger car.  If no letter is given, then the application     of the tire is Passenger car usage.  As far as I know, these letters     only appear in the US market.  The LT designation is prinicipally of     interest to owners of light trucks and other utility vehicles.  For     the owner of a passenger vehicle, there is no meaningful difference     between a tire with a P designation and one with no designation at     all.      If the aspect ratio is omitted, it is probably 80, but may be 78.      Tires with an MS (mud/snow) designation may have their speed rating     reduced by 20 km/h (about 12mph.)      There is an additional set of ratings on tires for temperature,     traction, and treadwear.  Temperature and Traction are graded     A, B, and C (with A the best and C the worst); treadwear is     a numeric rating.  These values are of limited value, as they     are assigned somewhat arbitrarily by tire manufacturers and are     thus not useful in comparing different brands of tires.  Q:  My car has tires with a funny size designation:  185/65HR390; can i put     normal tires on the car?  A:  Your tires are called TRX tires; they were devised by Michelin.     Because of a somewhat different bead design, they are incompatible     with normal tires; Michelin used a different diameter wheel for them     so that they could not be mounted on the wrong type wheel (and so that     more conventional tires could not be mounted on TRX type wheels.)     You will need to aquire different wheels to put a normal tire on your     car; it is barely possible to fit normal tires on TRX wheels, and horribly     dangerous to do so (the tires may simply peel off the rims in a corner,     or possibly blow out at high speed.)  TRX type tires are becoming hard     to find; in addition to Michelin, Avon makes suitable tires.  Goodyear     has apparently discontinued their line of TRX tires.  Q:  Can I rotate radials from side to side, or rotate them only on one side     of my car?  A:  Car and tire manufacturers have differing views on this subject; many     say that swapping radials between the left and right hand sides of a     car is now ok (this group includes Michelin and Goodyear); others     (for example, Pirelli and Nokia) will void warranties if such swapping     is done.  The best advice is to read your tire manual carefully before     rotating your tires, and stick to the manufacturer's recommendations.  Q:  How many snow tires should I buy, and if I buy 2, which end of the     car should I put them on?  A:  In short, 4, and both ends.  To explain, many drivers in areas that don't     get excessive snow or who don't drive agressively (or at all) in snow     conditions get away with only two snows on the drive wheels, but there     are circumstances where this can be dangerous practice.  With a rear     wheel drive car, you can choose between being able to start the car     going (a function of the rear axle) or stopping and turning the car     (a function of the front axle.)  In a front wheel drive car, you start,     stop, and turn with the front end.  The primary risk of putting the     snow tires on the front only is that if you have to put on the brakes     while going downhill, you run a serious risk of going downhill backwards.  Radar Detectors and Speed Limits:  Q:  Why aren't there any comments on Radar Detectors and Speed Limits     in this Q&A posting?  A:  Because questions about detectors and speed limits crossposted between     misc.consumers and rec.autos.* always start long, tedious, and pointless     flame wars.  If you want to talk about either of these topics, please     subscribe to rec.autos or alt.flame and keep it there.  Safety Equipment:  Q:  Do airbags really work?  A:  Preliminary statistics suggest the following:  Airbags work much     better than no belts; good 3 point belts alone work much better than     Airbags alone, and AirBags + 3 point belts work slightly better than     3 point belts alone.  The con to airbags is that some designs tend     to burn the driver's hands when venting the byproducts of the     explosion that occurs inside the bag, and that some designs (but     not all) may knock the driver's hands from the wheel, making retention     of control of the vehicle after the bag deflates more difficult.  Brake Questions:  Q:  Do I always need to get the rotors on my disk brakes turned?  Midas     always wants to do this.  A:  No.  There are specific conditions that mandate turning or replacing     rotors; some shops try and make a little extra money by replacing rotors     more often than is strictly necessary.  if the rotors are not warped     warped, and only lightly grooved, then there is no need to replace or     to turn them.  Note also that some rotors (the rotors on many Hondas     are a good example) are so narrow to begin with that it is not practical     to turn them; they must be replaced when they become too thin, warped,     or badly grooved.  Q:  They tell me I should downshift when braking to slow my car down.  Is     this really a good idea?  A:  It used to be a very good idea, back in the days of mediocre, fade     prone drum brakes.  In modern disc brake equipped cars, use of     downshifting to slow the car is not really necessary, except in cases     of long, steep downhill runs.  Otherwise, modern disc brakes are more     than adequate to stop a passenger car in all circumstances, and they     are much cheaper to repair than clutch linings.      On the other hand, many standard driver's license tests in the USA     still specify that the driver being tested downshift under braking; I     suggest that before taking a US driver's test, you either 1) learn to     do this smoothly (which takes some time and practice) or 2) borrow a     car with an automatic to take the test.  Q:  How often should I replace my brake fluid?  A:  Probably more often than you do.  Traditional brake fluids tend to     absorb water; this water can corrode internal parts of the brake     system and also lower the boiling point of the fluid.  DOT-3 type     are older fluids; DOT-4 and DOT-5 are newer specifications.  The     principal differences are in wet and dry boiling points; the dry     boiling point is important in fresh brake fluid, but the wet boiling     point is important in older brake fluid.  DOT-3 fluids have the lowest     wet and dry boiling point _requirements_; DOT-4 fluids have better     boiling point requirements; and DOT-5 fluids have the best boiling     point requirements (but DOT-5 fluids are not clearly superior; see     the next Q&A for more details.)  While the requirements imply that     DOT-4 fluids are better than DOT-3 fluids, there may be specific     cases where a DOT-3 fluid is preferable, but these are mostly     competition applications.  Otherwise, DOT-4 type fluids offer _much_     improved brake pedal feel.  Replacement once a year is recommended for     DOT-4 fluids, although agressive drivers may profit by changing out     fluid more frequently, or at least bleeding a modest amount of fluid     out of the brake calipers fairly regularly.  Q:  What about DOT-5 brake fluids?  A:  This breaks down in to two parts.  The DOT-5 specification looks     excellent for performance, but the first DOT-5 fluids were Silicone     based.  Silicone fluids are a tricky proposition.  Unlike DOT-3 and     DOT-4 fluids, they do not absorb water at all.  While this may sound     like a feature, the problem is that any water present pools up in     such systems, interfering with braking performance and corroding any     metals at the spot where the pooling is occuring.  The water will tend     to migrate downwards in the braking system to the brake calipers, where     most of the corrosion occurs.      Because of this phenomenon, it is essential when converting to     Silicone to empty the entire brake system and flush it throughly     beforehand; some even recommend replacing all rubber parts in the     brake system when converting to Silicone fluids.      Two other issues that come up with silicone fluids:  1) they are     difficult to pour cleanly (that is, without air bubbles), which     interferes with getting a good brake pedal feel, and 2) while they     generally have much higher boiling points than DOT-4 fluids, they     do have high temperature failure modes which are indistinguishable     in effect from boiling DOT-4 fluids.  SIlicone fluids may make sense     in some street car applications, but they are certainly not     recommended for high performance driving applications, and the     economics are questionable for street use.      I have recently become aware of new fluids that meet the DOT-5 standard     that do not contain Silicones; these fluids appear to be reasonably     compatible with the older DOT-3 and DOT-4 fluids, but I have little     information at this time.  Q:  ABS is available on some of the cars I'm looking at, but it costs     more.  Is it worth it?  A:  This does not have a cut and dried answer; therefore, this answer will     be quite long in order to cover the pros and cons.  The short answer     is that ABS costs more, both initially, and to maintain, will generally     work better for the `average driver' (that is to say, a driver who does     not have extensive experience in high performance driving techniques),     and may require the `unlearning' of some obsolete braking techniques     like pump braking which should be unlearned in any case.      Now for the long answer.  ABS works by monitering the wheels of the     car, looking for signs of locked brakes.  It may or may not be able     be able to distinguish between the different wheels (there are several     systems on the market.)  It cannot detect impending lockup (which is     what you would really want in an ideal world), but only the existence     of lockup.  The sensors used vary; some of the less well designed     sensors are sensitive to tire size, and to brake pad material, and     may cease to function properly if the owner deviates from original     equipment or OE-equivalent components.      When the sensors detect lockup, the ABS system responds by unlocking     the brakes (either individually, or all at once, depending on the     system.)  If the driver keeps their foot firmly planted, the ABS     will end up cycling between the locked and unlocked states (if a     sensor existed that could detect _impending lockup_, then we could     sit right at that point, which is where maximum braking effect is     achieved.)  This pulsing can often be felt in the brake pedal, as     the system cycles.  The percentage of the time that the brakes are     truly engaged is called the `duty cycle'; typically in an ABS system     this is about 40%  On dry pavement, a trained driver can beat this     duty cycle quite reliably using a technique called threshold braking;     on wet pavement, braking is so chancy that ABS will outperform     threshold braking nearly every time.  Unfortunately, on mud and on     snow, often maximum braking effect can be acheived with the brakes     locked; only Audi, of the manufacturers producing ABS-equipped cars,     has seen fit to provide a disable switch for the ABS system for this     eventuality.      A particularly important feature of ABS is that it preserves     steering control.  This is the case simply because, if you are     braking near the limit and turn the wheel, the ABS will release     the brakes if it sees steering-triggered lockup, and back off     on the percentage of the time that the brakes are applied.     Braking distances will lengthen accordingly.      An important caution:  ABS cannot exceed the maximum theoretical     braking force in any given situation; if you start sliding on     glare ice, don't expect an ABS system to help you out very much.     The coefficient of friction is not changed by the presence of an     ABS system in your car.      As far as maintenence goes, in addition to the potential     restrictions I've listed above, you have to worry about the     following:  1) parts costs are much higher; the OE master cylinder     for my obscure european sedan lists for $185, but the OE master     cylinder for the ABS-equipped version of the same car lists for     over $1000.  Most manufacturers explicitly forbid use of DOT-5     (silicone) brake fluids in ABS-equipped vehicles.  Because of     the potential cost of replacement of corroded brake system     components, regular (I suggest annual) replacement of brake fluid     becomes very important.  Q:  What about this threshold braking business?  A:  [normally, I'd not put this in the consumers Q&A, but recent     publicity about a number of accidents involving police drivers     in ABS-equipped Chevy Caprices suggests that this section is     needed here -- rpw]      Threshold braking is a technique practiced by all serious high     performance drivers; if made a habit, it replaces the `stab     the pedal and lock 'em up' panic habit entirely, and is much     to be prefered.  Basically, the premise is that tires generate     maximum braking force when they have just started to slide, but     just before the wheels lock up entirely.  Drivers who threshold     brake learn to feel what this `threshold' feels like, and learn     to search for it and hit it on the application of the brake     pedal.  In many cars, you can feel that you are near the     threshold when the pedal starts to firm up as you depress it.     In any case, if you can't hear the tires whine just a bit, you're     not very near the threshold.      In a car with ABS, often there is a twinge in the pedal just     before the system starts cycling; if the driver backs off on     the pedal just a tad when the twinge is felt, then they are very     close to the threshold and they'll probably achieve better     stopping distances than if they just punched it and let the ABS     take over.      Recently, there has been a rash of publicity over a number of     accidents, and one death, involving police cars equipped with     ABS systems.  The police departments in question quickly blamed     the new ABS systems, but according to Autoweek magazine, it now     seems clear that the problem was a lack of training; none of the     involved officers had any recent performance driving training.     There is reason to believe that the drivers reacted to the pulsing     brake pedal by `pump braking', an old and discredited technique     of stabbing and releasing the brake pedal, the goal being to     try and get brakes back with a failing hydraulic system.  If you     think about it for a minute, you'll realize that pump braking must     cut the effective operation of a working brake system by at least     1/2, so if you cut the 40% duty cycle of an ABS system by that     much, you are giving up most of your brakes for the wrong reason.     Threshold braking has the advantage in that it is an effective     and useful technique regardless of whether your car has ABS; if     you do fear a failed hydraulic system, then one or two stabs at     the pedal will be sufficient.      Gas Questions:  Q:  Does High Octane gasoline help?  A:  Maybe, maybe not.  Some cars have knock sensors, and can adjust the     engine timing or turbocharger boost to suit the gasoline being used.     On most cars, however, you should use the cheapest gas that makes your     car run well.  Check your owner's manual for details on what your car     needs.  Q:  My car was made for leaded gasoline.  Will unleaded gas hurt it?  A:  It is possible that unleaded gas may *slightly* increase valve wear,     although the Amoco Oil company argues otherwise.  The actual increase     in valve wear will be almost unnoticeable, however, as modern leaded     gasolines actually contain very little lead.  You should, however,     check your owner's manual; many cars from the early 1970s do not     actually require leaded gasoline.  Q:  Do fuel treatments help?  What kind should I use?  A:  Some do and some don't.  During the winter, it is a good idea to use     dry gas; however, some may be harmful to fuel injection systems.     Never use an additive containing Methanol (sometimes called Methyl     Alcohol); such additives may damage fuel systems in cars with carbs     and almost certainly will damage cars with fuel injection.      Manufacturer's opinions vary on additives containing Ethanol (sometimes     called Ethyl Alcohol); if your car has fuel injection, check the owner's     manual on your car before  using these.  Most manufacturers consider     10% Ethanol acceptable in gasoline.  Additives with Isopropyl Alcohol     (Isopropanol), and Petroleum  Distillates are fine in fuel injected     cars.      An occasional bottle of fuel injector cleaner is helpful in cars with     fuel injectors, although many premium gasolines contain detergents that     do the same job.  Some off brands of fuel injector cleaners contain     Ethanol or Methanol; always check the ingredients before putting anything     in your gas tank.      There are a small number of particularly good additives; these are     noticeably more expensive that the run-of-the-mill ones, but work     much, much better.  Among these are Chevron Techron, Redline SL-1,     Wurth `Lubrimoly Ventil Sauber', and BG 44K.  A bottle of one of these,     once every six months, is highly recommended.  Q:  What about detergent gasolines?  A:  The quality of detergent packages in gasolines varies somewhat; BMW     has instituted a testing program, and gasoline brands which pass this     test may advertise that fact.  Stickers indicating passage of the test     are now beginning to appear on fuel pumps at gas stations.  If such     gasolines are used, then fuel injector cleaners are probably optional.     Beforewarned that while use of BMW approved gasolines will keep a clean     engine clean, they may not clean a motor with bad valve deposits.  Lubrication Questions:  Q:  What do the numbers and letters in a motor oil designation mean?  A:  There are several different items encoded.  There is a two-letter     code indicating the type of detergent package that the manufacturer      uses in the oil; this looks like SE,SF,CD or such.  The S codes are     for gasoline engine applications; the C codes are for diesel engine     applications.  The second letter is assigned in sequence as new levels     of protection are developed; thus SF is considered better than SE,     SE is considered better than SD, and so forth.      The more noticeable designation is the oil weight.  This is either     a single number (e.g., 30 weight) or a pair of numbers separated by     the letter W (e.g., 10W30.)  The latter type is much more commonly     used these days, and are the only type that most automobile     manufacturers specify in operators manuals.  The first number in the     designation (10W) is the apparent viscosity of the oil when it is cold;     the W stands for `winter'.  The second number (30) is the viscosity     of the oil when hot.  There is a trick here; the oil doesn't actually     get thicker (turn from 10 weight to 30 weight) as it gets hotter.  What     is actually happening is that when the oil is cold, it has the viscosity     of a cold 10 weight oil.  as it gets hotter, it doesn't get thin as fast     as a 10W oil would; by the time it is up to temperature, it has the     viscosity of a hot 30 weight oil.      Note that these numbers actually specify ranges of viscosities; not     all 10W oils have exactly the same viscosity when cold, and not all     30 weight oils have the same viscosity when hot.  Note also that the     novel behaviour of multi-grade oils is caused by additives, and it has     been reported that with the sole exception of Castrol GTX, 10W40 oils     do not retain their multi-grade characteristics well over time.  10W30,     15W40, and 20W50 oils work very well, though.  Q:  Are `quick lube' places any good?  A:  Some do adequate work, but there are quite a few incompetent ones out     there.  Let the buyer beware, watch them while they work, make sure     that they don't overtorque the oil drain plug, and keep your hand on     your wallet at all times.  Q:  Are oil additives like Slick-50 or Tufoil any good?  A:  Slick-50 and Tufoil are PTFE-based additives.  Many of these have     come onto the market recently; they are different from the moly-based     additives that have been around since the early 50's.  PTFE is the     chemical name for Teflon(TM), a trademark owned by DuPont. In general,     auto manufacturers do not recommend use of these products.  Most USENET     responses to questions on these additives are favorable (slight     increase of MPG after application, smoother revving) but long term     results (whether PTFE additives are effective after 5K miles) are     debatable.  Some manufacturers (such as Saab) claim that either the     product or the engine flush that preceeds application causes     deterioration of the oil seals and eventual leakage.  Some BMW owners     have reported death of valve seals shortly after the addition of     Slick 50 to their cars.  This writer has been cautioned by a Slick-50     Dealer (!) that Slick-50 should _not_ be used in Japanese motors, as     it may clog the oil return passages in the engine.  Otherwise, there are     no known reports of damage caused by PTFE additives.      On the other hand, there are satified Slick 50 customers in the world.  Q:  Do synthetic oils really work?  A:  Yes, but.  More specifically, most auto manufactuers accept synthetics,     but disagree with the extremely long oil change intervals claimed by     oil manufacturers.  Auto manufacturers recommend that you continue to     change oil at the intervals recommended in the owners manual for your     car.  Even if you decide to try the longer intervals, at least change     the oil filter at regular intervals, as synthetics get just as dirty     as conventional oils.      Synthetic gear lubricants for manual transmissions are another matter     entirely; Amsoil, Redline, and AGIP are very highly regarded and very     effective.  Mobil 1 synthetic gear lube gets mixed reviews, however.  Q:  Manufacturers are specifying longer and longer oil change intervals.     How often should I change my oil?  A:  It depends on how you drive.  If your car always (or nearly always)     gets warmed up, and you don't drive it very hard and keep the revs     down, the manufacturer's recommendation is probably fine.  If, however,     you drive it hard, drive it at high revs, or alternatively, if you     only drive it to and from the supermarket so that it doesn't get up     to temperature, then you may wish to change oil much more often,     perhaps at 3000 mile intervals (given that most manufacturers are     now specifying 7500 mile intervals.)  If you don't drive your car     much at all (say 7500 miles a year), then you probably want to change     oil every six months anyway.  If you are storing a car during the winter,     then change oil before storing it and change oil when you bring it out     of storage.  Misc. Questions:  Q:  My car has a timing belt.  I hear that bad things happen when they     break.  What's the story?  A:  It depends on the internal design of the motor.  Early Ford Escorts,     for example, will suffer severe valve damage if the belt breaks, but     the newer cars will just require a tow and installation of a new belt.     Some Honda motors will not be damaged, but others will be.      If no replacement interval is specified for your car, then change the     belt at least every 60,000 miles; some cars may require more frequent     replacement.  Ask your dealer or independent mechanic.  Also, ask if     there are any related repairs that should take place at the same time     (for example, the same Ford Escorts that suffer valve damage also have     a timing belt driven water pump, which has been known to seize,     destroying the timing belt, and which then causes major valve damage     as a side effect.  Replacing the timing belt while ignoring the water     pump can be a costly mistake.)  Q:  Why would anyone be stupid enough to design a motor so that it     self destructs when the timing belt breaks?  A:  For performance reasons.  Compromising piston design so that the     valves and pistons will not collide requires that the compression     ratio of the engine be reduced significantly; this is why you are     more likely to avoid valve damage in economy cars than in performance     oriented vehicles.  Q:  What causes Unintended Acceleration?  A:  The final report of the National Highway, Transportation, and Safety     Administration concluded that unintended acceleration could not be     caused by any mechanical failure of the vehicle in question and at the     same time be consistent with the physical evidence.  The NHTSA report     goes on to conclude that `pedal misapplication' by the vehicle operator     is probably the cause.\",\"Since I'm not all too keen on this area of hooking them up, I'm  asking for help.

I have come across a few that look good:    Zapp 1.1 from Inmark   Zinc 3.5 from Zinc software   C++/Views from Liant   Win++ from Blaise  Some considerations I'm using:    Being new to Windows programming (I'm from the UNIX/X world), the quality and intuitivness of the abstraction that these class libraries provide is very  important.  However, since I'm not adverse to learning the internals of Windows programming, the new programming methodology should be closely aligned with the native one.  I don't believe arbitrary levels of abstraction, just for the sake of changing the API, are valuable.    Since we will be developing for the 32bit Windows NT system the memory management issues and issues particular to the Windows 3.1 API are less important.     We will probably buy another C++ class library (something like Tools.h++ or Booch components from Rational) to handle data structures and other miscellaneous stuff  (allocators etc...).  So those features are not that important for this toolkit to have.  The two that I have narrowed it down to are ZApp and Zinc, they seem to be the two toolkits that have received the most attention from the media.  I was wondering if anyone had any first-hand experience with any of these toolkits (especially ZApp and Zinc).  A couple of observations about these toolkits that seem particularly noteworthy are:  ZApp ----   Seems to have the most extensive coverage of Windows functionality and     also includes some other miscellaneous useful classes.   Has new fancy 3D-style controls available, and support for custom controls.   Has a Windows NT version (Essential)   Redirectable graphics display/output architecture (useful for printing)   Sizer class for automatically managing control layout after resize.   Seems to be the newcomer, this could be an advantage in designing a better system.   Zinc ----   Has a platform independent resource strategy.  (Not too important for me right now)   Comes with a interface builder tool   Has a Windows NT version (Essential)   Seems to have been around longer (more mature), but grew up out of a DOS version.

Thiokol provided me with samples and data on a reinforcement to solid motor grains for high accelerations.  Solid motor propellants usually have a substantial percentage of  aluminum in the mix.  For example, the Space Shuttle SRBs are 16 percent Aluminum.  The technique is to use a 'foamed aluminum' structure. The structure looks like the inverse of a set of bubbles (an I suspect some bubbling process is used to form it).  In other words, if you made a bunch of bubbles in molten aluminum, then froze it, this is what you get.  It forms a strong network of effectively aluminum wires in all directions.  The remaining solid fuel mix is infiltrated into the voids, and you get aluminum-reinforced solid propellant.  The foamed-aluminum makes up about 6 percent of the total propellant, so there is still aluminum particles in the bulk grain.  The major improvement is the higher resistance to grain cracking, which is the principal failure mode for solid propellant.  Dani Eder \",\" I don't find this a credible argument, for two reasons.  One you have supplied below: unless I care about entering the USA at any time in the future (eg. the Taiwanese backyard cloners - who BTW have been known to decap custom silicon and reproduce it on daughterboards when pirating high-profit arcade machines and the like - who wouldn't care less), I am not  going to care much about US confidentiality, am I?  Only people like the real me, who does care about travelling to various countries for business reasons, will sit up and follow laws like this, but I would contend that we're not the main threat.  I also have grave doubts whether an algorythm widely distributed in silicon could possibly be called \\\"classified.\\\"  It's like handing out military secrets to the whole world in envelopes marked \\\"don't open me.\\\"  I can imagine several credible defences which could be employed if it came to a trial.  One would be the stupidity of the government's actions.   Amusing thought: could they have employed an algorythm which is infeasable for a fast software implementation, but which is easy in custom hardware? In DES, the extensive use of permutation tables (trivial in hardware: you just swap bus lines), but relatively slow in software have had a big effect on the speed difference between hardware and software implementations of that cipher (indeed, I suspect that Lucifer's designers were well aware that it would be, and approved.)  Certain algorythms (usually parallel search algorythms) can be very slow in software, yet can fly in custom hardware. I have no proof of their employment in Clipper -- it is pure conjecture.   However, as a software implementation of this cipher is something that its  designers would have been trying to avoid at all costs, then the inclusion  of such techniques seems credible.  Hmmm... I also wonder what Intergraph thinks about the use of the name \\\"Clipper\\\" for this device. :) \",\" In case anyone missed it, I'm reposting this and I'm also selling some other stuff.

And, as long as I'm posting (end of car stuff),  o Miscellaneous Darkroom Equipment ........................ $75.00      Solar enlarger (several objective lenses) with easel and       timer, negative carriers for 35mm and 2 1/4 x 3 1/4, misc.      printing masks.  Developing tanks, thermometer, trays,       constant-temperature bath, ground glass, mirrors, darkroom      lamps, glassware, el-cheap-o tripods..... and (as they say)                              MUCH   MORE!   o Beautiful Antique Buffet ............................... $1500.00      Solid cherry (no veneer).  Handmade, with very interesting      dovetail corners in the drawers.  Built (we think) around       1880.  Not gaudy or covered with gew-gaws; a simple, elegant       piece of furniture, but too big (60\\\" long, 37\\\" tall, 24\\\"       deep) for our little Cape Cod house.   Will deliver pricier items (ie, over $10) anywhere in the Rochester  area.  (And will consider delivering the others.)  Will deliver any  of it on UofR Campus between now and graduation.\",\"   --Minnesota definitely deserves an NHL franchise!!!  You'll see the Minnesota Whalers pretty soon, so fear not Minnesota fans.  No Norm Green, 'cept for the team color (sorry, bad pun!)     --What a difference two years makes!  Minnesota finished 29-37-14 in 1992 and made the finals.  They finish with a better record at  38-38-10 thi year and move to Dallas.  Every team in the playoffs has a winning record!!! Finally!!!  It's about time, NHL!!!\",\"I've just managed to get xdm running from an NCR 3000 (an SVR4 486 box running XFree86 1.2) to my NCD XDisplay.  It's pretty much working, but I'm encountering a weird error.  I'm attempting to start an xterm from my .xsession file, but nothing happens.  Redirecting stderr to a file using 'exec 2>$HOME/.xerrors' in .xsession reveals the error message:    \\\"xterm: Error 14, errno 1: Not owner\\\"  Now, if I start xterm from the window manager, or from the command line, it works fine.  And starting other clients, like the window manager (mwm), and a clock, from my .xsession also works.  Anyone encountered this?  Suggestions?  aTdHvAaNnKcSe\",\"      I meant to comment on this at the time.  There's just no way baserunning could be that important - if it was, runs created wouldn't be nearly as accurate as it is.    Runs Created is usually about 90-95% accurate on a team level, and there's a lot more than baserunning that has to account for the remaining percent.\",\"I need information on the Display PostScript strokeadjust feature. This feature adjusts the endpoints of lines so that the displayed line looks better on low resolution devices.  The PostScript literature explains the process to some extent.  They also give an example of how to \\\"emulate\\\" strokeadjust in PostScript environments where it is absent.  The suggested emulation is to modify the coordinates of the endpoints of a line using the following formula for each coordinate:   new_coord = (round (old_coord - 0.25)) + 0.25   Doing this we end up with all coordinates ending in \\\".25\\\".  From reading I thought that what they might actually do is:   new_coord = ((trunc (old_coord * 2)) / 2) + 0.25   This results in all the coordinates ending in either \\\"0.25\\\" or \\\"0.75\\\"  whichever is closer.  By doing some actual comparisons with Display PostScript, I find that neither of these is what DPS really uses.  Since I like how the DPS result looks better than how my stuff looks, I'd like to know if anyone who knows how DPS does it is willing/able to tell me.  Thanks,\",\"  Oh, yeah.  Dave Winfield--marginal player.  Guy didn't hit a lick, had negligible power, was a crap fielder and had no staying power.  Dave Winfield, now entering his (I believe) 20th big league season, is still a damn decent hitter.  Admittedly, his defense has slipped a great deal, but in his prime, he had a powerful arm and great range.  Take a look at the stats:  I don't  know where you even BEGIN to make an argument that Winfield and Kingman are similar players.  Kingman was a one-dimension power hitter--he couldn't field, he ran like an anvil, hit for a low average (though, if I remember right, his OBP wasn't THAT hideous...), and (for those who consider such things important) was a absolute-primo-dick.    Eddie Murray?  Yup, only the best 1st baseman of the 80's.  I know that MVP votes are conducted by mediots, but given that he got jobbed out of the MVP he deserved in 1983, it seems that he wasn't overrated by the media.    Lee Smith?  Hmmmm... This one's actually pretty close.  He's had a s solid, dependable career as a closer despite pitching in some nasty parks  (Wrigley, Fenway...).  I'd have to take a closer look at the stats (it's been  a while), but it seems Lee Arthur is of HOF caliber.    You do make a legitimate point about the HOF credentials of relievers, simply racking up a lot of saves doesn't mean a whole hell of a lot if you  blow a bunch, too.  Simply because Minnesota and Boston and (for a month) Atlanta used Reardon as a closer for longer than he should have been one,  the Equalizer has racked up an impressive number of saves.  No way should  HomerMan be in the HOF, IMHO.  Darrell Evans?  Nice career, actually a bit underrated (kinda like Ted Simmons, IMHO), but not a HOF'er.    Lemme ask you this.  Who the hell playing the game ISN'T marginal?    Now, wait a goddamn minute here.  Ozzie Smith absolutely REDEFINED the position of shortstop.  His defense was SO good that he's won something along the lines of 10 Gold Gloves.  Again, Gold Gloves are mediot-biased, and a  good argument could be made that Larkin deserved one or two of Ozzie's more recent awards, but usually, this is tempered by someone else in the early 80's getting the Gold Gloves Ozzie deserved earlier in his career.  Ozzie's offense, you ask?  Good OBP, great speed numbers, in a park which, for most of his career, depressed offense, admittedly, no power ('cept against Tom Niedenfuer :-|), but still, a definite asset offensively.  Yount?  3,000 hits, MVP at two different positions, uh-huh, a real stiff.  His '82 was one of the great years EVER by a player in recent memory, and probably ranks behind only the peak seasons of Wagner and Banks, as far as SS numbers go.  He's a clear HOF'er, IMHO.    Well, as far as Garvey goes, you're right.  Garvey is a \\\"mediot\\\"  candidate, pushed because of his \\\"winning attitude\\\" (a minor factor, if one at all), and his \\\"great defense\\\" (no errors, admittedly, but the range of a tree stump...).  Garvey shouldn't be in the HOF.  SkyJack?  I've said a lot of nasty things about SkyJack in the last year or so, but this is mostly in response to mediots and woofers who talk about Morris' \\\"ability to win\\\" which is nothing more than Morris' \\\"ability to pitch when Toronto to score tons of runs\\\".  At this point, Morris is an average pitcher (although from his early returns in '93, he may be damned  close to done.).  But, in all fairness, Morris was a dominant pitcher in the 80's for up-and-down Tiger teams.  While 1984 was (obviously) a great year for Detroit, the rest of the decade, the team was generally in contention, but not favorites.  Morris' career numbers are quite good, and worthy of HOF \\\"consideration\\\".    Ryan?  Of course, but be careful.  I guarantee you that someone will throw back your earlier logic about \\\"Yount and Smith being shortstops who  hung around a long time\\\".  After all, Nolan never won a Cy...  Damn, he's  just pitcher who hung around for 99 years...  His W-L record is mediocre... (Of course, Nolan's a HOF'er...)  Puck?  Probably, although he's got to play reasonably well for a few more years (10 years, even good ones, aren't enough to make the HOF, most likely).  That said, I believe Puckett WILL make the HOF, pretty much regardless of how the rest of his career turns out (barring something REALLY  tragic or sudden).  He's very popular in the media and with fans, and legitimately has been one of the best CF's in the game since he joined the league.  I've always liked the guy, and I hope he does make it.  And, in the end, I think the Puck will make it in.  But, really, it's too early to sell.   This debate comes up rather frequently on the net, and, believe it  or not, I never tire of it.  It's an interesting subject.  Here's an off the top of my head list of potential HOF'ers from each team.  I probably left a couple of guys off, so feel free to follow up.  I won't consider ANYONE who started playing after about 1985 (again, too early to tell.) [Note: these are all active players, I'm not counting recent retirees]  Baltimore:  Cal Ripken (should be a lock by now, even if Gehrig's record stands) Boston: Roger Clemens (might be a lock already, which is amazing), Dawson (?) Detroit: Alan Trammell and Lou Whitaker (possibilities) Milwaukee: Robin Yount (discussed earlier) New York: Wade Boggs (possibly), Mattingly (long shot) Toronto: Paul Molitor and Jack Morris (possibilities)  Kansas City: George Brett (lock) Minnesota: Kirby (too early to tell), Winfield (lock) Oakland: Eckersley (lock), McGwire (too early), Rickey (lock), Welch (LONG shot) Texas: The Mighty Nolan [Too early to consider Canseco or Strange :-)]  Cubs: Sandberg (lock) St. Louis: Ozzie (lock), Lee Smith (probably) New York: Murray (almost a lock), Saberhagen (obviously, he's got to regain              past form) [And most certainly, NOT Vince Coleman, despite what he'll tell you :-)]  Los Angeles: Butler, Strawberry, and Hershiser are all long shots. San Diego: Tony Gwynn (pretty good shot) Colorado: Dale Murphy (a good shot), Ryan Bowen (just to see if you're awake)   [Before I get flames: this is an off-the-top-of-the-head list, there's probably a few deserving candidates that I left off, and, I didn't include Barry Bonds, Will Clark, Any Atlanta Starting Pitcher, Frank Thomas, Canseco, McGriff, etc. because I only considered guys who started playing before 1985)]   E-mail or post, I almost fear what I may have started here... \",\" Question: If a team uses 40 players in a season do you merely divide the total +/- by 40?  If so, a player who plays in only 1 game is considered equally valuable as a player who plays in all of them.   Since the standard deviation for each team is different, I am unsure how  \\\"transferable\\\" between teams that these stats are.  Shouldn't the average standard deviation in the league be used?  I am interested in seeing each method. But I still think that mine is the best. If for no other reason than familiarity.\",\" : > Does anyone have any  other suggestions where the 42 came from?  Yep, here's a theory that I once heard bandied around.  Rather than thinking of the number think of the sound. For Tea Two.

Over Easter I increased the memory from 4Meg to 8Meg, and found that POVray reboots the system every time under DOS5.  I had a go at running POVray in a DOS window when running Win3.1 on the same system and it now works fine, even if a lot slower.  I would like to go back to  using POVray directly under DOS, anyone any ideas???  John\",\"      Better yet, instead of thrashing around on the DOS file system, take it a step further.  Write yourself a minimal \\\"file system\\\" program that is used to create/delete files, en/decrypt them to ramdisk, list a directory. Put the util, password protected, on a floppy.     The catch is that the storage space used by this util is NOT part of the DOS file system.  Instead, defrag your disk, thus packing all allocated clusters into clusters 0-n.  Then use the back end of the partition to hold your 'stealth' file system.  Or, leave a small 2nd partition on the disk that is not assigned to DOS.  Another approach might be to use a directory that contains a set of invariant files (DOS system files, for instance).  Due to DOS allocating a minimum storage  unit of a \\\"cluster\\\" there is unused physical space on the disk between the tail end of each file and the end of its associated cluster. These dead spaces could be concatenated and used to hold your stealth file system.     Now you have a situation where no encrypted data \\\"appears\\\" on your disk at all :-). \",\"From what I've seen in my 17 years as an MOA member, most of the folks in the RA are also in the MOA... I guess it's called covering all the bases to get some idea of what is really happening.. How else does one think the RA gets all the juicey news about what's happen' inside the  MOA?\",\"  Just want to back this up with a personal anecdote.  My grandparents have a Navajo rug made in the 1920's, which they received in trade  from the weaver while living in Flagstaff, Arizona.  The decorative motif consists of 4 large black swastikas, one in each corner.  What's more, the color scheme is black, white, and red.  To the casual glance it would undoubtedly appear to be a Nazi relic of some kind.  Yet they owned it ten years before Hitler and the National Socialists came to power.    As I recall, they took it down in the 30's, and didn't feel quite right about putting it back up until the 60's.  It still draws comments from  those who don't know what it is.  --ccm  --  Christopher C. May * U. of Ariz.

Larson's comprehensive            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he            calls the \\\"Reciprocal System\\\", is built on two fundamental            postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of            space and time:                      (1) \\\"The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE            component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE            UNITS, and in two RECIPROCAL forms, SPACE and TIME.\\\"                      (2) \\\"The physical universe conforms to the relations of            ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its magnitudes are            ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN.\\\"                      From these two postulates, Larson developed a COMPLETE            Theoretical Universe, using various combinations of            translational, vibrational, rotational, and vibrational-           rotational MOTIONS, the concepts of IN-ward and OUT-ward            SCALAR MOTIONS, and speeds in relation to the Speed of Light            (which Larson called \\\"UNIT VELOCITY\\\" and \\\"THE NATURAL            DATUM\\\").                        At each step in the development, Larson was able to            MATCH objects in his Theoretical Universe with objects in the            REAL physical universe, (photons, sub-atomic particles            [INCOMPLETE ATOMS], charges, atoms, molecules, globular star            clusters, galaxies, binary star systems, solar systems, white            dwarf stars, pulsars, quasars, ETC.), even objects NOT YET            DISCOVERED THEN (such as EXPLODING GALAXIES, and GAMMA-RAY            BURSTS).                            And applying his Theory to his NEW model of the atom,            Larson was able to precisely and accurately CALCULATE inter-           atomic distances in crystals and molecules, compressibility            and thermal expansion of solids, and other properties of            matter.

Some of the early            books are out of print now, but still available through            inter-library loan.                      \\\"The Structure of the Physical Universe\\\" (1959)                      \\\"The Case AGAINST the Nuclear Atom\\\" (1963)                     \\\"Beyond Newton\\\" (1964)                      \\\"New Light on Space and Time\\\" (1965)                      \\\"Quasars and Pulsars\\\" (1971)                      \\\"NOTHING BUT MOTION\\\" (1979)                      [A $9.50 SUBSTITUTE for the $8.3 BILLION \\\"Super                                                              Collider\\\".]                      [The last four chapters EXPLAIN chemical bonding.]                 \\\"The Neglected Facts of Science\\\" (1982)                       \\\"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\\\" (1984)                     [FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL astrophysical                                                             mysteries.]                        \\\"BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER\\\" (1988)                 All but the last of these books were published by North            Pacific Publishers, P.O. Box 13255, Portland, OR  97213, and            should be available via inter-library loan if your local            university or public library doesn't have each of them.                  Several of them, INCLUDING the last one, are available            from: The International Society of Unified Science (ISUS),            1680 E. Atkin Ave., Salt Lake City, Utah  84106.  This is the            organization that was started to promote Larson's Theory.             They have other related publications, including the quarterly            journal \\\"RECIPROCITY\\\".                         Physicist Dewey B. Larson's Background                     Physicist Dewey B. Larson was a retired Engineer            (Chemical or Electrical).  He was about 91 years old when he            died in May 1989.  He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in            Engineering Science from Oregon State University.  He            developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE            chemical properties based only on the elements used.                      Larson's lack of a fancy \\\"PH.D.\\\" degree might be one            reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is            NOT A VALID REASON.  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider            to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES.  At the same            time, it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX            physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer,            well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC            ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, ETC..                       Larson did NOT have the funds, etc. to experimentally            test his Theory.  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so.             He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER            researchers' experimental and observational data.  And in            many cases, HIS explanation FIT BETTER.                      A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX            physicists and astronomers have!  They CLAIM to be looking            for a \\\"unified field theory\\\" that works, but have been            IGNORING one for over 30 years now!                      \\\"Modern physics\\\" does NOT explain the physical universe            so well.  Some parts of some of Larson's books are FULL of            quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who            agree.  And remember that \\\"epicycles\\\", \\\"crystal spheres\\\",            \\\"geocentricity\\\", \\\"flat earth theory\\\", etc., ALSO once SEEMED            to explain it well, but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG.                           Prof. Frank H. Meyer, Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior,            was/is a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson's Theory, and was (or            still is) President of Larson's organization, \\\"THE            INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE\\\", and Editor of            their quarterly Journal \\\"RECIPROCITY\\\".  He moved to            Minneapolis after retiring.                   \\\"Super Collider\\\" BOONDOGGLE!                           I am AGAINST contruction of the \\\"Superconducting Super            Collider\\\", in Texas or anywhere else.  It would be a GROSS            WASTE of money, and contribute almost NOTHING of \\\"scientific\\\"            value.                      Most physicists don't realize it, but, according to the            comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist            Dewey B. Larson, as described in his books, the strange GOOFY            particles (\\\"mesons\\\", \\\"hyperons\\\", ALLEGED \\\"quarks\\\", etc.)            which they are finding in EXISTING colliders (Fermi Lab,            Cern, etc.) are really just ATOMS of ANTI-MATTER, which are            CREATED by the high-energy colliding beams, and which quickly            disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible            with their environment.                      A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a            few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not            seen there before, and the physicists will be EVEN MORE            CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW!                      Are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $8.3            BILLION cost?!!  Don't we have much more important uses for            this WASTED money?!                            Another thing to consider is that the primary proposed            location in Texas has a serious and growing problem with some            kind of \\\"fire ants\\\" eating the insulation off underground            cables.  How much POISONING of the ground and ground water            with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of            the \\\"Supercollider\\\"?!                                 Naming the \\\"Super Collider\\\" after Ronald Reagon, as            proposed, is TOTALLY ABSURD!  If it is built, it should be            named after a leading particle PHYSICIST.                     LARSONIAN Anti-Matter                           In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe, anti-matter is NOT a simple case of            opposite charges of the same types of particles.  It has more            to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the            photons of which they are made, in relation to the            vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light,            which Larson calls \\\"Unit Velocity\\\" and the \\\"Natural Datum\\\".                       In Larson's Theory, a positron is actually a particle of            MATTER, NOT anti-matter.  When a positron and electron meet,            the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their            respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each            other.                        In Larson's Theory, the ANTI-MATTER half of the physical            universe has THREE dimensions of TIME, and ONLY ONE dimension            of space, and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our            MATERIAL half.                      LARSONIAN Relativity                           The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury            has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the            rate of 574 seconds of arc per century.  531 seconds of this            advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational            perturbations from the other planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter,            etc.).  The remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to            help \\\"prove\\\" Einstein's \\\"General Theory of Relativity\\\".                      But the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieved results            CLOSER to the 43 seconds than \\\"General Relativity\\\" can, by            INSTEAD using \\\"SPECIAL Relativity\\\".  In one or more of his            books, he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH            ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury.                      Larson TOTALLY REJECTED \\\"General Relativity\\\" as another            MATHEMATICAL FANTASY.  He also REJECTED most of \\\"Special            Relativity\\\", including the parts about \\\"mass increases\\\" near            the speed of light, and the use of the Lorentz Transform on            doppler shifts, (Those quasars with red-shifts greater than            1.000 REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT,            although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME.).                       In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe, there are THREE dimensions of time instead            of only one.  But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured            from our material half of the physical universe.  The one            dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time.  At low            relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are            NEGLIGIBLE; but at high speeds, they become significant, and            the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR.            [Larson often used the term \\\"COORDINATE TIME\\\" when writing            about this.]                            In regard to \\\"mass increases\\\", it has been PROVEN in            atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near            the speed of light.  But the formula for acceleration is            ACCELERATION = FORCE / MASS, (a = F/m).  Orthodox physicists            are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR: FORCE.  In Larson's Theory,            mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero.  FORCE is            actually a MOTION, or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS, or RELATIONS            BETWEEN MOTIONS, including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS.             The expansion of the universe, for example, is an OUTward            SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of            the so-called \\\"Big Bang\\\" (which is yet another MATHEMATICAL            FANTASY).                                                                 THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION                 I wish to recommend to EVERYONE the book \\\"THE UNIVERSE            OF MOTION\\\", by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North Pacific            Publishers, (P.O. Box 13255, Portland, Oregon  97213), 456            pages, indexed, hardcover.                      It contains the Astrophysical portions of a GENERAL            UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by that            author, an UNrecognized GENIUS, more than thirty years ago.                      It contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL Astrophysical            mysteries, including the FORMATION of galaxies, binary and            multiple star systems, and solar systems, the TRUE ORIGIN of            the \\\"3-degree\\\" background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma-           ray bursts, and the TRUE NATURE of quasars, pulsars, white            dwarfs, exploding galaxies, etc..                      It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL            looking for, if they are ready to seriously consider it with            OPEN MINDS!                      The following is an example of his Theory's success:            In his first book in 1959, \\\"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL            UNIVERSE\\\", Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING            GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding            them.  They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson's            comprehensive Theory.  And when QUASARS were discovered, he            had an immediate related explanation for them also.                    GAMMA-RAY BURSTS                 Astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching            their heads about the mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS.  They were            originally thought to originate from \\\"neutron stars\\\" in the            disc of our galaxy.  But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in            Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions            uniformly, and their source locations in space do NOT            correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of            directional coincidence).                      Gamma-ray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by            the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson.  According to page 386 of            his book \\\"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\\\", published in 1984, the            gamma-ray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the            ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls            the \\\"Cosmic Sector\\\".  Because of the relationship between the            anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and            the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can            pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at            random.  (This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do            not correspond with known objects, and come from all            directions uniformly.)                      I wonder how close to us in space a source location            would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most            life on Earth!  There would be NO WAY to predict one, NOR to            stop it!                      Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past, which            are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were            actually caused by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS!                   LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation                           About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the            vicinity of the sun are binary or double.  But orthodox            astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory            theory about how they form or why there are so many of them.                      But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY            CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of            the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey            B. Larson.                      I will try to summarize Larsons explanation, which is            detailed in Chapter 7 of his book \\\"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\\\"            and in some of his other books.                      First of all, according to Larson, stars do NOT generate            energy by \\\"fusion\\\".  A small fraction comes from slow            gravitational collapse.  The rest results from the COMPLETE            ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements (heavier than IRON).  Each            element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT.  The heavier the            element is, the lower is this limit.  A star's internal            temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and            absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually            reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and            lighter elements.                      When the internal temperature of the star reaches the            destructive temperature limit of IRON, there is a Type I            SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION!  This is because there is SO MUCH iron            present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms            and the atom building process, which Larson explains in some            of his books [better than I can].                      When the star explodes, the lighter material on the            outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less            than the speed of light.  The heavier material in the center            portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to            the speed of light, because of the high temperature.  The            explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light, and            it expands OUTWARD IN TIME, which is equivalent to INWARD IN            SPACE, and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while.                      Over long periods of time, both masses start to fall            back gravitationally.  The material that had been blown            outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star.  The            material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a            WHITE DWARF star.  BOTH stars then start moving back toward            the \\\"MAIN SEQUENCE\\\" from opposite directions on the H-R            Diagram.                      The chances of the two masses falling back into the            exact same location in space, making a single lone star            again, are near zero.  They will instead form a BINARY            system, orbiting each other.                       According to Larson, a white dwarf star has an INVERSE            DENSITY GRADIENT (is densest at its SURFACE), because the            material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown            outward) in time.   This ELIMINATES the need to resort to            MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about \\\"degenerate matter\\\", \\\"neutron            stars\\\", \\\"black holes\\\", etc..                   LARSONIAN Solar System Formation                 If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the            exploding star is relatively SMALL, then, instead of a single            white dwarf star, there will be SEVERAL \\\"mini\\\" white dwarf            stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably            still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affected            by its heat, etc.).  These will become PLANETS!                        In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, Larson used all            this information, and other principles of his comprehensive            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, to derive            his own version of Bode's Law.                         \\\"Black Hole\\\" FANTASY!                 I heard that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently            completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO \\\"black            holes\\\" merging together into a SINGLE \\\"black hole\\\", and            concluded that the new \\\"black hole\\\" would have MORE MASS than            the sum of the two original \\\"black holes\\\".                      Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED            FLAG, causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of \\\"black            holes\\\", etc.!                      After reading Physicist Dewey B. Larson's books about            his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe, especially his book \\\"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\\\", it is            clear to me that \\\"black holes\\\" are NOTHING more than            MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES!  The strange object at Cygnus X-1 is            just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR, NOT the \\\"black            hole\\\" that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want            to \\\"prove\\\" their theory.                           By the way, I do NOT understand why so much publicity is            being given to physicist Stephen Hawking.  The physicists and            astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawking's severe physical            problem somehow makes him \\\"wiser\\\".  It does NOT!                      I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist            Dewey B. Larson while he was still alive.  Widespread            publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson's            Theory, books, and organization (The International Society of            Unified Science).                                             ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION                 I heard of that concept many years ago, in connection            with UFO's and unorthodox inventors, but I never was able to            find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed.                      I found a possible clue about why they might work on            pages 112-113 of the book \\\"BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER\\\", by            the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson, which describes part of            Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe.  I quote one paragraph:                      \\\"As indicated in the preceding chapter, the development            of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally            different concept of the nature of electrical resistance.             The electrons, we find, are derived from the environment.  It            was brought out in Volume I [Larson's book \\\"NOTHING BUT            MOTION\\\"] that there are physical processes in operation which            produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that,            although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in            many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities            for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are            limited.  It follows that there is always a large excess of            free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the            universe, most of which are uncharged.  In this uncharged            state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension            space, because they are inherently rotating units of space,            and the relation of space to space is not motion.  In open            space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently            in the same location with respect to the natural reference            system, in the manner of a photon.  In the context of the            stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron,            like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by            the progression of the natural reference system.  All            material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons            similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation.             Meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later,            whereby electrons are returned to the environment.  The            electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth            therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level.\\\"                            Note that in Larson's Theory, UNcharged electrons are            also massLESS, and are basically photons of light of a            particular frequency (above the \\\"unit\\\" frequency) spinning            around one axis at a particular rate (below the \\\"unit\\\" rate).             (\\\"Unit velocity\\\" is the speed of light, and there are            vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light,            according to Larson's Theory.)  [I might have the \\\"above\\\" and            \\\"below\\\" labels mixed up.]                      Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass-           LESS UN-charged electrons flying around at the speed of            light!                      If this is true, then the ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION            fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these            electrons, or other particles in space, perhaps GIVING them a            charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to            achieve propulsion. (In Larson's Theory, an electrical charge            is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular            frequency (above the \\\"unit\\\" frequency) superimposed on the            rotation of the particle.)                        The paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to            confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is            generated in clouds.               SUPPRESSION of LARSONIAN Physics                 The comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson has            been available for more than 30 YEARS, published in 1959 in            his first book \\\"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE\\\".                      It is TOTALLY UN-SCIENTIFIC for Hawking, Wheeler, Sagan,            and the other SACRED PRIESTS of the RELIGION they call            \\\"science\\\" (or \\\"physics\\\", or \\\"astronomy\\\", etc.), as well as            the \\\"scientific\\\" literature and the \\\"education\\\" systems, to            TOTALLY IGNORE Larson's Theory has they have.                      Larson's Theory has excellent explanations for many            things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers, such            as gamma-ray bursts and the nature of quasars.                      Larson's Theory deserves to be HONESTLY and OPENLY            discussed in the physics, chemistry, and astronomy journals,            in the U.S. and elsewhere.  And at least the basic principles            of Larson's Theory should be included in all related courses            at UW-EC, UW-Madison, Cambridge, Cornell University, and            elsewhere, so that students are not kept in the dark about a            worthy alternative to the DOGMA they are being fed.

It's a sports fans dream (especially if that person is from NY and wants to hear about his teams while he's away at school). As for Lupica & Berman, it's turned out to be Lupica, then Berman. Neither of them wanted to work a full four hour show, so Ed Coleman and Dave Sims' old four-hour slot was broken down into two seperate two-hour show - Lupica from 10-12, and Berman from 12-2. And they both happen to suck in comparison to Eddie and Dave.  COME BACK, GUYS!   Like I said, I live in Philly, so I can hear FAN and/or WIP whenever I want. But I cannot stand WIP. And it isn't because I loathe the Philly sports teams - the Phillies are my favorite NL team (Yanks are favorite AL), and the Eagles aren't too bad either. There are two big problems:   1)Total emphasis on the home teams, especially the Eagles. Unlike    the FAN hosts, who can at least answer a question about an    out-of-town team if a caller asks, the WIP hosts seem     to have no clue about any team that doesn't play on    Broad Street. Also, FANs periodic sports updates (every 20    minutes) gives sports news and scores from around the    country. It's very rare to hear an out-of-town score    being reported on WIP.   2)The hosts. With the exception of Jody MacDonald, who I miss    from his days at FAN, none of the hosts really seems to have    both a broad knowledge of the sport or a good on-air presence.    The worst is Gary Cobb, who seems to have been hired solely    on the basis that he used to play for the Eagles.  Anyway, that's my two cents on the whole FAN vs WIP battle.\",\"   The newspaper itself is almost certainly copyrighted in its entirety.

Syria and Lebanon have a right to determine if they wish to return to the situation prior to the French invasion where they were both part of the same \\\"mandate territory\\\" - read colony.  Israel has no right to determine what happens in Lebanon. Invading another country because you consider them a threat is precisely the way that almost all wars of aggression have started.    Again territorial expansion by force.    The UN defines them as occupied. They are recognised as such by every nation on earth (excluding one small caribean island).    So the Adam thinks that peace is possible with continued occupation and  a continued military presence? That is a completely unsustainable situation because the USA is bankrupt and simply cannot afford to finance the Israeli ecconomy any more. There is no money for such an occupation.    They were moved in as part of a deliberate policy to prevent the return of the occupied territories. Machiavelli described the reasoning in the Prince. The clear intention was to create a constituency which the Likud beleived could not be deprived of the land stolen from the indigenous population.  The pretexts under which the settlers aquired land was through the  redefinition of much land used in common as \\\"public land\\\". The assertion that the village common on which the village depends for food belongs to an invader simply because no individual has title is clearly an excuse. When the land is used to build a condominium for aliens brought in to occupy the land for a foreign power there is a clear breach of the Geneva convention which stipulates that land use in occupied territories must not be changed.   No amount of self justifying on the part of Likud and hard linner appologists will change the fact that the majority of world governments, and all of those that actually have any power have condemned this practice.    Theyu also are a liability. We are talking about civilian encampments that would last no more than hours against tanks,   Don't fool yourself. It was the gulf war that brought the Israelis to the negotiating table. Once their US backers had a secure base in the gulf they insrtructed Shamir to negotiate or else.  If the creation of settlements had gone on any longer the USA would have cut the money supply.   Not at all. They can chose to live in an arab state or return to Israel.   The existence of a comunity does not give the right for another country to annexe territory, not in Bosnia, not in the West Bank.   Unless the new boundaries drawn up are those of 48 there will be no peace. Araffat has precious little authority to agree to anything else.   The real issue is not the land treaty but the trade treaty. Since the Palestinians will remain heavily dependent on Israel indefinitely it is this that will be the guarantor of peace. another factor will be the return of lands confiscated by the Israeli state within Israel and the dismantling of the shadow structures which allow discrimination against non-Jews within what is nominaly a secular state.   The irony is that in return for a guarantee that the palestinian state has a non descrimination law in order to protect the remaining settlers the Israeli state is going to be forced inot the same position. This will mean outlawing of discrimination such as that which prevents arabs from buying or using much of the land.   \",\"   \\\"Thinking if I could see, I would believe.

Features:     Client-Server based model, using Berkeley Sockets.    No limit to the number of users (apart from performance).    Generic clients.    Customizable servers.    Hierachical Objects (allowing attachment of cameras and light sources).    Multiple light sources (ambient, point and spot).    Objects can have extension code, to handle unique functionality, easily         attached.  Functionality:    Client:    The client is built around a 'fast' render loop. Basically it changes things    when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user's    viewpoint. It also provides the server with information about the user's    actions - which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to    other users.     The client is designed to be generic - in other words you don't need to    develop a new client when you want to enter a new world. This means that    resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting    it. The adaptations, as will be explained in a moment, occur in the servers.     This release of the client software supports the following functionality:      o Hierarchical Objects (with associated addressing)      o Multiple Light Sources and Types (Ambient, Point and Spot)      o User Interface Panels      o Colour Polygonal Rendering with Phong Shading (optional wireframe for  faster frame rates)      o Mouse and Keyboard Input     (Some people may be disappointed that this software doesn't support the    PowerGlove as an input device - this is not because it can't, but because    I don't have one! This will, however, be one of the first enhancements!)    Server(s):    This is where customization can take place. The following basic support is    provided in this release for potential world server developers:      o Transparent Client Management      o Client Message Handling     This may not sound like much, but it takes away the headache of accepting and    terminating clients and receiving messages from them - the application writer    can work with the assumption that things are happening locally.     Things get more interesting in the object extension functionality. This is    what is provided to allow you to animate your objects:      o Server Selectable Extension Installation:         What this means is that you can decide which objects have extended         functionality in your world. Basically you call the extension         initialisers you want.      o Event Handler Registration:         When you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback         functions for the events that you want the object to respond to.         (Current events supported: INIT, MOVE, CHANGE, COLLIDE & TERMINATE)      o Collision Detection Registration:         If you want your object to respond to collision events just provide         some basic information to the collision detection management software.         Your callback will be activated when a collision occurs.      This software is kept separate from the worldServer applications because     the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects     from which to choose.      The following is all you need to make a World Server application:      o Provide an initWorld function:         This is where you choose what object extensions will be supported, plus         any initialization you want to do.      o Provide a positionObject function:         This is where you determine where to place a new client.      o Provide an installWorldObjects function:         This is where you load the world (.wld) file for a new client.      o Provide a getWorldType function:         This is where you tell a new client what persona they should have.      o Provide an animateWorld function:         This is where you can go wild! At a minimum you should let the objects         move (by calling a move function) and let the server sleep for a bit         (to avoid outrunning the clients).      That's all there is to it! And to prove it here are the line counts for the     three world servers I've provided:          generic - 81 lines         dactyl - 270 lines (more complicated collision detection due to the                            stairs! Will probably be improved with future                            versions)         dogfight - 72 lines  Location:     This software is located at the following site:    ftp.u.washington.edu     Directory:    pub/virtual-worlds     File:    multiverse-1.0.2.tar.Z  Futures:     Client:      o Texture mapping.      o More realistic rendering: i.e. Z-Buffering (or similar), Gouraud shading      o HMD support.      o Etc, etc....     Server:      o Physical Modelling (gravity, friction etc).      o Enhanced Object Management/Interaction      o Etc, etc....     Both:      o Improved Comms!!!  I hope this provides people with a good understanding of the Multiverse software, unfortunately it comes with practically zero documentation, and I'm not sure whether that will ever be able to be rectified! :-(  I hope people enjoy this software and that it is useful in our explorations of the Virtual Universe - I've certainly found fascinating developing it, and I would *LOVE* to add support for the PowerGlove...and an HMD :-)!!

On the other hand, I don't see \\\"Clipper\\\" as providing  a secure channel--it just prevents casual eavesdropping.  This is part of why  I am not worried about it per se.  Trying to look at Clipper as a serious  security tool is simply ludicrous.  It's a voice scrambler, nothing more.  There is still plenty of market for real crypto.   They cost an arm and a leg, though. \\\"Clipper\\\" is obviously aimed at the mass  market.  It certainly won't put Cylink out of business.   This is old news.  I can do this now.   There ARE restrictions.  Example: We're a networking software vendor with a  large overseas share of our market.  We cannot currently ship PEM, or even  simple DES, in our products without case-by-case approval from the Department  of State.  ITAR presents a material trade barrier to US firms trying to  compete in international information systems markets.  Sure, you can use whatever freebie software you want to talk over BBS's in  the USA.  I, on the other hand, want strong crypto (PKCS, for example) to be  the *default* for electronic mail, worldwide.  I want priests to be able to  hear confession over email.  I want lawyers to be able to talk to clients in  confidence over email, or doctors talk with patients.  I want to be able to  order products from my favorite Japanese mail-order catalog over the net.  I  want to be able to sign contracts, transact business, and so on  electronically.  This is so far infeasible as a result of the current restrictions on  crytographic systems, especially beyond the borders of the USA.  Clipper is irrelevant, and if it distracts the authorities into feeling safe,  all the better.  Its only danger is if it emboldens them into trying to put  more restrictions into place, on the theory that it is \\\"good enough for  anyone who has nothing to hide.\\\"  That argument is, of course, utter BS, just  as much as \\\"no one needs an assault rifle\\\". \",\"Look in the /pub/SPACE directory on ames.arc.nasa.gov - there are a number of earth images there.

The initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.  For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.  Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.  A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" has been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new, relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today.  This new technology will help companies protect proprietary information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals.   A \\\"key-escrow\\\" system will be established to ensure that the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique                                   2   \\\"keys,\\\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately in two \\\"key-escrow\\\" data bases that will be established by the Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap.  The \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans.  To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings.  The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield criminals and terrorists.  We need the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" and other approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system), the President has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:       --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to           employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;       --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone           calls and data, under proper court or other legal           order, when necessary to protect our citizens;       --   the effective and timely use of the most modern           technology to build the National Information           Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and           the competitiveness of American industry in the global           marketplace; and        --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export           high technology products.  The President has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.                                    3  The Administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a National Information Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks (\\\"information superhighways\\\") will transmit video, images, HDTV programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone system transmits voice.  Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law.  Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet.  The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available.

A:   No.  \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with      no new authorities to access the content of the private      conversations of Americans.  Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on      a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation      encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to      decipher the message?  A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a      court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They      would then present documentation of this authorization to      the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and      obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug      smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are      stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key      escrow system.  Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?  A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent      entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the      Administration have yet to determine which agencies will      oversee the key-escrow data banks.  Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure      how strong the security is?    A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption      systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will      remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow      system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of      cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all      potential users that there are no unrecognized      vulnerabilities.  Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?  A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the      Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in      this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the      President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet      officials.  Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?  A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on      encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify      as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have      briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the      decisions related to this initiative.  Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?  A:   The government designed and developed the key access      encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the      microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product      manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip      manufacturer that produces them.  Q:   Who provides the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\"?  A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,      California, and will sell the chip to encryption device      manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed      to other vendors in the future.  Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices?   A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating      the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" into their devices.       Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological      solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be      willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more      powerful encryption devices?  A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be      considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow      mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product      that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive      than others readily available today, but it is just one      piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to      encryption technology, which the Administration is      developing.       The Administration is not saying, \\\"since encryption      threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,      we will prohibit it outright\\\" (as some countries have      effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \\\"every      American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an      unbreakable commercial encryption product.\\\"  There is a      false \\\"tension\\\" created in the assessment that this issue is      an \\\"either-or\\\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,      and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,      balanced approach such as is proposed with the \\\"Clipper      Chip\\\" and similar encryption techniques.  Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton      Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from      that of the Bush Administration?    A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption      technology in telecommunications and computing and are      committed to working with industry and public-interest      groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'      privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law      enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime      and terrorism.  Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use      the government hardware?\",\" \",\"  [ etc. ]  Hey, he's the only manager so far to lead the Seattle Mariners to a  winning season, out of, what, fifteen?

This is especially likely to happen when  they start off with feelings of attraction.    When people feel attracted those feelings can cloud their judgement.   I've had the experience of going quickly from believing that I shouldn't  date non-Christians to believing that dating this man would be okay to  believing that premarital sex is fine when people really love each  other.  When the relationship ended my beliefs immediately returned to  their original state.    This is an especially extreme case because I was young and away from home  and fellowship.  I don't think it would work exactly this way for most  people.  However, it's important not to underestimate the power of  feelings of attraction.  \",\"FOR SALE(of course)  Linear Power model 952 IQ          2 channel automotive stereo amplifier         95 watts peak per channel         2 ohm stable         fidelity tested   $100 You pay shipping  1 Pair (two (2)) Mobile Authority woofers         10 inch         2 inch voice coil         20 oz magnet         130 watt peak power handeling         4 ohms    $40 for both, you pay shipping (will not sell seperatly)  reply thru e-mail to:  Karl R.

How does one tell if a Second Coming is the real thing, unless the person claiming to be IT is obviously insane?  I'm not saying that David Koresh is the Second Coming of Christ.  How could somebody who breaks his word be the Second Coming?  Koresh did promise that he would come out of his compound if only he was allowed to give a radio broadcast.  He didn't.  Still it seems to me that he did fool some people.  And, from my meagre knowledge of the Bible, it seems that Christians have been hard on the Jews of Christ's day for being cautious about accepting somebody that their religious authorities didn't accept as the Messiah.  So I was surprised that nobody had discussed the difficulty of wanting to be early to recognize the Second Coming while, at the same time, not wanting to be credulously believing just anybody who claims to be God.  [Mark 13:21   And then if any one says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!'  or 'Look, there he is!' do not believe it.  Mark 13:22   False Christs and false prophets will arise and show signs and  wonders, to lead astray, if possible, the elect.  Mark 13:23   But take heed; I have told you all things beforehand.  Mark 13:24    \\\"But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun will be  darkened, and the moon will not give its light,  Mark 13:25   and the stars will be falling from heaven, and the powers in  the heavens will be shaken.  Mark 13:26   And then they will see the Son of man coming in clouds with  great power and glory.   My understanding of Jesus' answer is that, unlike his first coming, which was veiled, the second coming will be quite unmistakeable.  He's telling us not to be misled by the other things that have to happen before his second coming -- the actual second coming will make his power openly visible.  By the way, from Koresh's public statement it's not so clear to me that he is claiming to be Christ.\",\" Hi!

There is a _massively_ longer tradition for proclaiming the Passion accounts without active participation.  If you know the Latin, one really beautiful way to hear the Passion is it's being chanted by three deacons:  the Narrator chants in the middle baritone range, Jesus chants in the bass, and others directly quoted are handled by a high tenor. This is actually the basis for the common proclamation of the Passion that John would prefer.  But there is always a judgement call based on pastoral considerations. Each pastor makes his own decisions (it isn't a church-wide conspiracy against participation).  The Palm Sunday liturgy, with its initial blessing and distribution of the palms and procession, is already getting long before you get to the Passion; some pastors feel that they should not make the people stand through that long narrative.  Also, the orchestrated proclamation with multiple readers and public participation in the crowd quotations runs longer than the single-reader proclamation --- in churches with multiple Masses for the Sunday, it might be necessary to go with the briefer options just to \\\"get 'em in and get 'em out\\\".  Each parish is different.  Catholics are no longer canonically tied to their geographic parishes.  It is possible that another Catholic parish in the Columbus area (based on the Ohio State address) has a liturgy closer to your preferences.  Or talk to some of your fellow parishioners and see how common your preferences are --- pastors generally ARE willing to listen to non-confrontational requests.  Though you probably should bring along a paramedic in case he reacts too strongly to the shock of people asked for a _longer_ Sunday Mass.  Perhaps the problem is that recent liturgical development hasn't follow the continuous evolution model (the accumulation of small changes, no single one of which is too hard to take) but rather the punctuated equilibrium model (things stay the same and we get accustomed to them, then the marked mutation hits).  {My apologies if I am mis-remembering the names of the evolutionary theories.}\",\"JL> From: jlecher@pbs.org JL> > I would not classify a mild headache that was continuous for weeks JL> > as migraine, even if the other typical features were there (e.g., JL> > unilateral, nausea and vomiting, photophobia).

Last year I won the pennant due primarily to the fact that I had terrible pitching.  I would like to lower my batting average which is rather high because I do have Jose Offerman (who made up for this by helping me lock first place in errors).  Anyway, someone offered:  Andres Gallaraga for Bud Black  I can afford to give up Bud Black because I still have Kyle Abbott. However, I am afraid of Andres actually doing well this season. Should I make the trade or not?  Your comments will be appreciated.  --  Warren Usui\",\"  I think you missed one of my points there.  It takes *more* than a great GM to win a stanley cup, even once.  Some of the guys on the list you gave earlier never won one.  I agree that you and I could probably argue back and forth for days to no avail about who is the best GM in hockey- that is a matter of opinion, and who is to say my opinion is any better  than yours or yours than mine?  But the point of my *original* original post (if not well stated) was that Murray has the GM abilities but not the coaching abilities.  Which leads to below:   I think at this point there's a personal, emotional element involved here which transcends Murray's logical thought.  As outsiders, it's fine for  us to say, \\\"He should hire a different coach.\\\"  In fact, he has talked about doing so in the past.  But, the press (here in Detroit, at least) has so built up this business about Murray never getting past the second round of the playoffs as a coach, that I think he has taken it upon himself to  prove to the world that he *is* capable of coaching a team past the second round.  He needs to, as the papers say, \\\"get that monkey off his back.\\\" So it becomes a matter not of intelligence, but of pride.  Is it foolish to let pride stand in the way of sound logic?  Perhaps, but we're all a little that way from time to time.  I think eventually he'll step down from behind the bench and concentrate on his GM duties, and the team will improve as a result.  I think his coaching duties take away time he might have otherwise spent on GM work.  In that sense, once he steps down as coach, we'll see how good of a GM he really is.   I may not agree with everything you've said, but it's been fun discussing it with you. \",\" I think one (not ideal) solution is to use the tracing utility (can't remember the name, sorry!) included in the Corel Draw s/w pack.  It can convert bitmaps to Corel art format.  These can then be imported into a drawing rather than the bitmap. Result - the file is completely in Corel format and can be SCODAL'ed no problem!  BUT the slight problem with this, which makes the solution less than idea, is that the trace utility spits out many more points than are necessary to define the shapes being traced.  Straight lines and curves are both traced as many short segments.  So... the SCODAL taking *much* longer to image.  The obvious solution is time-consuming - stripping out the extra points by hand using Corel.  OUCH! I've done it a few times :-]                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  As I say, if you don't mind the problems, go via the route... BITMAP -> COREL (VIA TRACE) -> HAND TRIMMING (USING COREL)!!! -> COMBINE WITH MAIN COREL PIC (VIA IMPORT) -> SCODAL\",\"  Yes, I have!  Wasn't there a case of a single lion ruling all the land from South Africa up to Egypt across to the congo?  If my memory serves me correctly there was enough game to feed some 100,000 or more lions but he wouldn't let the other lions hunt as he wanted it all himself.  He died of a heart attack brought on by being overweight.  Good thing too as he had designs on Europe, America (north and south), and the Falkland Islands.   \",\" True.  At first, the news media seemed entranced by all the new gizmos the military was using, not to mention the taped video transmissions from the missiles as they zeroed in on their targets.  But later, and especially after the bunker full of civilians was hit, they changed their tone.  It seemed to me that they didn't have the stomach for the reality of war, that innocent people really do die and are maimed in warfare.  It's like they were only pro-Gulf-War as long as it was \\\"nice and clean\\\" (smart missiles dropping in on military HQs), but not when pictures of dead, dying, and maimed civilians started cropping up.  What naive hypocrites!   [ discussion about blanket-bombing and A-bombs deleted.]                             ^^^^^^^^^  I should have said here \\\"militarily justified\\\".  It seems from your comments below that you understood this as meaning \\\"morally justified\\\". I apologize.   I have often wondered about this.  I've always thought that the first bomb should have been dropped on Japan's island fortress of Truk.  A good, inpenatrable military target.  The second bomb could've been held back for use on an industrial center if need be.  But I digress.  Yes, I have heard that we found evidence (after the war, BTW) that Japan was seriously considering surrender after the first bomb.  Unfortunately, the military junta won out over the moderates and rejected the US's ulimatum.  Therefore the second bomb was dropped.  Most unfortunate, IMO.   I don't regret the fact that sometimes military decisions have to be made which affect the lives of innocent people.  But I do regret the  circumstances which make those decisions necessary, and I regret the suffering caused by those decisions.    [...]   Actually, it was the fact that both situations existed that prompted US and allied action.  If some back-water country took over some other back-water country, we probably wouldn't intervene.  Not that we don't care, but we can't be the world's policman.  Or if a coup had occured in Kuwait (instead of an invasion), then we still wouldn't have acted because there would not have been the imminent danger perceived to Saudi Arabia.  But the combination of the two, an unprovoked invasion by a genocidal tyrant AND the potential danger to the West's oil  interests, caused us to take action.   [...]  I'm not setting up a strawman at all.  If you want to argue against the war, then the only logical alternative was to allow Hussein to keep Kuwait.  Diplomatic alternatives, including sanctions, were ineffective.  Well, in a sense, yes.  They probably had no idea of what end Hitler would lead their nation to.   They suffered along with the rest.  Why does this bother you so much? The world is full of evil, and circumstances are not perfect.  Many innocents suffer due to the wrongful actions of others.  It it regretable, but that's The-Way-It-Is.  There are no perfect solutions.  [...]  Probably because we're not the saviors of the world.  We can't police each and every country that decides to self-destruct or invade another.  Nor are we in a strategic position to get relief to Tibet, East Timor, or some other places.  Tell me how we could stop them and I'll support it.  I, for one, do not agree with the present US policy of \\\"sucking up to them\\\" as you put it. I agree that it is deplorable.   Are they?  Or are they supposed to reflect the population of the locale where the trial is held?  (Normally this is where the crime is committed unless one party or the other can convince the judge a change of venue is in order.)  I'm not an expert on California law, or even US law, but it seems that this is the way the system is set up.  You can criticize the system, but let's not have unfounded allegations of racial  prejudice thrown around.   No, not at all.  The point is that the fact that there were no blacks on the first jury and that Rodney King is black is totally irrelevant.   Germans, perhaps.  \\\"Peers\\\" doesn't mean \\\"those who do the same thing\\\", like having murderers judge murderers.  It means \\\"having people from the same station in life\\\", presumably because they are in a better position to understand the defendent's motivation(s).   OK, granted.  However, you are using this reasoning as part of *your* logical argument in this discussion.  This is not a court of law.  The media is not totally monolithic.  Even though there is a prevailing liberal bias, programs such as the MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour try to give a balanced and fair reporting of the news.  There are even conservative sources out there if you know where to look.  (Hurrah for Rush!)  BTW, I never used the word \\\"conspiracy\\\".  I don't accept (without *far* more evidence) theories that there is some all-pervading liberal conspiracy attempting to take over all news sources.   Hardly.  I didn't say that it's a Good Thing [tm] to kill innocent people if the end is just.  Unfortunately, we don't live in a perfect world and there are no perfect solutions.  If one is going to  resist tyranny, then innocent people on both sides are going to suffer and die.  I didn't say it is OK -- it is unfortunate, but sometimes necessary.   I would agree that it was evil in the sense that it caused much pain and suffering.  I'm not so sure that it was unnecessary as you say.  That conclusion can only be arrived at by evaluating all the factors involved. And perhaps it *was* unnecessary as (let's say) we now know.  That doesn't mean that those who had to make the decision to bomb didn't see it as being necessary.  Rarely can one have full known of the consequences of an action before making a decision.  At the time it may have seemed necessary enough to go ahead with it.  But don't assume that I feel the bombing was *morally* justified -- I don't!  I just don't condemn those who had to make a difficult decision under difficult circumstances.   You certainly are not in such a position if you are a moral relativist. I, as an absolutist, am in a position to judge, but I defer judgment.   Wrong.  They were neither moral then nor now.  They seemed necessary to those making the decisions to bring a quick end to the war.  I simply refuse to condemn them for their decision.  One day I will stand before Jesus and give account of every word and action; even this discourse in this forum.  I understand the full ramifications of that, and I am prepared to do so.  I don't believe that you can make the same claim.   And BTW, the reason I brought up the blanket-bombing in Germany was because you were bemoaning the Iraqi civilian casualties as being  \\\"so deplorable\\\".  Yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombing wasn't accurate enough to hit industrial/military targets in a decisive way by any other method at that time.  But in the Gulf War, precision bombing was the norm.  So the point was, why make a big stink about the relatively few civilian casualties that resulted *in spite of* precision bombing, when so many more civilians (proportionately and quantitatively) died under the blanket bombing in WW2?  Even with precision bombing, mistakes happen and some civilians suffer.  But less civilians suffered in this war than any other iany other in history!  Many Iraqi civilians went about their lives with minimal interference from the allied air raids.  The stories of \\\"hundreds of thousands\\\" of Iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk. Yes, bunk.  The US lost 230,000 servicemen in WW2 over four years and the majority of them were directly involved in fighting!  But  we are expected to swallow that \\\"hundreds of thousands\\\" of  *civilian* Iraqis died in a war lasting about 2 months!  And with  the Allies using the most precise bombs ever created at that!   What hogwash.  If \\\"hundreds of thousands\\\" of Iraqi civilians died,  it was due to actions Hussein took on his own people, not due to  the Allied bombing.

It is good to hear that there are a few reasonable Christians about. If only those christian \\\"scientists\\\" would take note.  (In Australia there is a very strong movement, a bunch of christian  scientists who believe that every single event in the bible is exactly true, and that there is a rational explanation for it all that can be justified by using the laws of physics.  For example, there are a few chaps who are  trying to prove that the age of the universe is 6000 years old, and that the error in conventional calculations is the result of the fact that the speed  light has been rapidly decaying over the years, and this has not been  accounted for. :-] )   Or (of course), that he never existed, and the bible was a story, and was never  intended to become a manifesto for a billion people.  Did Tony follow that one up?   Millions of people have \\\"died for a lie\\\".  This  point is difficult to  substantiate since it is not well defined (a great many religious arguments work in that way), but consider the many Aztec warriors who sacrificed  themselves to their gods in the belief that this act would bring them victory of the Spanish invaders.  The list is endless.  The Aztecs lost, BTW.     That is perfectly reasonable, but it is not grounds for me (or anyone) to become a christian.  More to the point, it does not add weight to the claim that Jesus was the \\\"real thing\\\".    Have you ever seen a documentary about the rise of Nazi Germany?  More to the point, did Tony mention this?  One could hardly call Werner Heisenberg and his many colleagues  fools, or  illogical men, their support of Hitler was based  (I presume) upon an emotional issue rather than a rational agreement with  his principles.  Obviously my argument is invalid if Tony thought that Hitler was sane....      Hmmm.... I don't think his arguments warrant the use of a \\\"Therefore...\\\"   This is (unfortunately) what alot of religious discussions I have had with people result in - quoting the bible.  The only reasonable way I think people can look at the bible is to treat the stories as some sort of metaphorical representation of the messages that the authors were trying to present.  If someone tries to interpret parts of the bible literally, he or she will end up in all sorts of shit.     Tony's argument would be perfectly reasonable for people who believe the events described in the bible took place, but to convince someone,  who thinks the bible is total fiction, that Jesus is real by quoting the book is totally pointless.  For example, in mathematics you cannot say \\\"a is equal to b because a is equal to b\\\".       That would possibly explain why there have so many people being killed  in religious wars, and why there are hundreds of different versions all claiming to be correct.    It   I think if you posted this part to alt.religion you would get more flames than here :-).  I have never really understood why the emotional sentiments of a stranger should be of interest to other people.

If you have an obvious hernia sac coming down  into your scrotum, or a bulge in your groin that is brought about by increasing intra-abdominal pressure.... Sometimes is not that obvious. The hernia is small and you can only  detect it by putting your finger into the inguinal canal.  Whether you have a recurrent hernia, or this is related to the previous operation, I can't tell you. The person that examined you is in  the best position to make that determination.  Are there non-invasive ways of diagnosing a hernia?

In case you don't know, Krillean Photography, to the best of my    knowledge, involves taking pictures of an (most of the time) organic    object between charged plates. The picture will show energy patterns    or spikes around the object photographed, and depending on what type    of object it is, the spikes or energy patterns will vary. One might    extrapolate here and say that this proves that every object within    the universe (as we know it) has its own energy signature.  There have been a number of scientific papers (in peer-reviewed journals) published about Kirlian photography in the early 1970s.  Sorry I can't be more specific but it is a long time since I read them.  They would describe what is needed and how to set up the apparatus.    These papers demonstrate that the auras obtained by Kirlian photography can be completely explained by the effect of the electric currents used on the moisture in the object being photographed.  It has nothing to do with the \\\"energy signature\\\" of organic objects.  I did a science project on Kirlian photography when I was in high school.

And \\\"given by god\\\" refers to any action whereby a god god causes or better effects something.     Rob, I am not intimate with Jewish theology, but I understand that you are a Messianic Jew. Correct me if I am wrong, but it appears that the views of Messianic Jews on metaphysics is different to that of the majority of Jews. While Jewish theology overall is quite distinct from the Christianic god views, I have heard that it is possible for Jews to attribute evil to their god, an no-no for Christians, the Bible is still seen as effect of the interaction of some god with man.     (Deletion)   The context was metaphysics, even when the process of adapting the commandments is not transcendent, the justification of the process lie in metaphysic specualtion. I wonder how you break out of the shackles of having metaphysics in your system.     (Deletion)   Is is in a book that commands to commit genocide among other reprehensible deeds. The context is repulsive, and it is foul play, IMO, to invoke some relatively enlightened passages as an example for the content of the whole book.     (Big deletion)   No, not the interpretation of some laws, but the interpretation of the bible. As in the example that Sodom and Gomorrha mean argue with god. The whole idea that it is metaphorically and yet allows you to argue with a god (whatever that means, that alone is a theo- logic question) is proof of a theology used.       It is an important question in the light of what for instance the passage witrh Sodom and Gomorrha means. Either there is some connection between the text, the fact that it exists, and your interpretation of it, or it is purely arbitrary.. Further, the question is why is has one to carry the burden of Biblical texts when one could simply write other books that convey the message better. You might answer that one can't becuase  some peculiar Biblical information might be lost, but that holds true of every other book, and the question remains why has the Bible still a special place? Can't it be replaced somehow? Is it ok to bargain the dangerous content of the Bible against some other message that is included as well?     (Deletion)   Sorry, but there are worse systems does not say anything about if one could not have a better system.   (Deletion)   If we read two stories in the Bible, one that god commands people to kill children for being idolaters and another where god kills children directly, what is more important to resolve, the message that children are to be killed or if it has  to be done by god?     And the argument you have given is a fallacy, while it may not be important in the context you have given to find out if god is corporeal or not, it can be crucial in other questions. Religious believers resolve contradictions with that they choose one of the possibilities given in an arbitrary way, and have the advantage of being able to attribute their decision to some god.\",\"Yes, the Phobos mission did return some useful data including images of Phobos itself.

This is akin to an article saying that it is POSSIBLE that the USAF has several captured UFOs, without supporting the liklihood of such an assertion.   In other words, they were telling a pesky reporter to keep guessing.  Israel maintains this same attitude about nuclear weapons it may or may not have.  The US maintains the same attitude about the presence of nuclear weapons on specific naval craft.  By refusing to acknowledge the existence of such weapons on specific ships, US warships have, I believe, become unwelcome in New Zealand, which has declared itself a nuclear-free-zone.     The USAF has never officially admitted to having any UFOs, either.   This is stated as a fact without supporting evidence.  It would've been more convincing if your reporter had come up with just one name of someone who is sitting in jail, lost to the world, as he suggests. Maybe Elvis, or JFK, somebody.    Let's put it this way: If Israel has put people away without publicizing their arrests or the legal proceedings against them, how has their disappearance been explained?  People have relatives, friends and colleagues, you know.  Israel is not known as a place where people are made to vanish.  Would you care to give us a list of people whose whereabouts are unknown?

I feel a philosophy or religion group would be more appropriate. The topic is deeply embedded in the world view of Islam and the esoteric teachings of the Prophet (S.A.). Heresy does not enter into it at all except for those who see Islam only as an exoteric religion that is only nominally (if at all) concerned with the metaphysical substance of man's being and nature.  A good introductory book (in fact one of the best introductory books to Islam in general) is Murtaza Mutahhari's \\\"Fundamental's of Islamic Thought - God, Man, and the Universe\\\" - Mizan Press, translated by R. Campbell. Truly a beautiful book. A follow-up book (if you can find a decent translation) is \\\"Wilaya - The Station of the Master\\\" by the same author. I think it also goes under the title of \\\"Master and Mastership\\\" - It's a very small book - really just a transcription of a lecture by the author. The introduction to the beautiful \\\"Psalms of Islam\\\" - translated by William C. Chittick (available through Muhammadi Trust of Great Britain) is also an excellent introduction to the subject. We have these books in our University library - I imagine any well stocked University library will have them.  From your posts, you seem fairly well versed in Sunni thought.

The distribution terms are those of the X consortium, not the GNU Public License.  Thus anyone can commercially exploit the Andrew code without restriction.  (To encourage membership, however, we defer universal release of the latest versions until Consortium members have had an opportunity to explore the new capabilities.)  To se what AUIS looks like, you can try a remote demo.  You need an X server (R5 is best) on a machine linked to the internet.  Give the command    finger help@atk.itc.cmu.edu   for instructions.  NOTE:  The demo version does not use the Motif-look-and-feel scrollbar, but one is available.  You can use it on the demo by changing an option in the ~/preferences file and starting a new editor.  The Andrew Toolkit component of AUIS is ideal if you want to build applications using compound documents.  Andrew's major feature is its architecture for recursive embedding of objects: equation in table in figure in text, for example.  This architecture extends to areas not usually found in toolkits, including file stream formats, cut/paste, and printing.  Andrew also provides some of the most commonly requested applications:  word processor, spreadsheet, drawing editor, and font editor (the latter two are in version 5.2 which will be generally released on the XR6 tape in December.)\",\"In <C5nGII.BGx@news2.cis.umn.edu> bunt0003@student.tc.umn.edu (Monthian   Perhaps the reason is simple--maybe the marketing people who put together the brochures and price lists weren't clear on the FPU issue.

I am familiar with    the command lines of several operating systems but occasionally    I will have to some work on a system that I almost never use.    If it has a GUI, I can usually accomplish what I want to do    fairly easily, the command line on the other hand often is    a long and painful experience.   What I hate about GUI's:   - Having to switch between the mouse and the keyboard. I guess    I have a strong one-handed preference. I like to use a    computer with one hand and use the other for holding something    like a piece of paper of a mug of tea. I have configured my    favorite editor so that most of the editing functions can be    done with one hand such as navigating, cutting, pasting,    searching, opening and saving files, etc. The main thing I    need to use both hands for is entering text.

TrueType font files are at least 1/3 larger than their Type-1  equivalents.

There are diseases that haven't been described yet and the root cause of many diseases now described aren't known. (Read a book on gastroenterology sometime if you want to see a lot of them.)

I'm looking for  recommendations for a suitable replacement.  I would like to buy a full Aerostich suit but I can't afford $700 for it right now.  I'm considering two basic options:  1)  Buy the Aerostich jacket only.  Dunno how much it costs     due to recent price increases, but I'd imagine over $400.     That may be pushing my limit.  Advantages include the fact     that I can later add the pants, and that it nearly eliminates     the need for the jacket portion of a rainsuit.  2)  Buy some kind of leather jacket.  I like a few of the new      Hein-Gericke FirstGear line, however they may be a bit pricey     unless I can work some sort of deal.  Advantages of leather     are potentially slightly better protection, enhanced pose     value (we all know how important that is :-), possibly cheaper     than upper Aerostich.  Requirements for a jacket are that it must fit over a few other  layers (mainly a sizing thing), if leather i'd prefer a zip-out  lining, it MUST have some body armor similar to aerostich (elbows,  shoulders, forearms, possibly back/kidney protection, etc.), a  reasonable amount of pocket space would be nice, ventilation would  be a plus, however it must be wearable in cold weather (below freezing) with layers or perhaps electrics.

Other questions:  - Excuse my ignorance, but is \\\"Texel\\\" a reputable maker in the CD-ROM   market?  Or do you think NEC is the better drive?  - Bottom line:  Is this kit worth the money?

I found 3 shareware Workspace Managers, from Australia's MS-WINDOWS archive (monu6.cc.monash.edu.au), which mirrors some sites in the U.S.  The three I found were:  1. WORKSPACES 1.10 (wspace.zip)                                 This was the smallest and simplest    of the workspace managers that I found.  It is very easy to use.    It displays a small window, containing 6 buttons, plus an extra    button for configuration purposes.  One annoying feature was the    title window that is first presented when it is run - you must press    a key (not a mouse button!) for the thing to go away.  Also, it would    have been nice if there was an \\\"ALWAYS ON TOP\\\" setting for the little    window containing the workspace buttons.  Maybe some user-specified    strings on the buttons instead of the numbers one to six might be    a nice feature.  The simplicity and ease of use of this workspace    manager makes it an attractive package.  2. WORKSHIFT 1.6 (wrksft16.zip)                                While this workspace manager offered a    few features that WORKSPACES 1.10 lacked, it was quite time consuming    to set things up.  With WORKSPACES 1.10, all but the first workspace    is initially empty.  With WORKSHIFT 1.6, you need to take \\\"snapshots\\\"    of how you want each of your workspaces to look like - i.e. what     applications they contain.  Also, the main window is quite large,    but this does allow you to have a small view of what is in each workspace.    With WORKSPACES 1.10, there was no facility for viewing what was in    a workspace without switching to it.  WORKSHIFT 1.6 provides this    viewing functionality which is quite useful.  3. BIGDESK 2.30 and BACKMENU (backdesk.zip)                             This is an interesting package, which contains    a few other goodies as well as a workspace manager.  Other goodies    include \\\"Backmenu\\\", which provides a pop-up root menu when you    press a certain mouse button - just like in X-Windows.  The menu    is totally configurable, offering unlimited depth of cascading menus,    which is provides quite handy access to applications.  You could    say it is a menu-based alternative to the program manager.  Also    bundled in \\\"backdesk.zip\\\" is a program called \\\"WRUN\\\", which allows    you to run windows applications from a DOS shell under WINDOWS    instead of using the File Manager to run applications.      The actual workspace manager is called BIGDESK 2.30.  BIGDESK works quite    differently to the other two workspace managers in that it    doesn't provide a certain number of disjoint and separate workspaces.    In fact, it basically enlarges your desktop by a configurable amount,    and you choose which region of the desktop you want your screen to    focus in on.  This means you can have windows overlapping between different    viewing regions, unlike the first two workspace managers in which    each workspace was isolated from the other one.  The BIGDESK control window    allows to to move windows around your enlarged desktop.

Be that as it may....  Clemens is always in this form, and Viola isn't really performing beyond what might reasonably have been expected. How do you know that the Sox are responding to them, and not to Al Bumbry, Hobson, or (my most likely suspect) new hitting coach Mike Easler? I certainly am more likely to give Easler credit for Mo Vaughhn's hot start than Clemens or Viola.  This was the optimistic scenario, but not unreasonably so. He hasn't shown much power yet, though.  How can you tell that Dawson is providing the leadership? Perhaps it's Calderon? Perhaps it's Clemens and Viola? Maybe Hobson is finally showing those people skills he was supposed to have when they hired him. Or maybe it's all a myth. And Dawson has been hitting reasonably well, but not as well as Greenwell, Vaughn, Cooper, or Fletcher.  In three games. Why don't we look at this one again in, say, July?  A bit better than could reasonably have been expected. But don't forget that Zupcic looked like Wade Boggs lite for about 75 AB's last year. Beware of small sample sizes. Still, if Fletcher hits as well as he did last year he'd be a great improvement over any Sox leadoff hitter from last year. Be aware that his career numbers seem to indicate that he puts up good numbers as long as he doesn't have to make more than 300 AB or so in a year.  Ummm...sorry, no. I can buy the \\\"in the field\\\" part, and I think he'll be better at the plate than the 1992 Boggs, but in general Cooper, while he'll be a pretty good hitter, couldn't carry Boggs' jockstrap. With a little luck, he could be the fourth or fifth best 3B in the AL (Martinez, Boggs, Ventura, and Palmer will all be better).   See, here is where you make that quick left turn off into the aether. .500 is plausible, third is not unlikely, but phrases like \\\"could run away with the division\\\" are likely to get you a visit from the men in the white coats. It's not really clear that their staff is better than last year. If Russell does well, Darwin doesn't go on the DL, and Hesketh doesn't pitch just barely well enough to avoid losing his spot in the rotation, they could be better. On the other hand, if Hesketh pitches miserably and they're too stupid to move him to the pen and bring up Conroy or somebody, Fossas continues to pitch dismally but they keep giving him innings becasue he's a lefty, and Russell explodes they could be pretty bad.

Roads like the Autobahn are smoother, straiter, wider and slightly banked.   Example: A few months back I was traveling late at  night ( 3:00 am or so) and I was changing highways at a bent crosssing. It  curved off to the south east becoming hidden by trees after about 1,000 ft and continued to the left strait north. I wanted to turn north, checked the south lane, rolled into the crossing and checked the north lane. Nevertheless there wasn't  a car in sight, so I took one last look and pulled into the left hand lane. Now my car isn't a 5 sec 0-60 performer but I was in the corect lane and  over 40 in decent time, even at 3:00 I wasn't wasting time. It was then that I checked my mirror and saw a Mustang closing in my lane *FAST*, he  had just turned the corner and was just noticing me. Luckly he saw me and  changed lanes in time, I estamate he was moving in excess of 90 or so. I was just a by stander, I had no chance of runing from him, or moving out  of his way. I'm glad he saw my brake lights in time. I shudder to  think of what would have happened had I wainted to pull out and not  left the time he needed to dodge me.

He also comes to first reveal the root cause of original sin (fallen nature) and then provide a means to cut the connection to that original sin.  He also wants to create world peace based on Godism.  The messiah's teachings will build on the foundation of the Bible but provide profound new insights into the nature of God, the fall of man, the purpose of creation, and God's providence of restoration.  It will also provide a foundation for the unity of all the World's religions.  Many Christians expect Jesus to come on literal clouds, so they may miss him when he returns. Just as the Jewish people missed Jesus 2000 years ago.  They are still waiting for his first coming.  The Jewish people of that age expected Elijah to come first.  Jesus said that John the Baptist was Elijah. But John the Baptist denied that he was Elijah.  (How did this reflect on Jesus?)  Later in prison John even questioned who Jesus was: \\\"is he the one who is to come or do we look for another\\\". (see book of Matthew)   David Koresh didn't even come close.  The problem is that people like this make it difficult for people to believe and trust in the real Messiah when he does show up.   Very good point and perhaps the most important point of all for Christians: How to recognize the Second Coming?  The Messiah should not claim to be God.  What sets a Messiah apart is that he is born without original sin.  He is not born perfect but achieves perfection after a period of growth.  Adam and Eve were born sinless but they fell, and this tragedy meant that it would take God thousands of years to create the kingdom of heaven on the earth as God originally intended.  God's restoration providence is still not complete.  The messiah is the true Son of God, one with God, God's representative on the earth, but not God himself.  There is only one God.  ...    Who else in this world is claiming to be the Messiah.  Maybe he's already here.\",\" >  >In the UK, it's impossible to get approval to attach any crypto device  >to the phone network.

Trigger a oneshot from the decoded riseing edge ;the one shot then goes to a mosfet to drive the mechanism to fire the pellet launcher.. these ckts require uAmps of current,between 5 - 15 volts, so a 12 volt gel cell of a few Amphours would last the six weeks. Then take the ckt board & battery wrap in 3\\\" or 4\\\" of foam or build a box of out of the stuff...with plywood or metal exterior... build a small heater out of 10-50 Watt resistors in series to keep the battery and ckts warm. 2nd thought use 2 batteries one for heater one for timer and pellet trigger.  Insolate-insolate.......even though the chips state that the - AL rated devices are good to -55 C.. The batteries have a considerable reduction in capacity...oh make sure the area inside has minium air leakage..  hope this helps RW     ( is this to long winded for the net??)(be gentle)...\",\" ------------ Part 7 of 14 ------------ MI:6EI:6EI:6EI:6EI:6EI:6EI:6EI4='1T='1T='1T='I:6EI:6EI:6EI0L+ M\\\"PL+\\\"PL+\\\"PL+\\\"PL+\\\"PL+I:6EI:6E1T='1T='W]_?W]]Z>GHJ*BJ[NUY>`P,# M`YF9F9D]/3T]/9F9F0->7KN[N[N[7EX#`P.9F9F'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MASC`P,!;;L`X.$O#P\\\\!;`M2YYK9:5]3/R%?/`A2JKB+L._$^AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX=75\\\\@%2J##=4V^,\\\"F,N)P-]5%1JZ$D*61DOF1D9(ST!H>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AVPVT_%N2IJL8YMD9#OQ M(K[Q9*R'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AU=75U>BP2'<`EMLTXCL'6X%2J\\\"L\\\\2WE922, M!F`-4<Q@4?6'AX>'A\\\\!+6ZJBU-3/5]345]175U>B:W69TG$9L+\\\"PL+!3BS3% MQ6=G9P],3(F)R<F)B8F)B<G)%A865%145%14%A86%A86%A86%A86%A;)R80- M$PU1S.%D\\\\64B[[;OO;6Q.XE,3&=&-C84HM2`7PRV?M3J7T,=:!V`P2&L[.S!

-------- End of part 7 of 14 --------     \",\" We're probably stuck, as Mike Burger pointed out that the baseball deal was made far in advance of the NHL contract.  WABC did the same thing; they were thankful that the Devils were wiped out by 9:30, because they had to switch over to Yankees baseball.  The proof of  the reasons for this is left to the reader ...  It's too bad, but I wonder if ESPN is stuck with other US local team coverage for their alternate games?  We got NESN's coverage of the Bruins-Sabres with the Boston homers ... they were awful!!!  I've read that Derek Sanderson is the colour analyst ... I wonder if he spent his early years after hockey as an intern at PRAVDA before landing this job?  *Everything* had to be twisted into something good to say about the Bruin(s) involved ... not even Bill Wirtz's shills on SC Chicago (Pat Foley, Dale Tallon) were this bad.  And just to be fair, SC used to take their feed from ESN (Empire Sports Network), the Sabre homers and they were horrible too ... but they were spacy.  From the CNN highlights, I hear Chris Cuthbert's voice from the CBC coverage of the Habs-Nords series.  Too bad that we couldn't get it on ESPN, with all due respect to the Sabres and the Bruins.  Mike Emrick is substituting on the Devils SCNY team for Gary Thorne. Mike was the original Devils TV play-by-play announcer, by the way.  gld\",\"Source: Hassan Arfa, \\\"The Kurds,\\\" (London, 1968), pp. 25-26.   \\\"When the Russian armies invaded Turkey after the Sarikamish disaster    of 1914, their columns were preceded by battalions of irregular    Armenian volunteers, both from the Caucasus and from Turkey. One of    these was commanded by a certain Andranik, a blood-thirsty adventurer.   These Armenian volunteers committed all kinds of excesses, more   than six hundred thousand Kurds being killed between 1915 and 1916 in    the eastern vilayets of Turkey.\\\"   Serdar Argic\",\"Help! I am working on a project that involves using text with foreign language characters (in this case Norwegian). I have been manipulating the data with Excell 4.0 and then exporting the data as comma seperated variable files to an RS6000 workstation.  The Norwegian characters show up fine under Windows, but appear as \\\"funny\\\" characters on the workstation.  The workstation is setup for national language support and we have problem entering the Norwegian characters from the workstation keyboard.  On further investigation I found that the character codes used by Windows are different (for these characters) than those specified by the MSDOS code page.  The MSDOS codes seem to be the same as the workstation.  What gives, and how can get around it. Please reply by E-mail as I will be out of the office the next few days and will not be reading the news. Thanks. \",\"Benedikt Rosenau writes, with great authority:   \\\"Contradictory\\\" is a property of language.

This was a heresy that was condemned in the Council of Chalcedon in 451 AD.  It grew up in reaction to Nestorianism, which held that the Son and Jesus are two different people who happened to be united in the same body temporarily.  Monophysitism is held by the Copts of Egypt and Ethipoia and by the Jacobites of Syria and the Armenian Orthodox.  It believes that Jesus Christ was God (which is correct), that he was man (which is correct), that he was one person (which is correct), but that he had only one nature and one will and oen energy (which is heretical, the orthodox position is that he had two natures and two wills and two energies, both divine and human, though the wills were in perfect harmony).  That is what Mike is trying to get across, that while Jesus came in human form, Mike says He did not have a human nature or a human will.  In reality, he had both, though neither made him subject to original sin. It is interesting to note that the Monothelites were a reaction to this conflict and attempted to solve the problem by admitting two natures but not two wills or two energies.  It also was condemned, at a late council in Constantinople I believe.  Andy Byler\",\": My 9 yr old son has signed up to do a science report on batteries.

Pros arrive late, nervousness for  rookie WC players, and problems to get the lines clicking may make things  hard to get it going against these \\\"worse\\\" nations.  I'd guess that the better team you face in the opening game, the better  it is, since the chances of an upset are greater then.   Some other reasons why the \\\"worse\\\" teams are so tough to beat was presented  by Hans \\\"Virus\\\" Lindberg (former coach in Switzerland).   1) The \\\"worse\\\" teams (referring to France, Switzerland, Austria, Italy etc)     have now usually world class goalies.   2) Their defensive play have become much more disciplined, they take much     less unnecessary penalties.   3) They use four lines which makes it harder to make them \\\"run out of gas.\\\"   4) The ice quality in the German WC rinks is poor.

I recently posted about how I received a bad vram chip for my new LCIII, and someone responded that it may not actually be bad, but it may be a 512K LC vram chip, and thus doesn't work properly with my computer. So I'm wondering if anyone can interpret these codes for me, so I can figure out what type of chip MacConnection sent me.     2515251  On the back of the card, it says 0593  I believe from the numbers that means it is an 80ns chip, but I can't figure out what the size is supposed to be. If anyone can help, I'd be grateful. Please email me your response.

What speed SIMMS does the C650 need/want?  (I know that it needs 80ns VRAM...not sure for the main RAM.)  2.  I've heard two conflicting stories about the total expandibility of the C650's RAM...132 and 136 megs.  Which is true?  (Perhaps another phrasing would be better:  does the 8 meg version come with all 8 megs on the logic board, or 4 megs + a 4 meg SIMM?)  Just wondering.... \",\"  You are conveniently ommitting the fact that the Arab governments told the Arab citizens of Israel to leave Israel, join with the Arab armies so that after what they felt like an assured victory occured, these Arabs could return to their former homes, reclaim them as well as anything else they wanted that belonged to Jews.  When the Arabs lost, Israel was left with a bunch of people who has just tried to kill them who now wanted back into the country as citizens.  What would you have done?  Let them in so they could kill Jews?  Israel sees those Arabs who stayed as citizens  because they were loyal to Israel during the war and didn't leave.  Of course some Arabs could have left to avoid the fighting but distinguishing between the two is impossible.  Therefore a decision was made based on secuturity of the country.   No kibbutz that I have ever visited has any \\\"employees\\\" unless they had to hire some people for the restaurants, hotels etc if there weren't enough  people ON the kibbutz to do them.  In such cases, they are paid properly. If a kibbutz turns away an Arab, 9I have never seen or heard of this) but it reflects only on the membership comittee of that kibbutz, not the whole kibbutz movement.   This just shows how ignorant you are of Israeli politics.  Although the  major parties in Israel aren't religious (however not totally secular), due to the format of the government (coalition) the religious parties have always had a lot of pull since they were needed to form a majority coalition. In fact, from what I heard the present government is the least influenced by the religious parties in the existance of Israel.  Israel CANNOT be called a secular state.  For instace, Haifa is the only city in the country (except for maybe some Arab cities) where buses run on the Jewish Sabbath.   There are many other examples of religion in Israel.  Marriages in Israel are NOT contolled by the state, but by Rabbis and Priests.  Obviously your  disbelief of this fact sheds some light of your ignorance of the country you claim to know so much about.

What scientists call an atom is nothing more than a mathematical model that describes  certain physical, observable properties of our surroundings.  All of which is subjective.    What is objective, though, is the approach a scientist  takes in discussing his model and his observations.  There is no objective science.  But there is an objective approach which is subjectively selected by the scientist.  Objective in this case means a specified, unchanging set of rules that he and his colleagues use to discuss their science.  This is in contrast to your Objective Morality.  There may be an objective approach to subjectively discuss your beliefs on morality.  But there exists no objective morality.  Also, science deals with how we can discuss our observations of  the physical world around us.  In that the method of discussion is objective ( not the science; not the discussion itself ).  Science makes no claims to know the whys or even the hows sometimes of what we can observe.  It simply gives us a way to discuss our surroundings in a meaningful, consistent way.  I think it was Neils Bohr who said (to paraphrase) Science is what we can _say_ about the physical world.\",\"    Sorry, but olwm and tvtwm don't do it. They place the title at that position    and the window at a position below it.     This becomes a problem when you want a program to be able to save its current    configuration and restore is later.     Currently, my solution is:      XCreateWindow(...);     XSetWMProperties(..);     XMapWindow(...);     XFlush(...);     XMoveWindow(...);      It works with olwm, but is less than elegant. All this leaves me wondering    if I'm overlooking something obvious.     Richard.   I know that the mwm has an resource to specify if positions are to be used for the border of a window or for the \\\"user\\\" window. Maybe other window managers have similar options. Another way to figure out the difference between the \\\"user\\\" window position and the window manager decoration window position is to subtract their positions. You just have to use XQueryTree and remember that the window manager decorations window is the parent of your window. Unfortunately, you can only figure out the decoration width and height after the window has been mapped this way.\",\"  \\\"Assuming\\\"? Also: come on, Brad. If we are going to get anywhere in  this (or any) discussion, it doesn't help to bring up elements I never  addressed, *nor commented on in any way*. I made no comment on who is  \\\"right\\\" or who is \\\"wrong\\\", only that civilians ARE being used as cover  and that, having been placed \\\"in between\\\" the Israelis and the guerillas, they *will* be injured as both parties continue their fight.    [The *purpose* of an army's use of military uniforms   is *to set its members apart* from the civilians so that   civilians will not be thought of by the other side as  \\\"combatants\\\". So, what do you think is the \\\"meaning behind\\\",   the intention and the effect when an \\\"army\\\" purposely   *does not were uniforms but goes out of its way to *look   like civilians'? *They are judging that the benefit they will   receive from this \\\"cover\\\" is more important that the harm  that will come to civilians.*  This is a comment on the Israeli experience and is saying that the guerillas *do* have some responsibility in putting civilians in \\\"the middle\\\" of this fight. By putting on uniforms and living apart from civilians (barracks, etc.), the guerillas would significantly lower the risk to civilians.   But if the guerillas do this aren't *they* putting themselves  at greater risk? Absolutely, they ask themselves \\\"why set   ourselves apart (by wearing uniforms) when there is a ready-made   cover for us (civilians)? That makes sense from their point of   view, BUT when this cover is used, the guerillas should accept   some of the responsibility for subsequent harm to civilians.   I agree with you here. I have always thought that Israel's bombing sortees and bombing policy is stupid, thoughtless, inhumane AND ineffective. BUT, there is no reason that Israel should passive wait  until attackers chose to act; there is every reason to believe that \\\"taking the fight *to* the enemy\\\" will do more to stop attacks.   As I said previously, Israel spent several decades \\\"sitting passively\\\" on its side of a border and only acting to stop these attacks *after* the attackers had entered Israeli territory. It didn't work very well. The \\\"host\\\" Arab state did little/nothing to try and stop these attacks  from its side of the border with Israel so the number of attacks were considerably higher, as was their physical and psychological impact  on the civilians caught in their path.    This is just another \\\"selectively applied\\\" statement.   The reason for this drawn-out impasse between Ababs/Palestinians and Israelis is that NEITHER side is willing to accept the Word of the other. By your criteria *everyone* should stay away from the negotiations.  That is precisely why the Palestinians (in their recent PISGA proposal for  the \\\"interim\\\" period after negotiations and leading up to full autonomy) are demanding conditions that essentially define \\\"autonomy\\\" already. They DO NOT trust that Israel will \\\"follow through\\\" the entire process and allow Palestinians to reach full autonomy.   Do you understand and accept this viewpoint by the Palestinians?  If you do, then why should Israel's view of Arabs/Palestinians  be any different? Why should they trust the Arab/Palestinians' words? Since they don't, they are VERY reluctant to give up \\\"tangible assets  (land, control of areas) in exchange for \\\"words\\\". For this reason, they are also concerned about the sorts of \\\"guarantees\\\" they will have  that the Arabs WILL follow through on their part of any agreement reached.  Absolutely, so are the Arabs/Palestinians asking FIRST for the Israelis \\\"word\\\" in relation to any agreement? NO, what is being demanded FIRST is LAND. When the issue is LAND, and one party finally gets HOLD of this \\\"land\\\", what the \\\"other party\\\" does is totally irrelevent. If I NOW have possession of this land, your words have absolutely no power; whether Israel chooses to keeps its word does NOT get the land back.   While the \\\"major armaments\\\" (those allowing people to wage \\\"civil wars\\\") have been removed, the weapons needed to cross-border attacks still remain to some extent. Rocket attacks still continue, and \\\"commando\\\" raids only require a few easily concealed weapons and a refined disregard for human life (yours of that of others). Such attacks also continue.   Bat guano. The situation you call for existed in the 1970s and attacks were commonplace.   There is NO WAY these groups can be effectively \\\"disarmed\\\" UNLESS the state is as authoritarian is Syria's. The only other way is for Lebanon to take it upon itself to constantly patrol the entire border with Israel, essentially mirroring Israel's border secirity on its side. It HAS TO PROVE TO ISREAL that it is this committed to protecting Israel from attack from Lebanese territory.  That's what I said, ok? But, doesn't that mean that Syria has to \\\"take over\\\" Lebanon? I don't think Israel or Lebanon would like that. What both \\\"sides\\\" need is to receive something \\\"tangible\\\". The Arabs/ Palestinians are looking for \\\"land\\\" and demanding that they receive it prior to giving anything to Israel. Israel has two problems: 1) if it gives up real *land* it IS exposing itself to a changed geostrategic situation (and that change doesn't help Israel's position), and 2) WHEN it gives up this land IT NEEDS to receive something in return to compensate for the increased risks\",\"  Well, some quick math on my part shows that an 8.3MHz bus, 16 bits wide, performing a transfer every two clock cycles will provide 8.3M bytes/sec.  Someone said that it really takes 3 clock cycles to perform a transfer, so that reduces the transfer rate to 5.5MB/s, which is the commonly-used figure for ISA bus speed.  However, I believe a two-clock transfer is possible (0 wait states).\",\" Such as?  Drunk drivers get back on the road in no time, to kill again.

However, who is at blame is another question. It seems that the entire society that sanctions any sorts of executions-- realizing the risks--is to blame.   Yes, but there is also a probablity that you will kill someone doing any raondom activity.  Presumably, you had not isolated yourself totally from the rest of society because of this.   And I argue that our law system is a similar risk.  Perhaps an innocent person will be punished someday, but we work to prevent this.  In fact, many criminals go free as a result of our trying to prevent punishment of innocents.   But, such accidents are to be totally expected, given the numner of vehicals on the road.  Again, the blame is on society.   Yes, but the state is not at fault in such a case.  The state can only do so much to prevent false witnesses.   Okay, so this is what you call murder.  But, the question is whether or not all such \\\"murders\\\" are wrong.  Are you saying that all taking of human life is wrong, no matter what the circumstances?   But, this is basically how it works.  Society accepts the risk that an innocent person will be murdered by execution.  And, every member of society shares this blame.  And, most people's definitions of murder include some sort of malicious intent, which is not involved in an execution, is it?   Murder violates the golden rule.  Executions do not, because by allowing it at all, society implicitly accepts the consequences no matter who the innocent victim is.   Reading the minds of the jury would certainly tell whether or not a conviction was moral or not.  But, in an objective system, only the absolute truth matters, and the jury system is one method to approximate such a truth.  That is, twelve members must be convinced of a truth.   But then, if we read the minds of these people, we would know that the conviction was unfair.   Yes, while we could objectively determine the difference (if we knew all possible information), we can't always determine the difference in our flawed system.  I think that our system is almost as good as possible, but it still isn't objectively perfect.  You see, it doesn't matter if we *know* it is fair or not.  Objectively, it is either fair or it is not.   But what we know has no effect on an objective system.   Why are you so sure?   Why is *your* reality important?   But, we can assume that the system is fairly decent, at least most likely. And, you realize that the correctness of our system says nothing about a totally ideal and objective system.   Well, we can have an ideal system, but the working system can not be ideal. We can only hope to create a system that is as close an approximation to the ideal system as possible.   Yes, we all bear the responsibility.  Most people seem willing to do this.   We must realize the consequences of all our actions.  Why do you keep separating the justice system from the pack?   I don't think our country has an objective system, but I think such an objective system can exist, in theory.  Without omniscience, an objective system is not possible in practice.\",\"Is Impulse shipping IMAGINE for the PC386/486?

We bought this thing because it (1) has a parallel data input in addition to the usual video signal inputs and (2) claimed to print 256 gray level images.  However, the manual that came with it only describes how to format the parallel data to print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images.  After some initial problems with the parallel interface I now have this thing running from a parallel port of an Hewlett-Packard workstation and I can print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images just fine.  I called the Mitsubishi people and asked about the 256 level claim and they said that was only available when used with the video signal inputs.  This was not mentioned in the sales literature.  However they did say the P78U can do 6 bit/pixel (64 level) images in parallel mode, but they didn't have any information about how to program it to do so, and they would call Japan, etc.  Frankly, I find it hard to believe that if this thing can do 8 bit/pixel images from the video source, it can't store 8 bits/pixel in the memory.  It's not like memory is that expensive any more.  If anybody has any information on getting 6 bit/pixel (or even 8 bit/pixel) images out of this thing, I would greatly appreciate your sending it to me.

Neil Smith                             WEIRD SCIENCE  Everyone knows how to tell when a politician is lying:  his lips  move.  What may not be equally obvious is that there are  politicians and then there are politicians -- and that the phrase  \\\"political science\\\" is subject to more than one interpretation.    Years ago, we heard how \\\"scientists\\\" were worried that a new Ice  Age might be coming, and later on that \\\"nuclear winter\\\" -- smoke  and dust thrown into the atmosphere by full-scale international  unpleasantness -- was a possibility.  Something like that may even  have killed the dinosaurs.    What we didn't hear was that no actual data supported any of this,  that real-world events (the burning of Kuwaiti oil fields) tended  to discredit it, that mostly it was propaganda meant to weaken  values that made America the most successful culture in history,  and that the dinosaurs probably died of something like the Plague  when continents drifted together, exposing them to new germs.    We miss a lot like this, unless we listen closely.  Prince William  Sound, site of the famous oil spill, and Mount St. Helen's weren't  supposed to recover from their respective disasters for at least  100 years.  That turned out not to be true, although you'd never  know it from watching network nightly news or CNN.  It doesn't fit  their agenda to inform us that the earth is vast and resilient, and  that nature is rougher on herself than we could ever be.    But for once, the media aren't entirely to blame.  As ignorant of  science as they are of everything, they trust \\\"scientists\\\" to  unscrew the inscrutable.  The trouble is that today's \\\"scientists\\\"  have agendas of their own.    Nobody in government, that wellspring of scientific wherewithal, is  going to offer grants to an investigator who states truthfully that  there is no respectable evidence for \\\"global warming\\\".  The money  and power for bureaucrats and politicians lie in mass transit, and  they hate the automobile -- blamed as a major cause of the mythical  crisis -- as a source of privacy and freedom they find intolerable.    The same appears true of \\\"acid rain\\\", a deliberate hoax cooked up  by the Environmental Protection Agency (which hates private  industrial capitalism almost as much as it does your car) and  foisted on real scientists through trickery which has depended on  specialists in different fields not talking to each other much.    The list goes on, always with a common, disreputable thread.   \\\"Ozone depletion\\\", for which evidence is even more suspect and  contradictory than for acid rain or global warming, is no more than  a last, desperate attempt to indict private capitalism in an era  when state central planning and the command economy have failed and  can only find this final, withered leg to teeter on.    Decades of anti-nuclear alarmism, resting on foundations of myth  and panic-mongering, have failed to erase the fact that nuclear  power is the safest, cleanest, most efficient source of energy  known to mankind -- and more to the point, that the greater amount  of energy there is available to any individual in society, the  freer that individual -- and his society -- become.    Honest studies on the effects of individual gun ownership and  self-defense on crime -- conducted by investigators who began as  ideological opponents to those concepts, but which show massive  reductions in the latter to be the result of the former -- have  been suppressed, most recently by the California state government.    And what the media didn't say about recent EPA \\\"discoveries\\\" on the  effect of \\\"secondhand smoking\\\" is that, although some harm to non- smokers may have been detected, it was less (by an order or two of  magnitude) than that associated with frying bacon a couple times a  week or keeping a pet bird.  It's enough to make you wonder whether  there was ever anything to the claim that smoking causes cancer.    That, of course, is the real threat represented by politically  correct science.  The world is a dangerous place.  It would be nice  to know the hazards.  I've never believed smoking to be a healthy  practice, but, given a lack of credibility on the part of today's  science, how am I to decide what to do about it?  Nicotine is  highly addictive, to that much I can attest from experience.  Yet  the stress of quitting may be riskier than to continue.  There  isn't any way to tell, thanks to the corrupting influence of  government money on the scientific establishment.    Two centuries ago, the Founding Fathers spared us certain agonies  to which every other nation in the world has been subject at one  time or another, by creating a legal barrier between politics and  religion.  Each time some short-sighted individual or group has  tried to lower the barrier (most recently over the issue of  abortion), blood -- real human blood, hot and smoking in the street  -- has wound up being shed.    Real human blood is being shed over scientific issues, as people's  lives are ruined through the loss, to agencies like the EPA, of  livelihood, or property it may have taken a lifetime to accumulate,  to diseases caused by toxins associated with burning fossil fuels  for electrical power, or thanks to bans on things like cyclamates,  when they die from the effects of obesity.    What we need now, if we hope to survive as a civilization for two  more centuries, is another barrier, a Constitutional separation of  state and science -- including medicine.  Knowledge is valuable;  real science won't languish for lack of funding.  The money will  simply come from contributors unwilling to pay for lies, and  everyone will benefit.    L.

It was six runs in the 8th for a 12-5 win Monday and five in the 8th and six in the 9th for a 12-2 win yesterday. Jamie Navarro pitched seven strong innings, but Orosco, Austin, Manzanillo and Lloyd all took part in the mockery of a bullpen yesterday. How's this for numbers? Maldanado has pitched three scoreless innings and Navarro's ERA is 0.75. The next lowest on the staff is Wegman at 5.14. Ouch!  It doesn't look much better for the hitters. Hamilton is batting .481, while Thon is hitting .458 and has seven RBI. The next highest is three. The next best hitter is Jaha at .267 and then Vaughn, who has the team's only HR, at .238. Another ouch. Looking at the stats, it's not hard to see why the team is 2-5. In fact, 2-5 doesn't sound bad when you're averaging three runs/game and giving up 6.6/game.   Still, it's early and things will undoubtedly get better. The offense should come around, but the bullpen is a major worry. Fetters, Plesac and Austin gave the Brewers great middle relief last year. Lloyd, Maldanado, Manzanillo,  Fetters, Austin and Orosco will have to pick up the pace for the team to be successful. Milwaukee won a number of games last year when middle relief either held small leads or kept small deficits in place. The starters will be okay, the defense will be alright and the hitting will come around, but the bullpen is a big question mark.  In other news, Nilsson and Doran were reactivated yesterday, while William Suero was sent down and Tim McIntosh was picked up by Montreal. Today's game with California was cancelled.\",\"Hi there,  is there anybody who know a polygon_reduction algorithm for marching cube surfaces. e.g. the algirithm of Schroeder, Siggraph'92.  For any hints, hugs and kisses.  - Erwin\",\"   There's documentation on how to use the shared memory extension in the X11R5 distribution.    Actually, I just finished writing a motif animation program... (take-lots-of-image-data-and-display-it-pretty-darn-fast). When using on-server pixmaps or shared memory, I had to insert a delay loop to keep it from going too quickly :). Testing both methods side by side, they were just about equal.    The advantage of SHM is that your X server doesn't grow to ridiculous sizes; but pixmaps can work over a network and *are* removed if your application dies (one tends to use ipcrm manually quite a bit when debugging SHM apps).    Shared memory also has the problem that some operating systems (e.g. Ultrix) seem to allow only a small number of segments (~6) to be attached to a process at once; consequently, a redraw becomes XShmAttach();XShmPutImage();XShmDetach(); on Dec systems. And Dec's 24 bit displays (like the ones I tend to use most often) don't seem to support the extension (maybe someone compiled them wrong?), and using pixmaps causes the X server to crash (failed mallocs), so one *has* to use the local unix domain socket (which really isn't that bad; one copies the info three times per redraw instead of one).    In short: allowing all three forms of display, within the program is a Good Thing (minus SHM if running over a network), and let the user pick whatever feels fastest.    (I just use an ximagehandler class and forget about it :)\",\" Was THAT your argument.  Well, you didn't make it very well.

The \\\"whole Russian strategy\\\" is not specific to Detroit or to Devellano, who was GM before Murray.  What the previous GM also did was to trade  away several players who have gone on to do well with other teams, most notably (in my memory) Murray Craven, who had a few very good years with Philly after leaving here.  Also, it's not the volume of trades that will  necessarily improve a team, but the quality of them.  Trading Adam Oates for Bernie Federko was just plain stupid, even if Federko used to be a  great player at one time.  Most of Murray's trades have worked significantly to the Wings' advantage, with those that didn't being soured mainly by  injury to the players involved (such as Troy Crowder, who suffered back problems from which he never really recovered).

Watson) asks:  > What is the objection to celebration of Easter?          The objection naturally is in the way in which you phrase it.  Easter (or Eashtar or Ishtar or Ishtarti or other spellings) is the pagan whore goddess of fertility.  Therefore, your question to me is \\\"what is the objection to celebration of the pagan whore goddess?\\\"  When phrased that way I suspect (or at least I would HOPE) that it becomes immeadiately apparent what my objection to \\\"celebrating\\\" her would be.    > It is celebration of the resurrection of Jesus.         No, you are thinking perhaps of \\\"Ressurection Sunday\\\" I think.  (Though I'm not too crazy about the word \\\"Sunday\\\", but I certainly like this phrasing much better than envoking the name of the whore goddess.)      For that matter, stay Biblical and call it Omar Rasheet (The Feast of First Fruits).  Torah commands that this be observed on the day following the Sabbath of Passover week.  (Sunday by any other name in modern parlance.)  Why is there so much objection to observing the Resurrection on the 1st day of the week on which it actually occured?  Why jump it all over the calendar the way Easter does?  Why not just go with the Sunday following Passover the way the Bible has it?  Why seek after unbiblical methods?    > I don't recall a command in Scripture for us to celebrate  > the resurrection, but it is the sole and only reason that  > we are Christians--how could we not celebrate it?         So what does this question have to do with Easter (the whore goddess)?  I am all for celebrating the Resurrection.  Just keep that whore out of the discussion.    > If it is only the name which is a problem, I suggest that if  > we are too concerned about etymology, there are a lot of  > words we are going to have to drop.

Fine by me.  And while we are at it, the left-handed people are both \\\"sinister\\\" and \\\"gauche\\\" so we probably will have some objections from that quarter as well.    > In Quebec French, the word for the celebration of the  > resurrection is \\\"Pa^ques\\\"--this is etymologically related  > to Pesach (Passover) and the pascal lamb.  So is the  > French Canadian (mostly Roman Catholic) celebration better  > because it uses the right name?         Yes, that sounds much better to me.

What happened to \\\"there is  > neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for  > all are one in Christ Jesus\\\"?         Read the letter to Philemon.  Now tell me, was Philemon's \\\"slave\\\" returned to him?  Were there different rules upon the slave than upon Philemon?  How about male and female?  Are there different \\\"rules\\\" that apply to them as well?  Or if there is no more \\\"male and female\\\" can Adam and Steve get married to each other in your congregation?  Yes, there are differences in form and function.  But the way we come to Salvation in Messiah remains the same no matter what our position in life.   ---------------------------------------  [I am in general not in favor of continuing this discussion, as it seems repetitive, but this particular point is one that I believe is new -- the objection is not to having a holiday but to its name.  I'd like to suggest that people think very carefully about this argument.  Words often change their meaning over time.  The days of the week are of course originally based on pagan gods.  Some Christians prefer to refer to \\\"first day\\\", \\\"second day\\\", etc.  However the majority of Christians have not been persuaded.  The question seems to be whether it makes any difference what the dictionary shows as the derivation of a word, if what people mean by it and think when they use it is different.  Indeed I'd like to suggest that postings like this could themselves be dangerous.  Suppose people in general use Easter to mean the celebration of Christ's resurrection.  Postings trying to convince them that they really mean a celebration in honor of some godess run the risk of creating exactly the situation that they claim to oppose. They are doing their best to *create* a linkage in people's minds between their celebration and the pagan goddess.  It's not clear that this is a healthy thing.\",\" Who compared Quayle to Gore?

I won't start panicking until/unless DES or RSA or stuff like that is prohibited, but I'm a little anxious.  (No doubt it won't be long before someone posts explaining how this just a small part of some far-ranging and long-lived NSA-PKP-IRS-FBI-CIA-HandgunControlInc-Clinton conspiracy to subvert freedom, democracy, and mathematics.)  My feeling is that the administration probably isn't that worried about things like DES and RSA and PGP and RIPEM, since they'll never be used by a group much wider than us computer geeks.  The fact that this just came out now suggests one of two things:  1.  The NSA has been working on this for a long time, and it only just     now happened to be ``ready'' to release to the world at this time.  2.  The NSA has been working on this for a long time, but wasn't able     to get the Bush administration to go along with this plan.  (I     find it unlikely that this would have been because of a sympathy     for the unescrowed use of cryptography; more likely the     administration felt that even escrowed, secret-algorithm and, for     all we know, trivially breakable cryptography should not be made     widely available.)  Thus said clipper@csrc.ncsl.nist.gov (Clipper Chip Announcement):  The majority of the discussion involving this \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" seems to pertain to the encryption of telephone conversations.  Does anyone know if that means this chip is designed to work primarily with analog signals?  The language sort of suggests this, but it's hard to say.  The main thing I just don't get is whether this chip implements symmetric or asymmetric cryptographic techniques.  Anybody know?  I'm guessing symmetric, but they don't get very clear about it.  If it is symmetric, how is it useful for anything other than link-level encryption with an identical chip at each end?  How can you negotiate a per-session key using symmetric cryptography without using a trusted third party who knows your key?  (Or does it even use a per-session key?)  If it's asymmetric, what about PKP's patents, which they claim cover all methods of doing asymmetric cryptography?  Are they getting royalties, or is hiding infringement the real reason for keeping the algorithm secret? :-)\",\"I am glad and proud to announce the new mailing-list for the PD Motif C++ bindings.

Imake support has been improved, a few defaults have been changed, and a lot of other small things have been added.  This is basically a release which drops the 'gamma' status. Next release will incorporate some improvements by Stefan Schwarz, and possibly will support X11R5 and Motif 1.2.x.  Note to all of those who keep copies of the archive: please retrieve this distribution (during off-peak hours), and delete all previous copies.  Here is the original ANNOUNCEMENT:  HISTORY  The University of Lowell, supported by a grant of the Open Software Foundation, has developed a wrapper-library, that encapsulates Motif widgets in C++ classes. All resources of these Widgets can now be set through member-functions, while objects can be used in callback-functions. The library was made available for free or nominal cost for anonymous ftp at 129.63.1.1. However, the library contained a large number of bugs and oversights, and only worked under X11R3. Due to lack of subsequent fundings, the bindings are no longer actively supported by the University of Lowell.  I, Ronald van Loon, at a certain point last year, have taken the Lowell  bindings, fixing the bugs I came across, adding missing memberfunctions, and enhancing functionality and made the bug-fixed library available for the general public for anonymous ftp (made possible by Rick Murphy at DEC).  NEW RELEASE  I am now pleased to announce a new and updated release of the Motif++ bindings.   This release offers:  - Full Motif1.1 and X11R4 support - Support for Xbae widgetset  - Two additional widgets, written by myself, that can be used to indicate   progress in an application. - Imake support. NB: this release relies heavily on the existence of imake        and its config files on your site. I have tried to        provide the bindings with a standard Makefile, tweakable        for those unfortunates without imake. I have not severely        tested the standard Makefile though. Contact me if you        have problems. The reason for calling this a gamma        release lies in the fact that I do not have a multitude        of platforms to test the Imake-files on. - Lots of testfiles (even somewhat useful programs) - An article I wrote on the usage of Motif, X and C++, previously posted   on Usenet.  WHERE TO GET THE NEW MOTIF BINDINGS  Ftp:  Anonymous ftp at decuac.dec.com (192.5.214.1), directory /pub/X11.  Note:  Please be patient as the network link is quite slow. Please do not FTP large files during working hours.  Also note that there is also a motif++.31.jan.92.tar.Z file at this site; this is an old version of the bindings.  E-mail:  Those who don't have ftp can send me e-mail, and I will send the bindings by e-mail.  REQUEST  Those who use the bindings and find bugs, or see room for improvement, please contact me, and I will try to incorporate them in a future release (in case of bugs, a bug-fix of course ;-).

The training course will discuss the applications of satellite data concerning natural resources, renewable energy and the environment.  The training course, organised for the benefit of francophone African experts, will be hosted by ESRIN, the European Space Agency's establishment in Frascati, which is responsible for coordination with the users of data from ESA's remote sensing satellite. Twenty-four experts in the field of remote sensing, selected from 19 francophone countries from northern, western and central Africa, and three regional African centres, will attend the two-week session. The course will focus on remote sensing techniques and data applications, particularly ERS-1 data.  The ERS-1 satellite, developed by ESA and launched in 1991 with the European Ariane launcher, carries an advanced radar instrument and is the first in a series of radar remote sensing missions that will ensure availability of data beyond the year 2000. The aim of the training course is to increase the potential of experts using the practical applications of radar remote sensing systems to natural resources, renewable energy and the environment, with particular emphasis on applications to geology and mineral prospecting, oceanography and near- coastal areas, agriculture, forestry and meteorology.  The education and practical training programme was developed jointly by the United Nations and ESA. The facilities and the technical support, as well as lecturers and information documents for the training course, will be provided by the Agency. Lecturers at the training course will include high-level experts from other European and African organisations active in remote sensing applications. Funds for the training course are being provided by the United Nations    Trust Fund for New and Renewable Sources of Energy; the primary contributor to that Fund is the Government of Italy.\",\"I am a student at UW-Eau Claire.

Any suggestions?\",\"     Yes, but... the minimization of gates is important in part because of TIMING considerations.  A TTL gate has the basic structure of AND/OR/INVERT, and an inversion of a sum of a product is just exactly ONE gate delay.  The reason to find a minimal sum of products is that this matches a hardware optimization.   A positive-OR gate (such as the 9-gate solution uses) has TWO gate delays (and there's another gate delay in the second term) so that the second solution, while simpler in logic symbols, can  be expected to be something less than optimal in the real world. ECL is similar to TTL, in that it can support an OR/AND gate with the minimum delay (unlike TTL, you get both true and inverse outputs for 'free' when using ECL).   PALs are basically large programmable AND/OR/INVERT gates (with your choice of internal connections between the various sections, and perhaps some latches), so a minimum sum of products ALSO is a way to shoehorn a logic design into  a few PALs.  It's not comparably easy to design with a minimization of logic gates, but some software packages claim to allow you to do so, and will take just about any mess of gates (as a nodelist with 74xxx series logic ICs) and produce a description of a logic cell array to do the same job.  Xilinx's XACT software does this by treating each logic block as a macro, and expanding it all out, then simplifying.\",\"  window = XCreateWindow(...);  XSetTransientForHint(display, window, window);  XMapWindow(...);\",\" While others here may have had better experiences, I, too, share the sentiments posted above.

That makes them the best method of defense for the citizenry. Not everybody has the time to train with a gladius, you know, but for some reason those who prey on others seem to have more free time.  To extend this a bit further, you need only a certain level of competence to beat another with a range weapon.  Getting in their face with a weapon and winning is much more difficult, and requires more training time the average citizen just does not have.  I've spent a few years practicing with a sword.  I can take the common person armed with one (though self-defense isn't the reason I own one).  My kid sister would have an even chance of beating me, gun vs. gun, with only a month of training.

In Norway I suspect it was about the only weapon available.  You conquered your land (among others) a full millenia before we were thought of, and shortly thereafter weapons weren't quite so common.  I suspect that a few world wars made a difference too, since in times of emergency weapons tend to be turned in or donated to needy causes.

The time scale and the homogeneous culture are important.  Equally important is a basic philosophical difference in personal versus collective good. In America, the individual is more important than the masses.  Personal liberties are prized above all.  This is, sadly, changing of late, but I trust you notice how this call for freedom makes laws that restrict individuals for little collective benefit hateful to Americans.  I'd hazard a guess that, were America less interested in freedom and personal liberty and more interested in collective good we never would have sent our armed forces anywhere.

But here your message leaves talk of hypothesis and gets back, once again,  to equating the business of science with the end result, the gizmo produced.   My point isn't so much whether or not you have a novel paradigm but *how*  you come about developing it.   Perhaps you'd admit that this is an oversimplification on your part (the topic of the philosophy of science is made for them, I'm making them too) but I think that it also summarizes popular misconceptions of science and the  business of doing science.  Biomedical research doesn't make any basic  assumptions that aren't the same as any other discipline of scientific research.  That is, that you make empirical observations, form an hypothesis and test it.  Modern medicine has much more to do with biochemistry than  \\\"the old Newtonian model of the world\\\".  And I doubt that many psychologists would appreciate being put outside this empirical \\\"world view\\\".  Psychology also has more to do with biochemistry than spoon bending.    Oversimplified, of course, but a good example.  This is an empirical observa- tion.  It was then tested, though perhaps not by Aristotle, and eventually  found wanting.  In the meantime, some folk will  have continued to believe in the spontaneous generation of animal life.   There's nothing at all surprising about this, it's the way the gathering of knowledge works.  There are probably more than a few things in my own  discipline of molecular biology that will be found to be totally off-base, even idiotic, to someone in the future.  These future people won't have come to these relevations because they had suddenly gone all Zen-like and had  a vision in an LSD trip.  Someone will have thought of something new and  tested it.

So I decided to check it out, on my own.  But, then, that was in BN times (Before Net).  So, here are some  references.  See Robin Lane Fox's _The unauthorized version_, (p.284) where  Lane Fox writes, \\\"... the one passage which appears to [comment on Jesus'  career] is agreed to be a Christian addition.\\\"  In my Re:Albert Sabin response (C5u7sJ.391@sunfish.usd.edu) to Jim Lippard (21 April 93), I noted that consensus is typically indicated subtly as in Elaine  Pagel's _The gnostic gospels_ (p.85), to wit:  \\\"A comment *attributed* to Josephus reports ... [emphasis mine]\\\".  Scholars sometimes do not even mention the two Josephus entries, another subtlety reflecting consensus.  So far as I can deduce, today's consensus is built on at least three things:  1) the long passage is way out of context, 2) Origen did not know about the long passage, and 3) the short and long passages are contradictory.  I don't know the references wherein the arguments which led to consensus are orginally developed (does anyone?).  Biblical scholars as I defined them include theologians and historians.  The former, like the latter, incorporate historical, social, technological and ideological contexts as well as theology.  So the distinction is blurred.  I  didn't elaborate on that.  Sorry.  (In turn, historians are compelled to incorporate theology).  Can't say about the number of copies.  These were, however, BG times (Before  Gutenburg).  A hundred first editions seems exceedingly high; counting on one  hand seems more reasonable.  Perhaps those mss. without the long insert (if any, because anything is possible) have been destroyed.  Such a practice is  certainly not foreign to religions.  Anyway, all we have are mss. which have  the two entries.  Lippart (in the message noted above) talks about an Arabic  ms.

I don't think it is a reaction to sugar or junk food per se since Kathryn has never shown any signs of hyperactivity or changes in behavior in response to food. She has always been very calm and dare I say, a neat, smart kid.  The fact that this happened while eating two sugar coated cereals made by Kellog's makes me think she might be having an allergic reaction to something in the coating or the cereals.  Of the four of us in our immediate family, Kathryn shows the least signs of the hay fever, running nose, itchy eyes, etc. but we have a lot of allergies in our family history including some weird food allergies - nuts, mushrooms.

However, the Jews believe that the Covenant between YHWH and the Patriarchs (Abraham and Moses, in this case) establishes a Moral Code to follow for mankind. Even the Jews could not decide where the boundaries fall, though.  As I understand it, the Sadducees believed that the Torah was all that was required, whereas the Pharisees (the ancestors of modern Judaism) believed that the Torah was available for interpretation to lead to an understanding of the required Morality in all its nuances (->Talmud).  The essence of all of this is that Biblical Morality is an interface between Man and YHWH (for a Jew or Christian) and does not necessarily indicate anything about YHWH outside of that relationship (although one can speculate).   The trouble with all of this is that we don't really know what the \\\"created in His image\\\" means. I've heard a number of different opinions on this and have still not come to any conclusion. This rather upsets the Apple Cart if one wants to base a Life Script on this shaky foundation (to mix metaphors unashamedly!) As to living by Christ's example, we know very little about Jesus as a person. We only have his recorded utterances in a set of narratives by his followers, and some very small references from comtemporary historians. Revelation aside, one can only \\\"know\\\" Christ second-hand or worse.  This is not an attempt to debunk Christianity (although it may seem that way initially), the point I`m trying to make is that we only really have the Bible to interpret, and that interpretation is by humanity. I guess this is where Faith or Relevation comes in with all its inherent subjectiveness.   No. There may be an absolute moral code. There are undoubtably multiple moral codes. The multiple moral codes may be founded in the absolute moral code. As an example, a parent may tell a child never to swear, and the child may assume that the parent never swears simply because the parent has told the child that it is \\\"wrong\\\". Now, the parent may swear like a trooper in the pub or bar (where there are no children). The \\\"wrongness\\\" here is if the child disobeys the parent. The parent may feel that it is \\\"inappropriate\\\" to swear in front of children but may be quite happy to swear in front of animals. The analogy does not quite hold water because the child knows that he is of the same type as the parent (and may be a parent later in life) but you get the gist of it? Incidentally, the young child considers the directive as absolute until he gets older (see Piaget) and learns a morality of his own.

To get emergency medical care, anyone so insured must always carry their Blue Cross card. Before entering a hospital, you must notify Blue Cross, or they will refuse to pay your bills.  In an emergency, where you must be treated before notifying them,  you must inform them within 24 hours or (if you are unable to do so for medical reasons) the hospital must. Failing to do so within 24 hours means they will not cover the hospitalization. In you need your card to notify them (and without the card, the hospital certainly wouldn't know they had to.)

According to Luke 3:23     And when he began his ministry, Jesus himself was about     thirty years of age, being supposedly the son of Joseph,    the son of Eli,  Aside from the fact that Mary is not mentioned, there are two possible interpretations: either Joseph was her father or he was her brother. Clearly this is not acceptable.  A third would be that Joseph, the son of Eli, was her Father and just happened to have the name as the man to whom she was betrothed. But that would seem to be grasping at straws. The most straightforward interpretation is that Luke had no intention of tracing Mary's genealogy (in which case he would have named her) but that he traces her husband's, from David's son Nathan.  The Matthew descendant list most definitely traces down from David's son, Solomon, to Joseph.  Matthew 1:16 reads:     And to Jacob was born Joseph, the husband of Mary, by whom was born    Jesus, who is called Christ.   There are two apparent problems.  The first is, how to reconcile the two paternal genealogies - which diverge with the sons of David, Solomon and Nathan.  The second is, why is any genealogy of Joseph relavent at all, if Joseph had nothing to do with it.  If Joseph was not Jesus's physical father, then the original poster is quite correct, that claims for Jesus's messianic heritage are not based on truth but only on appearances, whatever Jesus's divine nature was.  The second problem is easy, in my mind.  We assume that Joseph was not involved in the conception of Jesus in any way.  However, a Holy Spirit capable of working a physical conception in Mary is also capable of employing the physical agency of Joseph's seed in this work.  In our materialistic times we interpret viginity and its loss solely in terms of a physical act, whereas it is really a matter of purity on a much higher level as well.  The important thing is that neither Mary nor Joseph was conscious of any union between them (they had not \\\"known\\\"each other).  Thus the first gospel's dedication of half its opening chapter to the genealogy of Joseph is quite relevant to Jesus, the Virgin birth not- withstanding.  To the first question there is an answer that creates, to begin with, more problems than it resolves.  It is that the two evangelists are relating  the births of two entirely different children of two entirely different sets of parents.  Except for the names of the parents and the child, and  the birthplace in Bethlehem there is no point in common between the two  stories.  Matthew and Luke converge in their accounts only thirty years later with the Baptism of Jesus in Jordan.  Rudolf Steiner offered his explanation of how these accounts begin with two children and then converge with their accounts of the one Jesus of Nazareth.  He did not derive his resolution from biblical study or speculation, or from other external documents, and the discussion of \\\"how this could be\\\" might bring us beyond the limits of appropriateness for this newsgroup.  In any case, the details are described in Steiner's \\\"The Spiritual Guidance of the Human  Being and of Humanity\\\", \\\"The Gospel of St. Luke\\\", and \\\"The Gospel of St. Matthew\\\".   Whether or not Rudolf Steiner's methods and explanation are accepted as valid, at least this interpretation resolves the apparent contradictions of the two genealogies while leaving the text intact.  As for the passing of one's Jewishness through the mother, this was never an issue with Jesus. No one ever questioned his or Mary's Jewishness.  The issue of the genealogies has to do with his paternal line of descent from David, the king.\",\"  As usual, David Sternlight is demonstrating his inability to read. The proposal clearly states:  => The initiative will involve the creation of new products to => accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure => telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.  It speaks about telecommunications in general. Read it again, David. Maybe you'll understand it the next time... Nah, probably not.   That's exactly what the government wants all sheep-minded people to think. Let's look at the current situation. It allows to almost anybody to eavesdrop almost everybody, unless secure (and I mean secure) encryption is used. What will happen when (\\\"if\\\"? Ha! optimists...) the new proposal gets accepted? Almost nobody EXCEPT SOME will be able to eavesdrop everybody else, but the ability of these \\\"some\\\" to eavesdrop will be guaranteed! The proposal emphasizes on the former (\\\"almost nobody\\\") - which is clearly an improvement - and \\\"forgets\\\" to mention the drawbacks of the latter (\\\"guaranteed\\\"). Yes, my statement assumes that the next step will be to make the strong crypto unlawful. You think that it will not happen? Good luck.   It's not just \\\"continued ability\\\". It's -guaranteed- ability.   Yeah, that's exactly what your government wants you to think. Let's take small steps, one at a time. Concentrate on the current one, don't think about the future. Trust us.   It's not asked because the proposal clearly says that this is the intention. They, unlike you, read what they write.   Yes, it will. It will stop the jerk who is eavesdropping now. It will allow only to the government to eavesdrop. (If the scheme is secure, of course, which is yet to be proven.) But how do you know that the jerk you are fearing now will not get a government job tomorrow? The new proposal -guarantees- him the ability to eavesdrop then. Hell, that will even motivate him to get that job - if he indeed is that mentally pervert...   Great. The Greatest Cryptographer of All Times David Sternlight (tm) has succeeded to evaluate the new system in the absense of any details whatsoever and has concluded that it is \\\"highly secure\\\". I guess, that comes from the background of working some 50 years for the two major crypto evaluating companies, right? Gee, now the government can save all that money and trouble to ask a secret council of crypto experts to secretly analyse the new secret method - for David Sternlight has already done all the job for them...   \\\"Trust us, we're from the Government and we're here to help you.\\\"   \\\"Those who are prepared to trade their liberties for the promises of future safety, do not deserve either.\\\" This (or something like that; I don't have the exact quote, but the meaning is the same) has been said by one of your great men. Maybe you should study their works more carefully, if you have the brains to understand them, of course.   The main question is to guarantee to availability of -really- secure cryptography to the masses. Gee, if the proposal was saying \\\"we guarantee that every American will still have the full right to use any kind of encryption s/he would like and regard this proposal as just a default, voluntary implementation\\\", there would have been much less opposition... For some reason, they didn't even try to promise you that. I wonder why... Was Orwell off only by 10 years?   No, in return you get crypto that is guaranteed to be crippled.   While the above is just rumors, and while even if it is true, it is not done -easily-, the new scheme can is guaranteed to be easily breakable by anybody who has the two keys. It might be also breakable by somebody who does not have them but knows the right trick. Or who has only one of them. NSA also told you that DES is secure, why don't you simply trust them, huh?   It is -guaranteed- to be -easily- breakable - just get the keys. It might be even easier, but until there is some evidence, this is just a wild speculation.   The trapdoors -are- there.

It just might be a bad idea for them, too.  OK, suppose the NY State Police want to tap a suspect's phone.  They need a warrant, just like the old days.  But unlike the old days, they now need to      (a) get two federal agencies to give them the two parts of        the key.  Now, what happens if there's a tiff between the two escrow houses? Posession/release of keys becomes a political bargaining chit.  State and lower-level police agencies have to watch the big boys play politics, while potentially good leads disappear, lives and property are lost, statutes of limitations run out, etc.  Not to mention: a moderately clever person who suspects the police are after her/him will be buying new phones faster than tap requests can be processed.  Or using stolen ones.  [Will the Turing Police come and arrest you for transmitting without a dialing license?]  There's also bureacracy and security problems -- within each escrow house,  how will requests for key disclosure be authenticated?  Put in enough safeguards of the kind bureaucrats and activists feel comfortable with, and  it might take a LONG time to get that key.  [Even when a request is approved,  how is the key going to be disclosed?  Will it be encrypted by a Clipper-type chip for transmission?  In a bureaucracy the size of the Federal Government, with a databank of the necessary size, and data traffic of the projected volume, there's going to be a lot of weak links.  How many of  these kinds of problems will be open for public or \\\"expert\\\" scrutiny?]    Furthermore, the Feds might be leery of handing completed keys around,  even to State Police agencies: a trust and security issue.  This would be  an especially acute issue if some other State's Police had mishandled a  key, resulting in lawsuits, financial settlements, and political  embarassment.  So, the Feds implement it this way:      (b) some federal agency gets the keys, performs the tap, and        turns the results over to the NY State Police.  But let's say Cuomo's been causing some problems over a Clinton Aid-To-Urban-Areas proposal.  Or there just happens to be a turf war going on between the State cops and the Justice department on a case. Now, not only do we have the keys as a political chit, we have an extra player in the game *and* we have the tap's tapes as another bargaining chit.  Again, the State Police lose.

Further striking bigoted and racist attitude of  certain Greeks still exists in our day. Most Greeks insist even  today, that the 537 year-old capital of the Ottoman Empire should  be called not by its rightful name of Istanbul, but by its half  a millennium-old moniker 'Cons*(whatever).'  Everyone knows that New York City was once called 'New Amsterdam' but Dutch people do not persist on calling it that today. The name  of Stalingrad too is long gone, replaced by Volgagrad. China's Peking traded its name for Beiging long ago. Ciudad Trujillo of the Dominican Republic is now Santa Domingo. Zimbabve's old colonial capital Salisburry became Harrare. These changes have all been accepted officially by everyone in the world.  But, Greeks are still determined on calling the Turkish Istanbul  by the name of 'Cons*.'  How can one explain this total intransigence? What makes Greeks so different from other mortals? 18-year-old questionable democracy? Why don't they seem to reconcile with the fact, for instance, that Istanbul changed hands 537 years ago in 1453 AD, and that this predates the discovery of the New  World, by 39 years. The declaration of U.S. independence in 1776 will come 284 years later.  Shouldn't then, half a millennium be considered enough time for  'Cons*' to be called a Turkish city? Where is the logic in the  Greek reasoning, if there is any? How long can one sit on the  laurels of an ancient civilization? Ancient Greece does not exist,  any more than any other 16 civilizations that existed on the soil  of Anatolia.  These undereducated 'wieneramus' live with an illusion. It  is the same mentality which allows them to rationalize that Cyprus is a Greek Island. No history book shows that it ever was. It belonged to the Ottoman Turks 'lock, stock and barrel' for a period of well over 300 years.  In fact, prior to the Turks' acquisition of it, following bloody naval battles with the Venetians in 1570 AD, the island of Cyprus belonged, invariably, to several nations:  The Assyrians, the Sumerians, the Phoenicians, the Egyptians, the Ottoman Turks, of course in that order, owned it as  their territory. But, it has never been the possession of the government of Greece - not even for one day - in the history of the world. Moreover, Cyprus is located 1500 miles from the Greek mainland, but only  40 miles from Turkiye's southern coastline.  Saddam Hussein claims that Kuwait was once Iraqi territory and the Greek Cypriot government and  the terrorist Greek governments think that Cyprus also was once part of the Greek hegemony.  Those 'Arromdians' involved in this grandiose hallucination should wake up from their sweet daydreams and confront  reality. Again, wishful thinking is unproductive, only  facts count.  As for Selanik,    <<Those Jews who survived these assaults in Southeastern Europe fled   particularly to Salonica, whose Jewish population increased substantially   as a result, from 28,000 in 1876 to 90,000 in 1908, more than half the   total population, though even there increased persecution by local Greeks   led many Jews to flee elsewhere in the Ottoman Empire, particularly to   the great port of Izmir.    Despite all the pressure from Ottomans and foreign Jews alike, the ritual   murders and other assaults by Christians on Jews went on and on. Greek   efforts to decimate the Jewish population of Salonica culminated in 1912   and 1913, following Greek conquest of Salonica during the first Balkan War,   when many of its Jews, were either killed or terrorized into leaving...>>    <<Though Greece was obligated by the post World War I treaties to allow   Jews and other minorities to use their own languages in education and to   practice their religions without hindrance, a law was issued in 1923   which forbad all inhabitants from working on Sunday, stimulating a new   Jewish exodus as it was intended to do. Between 1932 and 1934 there was a   series of anti-Semitic riots in Salonica, with the Cambel quarter, where   most of the remaining Jews lived, being burned to the ground. This   was followed by regulations requiring the use of Greek and prohibiting   Hebrew and Judea-Spanish in the Jewish schools. A start was made also   on expropriating the land of the principal Jewish cemetery in Salonica   for use by the new University in order to derive the Jews out [47]. By   killing and driving out large numbers of Jews, the Greeks left a   substantial Greek majority in the city for the first time, and starting   Salonica Jewry on the way to its final decimation by the Nazis during the   occupation of Greece starting in 1941.    Salonica and Izmir of course were not the only places of refuge for   Jewish refugees entering the Empire during its last century of existence.   Istanbul, Edirne, and other parts of Rumelia and Anatolia received   thousands more. Nor were Jews the only refugees received and helped by   the government of the Sultan. Thousands of Muslims accompanied them in   flight from similar persecutions wherever Balkan christian states gained   independence or expanded. The Russian conquest of the Crimea and the   Caucasus starting in the late eighteenth century, and particularly during   and after the Crimean War, combined with the same independence movements   in Southeastern Europe that had caused so much suffering and flight among   its Jews caused thousands of helpless, ill, and poverty-stricken Muslim   refugees to accompany them into the ever shrinking boundaries of the   Ottoman Empire, with the Istanbul government struggling mightly but vainly   to house and feed them as best it could. From 1850 to 1864 as many as   800,000 Crimean Tatars, Circassians, and other Muslims from north and   east of the Black Sea had entered Anatolia alone, as many as 200,000 more   came during the next twenty years, while 474,389 refugees entered in 1876-   1877 as a result of the Ottoman wars with Russia and the Balkan states,   with an equal number gaining refuge in the European portions of the   Empire.>>  [47] Robert Mantran, 'La structure sociale de la communaute juive de   Salonqiue a la fin du dix-neuvieme siecle', RH no.534 (1980), 391-92;   Nehama VII, 762; Joseph Nehama (Salonica) to AIU (Paris) no.2868/2,   12 May 1903 (AIU Archives I-C-43); and no.2775, 10 January 1900 (AIU   Archives I-C-41), describing daily battles between Jewish and Greek   children in the streets of Salonica.

The heat source is a 100 watt light bulb.  Basically, it's a vertical wooden box with ventilation holes in the top and bottom (lots of them, you want the air to flow).  The light bulb goes in the bottom, and wire cake racks are spaced every 6\\\" starting about 10\\\" above the bulb.  Or, at a slightly higher cost in electricity, you can do what I do:  Use your oven.  (NOTE - I do this in an electric oven; some gas ovens may not have a low enough setting).  Put food to be dried on cookie tins or racks in the oven.  Set oven to 140 degrees (the lowest setting on my oven - if yours goes down to 120 that's probably even better.)  Stick a wooden spoon or something across the front corner of the oven and close the door on the spoon so that it stays open about an inch - this allows for airflow.  Leave the stuff in the oven for 6 to 8 hours; check it often, since this dries it much faster than the dehydrator.  If you are using cookie sheets instead of racks, turn the stuff over halfway through.

BTW Love the sinner hate the sin is a slippery slope, with hatred at the bottom.    INCREDIBLY CHOPPED UP POST I won't even try to tell you where the deletions came out    I find that I am dissatisfied with the little purposes that we can manufacture for ourselves.  Little in the cosmic sense.  Even the greatest of the great pharos are long gone, the pyramids historical oddities being worn down by the wind, eventually to be turned into dust. Mankind itself will one day perish.  Without some interconnectedness that transcends the physical, without God, it is all pointless in the end.  Most people are able to live with that, and for them little purposes (success, money, power, effecting change, helping others) suffice.  I suppose they never  think about the cosmic scale, or are at least able to put it out of their minds.  To me, it is comforting to know that reality is an illusion.  That the true reality underneath the the physical is spirit.  That this world is a school of sorts, where we learn and grow, and our souls mature.  That gives a purpose to my little purposes, and takes some of the pressure off.  It's not so necessary to make this life a success in human terms if you're really just here to learn.  It's more important to progress, grow, persist, to learn to love yourself and others and to express your love, especially when it's dificult to do so.  Honest effort is rewarded by God, he knows our limitations.    Interesting theological question.  I have a feeling that most common perception of eternal life is WAY off base.

Brendan Shanahan tied the game 3-3 and Brett Hull scored the game winner 17 seconds later. Jeff Brown and Denny Felsner scored the other Blues goals. Brian Noonan had the hat trick for the Hawks, who also had some very good goaltending from Ed Belfour. Blues goalie Curtis Joseph was solid down the stretch to preserve the Blues lead.  The Hawks came out strong in the first period, outshooting the Blues 6-1 and taking a 1-0 lead on Noonan's first goal. Right after an interference penalty on Rick Zombo had expired, Keith Brown intercepted a clearing attempt at the blue line and passed the puck to Steve Larmer in the right circle. Larmer fired a long slap shot, and Noonan deflected the puck between Joseph's pads. After the goal, the Blues picked up the intensity and went on to outshoot the Hawks 10-9 in the first period.  Jeff Brown tied the game 1-1 at 3:12 of the second. Nelson Emerson broke in on the left side, got by Craig Muni and pushed the puck across the slot. Belfour came out to play the pass and shoveled it to the right boards, where Brown collected it and slapped it in before Belfour could get back to the goal.  Two minutes later on a Hawks power play, Belfour stopped Rich Sutter on a short-handed break-in. Chris Chelios picked up the puck and passed it to Jeremy Roenick who carried it on right wing and found an open Noonan with a nice pass across the slot. Noonan fired it past Joseph at 5:30 for the 2-1 lead.  Noonan completed his hat trick 3:11 later to increase the Hawks' lead to 3-1. Stephane Matteau made a nice pass from the right boards to Noonan who beat Stephane Quintal by driving to the net. Joseph had no chance as Noonan deflected the puck in the net.  Denny Felsner reduced the Blues deficit to 3-1 at 12:49 after picking up the rebound of Basil McRae's slap shot from the slot. Janney set up McRae for the shot, and the puck sailed wide of the net and bounced off the end boards to Felsner. Felsner sticked the rebound into the partially open net. The Blues outshot the Hawks 10-5 in the second period.  With the Blackhawks leading 3-2 at 9:56 of the third, Stephane Matteau picked up a high sticking penalty. Just 53 seconds into the power play, Steve Smith was called for slashing, giving the Blues a 5-on-3 advantage for 1:07.  The Blues didn't waste time as Brendan Shanahan scored just 23 seconds into the two-man advantage to tie the game 3-3. Janney found Hull in the slot, and Hull fired a rocket at Belfour. Jeff Brown collected the rebound and passed it to Shanahan in the left circle. Shanahan beat Belfour from a sharp angle.  Just 17 seconds later, Hull scored the game winner for the Blues. Nelson Emerson broke in on right wing, carried the puck behind the net along with two Hawks defensemen. Emerson made a nice pass to an unchecked Hull in the slot, and Hull beat Belfour to put the Blues up 4-3.  The Hawks had several chances to tie the game in the final minutes, but Joseph made some brilliant saves to prevent the Hawks from scoring. He stopped Troy Murray point blank from just right of the crease with 2:30 left in the game. The Blues killed off a late Hawks power play, with Rich Sutter clearing the puck with his hand as it was trickling along the goal line. The Blues held on to win the game. The Hawks oushot the Blues 13-7 in the third period, totaling 27 shots on goal for each team. The Blues special teams were excellent in the game. The Blues killed 6 of 7 Hawks power plays, and scored twice on on four power play chances. The Blues ranked among the best special teams in the league. They rank 2nd in penalty killing and 3rd on the power play.

Salam,  John Absood\",\"To the best of my knowledge there aren't any problems with Quadras and blind transfers.  Trouble with blind transfers usually means the programmer screwed up the TIBs or didn't test their driver with the device in question. Well designed TIBs poll or loop at every point where delays of >16\\u00b5sec occur. This usually occurs at the first byte of each block of a transfer but some devices can \\\"hiccup\\\" in the middle of blocks.  If this happens in the middle of a blind transfer there is the possibility of losing or gaining a byte depending on which direction the tranfer was going.  In anycase the SCSI Manager will eventually return a phase error at the end of the transaction because it is out of sync.  Actual data loss would only occur if the driver didn't pay attention to the errors coming back.

First of all I would say that I'm not sure all the prophecies had double-fulfillment, e.g., the Isaiah 7:14 prophecy.  I would say that just because this happens on some occasions does not mean it will occur always, especially with regard to NT prophecies. The apostles who quoted the OT and applied those passages to Jesus were acting as divine messengers and giving the inerrant Word of God to the Church.  No one has that authority today.  No one has the apostolic authority to say that such-and-such a prophecy has double-fulfillment.

There is virtual certainty that there is an internal ajustment for the offset control's zero detent position.  2)  Verify that the function generator is properly loaded.

I would beg to differ with you here.  The properly-formed conscience can be trusted virtually ALL the time.  I am not so sure, though, about something so materialistic as the human brain.  Does that mass of tissue possess anything trustworthy?  Your observation would probably be valid if we were discussing the \\\"mind\\\" of an animal, but the human being is only half animal, as it were; and half spiritual.   ?At the moment he stops speaking, and people start interpreting, the ?possibility of error appears.  Did he mean that literally or not?  We do ?not have any record that he elaborated on the words.  Was he thinking of ?Tran- or Con- substatiation?   He didn't say.  We interpret this passage ?using our brains; we think and reason and draw conclusions.  But we know ?that our brains are not perfect: our thinking often leads us wrong.  (This ?is something that most of us have direct experience of.  8-)  Now you have hit on the purpose of the Church.  It is by necessity the infallible interpreter of divine revelation.  Without the Church,           Christianity would be nothing more than a bunch of little divisive sects.   ?Unless you are infallible, there are very few things you can be certain ?of.  To the extent that doctrines rely on fallible human thinking, they ?cannot be certain.  This argument of yours regarding the certainty of an observation or a conclusion is not necessarily substantiated by experience.  It reminds me of the theoretical physicist who said that you can never be certain of a measurment because the sensor interferes with the field you are trying to measure.  Now, the experimental physicist will reply that although the measurement can never be made with absolute certainty, he is able to determine the certainty with which the measurement can be made, and this knowledge is often sufficient to render the measurement useful enough to allow evidence of the true condition of the field under observation. Therefore, although our minds are finite and susceptible to error, our competence in arriving at inductive insights gives confidence in our ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true, even in areas not subject to the experimental method.   ?Darren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu ?\\\"If any substantial number of  [ talk.religion.misc ]  readers read some ?

The initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.  For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.  Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.  A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" has been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new, relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today.  This new technology will help companies protect proprietary information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals.   A \\\"key-escrow\\\" system will be established to ensure that the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique                                   2   \\\"keys,\\\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately in two \\\"key-escrow\\\" data bases that will be established by the Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap.  The \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans.  To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings.  The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield criminals and terrorists.  We need the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" and other approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system), the President has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:       --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to           employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;       --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone           calls and data, under proper court or other legal           order, when necessary to protect our citizens;       --   the effective and timely use of the most modern           technology to build the National Information           Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and           the competitiveness of American industry in the global           marketplace; and        --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export           high technology products.  The President has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.                                    3  The Administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a National Information Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks (\\\"information superhighways\\\") will transmit video, images, HDTV programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone system transmits voice.  Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law.  Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet.  The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available.

A:   No.  \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with      no new authorities to access the content of the private      conversations of Americans.  Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on      a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation      encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to      decipher the message?  A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a      court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They      would then present documentation of this authorization to      the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and      obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug      smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are      stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key      escrow system.  Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?  A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent      entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the      Administration have yet to determine which agencies will      oversee the key-escrow data banks.  Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure      how strong the security is?    A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption      systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will      remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow      system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of      cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all      potential users that there are no unrecognized      vulnerabilities.  Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?  A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the      Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in      this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the      President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet      officials.  Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?  A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on      encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify      as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have      briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the      decisions related to this initiative.  Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?  A:   The government designed and developed the key access      encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the      microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product      manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip      manufacturer that produces them.  Q:   Who provides the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\"?  A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,      California, and will sell the chip to encryption device      manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed      to other vendors in the future.  Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices?   A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating      the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" into their devices.       Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological      solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be      willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more      powerful encryption devices?  A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be      considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow      mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product      that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive      than others readily available today, but it is just one      piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to      encryption technology, which the Administration is      developing.       The Administration is not saying, \\\"since encryption      threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,      we will prohibit it outright\\\" (as some countries have      effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \\\"every      American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an      unbreakable commercial encryption product.\\\"  There is a      false \\\"tension\\\" created in the assessment that this issue is      an \\\"either-or\\\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,      and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,      balanced approach such as is proposed with the \\\"Clipper      Chip\\\" and similar encryption techniques.  Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton      Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from      that of the Bush Administration?    A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption      technology in telecommunications and computing and are      committed to working with industry and public-interest      groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'      privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law      enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime      and terrorism.  Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use      the government hardware?\",\"For sale --------  STR-AV1070 Audio Receiver ------------------------- 120 Watts per channel Dolby Surround sound with Pro Logic Learning Programmable remote 10 Watts per channel for surround sound Supports Dual Room Link Control (to hear another source in a different room) Index filing of all radio stations 7 band equilizer with real-time analyzer  I need to get $450 for this unit or best offer.

A thirty bit serial number. And, we are told, the unit key U is derived deterministically from this serial number. That means that there are only one billion possible unit keys.     To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is    first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.    S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a    64-bit block R1:      R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .     Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and    N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:        R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1]      R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .     R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The    first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The    rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2    are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow    agencies.  Hmmm. We must assume that generating the unit key U from the serial number N rather than generating it from a randomly selected U1 and U2 is an intentional way of assuring a \\\"fail safe\\\" for the government -- U is completedly determined given S1, S2 and N. If S1 and S2 do not change they constitute effective \\\"master keys\\\" (along with F), the theft of which (or the possession of which by various authorities) completely obviates the security of the system. However, more interestingly, we know, for a fact that if S1 and S2 are fixed no matter what the keyspace for U is no more than 2^30. Why not pick U1 and U2 at random? Why this interesting restriction of they key space if it NOT to provide an additional back door?  I find it disturbing that at the very best my security is dependant on approximately 30 bytes worth of information that could be written on the back of a napkin.  Even if S1 and S2 change periodically, the rationale behind this restriction in the size of the keyspace seems strange if one is assuming that the goal is security -- and makes perfect sense if the goal is an illusion of security.  If S1 and S2 do not change, even if they remain secret I wonder if they can somehow be back-derived given enough unit key/serial number pairs. We are assured that this cannot happen -- but no one understands how Skipjack works outside of government officials and, soon, foreign intelligence services that gain the information via espionage. Presumably we will eventually have the information as well -- reverse engineering gets more and more advanced every year -- but by the time we know it may be too late.     As a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are    written onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a    file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part    U1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third    disk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent    2 takes the second disk.  The third disk is used to program the chips.    After the chips are programmed, all information is discarded from the    vault and the agents leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional    assurance that no information is left behind.  None of this makes me feel the least bit secure. The silly notion of \\\"destroying the laptop\\\" appears to be yet another bizarre distraction. We all know that you can't read data from DRAM that has been turned off for more than a few moments. On the other hand, what we don't know is why there is a need to generate the unit keys from S1 and S2 in the first place other than to weaken the system. We don't know if the agents in question would resist a million in cash a piece for their information -- its probably worth hundreds of million, so you can make the bribe arbitrarily hard to resist. And to tell you the truth, doing this in a \\\"vault\\\" rather than in Joe Random Tempest-shielded Room with a laptop computer seems like melodrama designed to make high-school dropouts from Peoria impressed -- but it does very little for most of the rest of us.     The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the    room instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2,    and the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to    the escrow agencies.  What would this provide? Lets say the escrow agencies are the ACLU and the NRA and their agents personally take back the disks and are always honest. Who cares? The NSA must be laughing out loud, because they have the algorithm to regenerate U given N and likely don't need to steal they keys as they effectively already have them.  -- Perry Metzger  pmetzger@shearson.com\",\"Hi there,  We are running a 120 node Token ring with Windows 3.1 and Novell 3.11.  Every once in a while, we run into \\\"The Black Screen of Death\\\", a phrase coined by Robert X. Cringely in a recent InfoWorld column.    Basically, sometimes when you quit Windows, the screen goes black and you get a nice little flashing cursor in the top left corner of your screen.  Also, sometimes when you exit to DOS, the same effect occurs. Cringely hints that Microsoft and/or Novell has a patch for Windows' virtual interrupt controller that  may solve this.  Neither company seems to know what I am talking about when I call them.  Has anyone else noticed this phenomenon?    Is there a fix for it?

The problem is, in a nutshell, this: the Liturgy is a symbolic action - in other words Catholics do [or should] believe that the _signs_ during the mass - Water, Blessings, Vestments, Altar, Relics, etc - are real. That is the sprinkling of water bestows real, almost tangible, holiness, the Vestments are a real indication of real sacred time. The point of a _symbol_ is that it is understood by all to be connected to an underlying REAL referent. This kind of thinking precludes analysis; holy water is not holy because of anything, it simply IS holy.  But, modern westerners find it extremely difficult, especially if well- educated, to think of the mass as a symbol. We are more likely to see it as a _sign_, ie an action that represents grace, but which could be replaced with other signs. In concrete terms, this means the mass has become a commercial for God's grace rather than the real thing. You can mess around with a commercial in a way you wouldn't dare with the real thing [ask Coca-Cola Co.!]. These attitudes have been encouraged by Liturgy workshops, etc. which instead of focusing on _how_ to do do liturgy, have focused on how to create a meaning in liturgy. You can only create signs, symbols have to come from God [or the heart, or somewhere deeper than analysis. The most dramatic example of this shift in understanding has been in the treatment of the sacred species [the consecrated host and wine]. Now, with pita bread etc, it is common to come away from the altar with hands covered in particles. If the Host is a sign of Grace, this isnt and issue; but Catholics in the past would have been distraught at this real desacration of the real symbol of Jesus' body.  Modern Catholic liturgy  is caught in this epistemological shift. We try to perfrom the old rites, but then we have some liturgomaniac priest get up and 'explain' what we are doing - so we stop doing it and start pretending to do it. This is not a soul filling experience. It doesn't help BTW that we have got stuck witha huge amount of two and three chord ersatz-folk music [again a result of mis-analysis: complicated tunes are in fact easier to remember than simple ones - this was the genius of Wesley and the 19C Anglican hymn writers]. Taize' is only slightly better.  What are we to do? Well I suggest rejecting the parish system if it doesn't work for you. Search out a Church where the liturgy is well prepared not well-explained. They exist in every city. This is not BTW a matter of particular style: the music might be old or new. It is the attitude of the church that counts. Also, note that a conservative liturgy - harking back to pre-Vatican II days, does not necessarily mean the Church will be socially conservative.  In NYC I can recommend:  Corpus Christi - W 12st St.  Corpus Christi - W 12st St. - very conservative liturgy,   St. Joseph's, Greenwich Village.  - Modern, \\\"clean\\\", largely gay  Oratorian Church, Brooklyn - Very beautiful  Avoid, anywhere, anytime a church with electric candles.

It *may* be possible to improve your technique if you have no idea what it is, through trial and error, but it is not very effective methodology. Only by understanding the technique of steering a motorcycle can one improve on that technique (I hold that this applies to any human endeavor).   Do you consider an understanding of the physics of traction absurd? Are you seriously suggesting that one can form a traction management policy without understanding what it is or what factors increase or decrease available traction?  Braking?

For most of his riding life this may not be a problem, but in an emergency situation it is very definately placing him at a disadvantage.   I disagree.  The existance and immense success of riding courses which teach the technique indicate that the concept can be taught in a manner that is neither confusing, nor detracts from any other aspects of the course.   Perhaps, but in the ensuing discussion, you strayed far from that point, to claim that knowledge of steering technique is irrelevant to a rider's ability.

Our lawyers do not work on contingency, so that if you were to sue for malpractice then you'd better be sure of winning to cover your fees ... likewise, if you were a doctor and subject of a suit, it's time to sweat.   A few weeks ago, the president of the Canadian MA wrote a letter to the NYT to decry a lobbyist's advert repeating the same old trash. This is significant because the AMA and the CMA are interlinked organizations and he would not have done it without the approval  of his AMA cronies.   It serves the same purpose as the Bethesda Naval Hospital ... since not all hospitals can provide everything, maybe they have some stuff that others don't?

The rest has to be made up for by billings from patients who use their services.   The GDP figures are combined public and private expenditures for total outlay, and  are compiled use the same methods by the OECD that yield  the 13-14% figure for the U.S.   How?  They are collecting premiums ... and I'm an advocate of having copayments like the French do in their system in order to make it look more like the real insurance that it is.

Most of OHIP comes from separate premiums on your paycheck if you are a player ...  he wants to spend our money on other things than the health insurance.  Our high taxes are high for other spending but health insurance, which is separate and optional, and it is being  spent in a nonpartisan manner by every party. )-;  OHIP is just a health insurance plan; it does not provide any kind of health care, that is up to you and your private doctors.   Some of the companies providing extra insurance are subsidiaries of American companies, and their parents provide full insurance down here.  Regardless, all firms up north can easily turn on cable TV to see how well the American firms are doing by being involved in basic coverage.

The scenario you outline is reasonably  consistent, but all the evidence that I am familiar with not only does not support it, but indicates something far different. The Earth, by latest estimates, is about 4.6 billion years old, and has had life for about 3.5 billion of those years. Humans have only been around for (at most) about 200,000 years. But, the fossil evidence inidcates that life has been changing and evolving, and, in fact, disease-ridden, long before there were people. (Yes, there are fossils that show signs of disease... mostly bone disorders, of course, but there are some.) Heck, not just fossil evidence, but what we've been able to glean from genetic study shows that disease has been around for a long, long time. If human sin was what brought about disease (at least, indirectly, though necessarily) then how could it exist before humans?  [deletions]   Uh... I know of many evolutionary biologists, who know more about biology than you claim to, who will strongly disagree with this. There is no evidence that the human genetic code (or any other) 'started off' in perfect condition. It seems to adapt to its envionment, in a collective sense. I'm really curious as to what you mean by 'the degeneration of the genetic code'.    Umm. Nah, we seem to do a pretty good job of adapting to viruses and bacteria, and they to us. Only a very small percentage of microlife is harmful to humans... and that small percentage seems to be reasonalby constant in size, but the ranks keep changing. For example, bubonic plague used to be a really nasty disease, I'm sure you'll agree. But it still pops up from time to time, even today... and doesn't do as much damage. Part of that is because of better sanitation, but even when people get the disease, the symptoms tend to be less severe than in the past. This seems to be partly because people who were very susceptible died off long ago, and because the really nasty variants 'overgrazed', (forgive the poor terminology, I'm an engineer, not a doctor! :-> ) and died off for lack of nearby hosts.  I could be wrong on this, but from what I gather acne is only a few hundred years old, and used to be nastier, though no killer. It seems to be getting less nasty w/age...    Now, wait a minute. I have a question. Humans were created perfect, right? And, you admit that we have an inbuilt abiliy to fight off disease. It seems unlikely that Satan, who's making the diseases, would also gift humans with the means to fight them off. Simpler to make the diseases less lethal, if he wants survivors. As far as I can see, our immune systems, imperfect though they may (presently?) be, must have been built into us by God. I want to be clear on this: are you saying that God was planning ahead for the time when Satan would be in charge by building an immune system that was not, at the time of design, necessary? That is, God made our immune systems ahead of time, knowing that Adam and Eve would sin and their descendents would need to fight off diseases?    Here's another puzzle. What, exactly, do you mean by 'perfect' in the phrase, 'created... perfect and without flaw'? To my mind, a 'perfect' system would be incapable of degrading over time. A 'perfect' system that will, without constant intervention, become imperfect is *not* a perfect system. At least, IMHO.  Or is it that God did something like writing a masterpiece novel on a bunch of gum wrappers held together with Elmer's glue? That is, the original genetic 'instructions' were perfect, but were 'written' in inferior materials that had to be carefully tended or would fall apart? If so, why could God not have used better materials?  Was God *incapable* of creating a system that could maintain itself, of did It just choose not to?

Most of the content of the White House announcements was in what was *not* said.  It gives us almost nothing of value, threatens to take away a lot, and does it with a sincere smile on its face, and the nice friendly word \\\"Management\\\".           FACT SHEET        PUBLIC ENCRYPTION MANAGEMENT  The first thing it doesn't say is \\\"We're giving you stronger encryption\\\". what it says is     the U. S. Government has developed a microcircuit that not only    provides privacy through encryption that is substantially more robust    than the current government standard, but also permits escrowing of    the keys needed to unlock the encryption.  The system for the    escrowing of keys will allow the government to gain access to    encrypted information only with appropriate legal authorization. But DES is strong enough that only the government can break it now, so the major effect is to make it EASIER for government to break! *At best* it makes it more difficult for the NSA to break, since they need to get one of the two escrowed keys to do a brute-force search for the other 40-bit key.  Similarly, it didn't say \\\"We're making encryption is commercially available.\\\" because encryption *is* already commercially available, including forms the NSA may not be able to break, like triple-DES or IDEA. And phone companies could offer DES-based systems *now* if they were convinced the government would let them and they could make enough money.  The next thing it didn't say is \\\"We're making encryption legal\\\", because of course encryption *has always been* legal, and the President can't change the First Amendment merely by decree. What it *did* say was:  In making this decision, I do not intend to prevent the  private sector from developing, or the government from approving,  other microcircuits or algorithms that are equally effective in  assuring both privacy and a secure key- escrow system. which clearly means \\\"We're making encryption illegal unless we get your keys. Soon.  Once business buys into this.\\\"  Another thing it didn't say is \\\"We're going to ask Congress for money to do *lots* more wiretapping\\\", because of course, there's a budget crisis, and Congress might debate the policy issues or not give them the cash. What it *did* say was:    The Attorney General will procure and utilize encryption devices to    the extent needed to preserve the government's ability to conduct    lawful electronic surveillance and to fulfill the need for secure    law enforcement communications.  Further, the Attorney General    shall utilize funds from the Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture    Super Surplus Fund to effect this purchase. which means \\\"We've got money Congress can't control and we're going to buy lots of wiretapping equipment with it to detect NON-APPROVED CRYPTO (that's what \\\"preserve the government's ability to conduct ... surveillance\\\"  means.)  \",\"  No, Brent that would be alt.sex.bondage.holly.silva.goofy.anti.semite.... :) \",\"Does anyone out there have any info on the up and coming fall comdex '93?

The New Testament does not quote Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, Ruth, Job, Ecclesiastes, or Song of Songs, just as it does not quote from the Deuterocanon.  But if the non-quotation of the former does not disqualify them, neither does the non-quotation of the later.  And the Wisodm of Solomon was quite clearly an influence on St. Paul, especially in the letter to the Romans (cf especially Romans 1.18-32 and Wisdom 13-14).  [stuff deleted]    True.  Not all accepted them as Scripture, though niether were all the books of the New Testament so accepted, which puts to the lie the whole argument of the books being excluded because they were debated and not universally accepted.  Hebrews, the Apocalypse, 2 Peter, Esther, and others were debated at various times, but eventually retained.  As for the Codexes you mention, both Vaticanus and Sinaitcus include the Deuterocanon, bothe of the New and Old Testaments, and Vaticanus (I think) inlcudes 1 Clement, the Shepard of Hermas, and the Epistle of Baranabas.  As for the Muratorian Canon, it deals with the New Testament only, though it is very valuable in its witness to those books.     You're not wrong!  It is a `tradition of men' to exlcude them, as I will explain below.  \\\"That nothing be read in the Church under the nmae of Divine Scripture, except the canonical Scriptures, and the canoncial Scriptures are - Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, Four books of Kingdoms [being 1&2 Samuel and 1&2 Kings], Two books of Paralpomenon [being 1&2 Chronicles], Job, the Psalter of David, the Five books of Solomon [being Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, Wisdom of Solomon, and [misatributed to him] the Wisdom of Jesus son of Sirach], The books of the Twelve (Minor) Prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah [being Jeremiah, the Lamentations, Baruch, and the Letter, all of which were formerly counted as one], Ezekiel, Daniel, Tobit, Judith, Esther, Two books of Ezra [being Ezra and Nehemiah], Two books of Maccabees.  And of the New Testament: Four books of the Gospel, One book of the Acts of the Apostles, Thirteen letters of Paul the Apostle, One Letter of the same to the Hebrews, two of Peter the Apostle, Three of John, One of the Apostle Jude, One of the Apostle James, One book of the Apocalypse of John.\\\"  -Council of Hippo, Statute 36, (393 AD)   This same list was promulgated again at the Third Council of Carthage (397 AD), and at the Sixth Council of Carthage (419 AD) - at which council the same list was enumerated with the words \\\"Because we have recieved from the Fathers that these are the books to be read in the Church.\\\"  Which ought to quiet those who assert \\\"in the name of Holy Scripture we do understand those books of whose authority there was never any doubt in the Church,\\\" as the Episcopal Church does in removing the Deuterocanon from the realm of Scripture.  (Though the Episcopalians hold them in high regard and read them in the Church, they are not counted as Scripture by them, and may not be used to prove dogma.  The Lutherans hold out similarly.)  Earlier mention of the so-called Apocrypha as divine scripture can also be found, and below I inlcude only a portion of the quotes calling it divine scripture that could be found among the writings of the Fathers.  \\\"And this is the reason why the Law of the old Testament is reckoned as consisting of twenty-two books: so that they may correspond to the number of letters [in the Hebrew alphabet]....

The Trib. would run a graphic of a handgun.  The Examiner would not have a Traders ad at all.  Over the past year while Oakland politicians have made a lot of noise about measures to fight crime the Trib stopped taking the Traders ad, then started publishing it, but without any handgun graphic, then stopped, then started.  Since the Trib. was sold some months ago it has not had the Traders ad.  During one of these non-ad interludes a Traders employee told me that the Trib. had refused to take their ads.

JCAG and SDPA claim responsibility.   Source: Edward K. Boghosian, \\\"Radical Group Hosts Well-Attended Solidarity Meeting,\\\" The Armenian Reporter, May 1, 1986, pp. 1 & 18.  ATHENS, Greece - An array of representatives of Greek political parties, including the ruling PASOK party, and a host of political groups, both Armenian and non-Armenian, joined to voice their solidarity with the  Armenian people in their pursuit of their cause and activities of a new Armenian political force were voiced here on Sunday, April 20 during the 2nd International Meeting of Solidarity with the Armenian People. And judging from encouraging messages offered by the representatives of these political groups and organizations, at least here in Greece, the Armenian Cause enjoys abundant support from a wide spectrum of the political world.  The International Meeting of Solidarity was sponsored by the Greek branch of the Armenian Popular Movement, a comparatively new political force headed by younger generations of Armenians, who openly profess their support of the armed struggle and of the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA). The organization has branches in various European and Middle Eastern countries and the United States although some of these branches appear to have gone through a switch of loyalties because of the split within the ranks of ASALA...  Voicing the support of PASOK, the ruling party in Greece, to the Armenian people, was Mr. Charalambidi Michalis, a member of the Central Committee of the party and the Greek member of the Permanent People's Tribunal... Explaining the goals and aspirations of the Armenian Popular Movement  was Ara Sarkisian. Significant was the address delivered by Mr. Bassam  Abu-Salim, on behalf of the Popular Front for the movement's continued  support of the Armenians' armed struggle in their pursuit of their cause,  pledging that Palestinian operated and run training camps would always be  open to Armenian youth who need training for such a struggle. Later, Mr.  Abu-Salim, answering a question put to him by this writer, affirmed that  his organization had always trained Armenian members of ASALA and that this policy will continue. \\\"The doors of our camps are always open to  Armenian freedom fighters,\\\" he affirmed.  Among the prominent Greek politicians who attended the conference was the son of Prime Minister Papandreou, who himself holds a post in the Greek cabinet; two members of the Cypriot Parliament who had journeyed to Athens for the specific purpose of attending the international gathering; representatives of the Christian Democratic party, EDIK Center party, two wings of the Communist party, representatives of an assortment of labor unions and trade associations, a number of mayors of Greek towns and cities; two Greek members of the European Parliament and other members of the Greek Parliament were also among those who participated in the international conference. Also on hand to follow the deliberations was the ambassador of Bulgaria in Athens.  More than significant was the large number of messages received by the  organizers, including the following: Palestinian National Revolutionary Movement, Fatah; Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command; the Central Committee of the Palestinian National Liberation Movement-Fatah; the Socialist Progressive Party of Lebanon; Arab Socialist Labor Party; the Kurdistan Democratic Union of Iraq; and numerous other international groups, all noted for their radical stand in the Israeli- Palestinian conflict.                   SUPPORT FROM ARF-RM  Among messages received from Armenian groups was the Armenian Revolutionary Federation-Revolutionary Movement, the group that has claimed the abduction and assassination of key party leaders in Lebanon accused of selling out to foreign interests and powers. The message clearly gave its support to the Armenian Popular Movement pledging that the Revolutionary movement will continue to \\\"reveal the realities, no matter how bitter or tragic they are,\\\" to expose the anti-Armenian activities of the leaders of the Dashnag \\\"Bureau.\\\" The message was taken as an indication of the link, loose as it may be, that exists between the dissident Dashnag group and the Armenian Popular Movement, open supporters of ASALA and armed struggle.  The Armenian Popular Movement has set up its headquarters in a suburb of the Greek capital, known as Neos Kosmos, where there is a large Armenian presence. The headquarters are located in a two-story building, which appears to have turned into a beehive of activity on the part of scores of Armenian youth, who prefer to give their first names only when invited to introduce themselves...

IS THIS ONE THE \\\"SPINOFFS\\\" WE WERE PROMISED? In 1950, science fiction writer Robert Heinlein published \\\"The Man Who Sold the Moon,\\\" which involved a dispute over the sale of rights to the Moon for use as billboard. NASA has taken the firsteps toward this  hideous vision of the future.  Observers were startled this spring when a NASA launch vehicle arrived at the pad with \\\"SCHWARZENEGGER\\\" painted in huge block letters on the side of the booster rockets.  Space Marketing Inc. had arranged for the ad to promote Arnold's latest movie. Now, Space Marketing is working with University of Colorado and Livermore engineers on a plan to place a mile-long inflatable billboard in low-earth orbit.  NASA would provide contractual launch services. However, since NASA bases its charge on seriously flawed cost estimates (WN 26 Mar 93) the taxpayers would bear most of the expense. This may look like environmental vandalism, but Mike Lawson, CEO of Space Marketing, told us yesterday that the real purpose of the project is to help the environment! The platform will carry ozone monitors he explained--advertising is just to help defray costs. ..........  What do you think of this revolting and hideous attempt to vandalize the night sky? It is not even April 1 anymore. What about light pollution in observations? (I read somewhere else that it might even be visible during the day, leave alone at night).

A convert no less, attracted by the rational tradition [Aquinas et al] and the emotional authenticity [in comp. with the faddishness of Anglicanism] to Roman Catholicism. I never had much time for the pope - or any other heirarchs - but I did, and do, believe in the sacremental system. I always felt quite happy to look down my nose at those such as John Emery [a few posts back] who had to engage in circuitous textual arguments to prove their faith, entirely oblivious to the fact that a dozen other faiths can do the same [with miracles too], and that since their arguments depend on the belief in the Bible as God's sole revelation, it was not very good logic to argue that the Bible proved God. No, I was happy to accept the CHURCH as God's revelation. It was the Church after all that existed before the Bible, the Church that choose [under grace of course] the canon of scripture. Protestant ludicrosity, I thought, was shown by Protestants breathtaking acceptance of Luther's right to reject a dozen or so books he disliked.  But recently I read Peter Brown's _Body and Society_. It is very well researched, and well written. But is raises some very upsetting questions. The early Christians were weird - even more so than today's carzy fundies. They had odd views on sex, odder views on the body,  totally ludicrous views about demons, and distinctly uncharitable views about other human beings.   now the question is this: were the first Christians just as weird, but we've got used to them, or did the pristine \\\"Fall of the Church\\\" happen within one generation. It certainly did'nt have to wait until the Triumph of the Church under Constantine. If so, wha does  this say about God's promise to always support the Church. It's no use throwing the usual Protestant pieties about the Church not being an organization at me. It's a community or it is nothing, and it was the early communities that were weird. The institional church was a model of sanity by comparison.  I would be interested in serious Catholic and Orthodox responses to this entirely serious issue. I'm not sure it is an issue for Protestants with their \\\"soul alone with Jesus\\\" approach, but for we who see the \\\"ecclesia\\\" as a \\\"koinoia\\\" over time and space, the weird early Christians are a problem.  [This is an exaggeration of the Protestant view.  Many Protestants have a strong appreciation for the role of the Church.  \\\"The soul alone with God\\\" is certainly important for Protestants, but it's by no means the whole story.  I have read the sort of history you talk about.  As you point out, Protestants don't have quite the same problem you do, because we believe that the church had a Fall at some point.  However Protestant mythology typically places the Fall around the time of Constantine (or more likely, regard it as happening in a sort of cumulative fashion, starting from Constantine but getting worse as the Pope accumulated power during the medieval period.)  The consequences of having it earlier are somewhat worrisome even to us.  Most Protestants accept the theological results of the early ecumenical councils, including such items as the Trinity and Incarnation.  Indeed in the works of Reformers such as Luther and Calvin, you'll find Church Fathers such as Augustine quoted all the time.  I think you'll find many Protestants resistant to the idea that the Early Church as a whole was \\\"wierd\\\".  (There is an additional problem for Protestants that I don't much want to talk about in this context, since it's been looked at recently -- that's the question of whether one can really think of Augustine and other Fathers as being proto-Protestants.  Their views on Mary, the authority of the Pope, etc, are not entirely congenial to Protestant thought.)  One thing that somewhat worries me is a question of methodology. There are certainly plenty of wierd people in the early church.  What concerns me is that they may be overrepresented in what we see.  We see every Christian who courted martyrdom.  But I think there's good reason to believe that most ordinary Christians were more prudent than that.  We see the heroic virgins.  But I think there's good reason to think that many Christians were happily married.  I can't help suspecting that the early church had the same range of wierdos and sane people that we do now.  I think there's also a certain level of \\\"revisionism\\\" active in history at the moment.  I don't mean that they're manufacturing things out of whole cloth.

The large majority involve rifles and shotgun; there are under 500 fatal handgun accidents each year. I really doubt all of those occur while the pistol is holstered, so the number of \\\"self-inflicted gunshot wounds by people wearing thigh holsters\\\" is probably well under 250 per year.   Handguns designs have included a \\\"hammer block\\\" since around 1960 or earlier. This is a metal part which physically seperates the cartridge and the firing pin: Even under impact, the gun cannot fire. The hammer block is connected to the trigger and is pulled out of the way as the trigger is pulled. As a result, modern pistols can fire _only_ if the trigger is pulled (or  in some cases, if they are cocked by hand and then dropped.)

I can't help but wonder what would happen if all violence against Israelis stopped.  Hopefully, violence against Arabs would stop at the same time.  If a state of non-violence could be  maintained, perhaps a state of cooperation could be achieved, i.e., greater economic opportunities for both peoples living in the \\\"territories\\\".    Of course, given the current leadership of Israel, your way may work also - but if that leadership changes, e.g., to someone with Ariel Sharon's mentality, then I would predict a considerable loss of life, i.e., no winners.

I, for one, : would *gladly* pay royalties via purchasing secure phones.   Hear hear! I completely agree that we need to work quickly to establish alternatives to the government's Clinton Clipper. As Brad Templeton and others have noted, once the Clipper becomes ensconced in enough phones there will be enormous pressure to make it the *legal* standard, and it will become the \\\"market* standard as well. (There is a lot of confusion in the proposal about whether the use of Clipper is mandated, about whether non-escrow alternatives will be allowed, etc.)  (There are also unclear issues about how hard, or how illegal, it will be to make \\\"workalikes\\\" which meet the standard but which generate phony or untappable keys...I'm sure the next several weeks will see these issues thrashed out in this and other groups.)  Meanwhile, I'd be interested to hear RSA Data Security's reaction. Often criticized in this group for their licensing policies (the usual complaints about MailSafe costing too much, at $125 or so, and the general issue of software patents...), we may find that *allying* ourselves with RSA is the best thing we can do. What's a mere licensing fee when our liberty may be at stake? (If everyone who wanted true security paid, say, $100 for a lifetime use of all of RSA's patents--which expire in the period 1998-2002, or so--then RSA would make tons of money and be happy, I'm sure. A small price to pay. For those to whom $100 sounds like too much, I'm sure the actual terms could be different, spread out over several years, whatever. To me, it's a small price to pay.)  Strong crypto means strong privacy. Escrowing keys, sending copies of keys to large databases, and splitting keys into two 40-bit pieces, all done with secret and non-analyzable protocols and algorithms, is *NOT* strong crypto!  Whatever some of us may think about the abstract principles of patenting number theory applications, this minor issue pales in comparison with the potential dangers of the Clipper proposal (note that I said \\\"potential\\\"...we'll presumably learn more in the coming months).  The RSA algorithms are at least public, have been analyzed and attacked for years, and source code is available (to better ensure no deliberate weakenesses or trapdoors).  I know of a number of groups putting together voice encryption systems using off-the-shelf hardware (like Soundblaster boards for the PC) and CELP-type software. The new generations of PCs, using fast 486s and Pentiums are fast enough to do real-time voice encryption. Combined with Diffie-Hellman key exchange, this should provide an alternative to the Clipper system.  Of course, we don't really know if the Administration proposes to outlaw competing systems. (It seems to me that their goal of tapping terrorists, child pornographers, and Hilary bashers would be thwarted if low-cost alternatives to Clipper proliferated. Not to defend child pornographers or terrorists, but limiting basic freedoms to catch a few criminals is not the American way of doing things. End of soapbox mode.)  I suggest we in these groups set aside any differences we may have had with RSA (and don't look at me....I have both MacPGP *and* a fully legal copy of \\\"MailSafe\\\"!) and instead work with them as quickly as we can.

[Honestly.] The word of Sin is Restriction. [Would I kid you?]   Does one man's words encompass the majestic vision of thousands of individuals?  Quoting a man is not the same as quoting the Order.  Taken out of context, words can be interpreted much differently than had one applied them within the confines of their original expression.  I think this is the case regarding Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior  of the Order to which I belong.  When he included that bit from Merlinus X' he did us all a service.  He showed us the extremes to which Order members have been known to go in their fervor. I have little knowledge regarding Reuss' background, but surely he was an unusual man, and he was an important force in the Order  for many years.  Yet as people change so do Orders change, and while we look back so carefully at the dirty laundry of O.T.O. remember that this is only the surface skim and that many perspectives are now encompassed which extend beyond any one individual.  I hope to show that there was and is much room for a difference of opinion within the Order itself, perhaps by testing the limits myself.   Let us examine this issue a bit more closely....  \\\"In 1895, Karl Kellner (1850-1905), a wealthy Austrian industrialist and paper chemist, as well as a high-grade Mason, founded the Ordo Templi Orientis.  Kellner had traveled widely in the East, where he met three adepts who instructed him specific magical practices.   Kellner's efforts to develop the Order were later assisted by Franz Hartmann, Heinrich Klein and Theodore Reuss, who had worked together prior to joining the O.T.O.  The Order was first proclaimed in 1902 in Reuss's Masonic publication, 'Oriflamme'.  On Kellner's death, Reuss succeeded him as Outer Head [O.H.O.].  The 'Jubilee' edition of the 'Oriflamme', published in 1912, announced that the Order taught secret of sexual magic.   \\\"Theodore Reuss was an interesting character.  Born June 28, 1855 in Augsburg, he entered Masonry in 1876.  He was a singer, journalist and possibly a spy for the Prussian political police, infiltrating the Socialist League founded by Karl Marx's daughter and her husband.  Reuss was later associated with William Wynn Westcott, a leader of the Golden Dawn, who later introduced him to John Yarker.  Yarker chartered Reuss to found the Rites of Memphis and Mizraim in Germany.  After several attempts to concretize various Masonic Rites, Reuss settled on the development of the O.T.O.  \\\"The Order experienced reasonably steady growth under Reuss' leadership. For example, he chartered Papus in France, Rudolph Steiner in Berlin and H. Spencer Lewis in the USA.  In 1912, the historic meeting between Reuss and Crowley occurred.  Crowley wrote that Reuss came to him and accused him of revealing Order secrets.  When Crowley looked at it afresh, the initiated interpretation of sexual magick unfolded itself to him for the first time.  Reuss appointed Crowley as Supreme and Holy King of all the English speaking world, and it was this authorization that he invoked when publishing the material of the Equinox.  \\\"Reuss resigned as Outer Head of the Order in 1922 after suffering a stroke and named Crowley his successor.  All was well until 1925 when _The Book of the Law_ was translated into German.  There was a break in the continuity of the Order.  Manyk members split with the new O.H.O. over the book, which Crowley was actively promulgating through the Order. He had earlier revise dthe Order rituals at Reuss's request, deeply infusing the doctrines of the New Aeon revelation.\\\"  _An Introduction to the History of the O.T.O._, by Ad Veritatem IX'  Within _Equinox III:10_, Edited by    Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior, Rex Summus Sanctissimus,     Caliph of the United States of America,       Published by Samuel Weiser, 1990.    There are many possible reasons that our Frater Superior included this material in _Equinox III:10_.  And this is the real point, is it not? Why did he wish to publish such things about the history of his own organization?  Does he represent a dogmatic threat to the principle of Thelema?  Or is he exercising his True Will and putting forth very complex pictures with no easy answers?  A picture which leaves room for very many interpretations.  It is quite easy for me to see, for example, that all of O.T.O. derived out of the dribble of faltering Masonry, purchased by clever hucksters with an ounce of courage and some writing ability to aid them.  And I can take that all the way down to our present Caliph, whose feeble support of the 'Law of Thelema' is laughable at best.  Would I be thrown out of the Order for speaking in this way?   Will I?   I think not. Why?  Because my Frater will see it as a perspective, an interjection I am using as an example.  My illustration shows that we may express things in the context of a larger work and the true significance of this may be quite difficult to apprehend at first.  So it may be with OTO and Merlinus X'.  Please look O.T.O. more carefully. I do not support Reuss's words myself, as I am not qualified to assess them, and I am critical of their pomposity.  If I who am a member of the Order take such a stand and am allowed to continue doing so, then what can this say about the health of the Order?  Does it mean that the Order has 'gone soft' and abandoned its moral principles?  Or does it mean that it is strong in its ability to let the will of universal kinship arise on its own, not shackled by some dogmatic requirement?  How shall we resolve these two possibilities?   I find a high calibre of individual associated with Ordo Templi Orientis. They are often quite intelligent and sometimes very well versed in arcane or usual information.  They are quite often artists and geniuses.   Having met some 20 longstanding members in the SF Bay Area (many who are or were very heavily involved with the Order), I can vouch for the integrity of the organization as it stands.  I have sometimes questioned the policy of Hymenaeus Beta.  In these moments  I followed my intuition, and I've found little to stop me from requesting a Second initiation from a different O.T.O. body.  I'm happily participating in social groups (Feasts or Initiations) and have come to know the Gnostic Mass well enough for my tastes.    This doesn't make me an authority on Order politics and explanations, however. I can only hypothesize and relay to you what I understand based on my limited contact with other members.  I urge you not to take the words of Merlinus X too far.  There are many ways to interpret words, and many people who have become involved with the Order feel very strongly about the sanctity of personal freedom and the preservation of individual vision.  I welcome other comment on this issue and will be writing more in response to other posts in this thread.   Invoke me under my stars.  Love is the law, love under will.

It's the one that sometimes sweeps schools or boot camp.  It is contagious and kills by attacking the covering of the brain, causing the blood vessels to thrombose and the brain to swell up.  It is very treatable if caught in time.  There isn't much time, however.  The rash is the tip off.  Infants are very susceptible to dying from bacterial meningitis.  Any infant with a fever who becomes stiff or lethargic needs to be rushed to a hospital where a spinal tap will show if they have meningitis.  Seizures can also occur.

There was a lot of fuzz about them, and a lot of sabotage too (a spray-can with touch-up paint can do a lot of good...).  Eventually they had to drop the idea as there were a lot of court-cases where the owner of the car could prove he didn't drive it at the time of speeding.  I especially recall a case where it eventually proved to be a car-thief that had stolen a car and made false plates. He, ofcourse, chose a license number of a identical car, so the photo seemed correct...  In conclosion: Photo-radar sucks, every way you look at it!\",\": Exodus 21:22-25:  :        22 And if men struggle with each other and strike a woman with :           child so that she has a miscarriage, yet there is no further :           injury, he shall surely be fined as the woman's husband may :           demand of him; and he shall pay as the judges decide. :        23 But if there is any further injury, then you shall appoint :           as a penalty life for life, :        24 eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, :        25 burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise.  : The most straightforward interpretation of these verses is that if : men in a fight strike a woman and cause her to miscarry, the penalty : is only a fine.  If, however, the woman is injured or dies, the : *lex talionis* doctrine of \\\"an eye for an eye\\\" applies.  This is the : Jewish interpretation, and is supported by Jewish commentaries on : these verses. :    This is quite an embarrassment for pro-lifer Christians, so there is : of course an alternate explanation.  The alternative interprets the : word \\\"miscarriage\\\" to mean \\\"premature birth\\\"--i.e., the child is born : alive--and \\\"further injury\\\" to mean injury to either the woman or : the fetus.  This is not a straightforward interpretation, it is not : (so far as I know) supported by any Jewish commentaries, and it does : not appeared to be supported by any other part of the Bible.  What if any, historical reference do we have to abortion at this time?  Did the ancient Jew have appropriate reference to understand abortion? (I am truly asking, not making a point veiled as a question).  If there is  little understanding of the medical procedure we know as abortion, it is not surprising the Bible makes little reference to it, as it makes little reference to nuclear power and contamination.\",\" Yes, but typically they *don't*.  Not every wild flight of fancy serves (or can serve) in the appropriate relation to a hypothesis.  It is somewhat interesting that when anyone is challanged to provide an example of this sort the *only* one they come up with is the one about Kekule.  Surely, there must be others.  But apparently this is regarded as an *extreme* example of a \\\"non-rational\\\" process in science whereby a successful hypothesis was proposed.  But how non-rational is it?  Of course we can't hope (currently at least) to explain how or why Kekule had the daydream of snakes in the fire biting their tails. Surely it wasn't the *only* daydream he had.  What was special about *this* one?  Could it have had something to do with a perceived *analogy* between the geometry of the snakes and problems concerning geometry of molecules?  Is such analogical reasoning \\\"extra-scientific\\\"? Or is it rather at the very heart of science (Perice's notion of abduction, the use of models within and across disciplines)?  Upon close examination, is there a non-rational mystical leap taking place, or is it perhaps closer to a formal (though often incomplete) analogy or model?\",\" Hi there I'm suffering from Sarcoidosis at present.

Cheers Nigel\",\"  Dr. Goebels thought that a lie repeated enough times could finally  be believed. I have been observing that 'Poly' has been practicing  Goebels' rule quite loyally. 'Poly's audience is mostly made of Greeks  who are not allowed to listen to Turkish news. However, in today's  informed world Greek propagandists can only fool themselves. For  instance, those who lived in 1974 will remember the TV news they  watched and the newspapers they read and the younger generation can  read the American newspapers of July and August 1974 to find out what  really happened.   There are in Turkiye the Greek Hospital, The Greek Girls' Lycee  Alumni Association, the Principo Islands Greek Benevolent Society,  the Greek Medical Foundation, the Principo Greek Orphanage Foundation,  the Yovakimion Greek Girls' Lycee Foundation, and the Fener Greek  Men's Lycee Foundation.    As for Greece, the longstanding use of the adjective 'Turkish'  in titles and on signboards is prohibited. The Greek courts  have ordered the closure of the Turkish Teachers' Association,  the Komotini Turkish Youth Association and the Ksanti  Turkish Association on grounds that there are no Turks in Western Thrace. Such community associations had been  active until 1984. But they were first told to remove the word 'Turkish' on their buildings and on their official papers and then eventually close down. This is also the  final verdict (November 4, 1987) of the Greek High Court.  In the city of Komotini, a former Greek Parliamentarian of Turkish parentage, was sentenced recently to 18 months of imprisonment with no right to appeal, just for saying outloud that he was of Turkish descent. This duly-elected ethnic Turkish official was also deprived of his political rights for a period of three  years. Each one of these barbaric acts seems to be none other than  a vehicle, used by the Greek governments, to cover-up their inferiority  complex they display, vis-a-vis, the people of Turkiye.   The Agreement on the Exchange of Minorities uses the term 'Turks,'  which demonstrates what is actually meant by the previous reference  to 'Muslims.' The fact that the Greek governments also mention the  existence of a few thousand non-Turkish Muslims does not change the  essential reality that there lives in Western Thrace a much bigger  Turkish minority. The 'Pomaks' are also a Muslim people, whom all the  three nations (Bulgarians, Turks, and Greeks) consider as part of  themselves. Do you know how the Muslim Turkish minority was organized  according to the agreements? Poor 'Poly.'  It also proves that the Turkish people are trapped in Greece  and the Greek people are free to settle anywhere in the world. The Greek authorities deny even the existence of a Turkish minority. They pursue the same denial in connection with  the Macedonians of Greece. Talk about oppression. In addition, in 1980 the 'democratic' Greek Parliament passed Law No. 1091, virtually taking over the administration of the vakiflar and other charitable trusts. They have ceased to be self-supporting religious and cultural entities. Talk about fascism. The Greek  governments are attempting to appoint the muftus, irrespective of the will of the Turkish minority, as state official. Although the Orthodox Church has full authority in similar matters in Greece, the Muslim Turkish minority will have no say in electing its religious leaders. Talk about democracy.  The government of Greece has recently destroyed an Islamic  convention in Komotini. Such destruction, which reflects an  attitude against the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a  violation of the Lausanne Convention as well as the 'so-called'  Greek Constitution, which is supposed to guarantee the protection  of historical monuments.   The government of Greece, on the other hand, is building new  churches in remote villages as a complementary step toward  Hellenizing the region.  And you pondered. Sidiropoulos, the president of the Macedonian Human  Rights Committee, became the latest victim of a tactic long used by  the Greeks to silence critics of policies of forced assimilation  of the Macedonian minority. A forestry official by occupation,  Sidiropoulos has been sent to 'internal exile' on the island of  Kefalonia, hundreds of kilometers away from his native Florina.  His employer, the Florina City Council, asked him to depart in  24 hours. The Greek authorities are trying to punish him for his  involvement in Copenhagen. He returned to Florina by his own choice  and remains without a job.   Helsinki Watch, a well-known Human Rights group, had been investigating  the plight of the Turkish Minority in Greece. In August 1990, their  findings were published in a report titled    'Destroying Ethnic Identity: Turks of Greece.'  The report confirmed gross violations of the Human Rights of the  Turkish minority by the Greek authorities. It says for instance,  the Greek government recently destroyed an Islamic convent in  Komotini. Such destruction, which reflects an attitude against  the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a violation of the  Lausanne Convention.   The Turkish cemeteries in the village of Vafeika and in Pinarlik were attacked, and tombstones were broken. The cemetery in Karotas was razed by bulldozers.  Shall I go on? Why not? The people of Turkiye are not going  to take human rights lessons from the Greek Government. The  discussion of human rights violations in Greece does not  stop at the Greek frontier. In several following articles  I shall dwell on and expose the Greek treatment of Turks in Western Thrace and the Aegean Macedonians.  It has been reported that the Greek Cypriot administration  has an intense desire for arms and that Greece has made  plans to supply it with the tanks and armored vehicles it  has to destroy in accordance with the agreement reached on  conventional arms reductions in Europe. Meanwhile, Greek  and Greek Cypriot officials are reported to have planned  to take ostentatious measures aimed at camouflaging the  transfer of these tanks and armored vehicles to southern  Cyprus, a process that will conflict with the spirit of  the agreement on conventional arms reduction in Europe.  An acceptable method may certainly be found when there is a will. But we know of various kinds of violent behaviors ranging from physical attacks to the burning of buildings. The rugs at the Amfia village mosque were  dragged out to the front of the building and burnt there.  Shots were fired on the mosque in the village of Aryana.  Now wait, there is more.    'Greek Atrocities in the Vilayet of Smyrna (May to July 1919), Inedited   Documents and Evidence of English and French Officers,' Published by   The Permanent Bureau of the Turkish Congress at Lausanne, Lausanne,   Imprimerie Petter, Giesser & Held, Caroline, 5 (1919).    pages 82-83:  << 1. The train going from Denizli to Smyrna was stopped at Ephesus    and the 90 Turkish travellers, men and women who were in it ordered    to descend. And there in the open street, under the eyes of their    husbands, fathers and brothers, the women without distinction of age    were violated, and then all the travellers were massacred. Amongst    the latter the Lieutenant Salih Effendi, a native of Tripoli, and a    captain whose name is not known, and to whom the Hellenic authorities    had given safe conduct, were killed with specially atrocious tortures.     2. Before the battle, the wife of the lawyer Enver Bey coming from    her garden was maltreated by Greek soldiers, she was even stript    of her garments and her servant Assie was violated.     3. The two tax gatherers Mustapha and Ali Effendi were killed in the    following manner: Their arms were bound behind their backs with wire    and their heads were battered and burst open with blows from the butt    end of a gun.     4. During the firing of the town, eleven children, six little girls    and five boys, fleeing from the flames, were stopped by Greek soldiers    in the Ramazan Pacha quarter, and thrown into a burning Jewish house    near bridge, where they were burnt alive. This fact is confirmed on oath    by the retired commandant Hussein Hussni Effendi who saw it.     5. The clock-maker Ahmed Effendi and his son Sadi were arrested and    dragged out of their shop. The son had his eyes put out and was then    killed in the court of the Greek Church, but Ahmed Effendi has been    no more heard of.     6. At the market, during the fire, two unknown people were wounded    by bayonets, then bound together, thrown into the fire and burnt alive.     The Greeks killed also many Jews. These are the names of some:    Moussa Malki, shoemaker          killed   Bohor Levy, tailor               killed   Bohor Israel, cobbler            killed   Isaac Calvo, shoemaker           killed   David Aroguete                   killed   Moussa Lerosse                   killed   Gioia Katan                      killed   Meryem Malki                     killed   Soultan Gharib                   killed   Isaac Sabah                      wounded   Moche Fahmi                      wounded   David Sabah                      wounded   Moise Bensignor                  killed   Sarah Bendi                      killed   Jacob Jaffe                      wounded   Aslan Halegna                    wounded....>>  Serdar Argic\",\"ok, i have a 486dx50(ISA) w/ Diamond Stealth VRAM 1MB.

They say the 39-year-old mechanic committed suicide after     killing his wife, Jocelyne Parent, 31.       The couple had been separated for a month and the woman had     gone to his apartment to talk about getting some more money     for food. A violent quarrel broke out and Prevost attacked     his wife with a kitchen knife, cutting her throat, police said.       She was only the latest of 13 women slain by a husband or     lover in Quebec in the last five weeks.

It is an LC, with 10MB of RAM and an 80MB internal drive, running system 7.1, with a few SCSI devices in a (so far as I know) properly terminated chain.  I had shut down the system for a day-- I was out of town and we sometimes have thunderstorms this time of year-- and upon restarting got a blinking question mark.  I booted from a floppy and saw that my external HD seemed okay, but there was no sign of the internal.  I installed a system folder on the external and was, indeed, able to boot from it.  I tried things like Disk First Aid and Silverlining, to inquire about the internal drive.  They either could not find it or got errors in trying to talk to it. (Silverlining claimed it was a Connor drive, but it is a Quantum... )  Well, I'd backed things up, so I was able to work.  But, at some point I noticed that the internal had reappeared.  Now, Disk First Aid says that all's well, etc.  Things seem to be fine.  But, what happened?  Was this a warning that something (the internal HD or something else) is about to die?  I'm definitely nervous.  And, if this is a signal that the internal HD is sick, is it true that I can only put up to a 127MB drive inside an LC?  Some folks have claimed there's a limitation in the LC (other'n size or power) while others (and that includes LaCie, over the phone) say anything that fits is okay.\",\"Would the person who is running the e-mail list for KANSAS CITY Royals please e-mail details regarding mailing list.

That was my point all along, Fred.      I see we are dealing with a problem in a conflict of interpretations, not least of which is your belief that only you can adequately judge what is and is not debate.  Suffice to say that I disagree with you on that last point.  Why don't you take a poll, Fred, if you want some psuedo-objective point-of-view?  And, as usual, you defend your insults with \\\"he started it.\\\"  \\\"Yeah, I took some of his research and called it my own, but he started it.\\\"  \\\"So what if I stole his car, he stole my lawnmower first.\\\"  Besides that, I think it's still open to interpretation whether Nick actually did start it. So your defense, besides being lame, and contradicting the first part of the sentence in which it occurs, may not even apply anyway.  Your defense reminds me of the guy that broke the borrowed tool:  \\\"I never borrowed it, I already gave it back, and it was broken when you gave it to me.\\\"  Make up yer mind, Fred!      First, I try to address what I think you meant, for which I am rewarded with a denial of sorts, and a smart remark.  Then, I point out that I am not clear what you did mean, rather than risking your childish ire, wrongly interpreting you a second time, and I'm stupid for it.  I just can't win, can I, Fred?  You've got a great point here somewhere, it's just that between stupid people that you must insult, and your jealous guarding of your valuable opinions, you never actually get around to making it.   *** Fred issue #2;  Nick's alleged meaning ***  Too bad the plan only exists in your mind, instead of Nick's, or you would have a really good point.  Instead you have provided a good reason to ignore your insults, since they are based on incorrect interpretations that you have made about others.  Forgive me for giving your insults more meaning than they ever should have had.  My reading of what Nick actually said is that \\\"people aren't required in all parts of all space processes\\\", so your taking issue with his opinions regarding people in the space program, I read as \\\"People are required in all parts of all space processes.\\\"  So, help me out, here, Fred, since I'm so patently stupid.  Did you read Nick wrong?  Or are you going to eat your terminal now?  If the latter, I sure hope it's one of those Cheeto and string models that all the computer mags have been raving about :-)  The point is, _I_ am not stupid because of _your_ incorrect assumption.  I'd only be stupid if I insulted you for having made it.  But, alas, that's your job, Fred.  And, finally, your style is confusing, since you tried to make two points, simultaneously, with an allegory/insult.  Sadly, one point addressed a 'plan' that only existed in your mind, and the other took issue with behaviors that you do as much as anyone.   No, no, I finally got it.  You don't like the plan that Nick's posts made you imagine.  And you don't like Nick's obnoxious behavior, even though it's no worse than your own.  Thanks for taking the time with someone as dense as myself.      Of course, Socrates.  How could it be otherwise?   Who cares who came on the net first?  If you do, consider that you saw me come on after a brief haitus, before which I was on for about 2 years. If you had seen me on the net first, you'd remember when Nick and I went down exactly the same road regarding rude, unneccesary behavior.  It's just amazing to me that you continue to take issue with behavior that's no worse than your own.  Let's see here, my complaints about your obnoxious behavior are hypocritical, while your flames against people you decide are flamers isn't, and my complaints about your name-calling are immature, while your name-calling isn't.  Yeah, right.  Maybe if you called me some more names, I might see it better, Fred.  \\\"Net.ghod wannabe\\\"?  Naturally, Fred, you've correctly interpreted my motivations, when yours are impossible to judge from your actions (as your insulting of people that try, proves).  I didn't really care about people that fill the net with personal garbage, what I really wanted was to impress everyone.  I only put my complaints with your behavior on private mail, not because it belongs there, but because I thought you were such a jerk that you'd bring it back to the Net, playing right into my hands. Alas, I had no idea what an intellectual master you were, turning tables and bringing the history of these posts to the net, for the noble and valuable purpose of embarassing me.  Whether I should feel stupid because I tried to make suggestions to such a superior intellect, or becuase I tried to communicate like an adult with a self-righteous ass, still isn't clear.  Well, Fred, you exposed me.  Now I'll never be able to get a(nother) job with NASA, since they all know that I'm stupider than Fred McCall.  Well, I just hope you're happy.

Richard Hirschhaut, director of the San Francisco branch of the ADL, art dealer Roy Bullock and former policeman Tom Gerard were also named as defendants in the suit, filed in San Francisco County Superior Court.      The 19 accuse the ADL of B'nai B'rith, a group dedicated to fighting anti-Semitism, and the other defendants of secretly gathering information on them, including data from state and federal agencies.      The suit alleges they disclosed the information to others, including the governments of Israel and South Africa, in what it alleges was a \\\"a massive spying operation.\\\"      The action is a class-action suit. It was filed on behalf of about 12,000 anti-apartheid activists or opponents of Israeli policies about whom the plaintiffs believe the ADL, Bullock and Gerard gathered information.      Representatives of the ADL in San Francisco were not immediately available for comment on Wednesday.      The civil suit is the first legal action arising out of allegations that Gerard, a former inspector in the San Francisco police intelligence unit, passed confidential police files on California political activists to a spy ring.      The FBI and San Francisco police are investigating the ADL, Bullock and Gerard over the affair and last week searched the ADL's offices in San Francisco and Los Angeles.      The suit alleges invasion of privacy under the Civil Code of California, which prohibits the publication of information obtained from official sources. It seeks exemplary damages of at least $2,500 per person as well as other unspecified damages.      Lawyer Pete McCloskey, a former Congresmen who is representing the plaintiffs, said the 19 plaintiffs included Arab-Americans and Jews -- and his wife Helen, who also had information gathered about her.      One of the plaintiffs is Yigal Arens, a research scientist at the University of Southern California who is a son of the former Israeli Defence Minister.      Arens told the San Francisco Examiner he had seen a file the ADL kept on him in the 1980s, presumably because of his criticism of the treatment of Palestinians and his position on the Israeli-occupied territories.      According to court documents released last week, Bullock and Gerard both kept information on thousands of California political activists.      In the documents, a police investigator said he believed the ADL paid Bullock for many years to provide information and that both the league and Bullock received confidential information from the authorities.      No criminal charges have yet been filed in the case. The ADL, Bullock and Gerard have all denied any wrongdoing.   REUTER AC KG CM    APn  04/14 2202  ADL Lawsuit  Copyright, 1993. The Associated Press. All rights reserved.  By CATALINA ORTIZ  Associated Press Writer    SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Arab-Americans and critics of Israel sued the Anti-Defamation League on Wednesday, saying it invaded their privacy by illegally gathering information about them through a nationwide spy network.    The ADL, a national group dedicated to fighting anti-Semitism, intended to use the data to discredit them because of their political views, according to the class-action lawsuit filed in San Francisco Superior Court.    \\\"None of us has been guilty of racism or Nazism or anti-Semitism or hate crimes, or any of the other `isms' that the ADL claims to protect against. None of us is violent or criminal in any way,\\\" said Carol El-Shaieb, an education consultant who develops programs on Arab culture.    The 19 plaintiffs include Yigal Arens, son of former Israel Defense Minister Moshe Arens. The younger Arens, a research scientist at the University of Southern California, said the ADL kept a file on him in the 1980s presumably because he has criticized Israel's treatment of Palestinians.    \\\"The ADL believes that anyone who is an Arab American ... or speaks politically against Israel is at least a closet anti-Semite,\\\" Arens said.    The ADL has denied any wrongdoing, but couldn't comment on the lawsuit because it hasn't reviewed it, said a spokesman at the ADL's New York headquarters.    The FBI and local police and prosecutors are investigating allegations that the ADL spied on thousands of individuals and hundreds of groups, including white supremacist and anti-Semitic organizations, Arab-Americans, Greenpeace, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and San Francisco public television station KQED.    Some information allegedly came from confidential police and government records, according to court documents filed in the probe and the civil lawsuit. No charges have been filed in the criminal investigation.    The lawsuit accuses the ADL of violating California's privacy law, which forbids the intentional disclosure of personal information \\\"not otherwise public\\\" from state or federal records.    The lawsuit claims the ADL disclosed the information to \\\"persons and entities\\\" who had no compelling need to receive it. It didn't elaborate.    Defendants include Richard Hirschhaut, director of the ADL's office in San Francisco. He did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment.    Other defendants are San Francisco art dealer Roy Bullock, an alleged ADL informant over the past four decades, and former police officer Tom Gerard. Gerard allegedly tapped into law enforcement and government computers and passed information on to Bullock.    Gerard, who has retired from the police force, has moved to the Philippines. Bullock's lawyer, Richard Breakstone, said he could not comment on the lawsuit because he had not yet studied it.      UPwe 04/14 1956  ADL sued for allegedly spying on U.S. residents\",\"Kirsch Pull down Window Shades   - White, Light Filtering  - 73.25\\\" Wide, 72\\\" High, can be cut to width  - Brand new, unopened  - \\\"Best Quality\\\", Vinyl Coated Cotton  - Mounting Brackets included  - $35 (Bought at $60 at J.C.Penney)\",\"  Maybe cyclical is not the best word.  That is one aspect of it.  In the case of the virgin birth prophecy, it applied to the then and there, and also prophetically to Christ.  The army that threatened the king would  cease to be a threat in a very short time.  Yet it also prophecied of  Christ.  Several prophecies that refered to Christ also had application at the time they were made.  \\\"Out of Egypt have I called my Son\\\" refers both to Israel, and prophetically to Christ.   \\\"Why do the heathen rage\\\" was said of David and also of Christ.    Another example would be the Scripture quoted of Judas, \\\"and his bishoprick let another take.\\\"  Another example is something that Isaiah said of His disciples which is also applied to Christ in Hebrews, \\\"the children thou hast given me.\\\"  How does the preterist view account for this phenomenon.  Link \",\"        Here's a question:  If most marijuana is domestic and producing it here is economical, why would we expect it to be imported?          Yet it was done.  Done quite successfully for a number of years. *Somebody* thought it was worth the risk.          Your assumption is that this \\\"low\\\" dollar/pound area is sufficiently low as to make gun-running unprofitable.  On what do you base this?           And given that smuggling channels are already established, and given the economies of scale, would it really add significantly more expense to start smuggling firearms, especially considering doing so would be less hazardous (in terms of getting caught) than drugs?          Now *that* was a jump.  In any case, define \\\"local.\\\"  It's a big country.           Wow, you gotta love the speculation.         As I posted before, we import billions upon billions of raw ores across the Mexican border.  Not only that but ships come in and out of U.S. harbors every day full stuff.  And customs doesn't even have the extra advantage of being able to sniff them out.           I'd be willing to wager that a shipload of handguns would be worth more than a shipload of raw ore, *and* you're virtually guaranteed to get it past customs, because they'd have to hand search every hold of every ship which came through.         It's not simply a matter of how much money are they worth, but how much *more* money are they worth than other goods, based on the likelihood of being caught.  Less money than drugs, but also a safer thing to smuggle. \"]},\"selected\":{\"id\":\"1115\"},\"selection_policy\":{\"id\":\"1114\"}},\"id\":\"1066\",\"type\":\"ColumnDataSource\"},{\"attributes\":{\"fill_alpha\":{\"field\":\"fill_alpha\"},\"fill_color\":{\"field\":\"__COLOR__\"},\"hatch_color\":{\"field\":\"__COLOR__\"},\"line_alpha\":{\"value\":0.3},\"line_color\":{\"field\":\"__COLOR__\"},\"size\":{\"field\":\"size\"},\"x\":{\"field\":\"embed_2d_0\"},\"y\":{\"field\":\"embed_2d_1\"}},\"id\":\"1086\",\"type\":\"Circle\"},{\"attributes\":{\"coordinates\":null,\"data_source\":{\"id\":\"1066\"},\"glyph\":{\"id\":\"1086\"},\"group\":null,\"hover_glyph\":null,\"muted_glyph\":{\"id\":\"1088\"},\"name\":\"train\",\"nonselection_glyph\":{\"id\":\"1087\"},\"view\":{\"id\":\"1090\"}},\"id\":\"1089\",\"type\":\"GlyphRenderer\"},{\"attributes\":{\"coordinates\":null,\"formatter\":{\"id\":\"1110\"},\"group\":null,\"major_label_policy\":{\"id\":\"1111\"},\"ticker\":{\"id\":\"1043\"}},\"id\":\"1042\",\"type\":\"LinearAxis\"},{\"attributes\":{},\"id\":\"1111\",\"type\":\"AllLabels\"},{\"attributes\":{},\"id\":\"1047\",\"type\":\"BasicTicker\"},{\"attributes\":{\"button_type\":\"primary\",\"height_policy\":\"fit\",\"icon\":null,\"label\":\"Apply\",\"subscribed_events\":[\"button_click\"],\"width_policy\":\"min\"},\"id\":\"1078\",\"type\":\"Button\"},{\"attributes\":{\"fill_alpha\":{\"value\":0.1},\"fill_color\":{\"field\":\"__COLOR__\"},\"hatch_alpha\":{\"value\":0.1},\"hatch_color\":{\"field\":\"__COLOR__\"},\"line_alpha\":{\"value\":0.1},\"line_color\":{\"field\":\"__COLOR__\"},\"size\":{\"field\":\"size\"},\"x\":{\"field\":\"embed_2d_0\"},\"y\":{\"field\":\"embed_2d_1\"}},\"id\":\"1099\",\"type\":\"Circle\"},{\"attributes\":{\"fill_alpha\":{\"field\":\"fill_alpha\"},\"fill_color\":{\"field\":\"__COLOR__\"},\"hatch_color\":{\"field\":\"__COLOR__\"},\"line_alpha\":{\"value\":0.3},\"line_color\":{\"field\":\"__COLOR__\"},\"size\":{\"field\":\"size\"},\"x\":{\"field\":\"embed_2d_0\"},\"y\":{\"field\":\"embed_2d_1\"}},\"id\":\"1098\",\"type\":\"Circle\"},{\"attributes\":{\"tools\":[{\"id\":\"1050\"},{\"id\":\"1051\"},{\"id\":\"1052\"},{\"id\":\"1053\"},{\"id\":\"1054\"},{\"id\":\"1055\"}]},\"id\":\"1058\",\"type\":\"Toolbar\"},{\"attributes\":{\"fill_alpha\":{\"value\":0.2},\"fill_color\":{\"field\":\"__COLOR__\"},\"hatch_alpha\":{\"value\":0.2},\"hatch_color\":{\"field\":\"__COLOR__\"},\"line_alpha\":{\"value\":0.2},\"line_color\":{\"field\":\"__COLOR__\"},\"size\":{\"field\":\"size\"},\"x\":{\"field\":\"embed_2d_0\"},\"y\":{\"field\":\"embed_2d_1\"}},\"id\":\"1100\",\"type\":\"Circle\"},{\"attributes\":{\"fill_alpha\":{\"field\":\"fill_alpha\"},\"fill_color\":{\"field\":\"__COLOR__\"},\"hatch_color\":{\"field\":\"__COLOR__\"},\"line_alpha\":{\"value\":0.3},\"line_color\":{\"field\":\"__COLOR__\"},\"size\":{\"field\":\"size\"},\"x\":{\"field\":\"embed_2d_0\"},\"y\":{\"field\":\"embed_2d_1\"}},\"id\":\"1080\",\"type\":\"Circle\"},{\"attributes\":{\"fill_alpha\":{\"field\":\"fill_alpha\"},\"fill_color\":{\"field\":\"__COLOR__\"},\"hatch_color\":{\"field\":\"__COLOR__\"},\"line_alpha\":{\"value\":0.3},\"line_color\":{\"field\":\"__COLOR__\"},\"size\":{\"field\":\"size\"},\"x\":{\"field\":\"embed_2d_0\"},\"y\":{\"field\":\"embed_2d_1\"}},\"id\":\"1092\",\"type\":\"Circle\"},{\"attributes\":{\"fill_alpha\":{\"value\":0.1},\"fill_color\":{\"field\":\"__COLOR__\"},\"hatch_alpha\":{\"value\":0.1},\"hatch_color\":{\"field\":\"__COLOR__\"},\"line_alpha\":{\"value\":0.1},\"line_color\":{\"field\":\"__COLOR__\"},\"size\":{\"field\":\"size\"},\"x\":{\"field\":\"embed_2d_0\"},\"y\":{\"field\":\"embed_2d_1\"}},\"id\":\"1087\",\"type\":\"Circle\"},{\"attributes\":{\"coordinates\":null,\"data_source\":{\"id\":\"1068\"},\"glyph\":{\"id\":\"1098\"},\"group\":null,\"hover_glyph\":null,\"muted_glyph\":{\"id\":\"1100\"},\"name\":\"test\",\"nonselection_glyph\":{\"id\":\"1099\"},\"view\":{\"id\":\"1102\"}},\"id\":\"1101\",\"type\":\"GlyphRenderer\"},{\"attributes\":{\"fill_alpha\":{\"value\":0.2},\"fill_color\":{\"field\":\"__COLOR__\"},\"hatch_alpha\":{\"value\":0.2},\"hatch_color\":{\"field\":\"__COLOR__\"},\"line_alpha\":{\"value\":0.2},\"line_color\":{\"field\":\"__COLOR__\"},\"size\":{\"field\":\"size\"},\"x\":{\"field\":\"embed_2d_0\"},\"y\":{\"field\":\"embed_2d_1\"}},\"id\":\"1088\",\"type\":\"Circle\"},{\"attributes\":{},\"id\":\"1119\",\"type\":\"Selection\"},{\"attributes\":{\"children\":[{\"id\":\"1077\"},{\"id\":\"1078\"}]},\"id\":\"1103\",\"type\":\"Row\"},{\"attributes\":{\"fill_alpha\":{\"value\":0.2},\"fill_color\":{\"field\":\"__COLOR__\"},\"hatch_alpha\":{\"value\":0.2},\"hatch_color\":{\"field\":\"__COLOR__\"},\"line_alpha\":{\"value\":0.2},\"line_color\":{\"field\":\"__COLOR__\"},\"size\":{\"field\":\"size\"},\"x\":{\"field\":\"embed_2d_0\"},\"y\":{\"field\":\"embed_2d_1\"}},\"id\":\"1094\",\"type\":\"Circle\"}],\"root_ids\":[\"1104\"]},\"title\":\"Bokeh Application\",\"version\":\"2.4.3\"}};\n",

And \\\"given by god\\\" refers to any action whereby a god god causes or better effects something.     Rob, I am not intimate with Jewish theology, but I understand that you are a Messianic Jew. Correct me if I am wrong, but it appears that the views of Messianic Jews on metaphysics is different to that of the majority of Jews. While Jewish theology overall is quite distinct from the Christianic god views, I have heard that it is possible for Jews to attribute evil to their god, an no-no for Christians, the Bible is still seen as effect of the interaction of some god with man.     (Deletion)   The context was metaphysics, even when the process of adapting the commandments is not transcendent, the justification of the process lie in metaphysic specualtion. I wonder how you break out of the shackles of having metaphysics in your system.     (Deletion)   Is is in a book that commands to commit genocide among other reprehensible deeds. The context is repulsive, and it is foul play, IMO, to invoke some relatively enlightened passages as an example for the content of the whole book.     (Big deletion)   No, not the interpretation of some laws, but the interpretation of the bible. As in the example that Sodom and Gomorrha mean argue with god. The whole idea that it is metaphorically and yet allows you to argue with a god (whatever that means, that alone is a theo- logic question) is proof of a theology used.       It is an important question in the light of what for instance the passage witrh Sodom and Gomorrha means. Either there is some connection between the text, the fact that it exists, and your interpretation of it, or it is purely arbitrary.. Further, the question is why is has one to carry the burden of Biblical texts when one could simply write other books that convey the message better. You might answer that one can't becuase  some peculiar Biblical information might be lost, but that holds true of every other book, and the question remains why has the Bible still a special place? Can't it be replaced somehow? Is it ok to bargain the dangerous content of the Bible against some other message that is included as well?     (Deletion)   Sorry, but there are worse systems does not say anything about if one could not have a better system.   (Deletion)   If we read two stories in the Bible, one that god commands people to kill children for being idolaters and another where god kills children directly, what is more important to resolve, the message that children are to be killed or if it has  to be done by god?     And the argument you have given is a fallacy, while it may not be important in the context you have given to find out if god is corporeal or not, it can be crucial in other questions. Religious believers resolve contradictions with that they choose one of the possibilities given in an arbitrary way, and have the advantage of being able to attribute their decision to some god.\",\"Yes, the Phobos mission did return some useful data including images of Phobos itself.

Student =====----\",\"  The lengthy article you quote doesn't imply this.  It only states that it is somehow POSSIBLE, not that it is in any way likely.  This is akin to an article saying that it is POSSIBLE that the USAF has several captured UFOs, without supporting the liklihood of such an assertion.   In other words, they were telling a pesky reporter to keep guessing.  Israel maintains this same attitude about nuclear weapons it may or may not have.  The US maintains the same attitude about the presence of nuclear weapons on specific naval craft.  By refusing to acknowledge the existence of such weapons on specific ships, US warships have, I believe, become unwelcome in New Zealand, which has declared itself a nuclear-free-zone.     The USAF has never officially admitted to having any UFOs, either.   This is stated as a fact without supporting evidence.  It would've been more convincing if your reporter had come up with just one name of someone who is sitting in jail, lost to the world, as he suggests. Maybe Elvis, or JFK, somebody.    Let's put it this way: If Israel has put people away without publicizing their arrests or the legal proceedings against them, how has their disappearance been explained?  People have relatives, friends and colleagues, you know.  Israel is not known as a place where people are made to vanish.  Would you care to give us a list of people whose whereabouts are unknown?  People who are presumed to be imprisoned?  This whole conspiracy story isn't something that we've come to associate with Yigal Arens before.

It's basic purpose - not to let the gun fire until you're ready.  Christ, I've known that since I had my first Crosman air gun.

I feel a philosophy or religion group would be more appropriate. The topic is deeply embedded in the world view of Islam and the esoteric teachings of the Prophet (S.A.). Heresy does not enter into it at all except for those who see Islam only as an exoteric religion that is only nominally (if at all) concerned with the metaphysical substance of man's being and nature.  A good introductory book (in fact one of the best introductory books to Islam in general) is Murtaza Mutahhari's \\\"Fundamental's of Islamic Thought - God, Man, and the Universe\\\" - Mizan Press, translated by R. Campbell. Truly a beautiful book. A follow-up book (if you can find a decent translation) is \\\"Wilaya - The Station of the Master\\\" by the same author. I think it also goes under the title of \\\"Master and Mastership\\\" - It's a very small book - really just a transcription of a lecture by the author. The introduction to the beautiful \\\"Psalms of Islam\\\" - translated by William C. Chittick (available through Muhammadi Trust of Great Britain) is also an excellent introduction to the subject. We have these books in our University library - I imagine any well stocked University library will have them.  From your posts, you seem fairly well versed in Sunni thought. You should seek to know Shi'ite thought through knowledgeable  Shi'ite authors as well - at least that much respect is due before the charge of heresy is levelled.\",\"Has anyone experienced problems formatting a system floppy in the File Manager under DOS 6?

(To encourage membership, however, we defer universal release of the latest versions until Consortium members have had an opportunity to explore the new capabilities.)  To se what AUIS looks like, you can try a remote demo.  You need an X server (R5 is best) on a machine linked to the internet.  Give the command    finger help@atk.itc.cmu.edu   for instructions.  NOTE:  The demo version does not use the Motif-look-and-feel scrollbar, but one is available.  You can use it on the demo by changing an option in the ~/preferences file and starting a new editor.  The Andrew Toolkit component of AUIS is ideal if you want to build applications using compound documents.  Andrew's major feature is its architecture for recursive embedding of objects: equation in table in figure in text, for example.  This architecture extends to areas not usually found in toolkits, including file stream formats, cut/paste, and printing.  Andrew also provides some of the most commonly requested applications:  word processor, spreadsheet, drawing editor, and font editor (the latter two are in version 5.2 which will be generally released on the XR6 tape in December.)\",\"In <C5nGII.BGx@news2.cis.umn.edu> bunt0003@student.tc.umn.edu (Monthian   Perhaps the reason is simple--maybe the marketing people who put together the brochures and price lists weren't clear on the FPU issue.

I am familiar with    the command lines of several operating systems but occasionally    I will have to some work on a system that I almost never use.    If it has a GUI, I can usually accomplish what I want to do    fairly easily, the command line on the other hand often is    a long and painful experience.

Most early treatment of non-life threatening illness is done on a guess, hazarded after anecdotal evidence given by the patient. It's an educated guess, by a trained person, but it's still no more than a guess. It's cheaper and simpler to medicate first and only deal further with those people who don't respond.  There are diseases that haven't been described yet and the root cause of many diseases now described aren't known. (Read a book on gastroenterology sometime if you want to see a lot of them.) After scientific methods have run out then it's the patient's freedom of choice to try any experimental method they choose.

I'm looking for  recommendations for a suitable replacement.  I would like to buy a full Aerostich suit but I can't afford $700 for it right now.  I'm considering two basic options:  1)  Buy the Aerostich jacket only.  Dunno how much it costs     due to recent price increases, but I'd imagine over $400.     That may be pushing my limit.  Advantages include the fact     that I can later add the pants, and that it nearly eliminates     the need for the jacket portion of a rainsuit.  2)  Buy some kind of leather jacket.  I like a few of the new      Hein-Gericke FirstGear line, however they may be a bit pricey     unless I can work some sort of deal.  Advantages of leather     are potentially slightly better protection, enhanced pose     value (we all know how important that is :-), possibly cheaper     than upper Aerostich.  Requirements for a jacket are that it must fit over a few other  layers (mainly a sizing thing), if leather i'd prefer a zip-out  lining, it MUST have some body armor similar to aerostich (elbows,  shoulders, forearms, possibly back/kidney protection, etc.), a  reasonable amount of pocket space would be nice, ventilation would  be a plus, however it must be wearable in cold weather (below freezing) with layers or perhaps electrics.

Other questions:  - Excuse my ignorance, but is \\\"Texel\\\" a reputable maker in the CD-ROM   market?  Or do you think NEC is the better drive?  - Bottom line:  Is this kit worth the money?

In some ways, this treatment of humans beings as breeding livestock is the most horrifying aspect of American slavery.  # Second, although mechanization of cotton production could be expected to # reduce the demands for labor eventually, it was only in the 1940's  # the mechanization of cotton production in the South largely eliminated # the labor intensive character of the operation, long after the \\\"first # mechanical cotton reaper\\\" was invented.  This is an interesting question.  Steinbeck's _Grapes of Wrath_ (published in the 1930s), uses agricultural mechanization of cotton production in Arkansas as the cause of the Joad family being evicted from the land.  How many years were involved in the mechanization of cotton farming?  When did this first appear?  # #Ken Mitchell       | The powers not delegated to the United States by the # Steve Hendricks                        |  DOMAIN:  steveh@thor.ISC-BR.COM   \",\" Excellent point.

I found 3 shareware Workspace Managers, from Australia's MS-WINDOWS archive (monu6.cc.monash.edu.au), which mirrors some sites in the U.S.  The three I found were:  1. WORKSPACES 1.10 (wspace.zip)                                 This was the smallest and simplest    of the workspace managers that I found.  It is very easy to use.    It displays a small window, containing 6 buttons, plus an extra    button for configuration purposes.  One annoying feature was the    title window that is first presented when it is run - you must press    a key (not a mouse button!) for the thing to go away.  Also, it would    have been nice if there was an \\\"ALWAYS ON TOP\\\" setting for the little    window containing the workspace buttons.  Maybe some user-specified    strings on the buttons instead of the numbers one to six might be    a nice feature.  The simplicity and ease of use of this workspace    manager makes it an attractive package.  2. WORKSHIFT 1.6 (wrksft16.zip)                                While this workspace manager offered a    few features that WORKSPACES 1.10 lacked, it was quite time consuming    to set things up.  With WORKSPACES 1.10, all but the first workspace    is initially empty.  With WORKSHIFT 1.6, you need to take \\\"snapshots\\\"    of how you want each of your workspaces to look like - i.e. what     applications they contain.  Also, the main window is quite large,    but this does allow you to have a small view of what is in each workspace.    With WORKSPACES 1.10, there was no facility for viewing what was in    a workspace without switching to it.  WORKSHIFT 1.6 provides this    viewing functionality which is quite useful.  3. BIGDESK 2.30 and BACKMENU (backdesk.zip)                             This is an interesting package, which contains    a few other goodies as well as a workspace manager.  Other goodies    include \\\"Backmenu\\\", which provides a pop-up root menu when you    press a certain mouse button - just like in X-Windows.  The menu    is totally configurable, offering unlimited depth of cascading menus,    which is provides quite handy access to applications.  You could    say it is a menu-based alternative to the program manager.  Also    bundled in \\\"backdesk.zip\\\" is a program called \\\"WRUN\\\", which allows    you to run windows applications from a DOS shell under WINDOWS    instead of using the File Manager to run applications.      The actual workspace manager is called BIGDESK 2.30.  BIGDESK works quite    differently to the other two workspace managers in that it    doesn't provide a certain number of disjoint and separate workspaces.    In fact, it basically enlarges your desktop by a configurable amount,    and you choose which region of the desktop you want your screen to    focus in on.  This means you can have windows overlapping between different    viewing regions, unlike the first two workspace managers in which    each workspace was isolated from the other one.  The BIGDESK control window    allows to to move windows around your enlarged desktop.  Basically    the control window provides a small scale view of your viewing area    while your actual computer screen provides a large scale or blow-up    of a particular section.\",\"I have a Hewlett-Packard LaserJet Series II Paper Tray for sale.

Be that as it may....  Clemens is always in this form, and Viola isn't really performing beyond what might reasonably have been expected. How do you know that the Sox are responding to them, and not to Al Bumbry, Hobson, or (my most likely suspect) new hitting coach Mike Easler? I certainly am more likely to give Easler credit for Mo Vaughhn's hot start than Clemens or Viola.  This was the optimistic scenario, but not unreasonably so. He hasn't shown much power yet, though.  How can you tell that Dawson is providing the leadership? Perhaps it's Calderon? Perhaps it's Clemens and Viola? Maybe Hobson is finally showing those people skills he was supposed to have when they hired him. Or maybe it's all a myth. And Dawson has been hitting reasonably well, but not as well as Greenwell, Vaughn, Cooper, or Fletcher.  In three games. Why don't we look at this one again in, say, July?  A bit better than could reasonably have been expected. But don't forget that Zupcic looked like Wade Boggs lite for about 75 AB's last year. Beware of small sample sizes. Still, if Fletcher hits as well as he did last year he'd be a great improvement over any Sox leadoff hitter from last year. Be aware that his career numbers seem to indicate that he puts up good numbers as long as he doesn't have to make more than 300 AB or so in a year.  Ummm...sorry, no. I can buy the \\\"in the field\\\" part, and I think he'll be better at the plate than the 1992 Boggs, but in general Cooper, while he'll be a pretty good hitter, couldn't carry Boggs' jockstrap. With a little luck, he could be the fourth or fifth best 3B in the AL (Martinez, Boggs, Ventura, and Palmer will all be better).   See, here is where you make that quick left turn off into the aether. .500 is plausible, third is not unlikely, but phrases like \\\"could run away with the division\\\" are likely to get you a visit from the men in the white coats. It's not really clear that their staff is better than last year. If Russell does well, Darwin doesn't go on the DL, and Hesketh doesn't pitch just barely well enough to avoid losing his spot in the rotation, they could be better. On the other hand, if Hesketh pitches miserably and they're too stupid to move him to the pen and bring up Conroy or somebody, Fossas continues to pitch dismally but they keep giving him innings becasue he's a lefty, and Russell explodes they could be pretty bad.

Roads like the Autobahn are smoother, straiter, wider and slightly banked.   Example: A few months back I was traveling late at  night ( 3:00 am or so) and I was changing highways at a bent crosssing. It  curved off to the south east becoming hidden by trees after about 1,000 ft and continued to the left strait north. I wanted to turn north, checked the south lane, rolled into the crossing and checked the north lane. Nevertheless there wasn't  a car in sight, so I took one last look and pulled into the left hand lane. Now my car isn't a 5 sec 0-60 performer but I was in the corect lane and  over 40 in decent time, even at 3:00 I wasn't wasting time. It was then that I checked my mirror and saw a Mustang closing in my lane *FAST*, he  had just turned the corner and was just noticing me. Luckly he saw me and  changed lanes in time, I estamate he was moving in excess of 90 or so. I was just a by stander, I had no chance of runing from him, or moving out  of his way. I'm glad he saw my brake lights in time. I shudder to  think of what would have happened had I wainted to pull out and not  left the time he needed to dodge me.

He also comes to first reveal the root cause of original sin (fallen nature) and then provide a means to cut the connection to that original sin.  He also wants to create world peace based on Godism.  The messiah's teachings will build on the foundation of the Bible but provide profound new insights into the nature of God, the fall of man, the purpose of creation, and God's providence of restoration.  It will also provide a foundation for the unity of all the World's religions.  Many Christians expect Jesus to come on literal clouds, so they may miss him when he returns. Just as the Jewish people missed Jesus 2000 years ago.  They are still waiting for his first coming.  The Jewish people of that age expected Elijah to come first.  Jesus said that John the Baptist was Elijah. But John the Baptist denied that he was Elijah.  (How did this reflect on Jesus?)  Later in prison John even questioned who Jesus was: \\\"is he the one who is to come or do we look for another\\\". (see book of Matthew)   David Koresh didn't even come close.  The problem is that people like this make it difficult for people to believe and trust in the real Messiah when he does show up.   Very good point and perhaps the most important point of all for Christians: How to recognize the Second Coming?  The Messiah should not claim to be God.  What sets a Messiah apart is that he is born without original sin.  He is not born perfect but achieves perfection after a period of growth.  Adam and Eve were born sinless but they fell, and this tragedy meant that it would take God thousands of years to create the kingdom of heaven on the earth as God originally intended.  God's restoration providence is still not complete.  The messiah is the true Son of God, one with God, God's representative on the earth, but not God himself.  There is only one God.  ...    Who else in this world is claiming to be the Messiah.  Maybe he's already here.\",\" >  >In the UK, it's impossible to get approval to attach any crypto device  >to the phone network.

Trigger a oneshot from the decoded riseing edge ;the one shot then goes to a mosfet to drive the mechanism to fire the pellet launcher.. these ckts require uAmps of current,between 5 - 15 volts, so a 12 volt gel cell of a few Amphours would last the six weeks. Then take the ckt board & battery wrap in 3\\\" or 4\\\" of foam or build a box of out of the stuff...with plywood or metal exterior... build a small heater out of 10-50 Watt resistors in series to keep the battery and ckts warm. 2nd thought use 2 batteries one for heater one for timer and pellet trigger.  Insolate-insolate.......even though the chips state that the - AL rated devices are good to -55 C.. The batteries have a considerable reduction in capacity...oh make sure the area inside has minium air leakage..  hope this helps RW     ( is this to long winded for the net??)(be gentle)...\",\" ------------ Part 7 of 14 ------------ MI:6EI:6EI:6EI:6EI:6EI:6EI:6EI4='1T='1T='1T='I:6EI:6EI:6EI0L+ M\\\"PL+\\\"PL+\\\"PL+\\\"PL+\\\"PL+I:6EI:6E1T='1T='W]_?W]]Z>GHJ*BJ[NUY>`P,# M`YF9F9D]/3T]/9F9F0->7KN[N[N[7EX#`P.9F9F'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MASC`P,!;;L`X.$O#P\\\\!;`M2YYK9:5]3/R%?/`A2JKB+L._$^AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX=75\\\\@%2J##=4V^,\\\"F,N)P-]5%1JZ$D*61DOF1D9(ST!H>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AVPVT_%N2IJL8YMD9#OQ M(K[Q9*R'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AU=75U>BP2'<`EMLTXCL'6X%2J\\\"L\\\\2WE922, M!F`-4<Q@4?6'AX>'A\\\\!+6ZJBU-3/5]345]175U>B:W69TG$9L+\\\"PL+!3BS3% MQ6=G9P],3(F)R<F)B8F)B<G)%A865%145%14%A86%A86%A86%A86%A;)R80- M$PU1S.%D\\\\64B[[;OO;6Q.XE,3&=&-C84HM2`7PRV?M3J7T,=:!V`P2&L[.S!

-------- End of part 7 of 14 --------     \",\" We're probably stuck, as Mike Burger pointed out that the baseball deal was made far in advance of the NHL contract.  WABC did the same thing; they were thankful that the Devils were wiped out by 9:30, because they had to switch over to Yankees baseball.  The proof of  the reasons for this is left to the reader ...  It's too bad, but I wonder if ESPN is stuck with other US local team coverage for their alternate games?  We got NESN's coverage of the Bruins-Sabres with the Boston homers ... they were awful!!!  I've read that Derek Sanderson is the colour analyst ... I wonder if he spent his early years after hockey as an intern at PRAVDA before landing this job?  *Everything* had to be twisted into something good to say about the Bruin(s) involved ... not even Bill Wirtz's shills on SC Chicago (Pat Foley, Dale Tallon) were this bad.  And just to be fair, SC used to take their feed from ESN (Empire Sports Network), the Sabre homers and they were horrible too ... but they were spacy.  From the CNN highlights, I hear Chris Cuthbert's voice from the CBC coverage of the Habs-Nords series.  Too bad that we couldn't get it on ESPN, with all due respect to the Sabres and the Bruins.  Mike Emrick is substituting on the Devils SCNY team for Gary Thorne. Mike was the original Devils TV play-by-play announcer, by the way.  gld\",\"Source: Hassan Arfa, \\\"The Kurds,\\\" (London, 1968), pp. 25-26.   \\\"When the Russian armies invaded Turkey after the Sarikamish disaster    of 1914, their columns were preceded by battalions of irregular    Armenian volunteers, both from the Caucasus and from Turkey. One of    these was commanded by a certain Andranik, a blood-thirsty adventurer.   These Armenian volunteers committed all kinds of excesses, more   than six hundred thousand Kurds being killed between 1915 and 1916 in    the eastern vilayets of Turkey.\\\"   Serdar Argic\",\"Help! I am working on a project that involves using text with foreign language characters (in this case Norwegian). I have been manipulating the data with Excell 4.0 and then exporting the data as comma seperated variable files to an RS6000 workstation.  The Norwegian characters show up fine under Windows, but appear as \\\"funny\\\" characters on the workstation.  The workstation is setup for national language support and we have problem entering the Norwegian characters from the workstation keyboard.  On further investigation I found that the character codes used by Windows are different (for these characters) than those specified by the MSDOS code page.  The MSDOS codes seem to be the same as the workstation.  What gives, and how can get around it. Please reply by E-mail as I will be out of the office the next few days and will not be reading the news.

I tooke them out and put some silicone sealant on them and put them back in. \",\" You're right about the signal being strong. I live in West Philadelphia, and I can get FAN almost perfectly. It's a sports fans dream (especially if that person is from NY and wants to hear about his teams while he's away at school). As for Lupica & Berman, it's turned out to be Lupica, then Berman. Neither of them wanted to work a full four hour show, so Ed Coleman and Dave Sims' old four-hour slot was broken down into two seperate two-hour show - Lupica from 10-12, and Berman from 12-2. And they both happen to suck in comparison to Eddie and Dave.  COME BACK, GUYS!   Like I said, I live in Philly, so I can hear FAN and/or WIP whenever I want. But I cannot stand WIP. And it isn't because I loathe the Philly sports teams - the Phillies are my favorite NL team (Yanks are favorite AL), and the Eagles aren't too bad either. There are two big problems:   1)Total emphasis on the home teams, especially the Eagles. Unlike    the FAN hosts, who can at least answer a question about an    out-of-town team if a caller asks, the WIP hosts seem     to have no clue about any team that doesn't play on    Broad Street. Also, FANs periodic sports updates (every 20    minutes) gives sports news and scores from around the    country. It's very rare to hear an out-of-town score    being reported on WIP.   2)The hosts. With the exception of Jody MacDonald, who I miss    from his days at FAN, none of the hosts really seems to have    both a broad knowledge of the sport or a good on-air presence.    The worst is Gary Cobb, who seems to have been hired solely    on the basis that he used to play for the Eagles.  Anyway, that's my two cents on the whole FAN vs WIP battle.\",\"   The newspaper itself is almost certainly copyrighted in its entirety.

For example after Tienanmien Square in Beijing the Chinese government began monitoring cyberspace.

But what's the big deal?  You shouldn't advocate illegal acts in this medium in any case.  If you are concerned about being monitored, you should use encyrption software (available in IGC's \\\"micro\\\" conference).

Syria and Lebanon have a right to determine if they wish to return to the situation prior to the French invasion where they were both part of the same \\\"mandate territory\\\" - read colony.  Israel has no right to determine what happens in Lebanon. Invading another country because you consider them a threat is precisely the way that almost all wars of aggression have started.    Again territorial expansion by force.    The UN defines them as occupied. They are recognised as such by every nation on earth (excluding one small caribean island).    So the Adam thinks that peace is possible with continued occupation and  a continued military presence? That is a completely unsustainable situation because the USA is bankrupt and simply cannot afford to finance the Israeli ecconomy any more. There is no money for such an occupation.    They were moved in as part of a deliberate policy to prevent the return of the occupied territories. Machiavelli described the reasoning in the Prince. The clear intention was to create a constituency which the Likud beleived could not be deprived of the land stolen from the indigenous population.  The pretexts under which the settlers aquired land was through the  redefinition of much land used in common as \\\"public land\\\". The assertion that the village common on which the village depends for food belongs to an invader simply because no individual has title is clearly an excuse. When the land is used to build a condominium for aliens brought in to occupy the land for a foreign power there is a clear breach of the Geneva convention which stipulates that land use in occupied territories must not be changed.   No amount of self justifying on the part of Likud and hard linner appologists will change the fact that the majority of world governments, and all of those that actually have any power have condemned this practice.    Theyu also are a liability. We are talking about civilian encampments that would last no more than hours against tanks,   Don't fool yourself. It was the gulf war that brought the Israelis to the negotiating table. Once their US backers had a secure base in the gulf they insrtructed Shamir to negotiate or else.  If the creation of settlements had gone on any longer the USA would have cut the money supply.   Not at all. They can chose to live in an arab state or return to Israel.   The existence of a comunity does not give the right for another country to annexe territory, not in Bosnia, not in the West Bank.   Unless the new boundaries drawn up are those of 48 there will be no peace. Araffat has precious little authority to agree to anything else.   The real issue is not the land treaty but the trade treaty. Since the Palestinians will remain heavily dependent on Israel indefinitely it is this that will be the guarantor of peace. another factor will be the return of lands confiscated by the Israeli state within Israel and the dismantling of the shadow structures which allow discrimination against non-Jews within what is nominaly a secular state.   The irony is that in return for a guarantee that the palestinian state has a non descrimination law in order to protect the remaining settlers the Israeli state is going to be forced inot the same position. This will mean outlawing of discrimination such as that which prevents arabs from buying or using much of the land.   \",\"   \\\"Thinking if I could see, I would believe.

Features:     Client-Server based model, using Berkeley Sockets.    No limit to the number of users (apart from performance).    Generic clients.    Customizable servers.    Hierachical Objects (allowing attachment of cameras and light sources).    Multiple light sources (ambient, point and spot).    Objects can have extension code, to handle unique functionality, easily         attached.  Functionality:    Client:    The client is built around a 'fast' render loop. Basically it changes things    when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user's    viewpoint. It also provides the server with information about the user's    actions - which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to    other users.     The client is designed to be generic - in other words you don't need to    develop a new client when you want to enter a new world. This means that    resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting    it. The adaptations, as will be explained in a moment, occur in the servers.     This release of the client software supports the following functionality:      o Hierarchical Objects (with associated addressing)      o Multiple Light Sources and Types (Ambient, Point and Spot)      o User Interface Panels      o Colour Polygonal Rendering with Phong Shading (optional wireframe for  faster frame rates)      o Mouse and Keyboard Input     (Some people may be disappointed that this software doesn't support the    PowerGlove as an input device - this is not because it can't, but because    I don't have one! This will, however, be one of the first enhancements!)    Server(s):    This is where customization can take place. The following basic support is    provided in this release for potential world server developers:      o Transparent Client Management      o Client Message Handling     This may not sound like much, but it takes away the headache of accepting and    terminating clients and receiving messages from them - the application writer    can work with the assumption that things are happening locally.     Things get more interesting in the object extension functionality. This is    what is provided to allow you to animate your objects:      o Server Selectable Extension Installation:         What this means is that you can decide which objects have extended         functionality in your world. Basically you call the extension         initialisers you want.      o Event Handler Registration:         When you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback         functions for the events that you want the object to respond to.         (Current events supported: INIT, MOVE, CHANGE, COLLIDE & TERMINATE)      o Collision Detection Registration:         If you want your object to respond to collision events just provide         some basic information to the collision detection management software.         Your callback will be activated when a collision occurs.      This software is kept separate from the worldServer applications because     the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects     from which to choose.      The following is all you need to make a World Server application:      o Provide an initWorld function:         This is where you choose what object extensions will be supported, plus         any initialization you want to do.      o Provide a positionObject function:         This is where you determine where to place a new client.      o Provide an installWorldObjects function:         This is where you load the world (.wld) file for a new client.      o Provide a getWorldType function:         This is where you tell a new client what persona they should have.      o Provide an animateWorld function:         This is where you can go wild! At a minimum you should let the objects         move (by calling a move function) and let the server sleep for a bit         (to avoid outrunning the clients).      That's all there is to it! And to prove it here are the line counts for the     three world servers I've provided:          generic - 81 lines         dactyl - 270 lines (more complicated collision detection due to the                            stairs! Will probably be improved with future                            versions)         dogfight - 72 lines  Location:     This software is located at the following site:    ftp.u.washington.edu     Directory:    pub/virtual-worlds     File:    multiverse-1.0.2.tar.Z  Futures:     Client:      o Texture mapping.      o More realistic rendering: i.e. Z-Buffering (or similar), Gouraud shading      o HMD support.      o Etc, etc....

On the other hand, I don't see \\\"Clipper\\\" as providing  a secure channel--it just prevents casual eavesdropping.  This is part of why  I am not worried about it per se.  Trying to look at Clipper as a serious  security tool is simply ludicrous.  It's a voice scrambler, nothing more.  There is still plenty of market for real crypto.   They cost an arm and a leg, though. \\\"Clipper\\\" is obviously aimed at the mass  market.  It certainly won't put Cylink out of business.   This is old news.  I can do this now.   There ARE restrictions.  Example: We're a networking software vendor with a  large overseas share of our market.  We cannot currently ship PEM, or even  simple DES, in our products without case-by-case approval from the Department  of State.  ITAR presents a material trade barrier to US firms trying to  compete in international information systems markets.  Sure, you can use whatever freebie software you want to talk over BBS's in  the USA.  I, on the other hand, want strong crypto (PKCS, for example) to be  the *default* for electronic mail, worldwide.  I want priests to be able to  hear confession over email.  I want lawyers to be able to talk to clients in  confidence over email, or doctors talk with patients.  I want to be able to  order products from my favorite Japanese mail-order catalog over the net.  I  want to be able to sign contracts, transact business, and so on  electronically.  This is so far infeasible as a result of the current restrictions on  crytographic systems, especially beyond the borders of the USA.  Clipper is irrelevant, and if it distracts the authorities into feeling safe,  all the better.  Its only danger is if it emboldens them into trying to put  more restrictions into place, on the theory that it is \\\"good enough for  anyone who has nothing to hide.\\\"  That argument is, of course, utter BS, just  as much as \\\"no one needs an assault rifle\\\". \",\"Look in the /pub/SPACE directory on ames.arc.nasa.gov - there are a number of earth images there.

Phil    ------- Forwarded Message  Subject: text of White House announcement and Q&As on clipper chip encryption  Note:  This file will also be available via anonymous file transfer from csrc.ncsl.nist.gov in directory /pub/nistnews and via the NIST Computer Security BBS at 301-948-5717.      ---------------------------------------------------                           THE WHITE HOUSE                    Office of the Press Secretary  _________________________________________________________________  For Immediate Release                           April 16, 1993                   STATEMENT BY THE PRESS SECRETARY   The President today announced a new initiative that will bring the Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary program to improve the security and privacy of telephone communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement.  The initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.  For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.  Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.  A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" has been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new, relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today.  This new technology will help companies protect proprietary information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals.   A \\\"key-escrow\\\" system will be established to ensure that the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique                                   2   \\\"keys,\\\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately in two \\\"key-escrow\\\" data bases that will be established by the Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap.  The \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans.  To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings.  The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield criminals and terrorists.  We need the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" and other approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system), the President has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:       --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to           employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;       --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone           calls and data, under proper court or other legal           order, when necessary to protect our citizens;       --   the effective and timely use of the most modern           technology to build the National Information           Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and           the competitiveness of American industry in the global           marketplace; and        --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export           high technology products.  The President has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.                                    3  The Administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a National Information Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks (\\\"information superhighways\\\") will transmit video, images, HDTV programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone system transmits voice.  Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law.  Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet.  The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available.

A:   No.  \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with      no new authorities to access the content of the private      conversations of Americans.  Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on      a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation      encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to      decipher the message?  A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a      court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They      would then present documentation of this authorization to      the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and      obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug      smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are      stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key      escrow system.  Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?  A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent      entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the      Administration have yet to determine which agencies will      oversee the key-escrow data banks.  Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure      how strong the security is?    A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption      systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will      remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow      system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of      cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all      potential users that there are no unrecognized      vulnerabilities.  Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?  A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the      Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in      this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the      President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet      officials.  Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?  A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on      encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify      as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have      briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the      decisions related to this initiative.  Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?  A:   The government designed and developed the key access      encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the      microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product      manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip      manufacturer that produces them.  Q:   Who provides the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\"?  A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,      California, and will sell the chip to encryption device      manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed      to other vendors in the future.  Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices?   A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating      the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" into their devices.       Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological      solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be      willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more      powerful encryption devices?  A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be      considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow      mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product      that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive      than others readily available today, but it is just one      piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to      encryption technology, which the Administration is      developing.       The Administration is not saying, \\\"since encryption      threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,      we will prohibit it outright\\\" (as some countries have      effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \\\"every      American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an      unbreakable commercial encryption product.\\\"  There is a      false \\\"tension\\\" created in the assessment that this issue is      an \\\"either-or\\\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,      and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,      balanced approach such as is proposed with the \\\"Clipper      Chip\\\" and similar encryption techniques.  Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton      Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from      that of the Bush Administration?    A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption      technology in telecommunications and computing and are      committed to working with industry and public-interest      groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'      privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law      enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime      and terrorism.  Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use      the government hardware?\",\" \",\"  [ etc. ]  Hey, he's the only manager so far to lead the Seattle Mariners to a  winning season, out of, what, fifteen?

How does one tell if a Second Coming is the real thing, unless the person claiming to be IT is obviously insane?  I'm not saying that David Koresh is the Second Coming of Christ.  How could somebody who breaks his word be the Second Coming?  Koresh did promise that he would come out of his compound if only he was allowed to give a radio broadcast.  He didn't.  Still it seems to me that he did fool some people.  And, from my meagre knowledge of the Bible, it seems that Christians have been hard on the Jews of Christ's day for being cautious about accepting somebody that their religious authorities didn't accept as the Messiah.  So I was surprised that nobody had discussed the difficulty of wanting to be early to recognize the Second Coming while, at the same time, not wanting to be credulously believing just anybody who claims to be God.  [Mark 13:21   And then if any one says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!'  or 'Look, there he is!' do not believe it.

My understanding of Jesus' answer is that, unlike his first coming, which was veiled, the second coming will be quite unmistakeable.  He's telling us not to be misled by the other things that have to happen before his second coming -- the actual second coming will make his power openly visible.  By the way, from Koresh's public statement it's not so clear to me that he is claiming to be Christ.\",\" Hi!

You see, there's a thing called a tie.  A tie is worth one point (I know, I know. You're not good at math. But bear with me). A win is worth two points.

There is a _massively_ longer tradition for proclaiming the Passion accounts without active participation.  If you know the Latin, one really beautiful way to hear the Passion is it's being chanted by three deacons:  the Narrator chants in the middle baritone range, Jesus chants in the bass, and others directly quoted are handled by a high tenor. This is actually the basis for the common proclamation of the Passion that John would prefer.  But there is always a judgement call based on pastoral considerations. Each pastor makes his own decisions (it isn't a church-wide conspiracy against participation).  The Palm Sunday liturgy, with its initial blessing and distribution of the palms and procession, is already getting long before you get to the Passion; some pastors feel that they should not make the people stand through that long narrative.  Also, the orchestrated proclamation with multiple readers and public participation in the crowd quotations runs longer than the single-reader proclamation --- in churches with multiple Masses for the Sunday, it might be necessary to go with the briefer options just to \\\"get 'em in and get 'em out\\\".  Each parish is different.  Catholics are no longer canonically tied to their geographic parishes.  It is possible that another Catholic parish in the Columbus area (based on the Ohio State address) has a liturgy closer to your preferences.  Or talk to some of your fellow parishioners and see how common your preferences are --- pastors generally ARE willing to listen to non-confrontational requests.  Though you probably should bring along a paramedic in case he reacts too strongly to the shock of people asked for a _longer_ Sunday Mass.  Perhaps the problem is that recent liturgical development hasn't follow the continuous evolution model (the accumulation of small changes, no single one of which is too hard to take) but rather the punctuated equilibrium model (things stay the same and we get accustomed to them, then the marked mutation hits).  {My apologies if I am mis-remembering the names of the evolutionary theories.}\",\"JL> From: jlecher@pbs.org JL> > I would not classify a mild headache that was continuous for weeks JL> > as migraine, even if the other typical features were there (e.g., JL> > unilateral, nausea and vomiting, photophobia).

The differential diagnosis between migraine and non-migranous pain is not *always* important, because some therapies are effective in both (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen).  Other therapies may be more specific: beta-blockers such as propranolol work better in migraine than tension-type headache.  The most important thing, from your perspective, is that you got relief.

Which leads to below:   I think at this point there's a personal, emotional element involved here which transcends Murray's logical thought.  As outsiders, it's fine for  us to say, \\\"He should hire a different coach.\\\"  In fact, he has talked about doing so in the past.  But, the press (here in Detroit, at least) has so built up this business about Murray never getting past the second round of the playoffs as a coach, that I think he has taken it upon himself to  prove to the world that he *is* capable of coaching a team past the second round.  He needs to, as the papers say, \\\"get that monkey off his back.\\\" So it becomes a matter not of intelligence, but of pride.  Is it foolish to let pride stand in the way of sound logic?  Perhaps, but we're all a little that way from time to time.  I think eventually he'll step down from behind the bench and concentrate on his GM duties, and the team will improve as a result.  I think his coaching duties take away time he might have otherwise spent on GM work.  In that sense, once he steps down as coach, we'll see how good of a GM he really is.   I may not agree with everything you've said, but it's been fun discussing it with you. \",\" I think one (not ideal) solution is to use the tracing utility (can't remember the name, sorry!) included in the Corel Draw s/w pack.  It can convert bitmaps to Corel art format.  These can then be imported into a drawing rather than the bitmap. Result - the file is completely in Corel format and can be SCODAL'ed no problem!  BUT the slight problem with this, which makes the solution less than idea, is that the trace utility spits out many more points than are necessary to define the shapes being traced.  Straight lines and curves are both traced as many short segments.  So... the SCODAL taking *much* longer to image.  The obvious solution is time-consuming - stripping out the extra points by hand using Corel.  OUCH! I've done it a few times :-]                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  As I say, if you don't mind the problems, go via the route... BITMAP -> COREL (VIA TRACE) -> HAND TRIMMING (USING COREL)!!! -> COMBINE WITH MAIN COREL PIC (VIA IMPORT) -> SCODAL\",\"  Yes, I have!  Wasn't there a case of a single lion ruling all the land from South Africa up to Egypt across to the congo?  If my memory serves me correctly there was enough game to feed some 100,000 or more lions but he wouldn't let the other lions hunt as he wanted it all himself.  He died of a heart attack brought on by being overweight.  Good thing too as he had designs on Europe, America (north and south), and the Falkland Islands.   \",\" True.  At first, the news media seemed entranced by all the new gizmos the military was using, not to mention the taped video transmissions from the missiles as they zeroed in on their targets.  But later, and especially after the bunker full of civilians was hit, they changed their tone.  It seemed to me that they didn't have the stomach for the reality of war, that innocent people really do die and are maimed in warfare.  It's like they were only pro-Gulf-War as long as it was \\\"nice and clean\\\" (smart missiles dropping in on military HQs), but not when pictures of dead, dying, and maimed civilians started cropping up.  What naive hypocrites!   [ discussion about blanket-bombing and A-bombs deleted.]                             ^^^^^^^^^  I should have said here \\\"militarily justified\\\".  It seems from your comments below that you understood this as meaning \\\"morally justified\\\". I apologize.   I have often wondered about this.  I've always thought that the first bomb should have been dropped on Japan's island fortress of Truk.  A good, inpenatrable military target.  The second bomb could've been held back for use on an industrial center if need be.  But I digress.  Yes, I have heard that we found evidence (after the war, BTW) that Japan was seriously considering surrender after the first bomb.  Unfortunately, the military junta won out over the moderates and rejected the US's ulimatum.  Therefore the second bomb was dropped.  Most unfortunate, IMO.   I don't regret the fact that sometimes military decisions have to be made which affect the lives of innocent people.  But I do regret the  circumstances which make those decisions necessary, and I regret the suffering caused by those decisions.    [...]   Actually, it was the fact that both situations existed that prompted US and allied action.  If some back-water country took over some other back-water country, we probably wouldn't intervene.  Not that we don't care, but we can't be the world's policman.  Or if a coup had occured in Kuwait (instead of an invasion), then we still wouldn't have acted because there would not have been the imminent danger perceived to Saudi Arabia.  But the combination of the two, an unprovoked invasion by a genocidal tyrant AND the potential danger to the West's oil  interests, caused us to take action.   [...]  I'm not setting up a strawman at all.  If you want to argue against the war, then the only logical alternative was to allow Hussein to keep Kuwait.  Diplomatic alternatives, including sanctions, were ineffective.  Well, in a sense, yes.  They probably had no idea of what end Hitler would lead their nation to.   They suffered along with the rest.  Why does this bother you so much? The world is full of evil, and circumstances are not perfect.  Many innocents suffer due to the wrongful actions of others.  It it regretable, but that's The-Way-It-Is.  There are no perfect solutions.  [...]  Probably because we're not the saviors of the world.  We can't police each and every country that decides to self-destruct or invade another.  Nor are we in a strategic position to get relief to Tibet, East Timor, or some other places.  Tell me how we could stop them and I'll support it.  I, for one, do not agree with the present US policy of \\\"sucking up to them\\\" as you put it. I agree that it is deplorable.   Are they?  Or are they supposed to reflect the population of the locale where the trial is held?  (Normally this is where the crime is committed unless one party or the other can convince the judge a change of venue is in order.)  I'm not an expert on California law, or even US law, but it seems that this is the way the system is set up.  You can criticize the system, but let's not have unfounded allegations of racial  prejudice thrown around.   No, not at all.  The point is that the fact that there were no blacks on the first jury and that Rodney King is black is totally irrelevant.   Germans, perhaps.  \\\"Peers\\\" doesn't mean \\\"those who do the same thing\\\", like having murderers judge murderers.  It means \\\"having people from the same station in life\\\", presumably because they are in a better position to understand the defendent's motivation(s).   OK, granted.  However, you are using this reasoning as part of *your* logical argument in this discussion.  This is not a court of law.  The media is not totally monolithic.  Even though there is a prevailing liberal bias, programs such as the MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour try to give a balanced and fair reporting of the news.  There are even conservative sources out there if you know where to look.  (Hurrah for Rush!)  BTW, I never used the word \\\"conspiracy\\\".  I don't accept (without *far* more evidence) theories that there is some all-pervading liberal conspiracy attempting to take over all news sources.   Hardly.  I didn't say that it's a Good Thing [tm] to kill innocent people if the end is just.  Unfortunately, we don't live in a perfect world and there are no perfect solutions.  If one is going to  resist tyranny, then innocent people on both sides are going to suffer and die.  I didn't say it is OK -- it is unfortunate, but sometimes necessary.   I would agree that it was evil in the sense that it caused much pain and suffering.  I'm not so sure that it was unnecessary as you say.  That conclusion can only be arrived at by evaluating all the factors involved. And perhaps it *was* unnecessary as (let's say) we now know.  That doesn't mean that those who had to make the decision to bomb didn't see it as being necessary.  Rarely can one have full known of the consequences of an action before making a decision.  At the time it may have seemed necessary enough to go ahead with it.  But don't assume that I feel the bombing was *morally* justified -- I don't!  I just don't condemn those who had to make a difficult decision under difficult circumstances.   You certainly are not in such a position if you are a moral relativist. I, as an absolutist, am in a position to judge, but I defer judgment.   Wrong.  They were neither moral then nor now.  They seemed necessary to those making the decisions to bring a quick end to the war.  I simply refuse to condemn them for their decision.  One day I will stand before Jesus and give account of every word and action; even this discourse in this forum.  I understand the full ramifications of that, and I am prepared to do so.  I don't believe that you can make the same claim.   And BTW, the reason I brought up the blanket-bombing in Germany was because you were bemoaning the Iraqi civilian casualties as being  \\\"so deplorable\\\".  Yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombing wasn't accurate enough to hit industrial/military targets in a decisive way by any other method at that time.  But in the Gulf War, precision bombing was the norm.  So the point was, why make a big stink about the relatively few civilian casualties that resulted *in spite of* precision bombing, when so many more civilians (proportionately and quantitatively) died under the blanket bombing in WW2?  Even with precision bombing, mistakes happen and some civilians suffer.  But less civilians suffered in this war than any other iany other in history!  Many Iraqi civilians went about their lives with minimal interference from the allied air raids.  The stories of \\\"hundreds of thousands\\\" of Iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk. Yes, bunk.  The US lost 230,000 servicemen in WW2 over four years and the majority of them were directly involved in fighting!  But  we are expected to swallow that \\\"hundreds of thousands\\\" of  *civilian* Iraqis died in a war lasting about 2 months!  And with  the Allies using the most precise bombs ever created at that!   What hogwash.  If \\\"hundreds of thousands\\\" of Iraqi civilians died,  it was due to actions Hussein took on his own people, not due to  the Allied bombing.

It is good to hear that there are a few reasonable Christians about. If only those christian \\\"scientists\\\" would take note.  (In Australia there is a very strong movement, a bunch of christian  scientists who believe that every single event in the bible is exactly true, and that there is a rational explanation for it all that can be justified by using the laws of physics.  For example, there are a few chaps who are  trying to prove that the age of the universe is 6000 years old, and that the error in conventional calculations is the result of the fact that the speed  light has been rapidly decaying over the years, and this has not been  accounted for. :-] )   Or (of course), that he never existed, and the bible was a story, and was never  intended to become a manifesto for a billion people.  Did Tony follow that one up?   Millions of people have \\\"died for a lie\\\".  This  point is difficult to  substantiate since it is not well defined (a great many religious arguments work in that way), but consider the many Aztec warriors who sacrificed  themselves to their gods in the belief that this act would bring them victory of the Spanish invaders.  The list is endless.  The Aztecs lost, BTW.     That is perfectly reasonable, but it is not grounds for me (or anyone) to become a christian.  More to the point, it does not add weight to the claim that Jesus was the \\\"real thing\\\".    Have you ever seen a documentary about the rise of Nazi Germany?  More to the point, did Tony mention this?  One could hardly call Werner Heisenberg and his many colleagues  fools, or  illogical men, their support of Hitler was based  (I presume) upon an emotional issue rather than a rational agreement with  his principles.  Obviously my argument is invalid if Tony thought that Hitler was sane....      Hmmm.... I don't think his arguments warrant the use of a \\\"Therefore...\\\"   This is (unfortunately) what alot of religious discussions I have had with people result in - quoting the bible.  The only reasonable way I think people can look at the bible is to treat the stories as some sort of metaphorical representation of the messages that the authors were trying to present.  If someone tries to interpret parts of the bible literally, he or she will end up in all sorts of shit.     Tony's argument would be perfectly reasonable for people who believe the events described in the bible took place, but to convince someone,  who thinks the bible is total fiction, that Jesus is real by quoting the book is totally pointless.  For example, in mathematics you cannot say \\\"a is equal to b because a is equal to b\\\".       That would possibly explain why there have so many people being killed  in religious wars, and why there are hundreds of different versions all claiming to be correct.    It   I think if you posted this part to alt.religion you would get more flames than here :-).  I have never really understood why the emotional sentiments of a stranger should be of interest to other people.

If you have an obvious hernia sac coming down  into your scrotum, or a bulge in your groin that is brought about by increasing intra-abdominal pressure.... Sometimes is not that obvious. The hernia is small and you can only  detect it by putting your finger into the inguinal canal.  Whether you have a recurrent hernia, or this is related to the previous operation, I can't tell you. The person that examined you is in  the best position to make that determination.  Are there non-invasive ways of diagnosing a hernia?

In case you don't know, Krillean Photography, to the best of my    knowledge, involves taking pictures of an (most of the time) organic    object between charged plates. The picture will show energy patterns    or spikes around the object photographed, and depending on what type    of object it is, the spikes or energy patterns will vary. One might    extrapolate here and say that this proves that every object within    the universe (as we know it) has its own energy signature.  There have been a number of scientific papers (in peer-reviewed journals) published about Kirlian photography in the early 1970s.  Sorry I can't be more specific but it is a long time since I read them.  They would describe what is needed and how to set up the apparatus.    These papers demonstrate that the auras obtained by Kirlian photography can be completely explained by the effect of the electric currents used on the moisture in the object being photographed.  It has nothing to do with the \\\"energy signature\\\" of organic objects.  I did a science project on Kirlian photography when I was in high school.

As I recall, the coronas visible are ascribed to static discharges and chemical reactions between the organic material and the silver halides in the films. \",\" The proper term for what Mike expresses is Monophysitism.  This was a heresy that was condemned in the Council of Chalcedon in 451 AD.  It grew up in reaction to Nestorianism, which held that the Son and Jesus are two different people who happened to be united in the same body temporarily.  Monophysitism is held by the Copts of Egypt and Ethipoia and by the Jacobites of Syria and the Armenian Orthodox.  It believes that Jesus Christ was God (which is correct), that he was man (which is correct), that he was one person (which is correct), but that he had only one nature and one will and oen energy (which is heretical, the orthodox position is that he had two natures and two wills and two energies, both divine and human, though the wills were in perfect harmony).  That is what Mike is trying to get across, that while Jesus came in human form, Mike says He did not have a human nature or a human will.  In reality, he had both, though neither made him subject to original sin. It is interesting to note that the Monothelites were a reaction to this conflict and attempted to solve the problem by admitting two natures but not two wills or two energies.  It also was condemned, at a late council in Constantinople I believe.  Andy Byler\",\": My 9 yr old son has signed up to do a science report on batteries.

Pros arrive late, nervousness for  rookie WC players, and problems to get the lines clicking may make things  hard to get it going against these \\\"worse\\\" nations.  I'd guess that the better team you face in the opening game, the better  it is, since the chances of an upset are greater then.   Some other reasons why the \\\"worse\\\" teams are so tough to beat was presented  by Hans \\\"Virus\\\" Lindberg (former coach in Switzerland).   1) The \\\"worse\\\" teams (referring to France, Switzerland, Austria, Italy etc)     have now usually world class goalies.   2) Their defensive play have become much more disciplined, they take much     less unnecessary penalties.   3) They use four lines which makes it harder to make them \\\"run out of gas.\\\"   4) The ice quality in the German WC rinks is poor.   Another weird thing was that the Czechs played entertaining hockey..  err.. just kidding, David.   Alex? That's a new name for me ;)   OK, I forgot the Czech roster at home yesterday, but now I have it.

I recently posted about how I received a bad vram chip for my new LCIII, and someone responded that it may not actually be bad, but it may be a 512K LC vram chip, and thus doesn't work properly with my computer. So I'm wondering if anyone can interpret these codes for me, so I can figure out what type of chip MacConnection sent me.     2515251  On the back of the card, it says 0593  I believe from the numbers that means it is an 80ns chip, but I can't figure out what the size is supposed to be. If anyone can help, I'd be grateful. Please email me your response. Thanks a lot!  --  Hillel Sims  -----  simsh@rpi.edu  -----  Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute\",\"With a little luck, I could own a C650 sometime in the near future, and so I was just wondering if someone could clear these two questions up for me:  1.  What speed SIMMS does the C650 need/want?  (I know that it needs 80ns VRAM...not sure for the main RAM.)  2.  I've heard two conflicting stories about the total expandibility of the C650's RAM...132 and 136 megs.  Which is true?  (Perhaps another phrasing would be better:  does the 8 meg version come with all 8 megs on the logic board, or 4 megs + a 4 meg SIMM?)  Just wondering.... \",\"  You are conveniently ommitting the fact that the Arab governments told the Arab citizens of Israel to leave Israel, join with the Arab armies so that after what they felt like an assured victory occured, these Arabs could return to their former homes, reclaim them as well as anything else they wanted that belonged to Jews.  When the Arabs lost, Israel was left with a bunch of people who has just tried to kill them who now wanted back into the country as citizens.  What would you have done?  Let them in so they could kill Jews?  Israel sees those Arabs who stayed as citizens  because they were loyal to Israel during the war and didn't leave.  Of course some Arabs could have left to avoid the fighting but distinguishing between the two is impossible.  Therefore a decision was made based on secuturity of the country.   No kibbutz that I have ever visited has any \\\"employees\\\" unless they had to hire some people for the restaurants, hotels etc if there weren't enough  people ON the kibbutz to do them.  In such cases, they are paid properly. If a kibbutz turns away an Arab, 9I have never seen or heard of this) but it reflects only on the membership comittee of that kibbutz, not the whole kibbutz movement.   This just shows how ignorant you are of Israeli politics.  Although the  major parties in Israel aren't religious (however not totally secular), due to the format of the government (coalition) the religious parties have always had a lot of pull since they were needed to form a majority coalition. In fact, from what I heard the present government is the least influenced by the religious parties in the existance of Israel.  Israel CANNOT be called a secular state.  For instace, Haifa is the only city in the country (except for maybe some Arab cities) where buses run on the Jewish Sabbath.   There are many other examples of religion in Israel.  Marriages in Israel are NOT contolled by the state, but by Rabbis and Priests.  Obviously your  disbelief of this fact sheds some light of your ignorance of the country you claim to know so much about.

What scientists call an atom is nothing more than a mathematical model that describes  certain physical, observable properties of our surroundings.  All of which is subjective.    What is objective, though, is the approach a scientist  takes in discussing his model and his observations.  There is no objective science.  But there is an objective approach which is subjectively selected by the scientist.  Objective in this case means a specified, unchanging set of rules that he and his colleagues use to discuss their science.  This is in contrast to your Objective Morality.  There may be an objective approach to subjectively discuss your beliefs on morality.  But there exists no objective morality.  Also, science deals with how we can discuss our observations of  the physical world around us.  In that the method of discussion is objective ( not the science; not the discussion itself ).  Science makes no claims to know the whys or even the hows sometimes of what we can observe.  It simply gives us a way to discuss our surroundings in a meaningful, consistent way.  I think it was Neils Bohr who said (to paraphrase) Science is what we can _say_ about the physical world.\",\"    Sorry, but olwm and tvtwm don't do it. They place the title at that position    and the window at a position below it.     This becomes a problem when you want a program to be able to save its current    configuration and restore is later.     Currently, my solution is:      XCreateWindow(...);     XSetWMProperties(..);     XMapWindow(...);     XFlush(...);     XMoveWindow(...);      It works with olwm, but is less than elegant. All this leaves me wondering    if I'm overlooking something obvious.     Richard.   I know that the mwm has an resource to specify if positions are to be used for the border of a window or for the \\\"user\\\" window. Maybe other window managers have similar options. Another way to figure out the difference between the \\\"user\\\" window position and the window manager decoration window position is to subtract their positions. You just have to use XQueryTree and remember that the window manager decorations window is the parent of your window. Unfortunately, you can only figure out the decoration width and height after the window has been mapped this way.\",\"  \\\"Assuming\\\"? Also: come on, Brad. If we are going to get anywhere in  this (or any) discussion, it doesn't help to bring up elements I never  addressed, *nor commented on in any way*. I made no comment on who is  \\\"right\\\" or who is \\\"wrong\\\", only that civilians ARE being used as cover  and that, having been placed \\\"in between\\\" the Israelis and the guerillas, they *will* be injured as both parties continue their fight.    [The *purpose* of an army's use of military uniforms   is *to set its members apart* from the civilians so that   civilians will not be thought of by the other side as  \\\"combatants\\\". So, what do you think is the \\\"meaning behind\\\",   the intention and the effect when an \\\"army\\\" purposely   *does not were uniforms but goes out of its way to *look   like civilians'? *They are judging that the benefit they will   receive from this \\\"cover\\\" is more important that the harm  that will come to civilians.*  This is a comment on the Israeli experience and is saying that the guerillas *do* have some responsibility in putting civilians in \\\"the middle\\\" of this fight. By putting on uniforms and living apart from civilians (barracks, etc.), the guerillas would significantly lower the risk to civilians.   But if the guerillas do this aren't *they* putting themselves  at greater risk? Absolutely, they ask themselves \\\"why set   ourselves apart (by wearing uniforms) when there is a ready-made   cover for us (civilians)? That makes sense from their point of   view, BUT when this cover is used, the guerillas should accept   some of the responsibility for subsequent harm to civilians.   I agree with you here. I have always thought that Israel's bombing sortees and bombing policy is stupid, thoughtless, inhumane AND ineffective. BUT, there is no reason that Israel should passive wait  until attackers chose to act; there is every reason to believe that \\\"taking the fight *to* the enemy\\\" will do more to stop attacks.   As I said previously, Israel spent several decades \\\"sitting passively\\\" on its side of a border and only acting to stop these attacks *after* the attackers had entered Israeli territory. It didn't work very well. The \\\"host\\\" Arab state did little/nothing to try and stop these attacks  from its side of the border with Israel so the number of attacks were considerably higher, as was their physical and psychological impact  on the civilians caught in their path.    This is just another \\\"selectively applied\\\" statement.   The reason for this drawn-out impasse between Ababs/Palestinians and Israelis is that NEITHER side is willing to accept the Word of the other. By your criteria *everyone* should stay away from the negotiations.  That is precisely why the Palestinians (in their recent PISGA proposal for  the \\\"interim\\\" period after negotiations and leading up to full autonomy) are demanding conditions that essentially define \\\"autonomy\\\" already. They DO NOT trust that Israel will \\\"follow through\\\" the entire process and allow Palestinians to reach full autonomy.   Do you understand and accept this viewpoint by the Palestinians?  If you do, then why should Israel's view of Arabs/Palestinians  be any different? Why should they trust the Arab/Palestinians' words? Since they don't, they are VERY reluctant to give up \\\"tangible assets  (land, control of areas) in exchange for \\\"words\\\". For this reason, they are also concerned about the sorts of \\\"guarantees\\\" they will have  that the Arabs WILL follow through on their part of any agreement reached.  Absolutely, so are the Arabs/Palestinians asking FIRST for the Israelis \\\"word\\\" in relation to any agreement? NO, what is being demanded FIRST is LAND. When the issue is LAND, and one party finally gets HOLD of this \\\"land\\\", what the \\\"other party\\\" does is totally irrelevent. If I NOW have possession of this land, your words have absolutely no power; whether Israel chooses to keeps its word does NOT get the land back.   While the \\\"major armaments\\\" (those allowing people to wage \\\"civil wars\\\") have been removed, the weapons needed to cross-border attacks still remain to some extent. Rocket attacks still continue, and \\\"commando\\\" raids only require a few easily concealed weapons and a refined disregard for human life (yours of that of others). Such attacks also continue.   Bat guano. The situation you call for existed in the 1970s and attacks were commonplace.   There is NO WAY these groups can be effectively \\\"disarmed\\\" UNLESS the state is as authoritarian is Syria's. The only other way is for Lebanon to take it upon itself to constantly patrol the entire border with Israel, essentially mirroring Israel's border secirity on its side. It HAS TO PROVE TO ISREAL that it is this committed to protecting Israel from attack from Lebanese territory.  That's what I said, ok? But, doesn't that mean that Syria has to \\\"take over\\\" Lebanon? I don't think Israel or Lebanon would like that. What both \\\"sides\\\" need is to receive something \\\"tangible\\\". The Arabs/ Palestinians are looking for \\\"land\\\" and demanding that they receive it prior to giving anything to Israel. Israel has two problems: 1) if it gives up real *land* it IS exposing itself to a changed geostrategic situation (and that change doesn't help Israel's position), and 2) WHEN it gives up this land IT NEEDS to receive something in return to compensate for the increased risks\",\"  Well, some quick math on my part shows that an 8.3MHz bus, 16 bits wide, performing a transfer every two clock cycles will provide 8.3M bytes/sec.  Someone said that it really takes 3 clock cycles to perform a transfer, so that reduces the transfer rate to 5.5MB/s, which is the commonly-used figure for ISA bus speed.  However, I believe a two-clock transfer is possible (0 wait states).\",\" Such as?  Drunk drivers get back on the road in no time, to kill again.

However, who is at blame is another question. It seems that the entire society that sanctions any sorts of executions-- realizing the risks--is to blame.   Yes, but there is also a probablity that you will kill someone doing any raondom activity.  Presumably, you had not isolated yourself totally from the rest of society because of this.   And I argue that our law system is a similar risk.  Perhaps an innocent person will be punished someday, but we work to prevent this.  In fact, many criminals go free as a result of our trying to prevent punishment of innocents.   But, such accidents are to be totally expected, given the numner of vehicals on the road.  Again, the blame is on society.   Yes, but the state is not at fault in such a case.  The state can only do so much to prevent false witnesses.   Okay, so this is what you call murder.  But, the question is whether or not all such \\\"murders\\\" are wrong.  Are you saying that all taking of human life is wrong, no matter what the circumstances?   But, this is basically how it works.  Society accepts the risk that an innocent person will be murdered by execution.  And, every member of society shares this blame.  And, most people's definitions of murder include some sort of malicious intent, which is not involved in an execution, is it?   Murder violates the golden rule.  Executions do not, because by allowing it at all, society implicitly accepts the consequences no matter who the innocent victim is.   Reading the minds of the jury would certainly tell whether or not a conviction was moral or not.  But, in an objective system, only the absolute truth matters, and the jury system is one method to approximate such a truth.  That is, twelve members must be convinced of a truth.   But then, if we read the minds of these people, we would know that the conviction was unfair.   Yes, while we could objectively determine the difference (if we knew all possible information), we can't always determine the difference in our flawed system.  I think that our system is almost as good as possible, but it still isn't objectively perfect.  You see, it doesn't matter if we *know* it is fair or not.  Objectively, it is either fair or it is not.   But what we know has no effect on an objective system.   Why are you so sure?   Why is *your* reality important?   But, we can assume that the system is fairly decent, at least most likely. And, you realize that the correctness of our system says nothing about a totally ideal and objective system.   Well, we can have an ideal system, but the working system can not be ideal. We can only hope to create a system that is as close an approximation to the ideal system as possible.   Yes, we all bear the responsibility.  Most people seem willing to do this.   We must realize the consequences of all our actions.  Why do you keep separating the justice system from the pack?   I don't think our country has an objective system, but I think such an objective system can exist, in theory.  Without omniscience, an objective system is not possible in practice.\",\"Is Impulse shipping IMAGINE for the PC386/486?

We bought this thing because it (1) has a parallel data input in addition to the usual video signal inputs and (2) claimed to print 256 gray level images.  However, the manual that came with it only describes how to format the parallel data to print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images.  After some initial problems with the parallel interface I now have this thing running from a parallel port of an Hewlett-Packard workstation and I can print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images just fine.  I called the Mitsubishi people and asked about the 256 level claim and they said that was only available when used with the video signal inputs.  This was not mentioned in the sales literature.  However they did say the P78U can do 6 bit/pixel (64 level) images in parallel mode, but they didn't have any information about how to program it to do so, and they would call Japan, etc.  Frankly, I find it hard to believe that if this thing can do 8 bit/pixel images from the video source, it can't store 8 bits/pixel in the memory.  It's not like memory is that expensive any more.

Neil Smith                             WEIRD SCIENCE  Everyone knows how to tell when a politician is lying:  his lips  move.  What may not be equally obvious is that there are  politicians and then there are politicians -- and that the phrase  \\\"political science\\\" is subject to more than one interpretation.    Years ago, we heard how \\\"scientists\\\" were worried that a new Ice  Age might be coming, and later on that \\\"nuclear winter\\\" -- smoke  and dust thrown into the atmosphere by full-scale international  unpleasantness -- was a possibility.  Something like that may even  have killed the dinosaurs.    What we didn't hear was that no actual data supported any of this,  that real-world events (the burning of Kuwaiti oil fields) tended  to discredit it, that mostly it was propaganda meant to weaken  values that made America the most successful culture in history,  and that the dinosaurs probably died of something like the Plague  when continents drifted together, exposing them to new germs.    We miss a lot like this, unless we listen closely.  Prince William  Sound, site of the famous oil spill, and Mount St. Helen's weren't  supposed to recover from their respective disasters for at least  100 years.  That turned out not to be true, although you'd never  know it from watching network nightly news or CNN.  It doesn't fit  their agenda to inform us that the earth is vast and resilient, and  that nature is rougher on herself than we could ever be.    But for once, the media aren't entirely to blame.  As ignorant of  science as they are of everything, they trust \\\"scientists\\\" to  unscrew the inscrutable.  The trouble is that today's \\\"scientists\\\"  have agendas of their own.    Nobody in government, that wellspring of scientific wherewithal, is  going to offer grants to an investigator who states truthfully that  there is no respectable evidence for \\\"global warming\\\".  The money  and power for bureaucrats and politicians lie in mass transit, and  they hate the automobile -- blamed as a major cause of the mythical  crisis -- as a source of privacy and freedom they find intolerable.    The same appears true of \\\"acid rain\\\", a deliberate hoax cooked up  by the Environmental Protection Agency (which hates private  industrial capitalism almost as much as it does your car) and  foisted on real scientists through trickery which has depended on  specialists in different fields not talking to each other much.    The list goes on, always with a common, disreputable thread.   \\\"Ozone depletion\\\", for which evidence is even more suspect and  contradictory than for acid rain or global warming, is no more than  a last, desperate attempt to indict private capitalism in an era  when state central planning and the command economy have failed and  can only find this final, withered leg to teeter on.    Decades of anti-nuclear alarmism, resting on foundations of myth  and panic-mongering, have failed to erase the fact that nuclear  power is the safest, cleanest, most efficient source of energy  known to mankind -- and more to the point, that the greater amount  of energy there is available to any individual in society, the  freer that individual -- and his society -- become.    Honest studies on the effects of individual gun ownership and  self-defense on crime -- conducted by investigators who began as  ideological opponents to those concepts, but which show massive  reductions in the latter to be the result of the former -- have  been suppressed, most recently by the California state government.    And what the media didn't say about recent EPA \\\"discoveries\\\" on the  effect of \\\"secondhand smoking\\\" is that, although some harm to non- smokers may have been detected, it was less (by an order or two of  magnitude) than that associated with frying bacon a couple times a  week or keeping a pet bird.  It's enough to make you wonder whether  there was ever anything to the claim that smoking causes cancer.    That, of course, is the real threat represented by politically  correct science.  The world is a dangerous place.  It would be nice  to know the hazards.  I've never believed smoking to be a healthy  practice, but, given a lack of credibility on the part of today's  science, how am I to decide what to do about it?  Nicotine is  highly addictive, to that much I can attest from experience.  Yet  the stress of quitting may be riskier than to continue.  There  isn't any way to tell, thanks to the corrupting influence of  government money on the scientific establishment.    Two centuries ago, the Founding Fathers spared us certain agonies  to which every other nation in the world has been subject at one  time or another, by creating a legal barrier between politics and  religion.  Each time some short-sighted individual or group has  tried to lower the barrier (most recently over the issue of  abortion), blood -- real human blood, hot and smoking in the street  -- has wound up being shed.    Real human blood is being shed over scientific issues, as people's  lives are ruined through the loss, to agencies like the EPA, of  livelihood, or property it may have taken a lifetime to accumulate,  to diseases caused by toxins associated with burning fossil fuels  for electrical power, or thanks to bans on things like cyclamates,  when they die from the effects of obesity.    What we need now, if we hope to survive as a civilization for two  more centuries, is another barrier, a Constitutional separation of  state and science -- including medicine.  Knowledge is valuable;  real science won't languish for lack of funding.  The money will  simply come from contributors unwilling to pay for lies, and  everyone will benefit.    L.

It was six runs in the 8th for a 12-5 win Monday and five in the 8th and six in the 9th for a 12-2 win yesterday. Jamie Navarro pitched seven strong innings, but Orosco, Austin, Manzanillo and Lloyd all took part in the mockery of a bullpen yesterday. How's this for numbers? Maldanado has pitched three scoreless innings and Navarro's ERA is 0.75. The next lowest on the staff is Wegman at 5.14. Ouch!  It doesn't look much better for the hitters. Hamilton is batting .481, while Thon is hitting .458 and has seven RBI. The next highest is three. The next best hitter is Jaha at .267 and then Vaughn, who has the team's only HR, at .238. Another ouch. Looking at the stats, it's not hard to see why the team is 2-5. In fact, 2-5 doesn't sound bad when you're averaging three runs/game and giving up 6.6/game.   Still, it's early and things will undoubtedly get better. The offense should come around, but the bullpen is a major worry. Fetters, Plesac and Austin gave the Brewers great middle relief last year. Lloyd, Maldanado, Manzanillo,  Fetters, Austin and Orosco will have to pick up the pace for the team to be successful. Milwaukee won a number of games last year when middle relief either held small leads or kept small deficits in place. The starters will be okay, the defense will be alright and the hitting will come around, but the bullpen is a big question mark.  In other news, Nilsson and Doran were reactivated yesterday, while William Suero was sent down and Tim McIntosh was picked up by Montreal. Today's game with California was cancelled.\",\"Hi there,  is there anybody who know a polygon_reduction algorithm for marching cube surfaces. e.g. the algirithm of Schroeder, Siggraph'92.

Actually, I just finished writing a motif animation program... (take-lots-of-image-data-and-display-it-pretty-darn-fast). When using on-server pixmaps or shared memory, I had to insert a delay loop to keep it from going too quickly :). Testing both methods side by side, they were just about equal.    The advantage of SHM is that your X server doesn't grow to ridiculous sizes; but pixmaps can work over a network and *are* removed if your application dies (one tends to use ipcrm manually quite a bit when debugging SHM apps).    Shared memory also has the problem that some operating systems (e.g. Ultrix) seem to allow only a small number of segments (~6) to be attached to a process at once; consequently, a redraw becomes XShmAttach();XShmPutImage();XShmDetach(); on Dec systems. And Dec's 24 bit displays (like the ones I tend to use most often) don't seem to support the extension (maybe someone compiled them wrong?), and using pixmaps causes the X server to crash (failed mallocs), so one *has* to use the local unix domain socket (which really isn't that bad; one copies the info three times per redraw instead of one).    In short: allowing all three forms of display, within the program is a Good Thing (minus SHM if running over a network), and let the user pick whatever feels fastest.    (I just use an ximagehandler class and forget about it :)\",\" Was THAT your argument.  Well, you didn't make it very well.

The \\\"whole Russian strategy\\\" is not specific to Detroit or to Devellano, who was GM before Murray.  What the previous GM also did was to trade  away several players who have gone on to do well with other teams, most notably (in my memory) Murray Craven, who had a few very good years with Philly after leaving here.  Also, it's not the volume of trades that will  necessarily improve a team, but the quality of them.  Trading Adam Oates for Bernie Federko was just plain stupid, even if Federko used to be a  great player at one time.  Most of Murray's trades have worked significantly to the Wings' advantage, with those that didn't being soured mainly by  injury to the players involved (such as Troy Crowder, who suffered back problems from which he never really recovered).

Watson) asks:  > What is the objection to celebration of Easter?          The objection naturally is in the way in which you phrase it.  Easter (or Eashtar or Ishtar or Ishtarti or other spellings) is the pagan whore goddess of fertility.  Therefore, your question to me is \\\"what is the objection to celebration of the pagan whore goddess?\\\"  When phrased that way I suspect (or at least I would HOPE) that it becomes immeadiately apparent what my objection to \\\"celebrating\\\" her would be.    > It is celebration of the resurrection of Jesus.         No, you are thinking perhaps of \\\"Ressurection Sunday\\\" I think.  (Though I'm not too crazy about the word \\\"Sunday\\\", but I certainly like this phrasing much better than envoking the name of the whore goddess.)      For that matter, stay Biblical and call it Omar Rasheet (The Feast of First Fruits).  Torah commands that this be observed on the day following the Sabbath of Passover week.  (Sunday by any other name in modern parlance.)  Why is there so much objection to observing the Resurrection on the 1st day of the week on which it actually occured?  Why jump it all over the calendar the way Easter does?  Why not just go with the Sunday following Passover the way the Bible has it?  Why seek after unbiblical methods?    > I don't recall a command in Scripture for us to celebrate  > the resurrection, but it is the sole and only reason that  > we are Christians--how could we not celebrate it?         So what does this question have to do with Easter (the whore goddess)?  I am all for celebrating the Resurrection.  Just keep that whore out of the discussion.    > If it is only the name which is a problem, I suggest that if  > we are too concerned about etymology, there are a lot of  > words we are going to have to drop.

And while we are at it, the left-handed people are both \\\"sinister\\\" and \\\"gauche\\\" so we probably will have some objections from that quarter as well.    > In Quebec French, the word for the celebration of the  > resurrection is \\\"Pa^ques\\\"--this is etymologically related  > to Pesach (Passover) and the pascal lamb.

I'd like to suggest that people think very carefully about this argument.  Words often change their meaning over time.  The days of the week are of course originally based on pagan gods.  Some Christians prefer to refer to \\\"first day\\\", \\\"second day\\\", etc.  However the majority of Christians have not been persuaded.  The question seems to be whether it makes any difference what the dictionary shows as the derivation of a word, if what people mean by it and think when they use it is different.  Indeed I'd like to suggest that postings like this could themselves be dangerous.  Suppose people in general use Easter to mean the celebration of Christ's resurrection.  Postings trying to convince them that they really mean a celebration in honor of some godess run the risk of creating exactly the situation that they claim to oppose. They are doing their best to *create* a linkage in people's minds between their celebration and the pagan goddess.  It's not clear that this is a healthy thing.\",\" Who compared Quayle to Gore?

I won't start panicking until/unless DES or RSA or stuff like that is prohibited, but I'm a little anxious.

My feeling is that the administration probably isn't that worried about things like DES and RSA and PGP and RIPEM, since they'll never be used by a group much wider than us computer geeks.  The fact that this just came out now suggests one of two things:  1.  The NSA has been working on this for a long time, and it only just     now happened to be ``ready'' to release to the world at this time.  2.  The NSA has been working on this for a long time, but wasn't able     to get the Bush administration to go along with this plan.  (I     find it unlikely that this would have been because of a sympathy     for the unescrowed use of cryptography; more likely the     administration felt that even escrowed, secret-algorithm and, for     all we know, trivially breakable cryptography should not be made     widely available.)

If it is symmetric, how is it useful for anything other than link-level encryption with an identical chip at each end?  How can you negotiate a per-session key using symmetric cryptography without using a trusted third party who knows your key?  (Or does it even use a per-session key?)  If it's asymmetric, what about PKP's patents, which they claim cover all methods of doing asymmetric cryptography?

Imake support has been improved, a few defaults have been changed, and a lot of other small things have been added.  This is basically a release which drops the 'gamma' status. Next release will incorporate some improvements by Stefan Schwarz, and possibly will support X11R5 and Motif 1.2.x.  Note to all of those who keep copies of the archive: please retrieve this distribution (during off-peak hours), and delete all previous copies.  Here is the original ANNOUNCEMENT:  HISTORY  The University of Lowell, supported by a grant of the Open Software Foundation, has developed a wrapper-library, that encapsulates Motif widgets in C++ classes. All resources of these Widgets can now be set through member-functions, while objects can be used in callback-functions. The library was made available for free or nominal cost for anonymous ftp at 129.63.1.1. However, the library contained a large number of bugs and oversights, and only worked under X11R3. Due to lack of subsequent fundings, the bindings are no longer actively supported by the University of Lowell.  I, Ronald van Loon, at a certain point last year, have taken the Lowell  bindings, fixing the bugs I came across, adding missing memberfunctions, and enhancing functionality and made the bug-fixed library available for the general public for anonymous ftp (made possible by Rick Murphy at DEC).  NEW RELEASE  I am now pleased to announce a new and updated release of the Motif++ bindings.   This release offers:  - Full Motif1.1 and X11R4 support - Support for Xbae widgetset  - Two additional widgets, written by myself, that can be used to indicate   progress in an application. - Imake support. NB: this release relies heavily on the existence of imake        and its config files on your site. I have tried to        provide the bindings with a standard Makefile, tweakable        for those unfortunates without imake. I have not severely        tested the standard Makefile though. Contact me if you        have problems. The reason for calling this a gamma        release lies in the fact that I do not have a multitude        of platforms to test the Imake-files on. - Lots of testfiles (even somewhat useful programs) - An article I wrote on the usage of Motif, X and C++, previously posted   on Usenet.  WHERE TO GET THE NEW MOTIF BINDINGS  Ftp:  Anonymous ftp at decuac.dec.com (192.5.214.1), directory /pub/X11.  Note:  Please be patient as the network link is quite slow. Please do not FTP large files during working hours.  Also note that there is also a motif++.31.jan.92.tar.Z file at this site; this is an old version of the bindings.  E-mail:  Those who don't have ftp can send me e-mail, and I will send the bindings by e-mail.  REQUEST  Those who use the bindings and find bugs, or see room for improvement, please contact me, and I will try to incorporate them in a future release (in case of bugs, a bug-fix of course ;-).

The training course will discuss the applications of satellite data concerning natural resources, renewable energy and the environment.  The training course, organised for the benefit of francophone African experts, will be hosted by ESRIN, the European Space Agency's establishment in Frascati, which is responsible for coordination with the users of data from ESA's remote sensing satellite. Twenty-four experts in the field of remote sensing, selected from 19 francophone countries from northern, western and central Africa, and three regional African centres, will attend the two-week session. The course will focus on remote sensing techniques and data applications, particularly ERS-1 data.  The ERS-1 satellite, developed by ESA and launched in 1991 with the European Ariane launcher, carries an advanced radar instrument and is the first in a series of radar remote sensing missions that will ensure availability of data beyond the year 2000. The aim of the training course is to increase the potential of experts using the practical applications of radar remote sensing systems to natural resources, renewable energy and the environment, with particular emphasis on applications to geology and mineral prospecting, oceanography and near- coastal areas, agriculture, forestry and meteorology.  The education and practical training programme was developed jointly by the United Nations and ESA. The facilities and the technical support, as well as lecturers and information documents for the training course, will be provided by the Agency. Lecturers at the training course will include high-level experts from other European and African organisations active in remote sensing applications. Funds for the training course are being provided by the United Nations    Trust Fund for New and Renewable Sources of Energy; the primary contributor to that Fund is the Government of Italy.\",\"I am a student at UW-Eau Claire.

Any suggestions?\",\"     Yes, but... the minimization of gates is important in part because of TIMING considerations.  A TTL gate has the basic structure of AND/OR/INVERT, and an inversion of a sum of a product is just exactly ONE gate delay.  The reason to find a minimal sum of products is that this matches a hardware optimization.   A positive-OR gate (such as the 9-gate solution uses) has TWO gate delays (and there's another gate delay in the second term) so that the second solution, while simpler in logic symbols, can  be expected to be something less than optimal in the real world. ECL is similar to TTL, in that it can support an OR/AND gate with the minimum delay (unlike TTL, you get both true and inverse outputs for 'free' when using ECL).   PALs are basically large programmable AND/OR/INVERT gates (with your choice of internal connections between the various sections, and perhaps some latches), so a minimum sum of products ALSO is a way to shoehorn a logic design into  a few PALs.  It's not comparably easy to design with a minimization of logic gates, but some software packages claim to allow you to do so, and will take just about any mess of gates (as a nodelist with 74xxx series logic ICs) and produce a description of a logic cell array to do the same job.  Xilinx's XACT software does this by treating each logic block as a macro, and expanding it all out, then simplifying.\",\"  window = XCreateWindow(...);  XSetTransientForHint(display, window, window);  XMapWindow(...);\",\" While others here may have had better experiences, I, too, share the sentiments posted above.

That makes them the best method of defense for the citizenry. Not everybody has the time to train with a gladius, you know, but for some reason those who prey on others seem to have more free time.  To extend this a bit further, you need only a certain level of competence to beat another with a range weapon.  Getting in their face with a weapon and winning is much more difficult, and requires more training time the average citizen just does not have.  I've spent a few years practicing with a sword.  I can take the common person armed with one (though self-defense isn't the reason I own one).  My kid sister would have an even chance of beating me, gun vs. gun, with only a month of training.

We call use of them aggrivated assault, assault with a deadly weapon, assault with intent to kill, attempted murder, and a whole host of others, and tack on extra prison time.   In Norway I suspect it was about the only weapon available.  You conquered your land (among others) a full millenia before we were thought of, and shortly thereafter weapons weren't quite so common.  I suspect that a few world wars made a difference too, since in times of emergency weapons tend to be turned in or donated to needy causes.

The time scale and the homogeneous culture are important.  Equally important is a basic philosophical difference in personal versus collective good. In America, the individual is more important than the masses.  Personal liberties are prized above all.

But here your message leaves talk of hypothesis and gets back, once again,  to equating the business of science with the end result, the gizmo produced.   My point isn't so much whether or not you have a novel paradigm but *how*  you come about developing it.   Perhaps you'd admit that this is an oversimplification on your part (the topic of the philosophy of science is made for them, I'm making them too) but I think that it also summarizes popular misconceptions of science and the  business of doing science.  Biomedical research doesn't make any basic  assumptions that aren't the same as any other discipline of scientific research.  That is, that you make empirical observations, form an hypothesis and test it.  Modern medicine has much more to do with biochemistry than  \\\"the old Newtonian model of the world\\\".  And I doubt that many psychologists would appreciate being put outside this empirical \\\"world view\\\".  Psychology also has more to do with biochemistry than spoon bending.    Oversimplified, of course, but a good example.  This is an empirical observa- tion.  It was then tested, though perhaps not by Aristotle, and eventually  found wanting.  In the meantime, some folk will  have continued to believe in the spontaneous generation of animal life.   There's nothing at all surprising about this, it's the way the gathering of knowledge works.  There are probably more than a few things in my own  discipline of molecular biology that will be found to be totally off-base, even idiotic, to someone in the future.  These future people won't have come to these relevations because they had suddenly gone all Zen-like and had  a vision in an LSD trip.  Someone will have thought of something new and  tested it.  This is the bit that people who seem to relish misrepresenting science and research can't seem to wrap their minds around.  Science is a  creative process.  What I think of as factual and good research can be totally turned on its head tommorrow by new results and theories.  \",\"...  I seriously doubt that any practical implementation of this proposal would place the onus on the individual to register keys.  Realistically, the Clipper-Chip will probably emit an ID code which will serve as the identifier when requesting the key fragments.  The chip manufacturer would register this identifier code vs. key combination when the chip is made and the (uninitiated) end-user can therefore remain completely outside the loop. The chip could be used in a cellular phone, a modem, or other device -- it really makes no difference:  When the authorities detect the use of this encryption standard during surveillance, they would then capture the ID and apply for the key in order to decrypt the data.\",\" Prestone.

So I decided to check it out, on my own.  But, then, that was in BN times (Before Net).  So, here are some  references.  See Robin Lane Fox's _The unauthorized version_, (p.284) where  Lane Fox writes, \\\"... the one passage which appears to [comment on Jesus'  career] is agreed to be a Christian addition.\\\"  In my Re:Albert Sabin response (C5u7sJ.391@sunfish.usd.edu) to Jim Lippard (21 April 93), I noted that consensus is typically indicated subtly as in Elaine  Pagel's _The gnostic gospels_ (p.85), to wit:  \\\"A comment *attributed* to Josephus reports ... [emphasis mine]\\\".  Scholars sometimes do not even mention the two Josephus entries, another subtlety reflecting consensus.  So far as I can deduce, today's consensus is built on at least three things:  1) the long passage is way out of context, 2) Origen did not know about the long passage, and 3) the short and long passages are contradictory.  I don't know the references wherein the arguments which led to consensus are orginally developed (does anyone?).  Biblical scholars as I defined them include theologians and historians.  The former, like the latter, incorporate historical, social, technological and ideological contexts as well as theology.  So the distinction is blurred.  I  didn't elaborate on that.  Sorry.  (In turn, historians are compelled to incorporate theology).  Can't say about the number of copies.  These were, however, BG times (Before  Gutenburg).  A hundred first editions seems exceedingly high; counting on one  hand seems more reasonable.  Perhaps those mss. without the long insert (if any, because anything is possible) have been destroyed.

However, the Jews believe that the Covenant between YHWH and the Patriarchs (Abraham and Moses, in this case) establishes a Moral Code to follow for mankind. Even the Jews could not decide where the boundaries fall, though.  As I understand it, the Sadducees believed that the Torah was all that was required, whereas the Pharisees (the ancestors of modern Judaism) believed that the Torah was available for interpretation to lead to an understanding of the required Morality in all its nuances (->Talmud).  The essence of all of this is that Biblical Morality is an interface between Man and YHWH (for a Jew or Christian) and does not necessarily indicate anything about YHWH outside of that relationship (although one can speculate).   The trouble with all of this is that we don't really know what the \\\"created in His image\\\" means. I've heard a number of different opinions on this and have still not come to any conclusion. This rather upsets the Apple Cart if one wants to base a Life Script on this shaky foundation (to mix metaphors unashamedly!) As to living by Christ's example, we know very little about Jesus as a person. We only have his recorded utterances in a set of narratives by his followers, and some very small references from comtemporary historians. Revelation aside, one can only \\\"know\\\" Christ second-hand or worse.  This is not an attempt to debunk Christianity (although it may seem that way initially), the point I`m trying to make is that we only really have the Bible to interpret, and that interpretation is by humanity. I guess this is where Faith or Relevation comes in with all its inherent subjectiveness.   No. There may be an absolute moral code. There are undoubtably multiple moral codes. The multiple moral codes may be founded in the absolute moral code. As an example, a parent may tell a child never to swear, and the child may assume that the parent never swears simply because the parent has told the child that it is \\\"wrong\\\". Now, the parent may swear like a trooper in the pub or bar (where there are no children). The \\\"wrongness\\\" here is if the child disobeys the parent. The parent may feel that it is \\\"inappropriate\\\" to swear in front of children but may be quite happy to swear in front of animals. The analogy does not quite hold water because the child knows that he is of the same type as the parent (and may be a parent later in life) but you get the gist of it? Incidentally, the young child considers the directive as absolute until he gets older (see Piaget) and learns a morality of his own.

To get emergency medical care, anyone so insured must always carry their Blue Cross card. Before entering a hospital, you must notify Blue Cross, or they will refuse to pay your bills.  In an emergency, where you must be treated before notifying them,  you must inform them within 24 hours or (if you are unable to do so for medical reasons) the hospital must. Failing to do so within 24 hours means they will not cover the hospitalization. In you need your card to notify them (and without the card, the hospital certainly wouldn't know they had to.)

According to Luke 3:23     And when he began his ministry, Jesus himself was about     thirty years of age, being supposedly the son of Joseph,    the son of Eli,  Aside from the fact that Mary is not mentioned, there are two possible interpretations: either Joseph was her father or he was her brother. Clearly this is not acceptable.  A third would be that Joseph, the son of Eli, was her Father and just happened to have the name as the man to whom she was betrothed. But that would seem to be grasping at straws. The most straightforward interpretation is that Luke had no intention of tracing Mary's genealogy (in which case he would have named her) but that he traces her husband's, from David's son Nathan.  The Matthew descendant list most definitely traces down from David's son, Solomon, to Joseph.  Matthew 1:16 reads:     And to Jacob was born Joseph, the husband of Mary, by whom was born    Jesus, who is called Christ.   There are two apparent problems.  The first is, how to reconcile the two paternal genealogies - which diverge with the sons of David, Solomon and Nathan.  The second is, why is any genealogy of Joseph relavent at all, if Joseph had nothing to do with it.  If Joseph was not Jesus's physical father, then the original poster is quite correct, that claims for Jesus's messianic heritage are not based on truth but only on appearances, whatever Jesus's divine nature was.  The second problem is easy, in my mind.  We assume that Joseph was not involved in the conception of Jesus in any way.  However, a Holy Spirit capable of working a physical conception in Mary is also capable of employing the physical agency of Joseph's seed in this work.  In our materialistic times we interpret viginity and its loss solely in terms of a physical act, whereas it is really a matter of purity on a much higher level as well.  The important thing is that neither Mary nor Joseph was conscious of any union between them (they had not \\\"known\\\"each other).  Thus the first gospel's dedication of half its opening chapter to the genealogy of Joseph is quite relevant to Jesus, the Virgin birth not- withstanding.  To the first question there is an answer that creates, to begin with, more problems than it resolves.  It is that the two evangelists are relating  the births of two entirely different children of two entirely different sets of parents.  Except for the names of the parents and the child, and  the birthplace in Bethlehem there is no point in common between the two  stories.  Matthew and Luke converge in their accounts only thirty years later with the Baptism of Jesus in Jordan.  Rudolf Steiner offered his explanation of how these accounts begin with two children and then converge with their accounts of the one Jesus of Nazareth.  He did not derive his resolution from biblical study or speculation, or from other external documents, and the discussion of \\\"how this could be\\\" might bring us beyond the limits of appropriateness for this newsgroup.  In any case, the details are described in Steiner's \\\"The Spiritual Guidance of the Human  Being and of Humanity\\\", \\\"The Gospel of St. Luke\\\", and \\\"The Gospel of St. Matthew\\\".   Whether or not Rudolf Steiner's methods and explanation are accepted as valid, at least this interpretation resolves the apparent contradictions of the two genealogies while leaving the text intact.  As for the passing of one's Jewishness through the mother, this was never an issue with Jesus. No one ever questioned his or Mary's Jewishness.  The issue of the genealogies has to do with his paternal line of descent from David, the king.\",\"  As usual, David Sternlight is demonstrating his inability to read. The proposal clearly states:  => The initiative will involve the creation of new products to => accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure => telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.  It speaks about telecommunications in general. Read it again, David. Maybe you'll understand it the next time... Nah, probably not.   That's exactly what the government wants all sheep-minded people to think. Let's look at the current situation. It allows to almost anybody to eavesdrop almost everybody, unless secure (and I mean secure) encryption is used. What will happen when (\\\"if\\\"? Ha! optimists...) the new proposal gets accepted? Almost nobody EXCEPT SOME will be able to eavesdrop everybody else, but the ability of these \\\"some\\\" to eavesdrop will be guaranteed! The proposal emphasizes on the former (\\\"almost nobody\\\") - which is clearly an improvement - and \\\"forgets\\\" to mention the drawbacks of the latter (\\\"guaranteed\\\"). Yes, my statement assumes that the next step will be to make the strong crypto unlawful. You think that it will not happen? Good luck.   It's not just \\\"continued ability\\\". It's -guaranteed- ability.   Yeah, that's exactly what your government wants you to think. Let's take small steps, one at a time. Concentrate on the current one, don't think about the future. Trust us.   It's not asked because the proposal clearly says that this is the intention. They, unlike you, read what they write.   Yes, it will. It will stop the jerk who is eavesdropping now. It will allow only to the government to eavesdrop. (If the scheme is secure, of course, which is yet to be proven.) But how do you know that the jerk you are fearing now will not get a government job tomorrow? The new proposal -guarantees- him the ability to eavesdrop then. Hell, that will even motivate him to get that job - if he indeed is that mentally pervert...   Great. The Greatest Cryptographer of All Times David Sternlight (tm) has succeeded to evaluate the new system in the absense of any details whatsoever and has concluded that it is \\\"highly secure\\\". I guess, that comes from the background of working some 50 years for the two major crypto evaluating companies, right? Gee, now the government can save all that money and trouble to ask a secret council of crypto experts to secretly analyse the new secret method - for David Sternlight has already done all the job for them...   \\\"Trust us, we're from the Government and we're here to help you.\\\"   \\\"Those who are prepared to trade their liberties for the promises of future safety, do not deserve either.\\\" This (or something like that; I don't have the exact quote, but the meaning is the same) has been said by one of your great men. Maybe you should study their works more carefully, if you have the brains to understand them, of course.   The main question is to guarantee to availability of -really- secure cryptography to the masses. Gee, if the proposal was saying \\\"we guarantee that every American will still have the full right to use any kind of encryption s/he would like and regard this proposal as just a default, voluntary implementation\\\", there would have been much less opposition... For some reason, they didn't even try to promise you that. I wonder why... Was Orwell off only by 10 years?   No, in return you get crypto that is guaranteed to be crippled.   While the above is just rumors, and while even if it is true, it is not done -easily-, the new scheme can is guaranteed to be easily breakable by anybody who has the two keys. It might be also breakable by somebody who does not have them but knows the right trick. Or who has only one of them. NSA also told you that DES is secure, why don't you simply trust them, huh?   It is -guaranteed- to be -easily- breakable - just get the keys. It might be even easier, but until there is some evidence, this is just a wild speculation.   The trapdoors -are- there.

Further striking bigoted and racist attitude of  certain Greeks still exists in our day. Most Greeks insist even  today, that the 537 year-old capital of the Ottoman Empire should  be called not by its rightful name of Istanbul, but by its half  a millennium-old moniker 'Cons*(whatever).'  Everyone knows that New York City was once called 'New Amsterdam' but Dutch people do not persist on calling it that today. The name  of Stalingrad too is long gone, replaced by Volgagrad. China's Peking traded its name for Beiging long ago. Ciudad Trujillo of the Dominican Republic is now Santa Domingo. Zimbabve's old colonial capital Salisburry became Harrare. These changes have all been accepted officially by everyone in the world.  But, Greeks are still determined on calling the Turkish Istanbul  by the name of 'Cons*.'  How can one explain this total intransigence? What makes Greeks so different from other mortals? 18-year-old questionable democracy? Why don't they seem to reconcile with the fact, for instance, that Istanbul changed hands 537 years ago in 1453 AD, and that this predates the discovery of the New  World, by 39 years. The declaration of U.S. independence in 1776 will come 284 years later.  Shouldn't then, half a millennium be considered enough time for  'Cons*' to be called a Turkish city? Where is the logic in the  Greek reasoning, if there is any? How long can one sit on the  laurels of an ancient civilization? Ancient Greece does not exist,  any more than any other 16 civilizations that existed on the soil  of Anatolia.  These undereducated 'wieneramus' live with an illusion. It  is the same mentality which allows them to rationalize that Cyprus is a Greek Island. No history book shows that it ever was. It belonged to the Ottoman Turks 'lock, stock and barrel' for a period of well over 300 years.  In fact, prior to the Turks' acquisition of it, following bloody naval battles with the Venetians in 1570 AD, the island of Cyprus belonged, invariably, to several nations:  The Assyrians, the Sumerians, the Phoenicians, the Egyptians, the Ottoman Turks, of course in that order, owned it as  their territory. But, it has never been the possession of the government of Greece - not even for one day - in the history of the world. Moreover, Cyprus is located 1500 miles from the Greek mainland, but only  40 miles from Turkiye's southern coastline.  Saddam Hussein claims that Kuwait was once Iraqi territory and the Greek Cypriot government and  the terrorist Greek governments think that Cyprus also was once part of the Greek hegemony.  Those 'Arromdians' involved in this grandiose hallucination should wake up from their sweet daydreams and confront  reality. Again, wishful thinking is unproductive, only  facts count.  As for Selanik,    <<Those Jews who survived these assaults in Southeastern Europe fled   particularly to Salonica, whose Jewish population increased substantially   as a result, from 28,000 in 1876 to 90,000 in 1908, more than half the   total population, though even there increased persecution by local Greeks   led many Jews to flee elsewhere in the Ottoman Empire, particularly to   the great port of Izmir.    Despite all the pressure from Ottomans and foreign Jews alike, the ritual   murders and other assaults by Christians on Jews went on and on. Greek   efforts to decimate the Jewish population of Salonica culminated in 1912   and 1913, following Greek conquest of Salonica during the first Balkan War,   when many of its Jews, were either killed or terrorized into leaving...>>    <<Though Greece was obligated by the post World War I treaties to allow   Jews and other minorities to use their own languages in education and to   practice their religions without hindrance, a law was issued in 1923   which forbad all inhabitants from working on Sunday, stimulating a new   Jewish exodus as it was intended to do. Between 1932 and 1934 there was a   series of anti-Semitic riots in Salonica, with the Cambel quarter, where   most of the remaining Jews lived, being burned to the ground. This   was followed by regulations requiring the use of Greek and prohibiting   Hebrew and Judea-Spanish in the Jewish schools. A start was made also   on expropriating the land of the principal Jewish cemetery in Salonica   for use by the new University in order to derive the Jews out [47]. By   killing and driving out large numbers of Jews, the Greeks left a   substantial Greek majority in the city for the first time, and starting   Salonica Jewry on the way to its final decimation by the Nazis during the   occupation of Greece starting in 1941.    Salonica and Izmir of course were not the only places of refuge for   Jewish refugees entering the Empire during its last century of existence.   Istanbul, Edirne, and other parts of Rumelia and Anatolia received   thousands more. Nor were Jews the only refugees received and helped by   the government of the Sultan. Thousands of Muslims accompanied them in   flight from similar persecutions wherever Balkan christian states gained   independence or expanded. The Russian conquest of the Crimea and the   Caucasus starting in the late eighteenth century, and particularly during   and after the Crimean War, combined with the same independence movements   in Southeastern Europe that had caused so much suffering and flight among   its Jews caused thousands of helpless, ill, and poverty-stricken Muslim   refugees to accompany them into the ever shrinking boundaries of the   Ottoman Empire, with the Istanbul government struggling mightly but vainly   to house and feed them as best it could. From 1850 to 1864 as many as   800,000 Crimean Tatars, Circassians, and other Muslims from north and   east of the Black Sea had entered Anatolia alone, as many as 200,000 more   came during the next twenty years, while 474,389 refugees entered in 1876-   1877 as a result of the Ottoman wars with Russia and the Balkan states,   with an equal number gaining refuge in the European portions of the   Empire.>>  [47] Robert Mantran, 'La structure sociale de la communaute juive de   Salonqiue a la fin du dix-neuvieme siecle', RH no.534 (1980), 391-92;   Nehama VII, 762; Joseph Nehama (Salonica) to AIU (Paris) no.2868/2,   12 May 1903 (AIU Archives I-C-43); and no.2775, 10 January 1900 (AIU   Archives I-C-41), describing daily battles between Jewish and Greek   children in the streets of Salonica.

The heat source is a 100 watt light bulb.  Basically, it's a vertical wooden box with ventilation holes in the top and bottom (lots of them, you want the air to flow).  The light bulb goes in the bottom, and wire cake racks are spaced every 6\\\" starting about 10\\\" above the bulb.  Or, at a slightly higher cost in electricity, you can do what I do:  Use your oven.  (NOTE - I do this in an electric oven; some gas ovens may not have a low enough setting).  Put food to be dried on cookie tins or racks in the oven.  Set oven to 140 degrees (the lowest setting on my oven - if yours goes down to 120 that's probably even better.)  Stick a wooden spoon or something across the front corner of the oven and close the door on the spoon so that it stays open about an inch - this allows for airflow.  Leave the stuff in the oven for 6 to 8 hours; check it often, since this dries it much faster than the dehydrator.

INCREDIBLY CHOPPED UP POST I won't even try to tell you where the deletions came out    I find that I am dissatisfied with the little purposes that we can manufacture for ourselves.  Little in the cosmic sense.  Even the greatest of the great pharos are long gone, the pyramids historical oddities being worn down by the wind, eventually to be turned into dust. Mankind itself will one day perish.  Without some interconnectedness that transcends the physical, without God, it is all pointless in the end.  Most people are able to live with that, and for them little purposes (success, money, power, effecting change, helping others) suffice.  I suppose they never  think about the cosmic scale, or are at least able to put it out of their minds.  To me, it is comforting to know that reality is an illusion.  That the true reality underneath the the physical is spirit.  That this world is a school of sorts, where we learn and grow, and our souls mature.  That gives a purpose to my little purposes, and takes some of the pressure off.  It's not so necessary to make this life a success in human terms if you're really just here to learn.  It's more important to progress, grow, persist, to learn to love yourself and others and to express your love, especially when it's dificult to do so.

Brendan Shanahan tied the game 3-3 and Brett Hull scored the game winner 17 seconds later. Jeff Brown and Denny Felsner scored the other Blues goals. Brian Noonan had the hat trick for the Hawks, who also had some very good goaltending from Ed Belfour. Blues goalie Curtis Joseph was solid down the stretch to preserve the Blues lead.  The Hawks came out strong in the first period, outshooting the Blues 6-1 and taking a 1-0 lead on Noonan's first goal. Right after an interference penalty on Rick Zombo had expired, Keith Brown intercepted a clearing attempt at the blue line and passed the puck to Steve Larmer in the right circle. Larmer fired a long slap shot, and Noonan deflected the puck between Joseph's pads. After the goal, the Blues picked up the intensity and went on to outshoot the Hawks 10-9 in the first period.  Jeff Brown tied the game 1-1 at 3:12 of the second. Nelson Emerson broke in on the left side, got by Craig Muni and pushed the puck across the slot. Belfour came out to play the pass and shoveled it to the right boards, where Brown collected it and slapped it in before Belfour could get back to the goal.  Two minutes later on a Hawks power play, Belfour stopped Rich Sutter on a short-handed break-in. Chris Chelios picked up the puck and passed it to Jeremy Roenick who carried it on right wing and found an open Noonan with a nice pass across the slot. Noonan fired it past Joseph at 5:30 for the 2-1 lead.  Noonan completed his hat trick 3:11 later to increase the Hawks' lead to 3-1. Stephane Matteau made a nice pass from the right boards to Noonan who beat Stephane Quintal by driving to the net. Joseph had no chance as Noonan deflected the puck in the net.  Denny Felsner reduced the Blues deficit to 3-1 at 12:49 after picking up the rebound of Basil McRae's slap shot from the slot. Janney set up McRae for the shot, and the puck sailed wide of the net and bounced off the end boards to Felsner. Felsner sticked the rebound into the partially open net. The Blues outshot the Hawks 10-5 in the second period.  With the Blackhawks leading 3-2 at 9:56 of the third, Stephane Matteau picked up a high sticking penalty. Just 53 seconds into the power play, Steve Smith was called for slashing, giving the Blues a 5-on-3 advantage for 1:07.  The Blues didn't waste time as Brendan Shanahan scored just 23 seconds into the two-man advantage to tie the game 3-3. Janney found Hull in the slot, and Hull fired a rocket at Belfour. Jeff Brown collected the rebound and passed it to Shanahan in the left circle. Shanahan beat Belfour from a sharp angle.  Just 17 seconds later, Hull scored the game winner for the Blues. Nelson Emerson broke in on right wing, carried the puck behind the net along with two Hawks defensemen. Emerson made a nice pass to an unchecked Hull in the slot, and Hull beat Belfour to put the Blues up 4-3.  The Hawks had several chances to tie the game in the final minutes, but Joseph made some brilliant saves to prevent the Hawks from scoring. He stopped Troy Murray point blank from just right of the crease with 2:30 left in the game. The Blues killed off a late Hawks power play, with Rich Sutter clearing the puck with his hand as it was trickling along the goal line. The Blues held on to win the game. The Hawks oushot the Blues 13-7 in the third period, totaling 27 shots on goal for each team. The Blues special teams were excellent in the game. The Blues killed 6 of 7 Hawks power plays, and scored twice on on four power play chances. The Blues ranked among the best special teams in the league. They rank 2nd in penalty killing and 3rd on the power play.

Trouble with blind transfers usually means the programmer screwed up the TIBs or didn't test their driver with the device in question. Well designed TIBs poll or loop at every point where delays of >16\\u00b5sec occur. This usually occurs at the first byte of each block of a transfer but some devices can \\\"hiccup\\\" in the middle of blocks.  If this happens in the middle of a blind transfer there is the possibility of losing or gaining a byte depending on which direction the tranfer was going.  In anycase the SCSI Manager will eventually return a phase error at the end of the transaction because it is out of sync.  Actual data loss would only occur if the driver didn't pay attention to the errors coming back.  Note that this effect is not caused by anything actually on the SCSI Bus but rather by the transfer loops inside the SCSI Manager.  The problem occurs when the processor bus errors trying to access the SCSI chip when the next byte hasn't been clocked yet.  Also note that the Bus Error is dealt with by a bus error handler and doesn't crash the machine...\",\"If you can find a copy of \\\"8088 Assembler Language Programming: The IBM PC\\\" by Willen and Krantz, 2nd ed. pub. by Sams, there is a discussion of the game control adapter, monostable multivibrators, and conversion to other uses, as well as an assembler program.

I would beg to differ with you here.  The properly-formed conscience can be trusted virtually ALL the time.  I am not so sure, though, about something so materialistic as the human brain.  Does that mass of tissue possess anything trustworthy?  Your observation would probably be valid if we were discussing the \\\"mind\\\" of an animal, but the human being is only half animal, as it were; and half spiritual.   ?At the moment he stops speaking, and people start interpreting, the ?possibility of error appears.  Did he mean that literally or not?  We do ?not have any record that he elaborated on the words.  Was he thinking of ?Tran- or Con- substatiation?   He didn't say.  We interpret this passage ?using our brains; we think and reason and draw conclusions.  But we know ?that our brains are not perfect: our thinking often leads us wrong.  (This ?is something that most of us have direct experience of.  8-)  Now you have hit on the purpose of the Church.  It is by necessity the infallible interpreter of divine revelation.  Without the Church,           Christianity would be nothing more than a bunch of little divisive sects.   ?Unless you are infallible, there are very few things you can be certain ?of.  To the extent that doctrines rely on fallible human thinking, they ?cannot be certain.  This argument of yours regarding the certainty of an observation or a conclusion is not necessarily substantiated by experience.  It reminds me of the theoretical physicist who said that you can never be certain of a measurment because the sensor interferes with the field you are trying to measure.  Now, the experimental physicist will reply that although the measurement can never be made with absolute certainty, he is able to determine the certainty with which the measurement can be made, and this knowledge is often sufficient to render the measurement useful enough to allow evidence of the true condition of the field under observation. Therefore, although our minds are finite and susceptible to error, our competence in arriving at inductive insights gives confidence in our ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true, even in areas not subject to the experimental method.   ?Darren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu ?\\\"If any substantial number of  [ talk.religion.misc ]  readers read some ?

The initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.  For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.  Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.  A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" has been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new, relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today.  This new technology will help companies protect proprietary information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals.   A \\\"key-escrow\\\" system will be established to ensure that the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique                                   2   \\\"keys,\\\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately in two \\\"key-escrow\\\" data bases that will be established by the Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap.  The \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans.  To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings.  The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield criminals and terrorists.  We need the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" and other approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system), the President has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:       --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to           employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;       --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone           calls and data, under proper court or other legal           order, when necessary to protect our citizens;       --   the effective and timely use of the most modern           technology to build the National Information           Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and           the competitiveness of American industry in the global           marketplace; and        --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export           high technology products.  The President has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.                                    3  The Administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a National Information Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks (\\\"information superhighways\\\") will transmit video, images, HDTV programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone system transmits voice.  Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law.  Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet.  The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available.

A:   No.  \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with      no new authorities to access the content of the private      conversations of Americans.  Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on      a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation      encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to      decipher the message?  A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a      court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They      would then present documentation of this authorization to      the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and      obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug      smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are      stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key      escrow system.  Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?  A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent      entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the      Administration have yet to determine which agencies will      oversee the key-escrow data banks.  Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure      how strong the security is?    A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption      systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will      remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow      system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of      cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all      potential users that there are no unrecognized      vulnerabilities.  Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?  A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the      Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in      this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the      President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet      officials.  Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?  A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on      encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify      as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have      briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the      decisions related to this initiative.  Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?  A:   The government designed and developed the key access      encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the      microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product      manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip      manufacturer that produces them.  Q:   Who provides the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\"?  A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,      California, and will sell the chip to encryption device      manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed      to other vendors in the future.  Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices?   A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating      the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" into their devices.       Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological      solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be      willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more      powerful encryption devices?  A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be      considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow      mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product      that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive      than others readily available today, but it is just one      piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to      encryption technology, which the Administration is      developing.       The Administration is not saying, \\\"since encryption      threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,      we will prohibit it outright\\\" (as some countries have      effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \\\"every      American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an      unbreakable commercial encryption product.\\\"  There is a      false \\\"tension\\\" created in the assessment that this issue is      an \\\"either-or\\\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,      and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,      balanced approach such as is proposed with the \\\"Clipper      Chip\\\" and similar encryption techniques.  Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton      Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from      that of the Bush Administration?    A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption      technology in telecommunications and computing and are      committed to working with industry and public-interest      groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'      privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law      enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime      and terrorism.  Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use      the government hardware?\",\"For sale --------  STR-AV1070 Audio Receiver ------------------------- 120 Watts per channel Dolby Surround sound with Pro Logic Learning Programmable remote 10 Watts per channel for surround sound Supports Dual Room Link Control (to hear another source in a different room) Index filing of all radio stations 7 band equilizer with real-time analyzer  I need to get $450 for this unit or best offer.

I've tried several and none work for the hicolor modes.\",\"    Each chip includes the following components:        the Skipjack encryption algorithm       F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips       N, a 30-bit serial number       U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip  Hmmm. A thirty bit serial number. And, we are told, the unit key U is derived deterministically from this serial number. That means that there are only one billion possible unit keys.     To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is    first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.    S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a    64-bit block R1:      R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .     Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and    N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:        R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1]      R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .     R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The    first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The    rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2    are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow    agencies.  Hmmm. We must assume that generating the unit key U from the serial number N rather than generating it from a randomly selected U1 and U2 is an intentional way of assuring a \\\"fail safe\\\" for the government -- U is completedly determined given S1, S2 and N. If S1 and S2 do not change they constitute effective \\\"master keys\\\" (along with F), the theft of which (or the possession of which by various authorities) completely obviates the security of the system. However, more interestingly, we know, for a fact that if S1 and S2 are fixed no matter what the keyspace for U is no more than 2^30. Why not pick U1 and U2 at random? Why this interesting restriction of they key space if it NOT to provide an additional back door?  I find it disturbing that at the very best my security is dependant on approximately 30 bytes worth of information that could be written on the back of a napkin.  Even if S1 and S2 change periodically, the rationale behind this restriction in the size of the keyspace seems strange if one is assuming that the goal is security -- and makes perfect sense if the goal is an illusion of security.  If S1 and S2 do not change, even if they remain secret I wonder if they can somehow be back-derived given enough unit key/serial number pairs. We are assured that this cannot happen -- but no one understands how Skipjack works outside of government officials and, soon, foreign intelligence services that gain the information via espionage. Presumably we will eventually have the information as well -- reverse engineering gets more and more advanced every year -- but by the time we know it may be too late.     As a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are    written onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a    file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part    U1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third    disk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent    2 takes the second disk.  The third disk is used to program the chips.    After the chips are programmed, all information is discarded from the    vault and the agents leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional    assurance that no information is left behind.  None of this makes me feel the least bit secure. The silly notion of \\\"destroying the laptop\\\" appears to be yet another bizarre distraction. We all know that you can't read data from DRAM that has been turned off for more than a few moments. On the other hand, what we don't know is why there is a need to generate the unit keys from S1 and S2 in the first place other than to weaken the system. We don't know if the agents in question would resist a million in cash a piece for their information -- its probably worth hundreds of million, so you can make the bribe arbitrarily hard to resist. And to tell you the truth, doing this in a \\\"vault\\\" rather than in Joe Random Tempest-shielded Room with a laptop computer seems like melodrama designed to make high-school dropouts from Peoria impressed -- but it does very little for most of the rest of us.     The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the    room instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2,    and the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to    the escrow agencies.  What would this provide? Lets say the escrow agencies are the ACLU and the NRA and their agents personally take back the disks and are always honest. Who cares? The NSA must be laughing out loud, because they have the algorithm to regenerate U given N and likely don't need to steal they keys as they effectively already have them.  -- Perry Metzger  pmetzger@shearson.com\",\"Hi there,  We are running a 120 node Token ring with Windows 3.1 and Novell 3.11.

The problem is, in a nutshell, this: the Liturgy is a symbolic action - in other words Catholics do [or should] believe that the _signs_ during the mass - Water, Blessings, Vestments, Altar, Relics, etc - are real. That is the sprinkling of water bestows real, almost tangible, holiness, the Vestments are a real indication of real sacred time. The point of a _symbol_ is that it is understood by all to be connected to an underlying REAL referent. This kind of thinking precludes analysis; holy water is not holy because of anything, it simply IS holy.  But, modern westerners find it extremely difficult, especially if well- educated, to think of the mass as a symbol. We are more likely to see it as a _sign_, ie an action that represents grace, but which could be replaced with other signs. In concrete terms, this means the mass has become a commercial for God's grace rather than the real thing. You can mess around with a commercial in a way you wouldn't dare with the real thing [ask Coca-Cola Co.!]. These attitudes have been encouraged by Liturgy workshops, etc. which instead of focusing on _how_ to do do liturgy, have focused on how to create a meaning in liturgy. You can only create signs, symbols have to come from God [or the heart, or somewhere deeper than analysis. The most dramatic example of this shift in understanding has been in the treatment of the sacred species [the consecrated host and wine]. Now, with pita bread etc, it is common to come away from the altar with hands covered in particles. If the Host is a sign of Grace, this isnt and issue; but Catholics in the past would have been distraught at this real desacration of the real symbol of Jesus' body.  Modern Catholic liturgy  is caught in this epistemological shift. We try to perfrom the old rites, but then we have some liturgomaniac priest get up and 'explain' what we are doing - so we stop doing it and start pretending to do it. This is not a soul filling experience. It doesn't help BTW that we have got stuck witha huge amount of two and three chord ersatz-folk music [again a result of mis-analysis: complicated tunes are in fact easier to remember than simple ones - this was the genius of Wesley and the 19C Anglican hymn writers]. Taize' is only slightly better.  What are we to do? Well I suggest rejecting the parish system if it doesn't work for you. Search out a Church where the liturgy is well prepared not well-explained. They exist in every city. This is not BTW a matter of particular style: the music might be old or new. It is the attitude of the church that counts. Also, note that a conservative liturgy - harking back to pre-Vatican II days, does not necessarily mean the Church will be socially conservative.  In NYC I can recommend:  Corpus Christi - W 12st St.  Corpus Christi - W 12st St. - very conservative liturgy,   St. Joseph's, Greenwich Village.  - Modern, \\\"clean\\\", largely gay  Oratorian Church, Brooklyn - Very beautiful  Avoid, anywhere, anytime a church with electric candles.

The scenario you outline is reasonably  consistent, but all the evidence that I am familiar with not only does not support it, but indicates something far different. The Earth, by latest estimates, is about 4.6 billion years old, and has had life for about 3.5 billion of those years. Humans have only been around for (at most) about 200,000 years. But, the fossil evidence inidcates that life has been changing and evolving, and, in fact, disease-ridden, long before there were people. (Yes, there are fossils that show signs of disease... mostly bone disorders, of course, but there are some.) Heck, not just fossil evidence, but what we've been able to glean from genetic study shows that disease has been around for a long, long time. If human sin was what brought about disease (at least, indirectly, though necessarily) then how could it exist before humans?  [deletions]   Uh... I know of many evolutionary biologists, who know more about biology than you claim to, who will strongly disagree with this. There is no evidence that the human genetic code (or any other) 'started off' in perfect condition. It seems to adapt to its envionment, in a collective sense. I'm really curious as to what you mean by 'the degeneration of the genetic code'.    Umm. Nah, we seem to do a pretty good job of adapting to viruses and bacteria, and they to us. Only a very small percentage of microlife is harmful to humans... and that small percentage seems to be reasonalby constant in size, but the ranks keep changing. For example, bubonic plague used to be a really nasty disease, I'm sure you'll agree. But it still pops up from time to time, even today... and doesn't do as much damage. Part of that is because of better sanitation, but even when people get the disease, the symptoms tend to be less severe than in the past. This seems to be partly because people who were very susceptible died off long ago, and because the really nasty variants 'overgrazed', (forgive the poor terminology, I'm an engineer, not a doctor! :-> ) and died off for lack of nearby hosts.  I could be wrong on this, but from what I gather acne is only a few hundred years old, and used to be nastier, though no killer. It seems to be getting less nasty w/age...    Now, wait a minute. I have a question. Humans were created perfect, right? And, you admit that we have an inbuilt abiliy to fight off disease. It seems unlikely that Satan, who's making the diseases, would also gift humans with the means to fight them off. Simpler to make the diseases less lethal, if he wants survivors. As far as I can see, our immune systems, imperfect though they may (presently?) be, must have been built into us by God. I want to be clear on this: are you saying that God was planning ahead for the time when Satan would be in charge by building an immune system that was not, at the time of design, necessary? That is, God made our immune systems ahead of time, knowing that Adam and Eve would sin and their descendents would need to fight off diseases?    Here's another puzzle. What, exactly, do you mean by 'perfect' in the phrase, 'created... perfect and without flaw'? To my mind, a 'perfect' system would be incapable of degrading over time. A 'perfect' system that will, without constant intervention, become imperfect is *not* a perfect system. At least, IMHO.  Or is it that God did something like writing a masterpiece novel on a bunch of gum wrappers held together with Elmer's glue? That is, the original genetic 'instructions' were perfect, but were 'written' in inferior materials that had to be carefully tended or would fall apart?

The particular need in this case is for three machines, each in a different office of the same building, each having access to a Windows-based accounting system.  My first thought is to set up MS Windows for Workgroups on each of the machines (likely a 486 and two 386's) along with the appropriate Ethernet cards and cabling that come with the Windows for Workgroups starter kit (one additional user kit will be necessary).  It then seems logical to purchase a simple multi-user accounting system, along the lines of DacEasy or M.Y.O.B., and fire it all up!  The 486 will more or less act as server with a report/check printer attached to it. Cable runs of 30-40 feet will be necessary for this setup.  Well, this all seems too easy to me.

FACT SHEET        PUBLIC ENCRYPTION MANAGEMENT  The first thing it doesn't say is \\\"We're giving you stronger encryption\\\". what it says is     the U. S. Government has developed a microcircuit that not only    provides privacy through encryption that is substantially more robust    than the current government standard, but also permits escrowing of    the keys needed to unlock the encryption.  The system for the    escrowing of keys will allow the government to gain access to    encrypted information only with appropriate legal authorization. But DES is strong enough that only the government can break it now, so the major effect is to make it EASIER for government to break! *At best* it makes it more difficult for the NSA to break, since they need to get one of the two escrowed keys to do a brute-force search for the other 40-bit key.  Similarly, it didn't say \\\"We're making encryption is commercially available.\\\" because encryption *is* already commercially available, including forms the NSA may not be able to break, like triple-DES or IDEA. And phone companies could offer DES-based systems *now* if they were convinced the government would let them and they could make enough money.  The next thing it didn't say is \\\"We're making encryption legal\\\", because of course encryption *has always been* legal, and the President can't change the First Amendment merely by decree. What it *did* say was:  In making this decision, I do not intend to prevent the  private sector from developing, or the government from approving,  other microcircuits or algorithms that are equally effective in  assuring both privacy and a secure key- escrow system. which clearly means \\\"We're making encryption illegal unless we get your keys. Soon.  Once business buys into this.\\\"  Another thing it didn't say is \\\"We're going to ask Congress for money to do *lots* more wiretapping\\\", because of course, there's a budget crisis, and Congress might debate the policy issues or not give them the cash. What it *did* say was:    The Attorney General will procure and utilize encryption devices to    the extent needed to preserve the government's ability to conduct    lawful electronic surveillance and to fulfill the need for secure    law enforcement communications.  Further, the Attorney General    shall utilize funds from the Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture    Super Surplus Fund to effect this purchase. which means \\\"We've got money Congress can't control and we're going to buy lots of wiretapping equipment with it to detect NON-APPROVED CRYPTO (that's what \\\"preserve the government's ability to conduct ... surveillance\\\"  means.)  \",\"  No, Brent that would be alt.sex.bondage.holly.silva.goofy.anti.semite.... :) \",\"Does anyone out there have any info on the up and coming fall comdex '93?

The New Testament does not quote Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, Ruth, Job, Ecclesiastes, or Song of Songs, just as it does not quote from the Deuterocanon.  But if the non-quotation of the former does not disqualify them, neither does the non-quotation of the later.  And the Wisodm of Solomon was quite clearly an influence on St. Paul, especially in the letter to the Romans (cf especially Romans 1.18-32 and Wisdom 13-14).  [stuff deleted]    True.  Not all accepted them as Scripture, though niether were all the books of the New Testament so accepted, which puts to the lie the whole argument of the books being excluded because they were debated and not universally accepted.  Hebrews, the Apocalypse, 2 Peter, Esther, and others were debated at various times, but eventually retained.  As for the Codexes you mention, both Vaticanus and Sinaitcus include the Deuterocanon, bothe of the New and Old Testaments, and Vaticanus (I think) inlcudes 1 Clement, the Shepard of Hermas, and the Epistle of Baranabas.  As for the Muratorian Canon, it deals with the New Testament only, though it is very valuable in its witness to those books.     You're not wrong!  It is a `tradition of men' to exlcude them, as I will explain below.  \\\"That nothing be read in the Church under the nmae of Divine Scripture, except the canonical Scriptures, and the canoncial Scriptures are - Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, Four books of Kingdoms [being 1&2 Samuel and 1&2 Kings], Two books of Paralpomenon [being 1&2 Chronicles], Job, the Psalter of David, the Five books of Solomon [being Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, Wisdom of Solomon, and [misatributed to him] the Wisdom of Jesus son of Sirach], The books of the Twelve (Minor) Prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah [being Jeremiah, the Lamentations, Baruch, and the Letter, all of which were formerly counted as one], Ezekiel, Daniel, Tobit, Judith, Esther, Two books of Ezra [being Ezra and Nehemiah], Two books of Maccabees.

(Though the Episcopalians hold them in high regard and read them in the Church, they are not counted as Scripture by them, and may not be used to prove dogma.  The Lutherans hold out similarly.)  Earlier mention of the so-called Apocrypha as divine scripture can also be found, and below I inlcude only a portion of the quotes calling it divine scripture that could be found among the writings of the Fathers.  \\\"And this is the reason why the Law of the old Testament is reckoned as consisting of twenty-two books: so that they may correspond to the number of letters [in the Hebrew alphabet]....

ATHENS, Greece - An array of representatives of Greek political parties, including the ruling PASOK party, and a host of political groups, both Armenian and non-Armenian, joined to voice their solidarity with the  Armenian people in their pursuit of their cause and activities of a new Armenian political force were voiced here on Sunday, April 20 during the 2nd International Meeting of Solidarity with the Armenian People. And judging from encouraging messages offered by the representatives of these political groups and organizations, at least here in Greece, the Armenian Cause enjoys abundant support from a wide spectrum of the political world.  The International Meeting of Solidarity was sponsored by the Greek branch of the Armenian Popular Movement, a comparatively new political force headed by younger generations of Armenians, who openly profess their support of the armed struggle and of the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA). The organization has branches in various European and Middle Eastern countries and the United States although some of these branches appear to have gone through a switch of loyalties because of the split within the ranks of ASALA...  Voicing the support of PASOK, the ruling party in Greece, to the Armenian people, was Mr. Charalambidi Michalis, a member of the Central Committee of the party and the Greek member of the Permanent People's Tribunal... Explaining the goals and aspirations of the Armenian Popular Movement  was Ara Sarkisian. Significant was the address delivered by Mr. Bassam  Abu-Salim, on behalf of the Popular Front for the movement's continued  support of the Armenians' armed struggle in their pursuit of their cause,  pledging that Palestinian operated and run training camps would always be  open to Armenian youth who need training for such a struggle. Later, Mr.  Abu-Salim, answering a question put to him by this writer, affirmed that  his organization had always trained Armenian members of ASALA and that this policy will continue. \\\"The doors of our camps are always open to  Armenian freedom fighters,\\\" he affirmed.  Among the prominent Greek politicians who attended the conference was the son of Prime Minister Papandreou, who himself holds a post in the Greek cabinet; two members of the Cypriot Parliament who had journeyed to Athens for the specific purpose of attending the international gathering; representatives of the Christian Democratic party, EDIK Center party, two wings of the Communist party, representatives of an assortment of labor unions and trade associations, a number of mayors of Greek towns and cities; two Greek members of the European Parliament and other members of the Greek Parliament were also among those who participated in the international conference. Also on hand to follow the deliberations was the ambassador of Bulgaria in Athens.  More than significant was the large number of messages received by the  organizers, including the following: Palestinian National Revolutionary Movement, Fatah; Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command; the Central Committee of the Palestinian National Liberation Movement-Fatah; the Socialist Progressive Party of Lebanon; Arab Socialist Labor Party; the Kurdistan Democratic Union of Iraq; and numerous other international groups, all noted for their radical stand in the Israeli- Palestinian conflict.                   SUPPORT FROM ARF-RM  Among messages received from Armenian groups was the Armenian Revolutionary Federation-Revolutionary Movement, the group that has claimed the abduction and assassination of key party leaders in Lebanon accused of selling out to foreign interests and powers. The message clearly gave its support to the Armenian Popular Movement pledging that the Revolutionary movement will continue to \\\"reveal the realities, no matter how bitter or tragic they are,\\\" to expose the anti-Armenian activities of the leaders of the Dashnag \\\"Bureau.\\\" The message was taken as an indication of the link, loose as it may be, that exists between the dissident Dashnag group and the Armenian Popular Movement, open supporters of ASALA and armed struggle.  The Armenian Popular Movement has set up its headquarters in a suburb of the Greek capital, known as Neos Kosmos, where there is a large Armenian presence. The headquarters are located in a two-story building, which appears to have turned into a beehive of activity on the part of scores of Armenian youth, who prefer to give their first names only when invited to introduce themselves...

IS THIS ONE THE \\\"SPINOFFS\\\" WE WERE PROMISED? In 1950, science fiction writer Robert Heinlein published \\\"The Man Who Sold the Moon,\\\" which involved a dispute over the sale of rights to the Moon for use as billboard. NASA has taken the firsteps toward this  hideous vision of the future.  Observers were startled this spring when a NASA launch vehicle arrived at the pad with \\\"SCHWARZENEGGER\\\" painted in huge block letters on the side of the booster rockets.  Space Marketing Inc. had arranged for the ad to promote Arnold's latest movie. Now, Space Marketing is working with University of Colorado and Livermore engineers on a plan to place a mile-long inflatable billboard in low-earth orbit.  NASA would provide contractual launch services. However, since NASA bases its charge on seriously flawed cost estimates (WN 26 Mar 93) the taxpayers would bear most of the expense. This may look like environmental vandalism, but Mike Lawson, CEO of Space Marketing, told us yesterday that the real purpose of the project is to help the environment! The platform will carry ozone monitors he explained--advertising is just to help defray costs. ..........  What do you think of this revolting and hideous attempt to vandalize the night sky? It is not even April 1 anymore. What about light pollution in observations? (I read somewhere else that it might even be visible during the day, leave alone at night).

A convert no less, attracted by the rational tradition [Aquinas et al] and the emotional authenticity [in comp. with the faddishness of Anglicanism] to Roman Catholicism. I never had much time for the pope - or any other heirarchs - but I did, and do, believe in the sacremental system. I always felt quite happy to look down my nose at those such as John Emery [a few posts back] who had to engage in circuitous textual arguments to prove their faith, entirely oblivious to the fact that a dozen other faiths can do the same [with miracles too], and that since their arguments depend on the belief in the Bible as God's sole revelation, it was not very good logic to argue that the Bible proved God. No, I was happy to accept the CHURCH as God's revelation. It was the Church after all that existed before the Bible, the Church that choose [under grace of course] the canon of scripture. Protestant ludicrosity, I thought, was shown by Protestants breathtaking acceptance of Luther's right to reject a dozen or so books he disliked.  But recently I read Peter Brown's _Body and Society_. It is very well researched, and well written. But is raises some very upsetting questions. The early Christians were weird - even more so than today's carzy fundies. They had odd views on sex, odder views on the body,  totally ludicrous views about demons, and distinctly uncharitable views about other human beings.   now the question is this: were the first Christians just as weird, but we've got used to them, or did the pristine \\\"Fall of the Church\\\" happen within one generation. It certainly did'nt have to wait until the Triumph of the Church under Constantine. If so, wha does  this say about God's promise to always support the Church. It's no use throwing the usual Protestant pieties about the Church not being an organization at me. It's a community or it is nothing, and it was the early communities that were weird. The institional church was a model of sanity by comparison.  I would be interested in serious Catholic and Orthodox responses to this entirely serious issue. I'm not sure it is an issue for Protestants with their \\\"soul alone with Jesus\\\" approach, but for we who see the \\\"ecclesia\\\" as a \\\"koinoia\\\" over time and space, the weird early Christians are a problem.  [This is an exaggeration of the Protestant view.  Many Protestants have a strong appreciation for the role of the Church.  \\\"The soul alone with God\\\" is certainly important for Protestants, but it's by no means the whole story.  I have read the sort of history you talk about.  As you point out, Protestants don't have quite the same problem you do, because we believe that the church had a Fall at some point.  However Protestant mythology typically places the Fall around the time of Constantine (or more likely, regard it as happening in a sort of cumulative fashion, starting from Constantine but getting worse as the Pope accumulated power during the medieval period.)  The consequences of having it earlier are somewhat worrisome even to us.  Most Protestants accept the theological results of the early ecumenical councils, including such items as the Trinity and Incarnation.  Indeed in the works of Reformers such as Luther and Calvin, you'll find Church Fathers such as Augustine quoted all the time.  I think you'll find many Protestants resistant to the idea that the Early Church as a whole was \\\"wierd\\\".  (There is an additional problem for Protestants that I don't much want to talk about in this context, since it's been looked at recently -- that's the question of whether one can really think of Augustine and other Fathers as being proto-Protestants.  Their views on Mary, the authority of the Pope, etc, are not entirely congenial to Protestant thought.)  One thing that somewhat worries me is a question of methodology. There are certainly plenty of wierd people in the early church.  What concerns me is that they may be overrepresented in what we see.  We see every Christian who courted martyrdom.  But I think there's good reason to believe that most ordinary Christians were more prudent than that.  We see the heroic virgins.  But I think there's good reason to think that many Christians were happily married.  I can't help suspecting that the early church had the same range of wierdos and sane people that we do now.  I think there's also a certain level of \\\"revisionism\\\" active in history at the moment.  I don't mean that they're manufacturing things out of whole cloth.  But don't you think there might be a tendency to emphasize the novel?\",\" Could you expand on your definition of knowing? It seems a bit monolithic here, but I'm not sure that you intend that.

The large majority involve rifles and shotgun; there are under 500 fatal handgun accidents each year. I really doubt all of those occur while the pistol is holstered, so the number of \\\"self-inflicted gunshot wounds by people wearing thigh holsters\\\" is probably well under 250 per year.   Handguns designs have included a \\\"hammer block\\\" since around 1960 or earlier. This is a metal part which physically seperates the cartridge and the firing pin: Even under impact, the gun cannot fire. The hammer block is connected to the trigger and is pulled out of the way as the trigger is pulled. As a result, modern pistols can fire _only_ if the trigger is pulled (or  in some cases, if they are cocked by hand and then dropped.)    I don't know about animal attacks, but there are 23,500 murders  each year and under 500 die in the manner you suggest.

I can't help but wonder what would happen if all violence against Israelis stopped.  Hopefully, violence against Arabs would stop at the same time.  If a state of non-violence could be  maintained, perhaps a state of cooperation could be achieved, i.e., greater economic opportunities for both peoples living in the \\\"territories\\\".    Of course, given the current leadership of Israel, your way may work also - but if that leadership changes, e.g., to someone with Ariel Sharon's mentality, then I would predict a considerable loss of life, i.e., no winners.  Secondly, regarding your comment about the U.S. troops responding to \\\"stiff resistance\\\" - the analogy is not quite valid.  The U.S. troops could get out of the neighborhood altogether.

I, for one, : would *gladly* pay royalties via purchasing secure phones.   Hear hear! I completely agree that we need to work quickly to establish alternatives to the government's Clinton Clipper. As Brad Templeton and others have noted, once the Clipper becomes ensconced in enough phones there will be enormous pressure to make it the *legal* standard, and it will become the \\\"market* standard as well. (There is a lot of confusion in the proposal about whether the use of Clipper is mandated, about whether non-escrow alternatives will be allowed, etc.)  (There are also unclear issues about how hard, or how illegal, it will be to make \\\"workalikes\\\" which meet the standard but which generate phony or untappable keys...I'm sure the next several weeks will see these issues thrashed out in this and other groups.)  Meanwhile, I'd be interested to hear RSA Data Security's reaction. Often criticized in this group for their licensing policies (the usual complaints about MailSafe costing too much, at $125 or so, and the general issue of software patents...), we may find that *allying* ourselves with RSA is the best thing we can do. What's a mere licensing fee when our liberty may be at stake? (If everyone who wanted true security paid, say, $100 for a lifetime use of all of RSA's patents--which expire in the period 1998-2002, or so--then RSA would make tons of money and be happy, I'm sure. A small price to pay. For those to whom $100 sounds like too much, I'm sure the actual terms could be different, spread out over several years, whatever. To me, it's a small price to pay.)  Strong crypto means strong privacy. Escrowing keys, sending copies of keys to large databases, and splitting keys into two 40-bit pieces, all done with secret and non-analyzable protocols and algorithms, is *NOT* strong crypto!  Whatever some of us may think about the abstract principles of patenting number theory applications, this minor issue pales in comparison with the potential dangers of the Clipper proposal (note that I said \\\"potential\\\"...we'll presumably learn more in the coming months).  The RSA algorithms are at least public, have been analyzed and attacked for years, and source code is available (to better ensure no deliberate weakenesses or trapdoors).  I know of a number of groups putting together voice encryption systems using off-the-shelf hardware (like Soundblaster boards for the PC) and CELP-type software. The new generations of PCs, using fast 486s and Pentiums are fast enough to do real-time voice encryption. Combined with Diffie-Hellman key exchange, this should provide an alternative to the Clipper system.  Of course, we don't really know if the Administration proposes to outlaw competing systems. (It seems to me that their goal of tapping terrorists, child pornographers, and Hilary bashers would be thwarted if low-cost alternatives to Clipper proliferated. Not to defend child pornographers or terrorists, but limiting basic freedoms to catch a few criminals is not the American way of doing things. End of soapbox mode.)  I suggest we in these groups set aside any differences we may have had with RSA (and don't look at me....I have both MacPGP *and* a fully legal copy of \\\"MailSafe\\\"!) and instead work with them as quickly as we can.

[Honestly.] The word of Sin is Restriction. [Would I kid you?]   Does one man's words encompass the majestic vision of thousands of individuals?  Quoting a man is not the same as quoting the Order.  Taken out of context, words can be interpreted much differently than had one applied them within the confines of their original expression.  I think this is the case regarding Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior  of the Order to which I belong.  When he included that bit from Merlinus X' he did us all a service.  He showed us the extremes to which Order members have been known to go in their fervor. I have little knowledge regarding Reuss' background, but surely he was an unusual man, and he was an important force in the Order  for many years.  Yet as people change so do Orders change, and while we look back so carefully at the dirty laundry of O.T.O. remember that this is only the surface skim and that many perspectives are now encompassed which extend beyond any one individual.  I hope to show that there was and is much room for a difference of opinion within the Order itself, perhaps by testing the limits myself.   Let us examine this issue a bit more closely....  \\\"In 1895, Karl Kellner (1850-1905), a wealthy Austrian industrialist and paper chemist, as well as a high-grade Mason, founded the Ordo Templi Orientis.  Kellner had traveled widely in the East, where he met three adepts who instructed him specific magical practices.   Kellner's efforts to develop the Order were later assisted by Franz Hartmann, Heinrich Klein and Theodore Reuss, who had worked together prior to joining the O.T.O.  The Order was first proclaimed in 1902 in Reuss's Masonic publication, 'Oriflamme'.  On Kellner's death, Reuss succeeded him as Outer Head [O.H.O.].  The 'Jubilee' edition of the 'Oriflamme', published in 1912, announced that the Order taught secret of sexual magic.   \\\"Theodore Reuss was an interesting character.  Born June 28, 1855 in Augsburg, he entered Masonry in 1876.  He was a singer, journalist and possibly a spy for the Prussian political police, infiltrating the Socialist League founded by Karl Marx's daughter and her husband.  Reuss was later associated with William Wynn Westcott, a leader of the Golden Dawn, who later introduced him to John Yarker.  Yarker chartered Reuss to found the Rites of Memphis and Mizraim in Germany.  After several attempts to concretize various Masonic Rites, Reuss settled on the development of the O.T.O.  \\\"The Order experienced reasonably steady growth under Reuss' leadership. For example, he chartered Papus in France, Rudolph Steiner in Berlin and H. Spencer Lewis in the USA.  In 1912, the historic meeting between Reuss and Crowley occurred.  Crowley wrote that Reuss came to him and accused him of revealing Order secrets.  When Crowley looked at it afresh, the initiated interpretation of sexual magick unfolded itself to him for the first time.  Reuss appointed Crowley as Supreme and Holy King of all the English speaking world, and it was this authorization that he invoked when publishing the material of the Equinox.  \\\"Reuss resigned as Outer Head of the Order in 1922 after suffering a stroke and named Crowley his successor.  All was well until 1925 when _The Book of the Law_ was translated into German.  There was a break in the continuity of the Order.  Manyk members split with the new O.H.O. over the book, which Crowley was actively promulgating through the Order. He had earlier revise dthe Order rituals at Reuss's request, deeply infusing the doctrines of the New Aeon revelation.\\\"  _An Introduction to the History of the O.T.O._, by Ad Veritatem IX'  Within _Equinox III:10_, Edited by    Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior, Rex Summus Sanctissimus,     Caliph of the United States of America,       Published by Samuel Weiser, 1990.    There are many possible reasons that our Frater Superior included this material in _Equinox III:10_.  And this is the real point, is it not? Why did he wish to publish such things about the history of his own organization?  Does he represent a dogmatic threat to the principle of Thelema?  Or is he exercising his True Will and putting forth very complex pictures with no easy answers?  A picture which leaves room for very many interpretations.  It is quite easy for me to see, for example, that all of O.T.O. derived out of the dribble of faltering Masonry, purchased by clever hucksters with an ounce of courage and some writing ability to aid them.  And I can take that all the way down to our present Caliph, whose feeble support of the 'Law of Thelema' is laughable at best.  Would I be thrown out of the Order for speaking in this way?   Will I?   I think not. Why?  Because my Frater will see it as a perspective, an interjection I am using as an example.  My illustration shows that we may express things in the context of a larger work and the true significance of this may be quite difficult to apprehend at first.  So it may be with OTO and Merlinus X'.  Please look O.T.O. more carefully. I do not support Reuss's words myself, as I am not qualified to assess them, and I am critical of their pomposity.  If I who am a member of the Order take such a stand and am allowed to continue doing so, then what can this say about the health of the Order?  Does it mean that the Order has 'gone soft' and abandoned its moral principles?  Or does it mean that it is strong in its ability to let the will of universal kinship arise on its own, not shackled by some dogmatic requirement?  How shall we resolve these two possibilities?   I find a high calibre of individual associated with Ordo Templi Orientis. They are often quite intelligent and sometimes very well versed in arcane or usual information.  They are quite often artists and geniuses.   Having met some 20 longstanding members in the SF Bay Area (many who are or were very heavily involved with the Order), I can vouch for the integrity of the organization as it stands.  I have sometimes questioned the policy of Hymenaeus Beta.  In these moments  I followed my intuition, and I've found little to stop me from requesting a Second initiation from a different O.T.O. body.  I'm happily participating in social groups (Feasts or Initiations) and have come to know the Gnostic Mass well enough for my tastes.    This doesn't make me an authority on Order politics and explanations, however. I can only hypothesize and relay to you what I understand based on my limited contact with other members.  I urge you not to take the words of Merlinus X too far.  There are many ways to interpret words, and many people who have become involved with the Order feel very strongly about the sanctity of personal freedom and the preservation of individual vision.  I welcome other comment on this issue and will be writing more in response to other posts in this thread.   Invoke me under my stars.  Love is the law, love under will.

It's the one that sometimes sweeps schools or boot camp.  It is contagious and kills by attacking the covering of the brain, causing the blood vessels to thrombose and the brain to swell up.  It is very treatable if caught in time.  There isn't much time, however.  The rash is the tip off.  Infants are very susceptible to dying from bacterial meningitis.  Any infant with a fever who becomes stiff or lethargic needs to be rushed to a hospital where a spinal tap will show if they have meningitis.  Seizures can also occur.   It can live in the throat of carriers.  Don't worry, you won't get  it from them, especially if they took the medication.  --  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gordon Banks  N3JXP      | \\\"Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and geb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon.\\\" \",\"Who the hell is this guy David Davidian.

If, however, the woman is injured or dies, the : *lex talionis* doctrine of \\\"an eye for an eye\\\" applies.  This is the : Jewish interpretation, and is supported by Jewish commentaries on : these verses. :    This is quite an embarrassment for pro-lifer Christians, so there is : of course an alternate explanation.

Not every wild flight of fancy serves (or can serve) in the appropriate relation to a hypothesis.  It is somewhat interesting that when anyone is challanged to provide an example of this sort the *only* one they come up with is the one about Kekule.  Surely, there must be others.  But apparently this is regarded as an *extreme* example of a \\\"non-rational\\\" process in science whereby a successful hypothesis was proposed.  But how non-rational is it?  Of course we can't hope (currently at least) to explain how or why Kekule had the daydream of snakes in the fire biting their tails. Surely it wasn't the *only* daydream he had.  What was special about *this* one?  Could it have had something to do with a perceived *analogy* between the geometry of the snakes and problems concerning geometry of molecules?  Is such analogical reasoning \\\"extra-scientific\\\"? Or is it rather at the very heart of science (Perice's notion of abduction, the use of models within and across disciplines)?  Upon close examination, is there a non-rational mystical leap taking place, or is it perhaps closer to a formal (though often incomplete) analogy or model?\",\" Hi there I'm suffering from Sarcoidosis at present.

Cheers Nigel\",\"  Dr. Goebels thought that a lie repeated enough times could finally  be believed. I have been observing that 'Poly' has been practicing  Goebels' rule quite loyally. 'Poly's audience is mostly made of Greeks  who are not allowed to listen to Turkish news. However, in today's  informed world Greek propagandists can only fool themselves. For  instance, those who lived in 1974 will remember the TV news they  watched and the newspapers they read and the younger generation can  read the American newspapers of July and August 1974 to find out what  really happened.   There are in Turkiye the Greek Hospital, The Greek Girls' Lycee  Alumni Association, the Principo Islands Greek Benevolent Society,  the Greek Medical Foundation, the Principo Greek Orphanage Foundation,  the Yovakimion Greek Girls' Lycee Foundation, and the Fener Greek  Men's Lycee Foundation.    As for Greece, the longstanding use of the adjective 'Turkish'  in titles and on signboards is prohibited. The Greek courts  have ordered the closure of the Turkish Teachers' Association,  the Komotini Turkish Youth Association and the Ksanti  Turkish Association on grounds that there are no Turks in Western Thrace. Such community associations had been  active until 1984. But they were first told to remove the word 'Turkish' on their buildings and on their official papers and then eventually close down. This is also the  final verdict (November 4, 1987) of the Greek High Court.  In the city of Komotini, a former Greek Parliamentarian of Turkish parentage, was sentenced recently to 18 months of imprisonment with no right to appeal, just for saying outloud that he was of Turkish descent. This duly-elected ethnic Turkish official was also deprived of his political rights for a period of three  years. Each one of these barbaric acts seems to be none other than  a vehicle, used by the Greek governments, to cover-up their inferiority  complex they display, vis-a-vis, the people of Turkiye.   The Agreement on the Exchange of Minorities uses the term 'Turks,'  which demonstrates what is actually meant by the previous reference  to 'Muslims.' The fact that the Greek governments also mention the  existence of a few thousand non-Turkish Muslims does not change the  essential reality that there lives in Western Thrace a much bigger  Turkish minority. The 'Pomaks' are also a Muslim people, whom all the  three nations (Bulgarians, Turks, and Greeks) consider as part of  themselves. Do you know how the Muslim Turkish minority was organized  according to the agreements? Poor 'Poly.'  It also proves that the Turkish people are trapped in Greece  and the Greek people are free to settle anywhere in the world. The Greek authorities deny even the existence of a Turkish minority. They pursue the same denial in connection with  the Macedonians of Greece. Talk about oppression. In addition, in 1980 the 'democratic' Greek Parliament passed Law No. 1091, virtually taking over the administration of the vakiflar and other charitable trusts. They have ceased to be self-supporting religious and cultural entities. Talk about fascism. The Greek  governments are attempting to appoint the muftus, irrespective of the will of the Turkish minority, as state official. Although the Orthodox Church has full authority in similar matters in Greece, the Muslim Turkish minority will have no say in electing its religious leaders. Talk about democracy.  The government of Greece has recently destroyed an Islamic  convention in Komotini. Such destruction, which reflects an  attitude against the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a  violation of the Lausanne Convention as well as the 'so-called'  Greek Constitution, which is supposed to guarantee the protection  of historical monuments.   The government of Greece, on the other hand, is building new  churches in remote villages as a complementary step toward  Hellenizing the region.  And you pondered. Sidiropoulos, the president of the Macedonian Human  Rights Committee, became the latest victim of a tactic long used by  the Greeks to silence critics of policies of forced assimilation  of the Macedonian minority. A forestry official by occupation,  Sidiropoulos has been sent to 'internal exile' on the island of  Kefalonia, hundreds of kilometers away from his native Florina.  His employer, the Florina City Council, asked him to depart in  24 hours. The Greek authorities are trying to punish him for his  involvement in Copenhagen. He returned to Florina by his own choice  and remains without a job.   Helsinki Watch, a well-known Human Rights group, had been investigating  the plight of the Turkish Minority in Greece. In August 1990, their  findings were published in a report titled    'Destroying Ethnic Identity: Turks of Greece.'  The report confirmed gross violations of the Human Rights of the  Turkish minority by the Greek authorities. It says for instance,  the Greek government recently destroyed an Islamic convent in  Komotini. Such destruction, which reflects an attitude against  the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a violation of the  Lausanne Convention.   The Turkish cemeteries in the village of Vafeika and in Pinarlik were attacked, and tombstones were broken. The cemetery in Karotas was razed by bulldozers.  Shall I go on? Why not? The people of Turkiye are not going  to take human rights lessons from the Greek Government. The  discussion of human rights violations in Greece does not  stop at the Greek frontier. In several following articles  I shall dwell on and expose the Greek treatment of Turks in Western Thrace and the Aegean Macedonians.  It has been reported that the Greek Cypriot administration  has an intense desire for arms and that Greece has made  plans to supply it with the tanks and armored vehicles it  has to destroy in accordance with the agreement reached on  conventional arms reductions in Europe. Meanwhile, Greek  and Greek Cypriot officials are reported to have planned  to take ostentatious measures aimed at camouflaging the  transfer of these tanks and armored vehicles to southern  Cyprus, a process that will conflict with the spirit of  the agreement on conventional arms reduction in Europe.  An acceptable method may certainly be found when there is a will. But we know of various kinds of violent behaviors ranging from physical attacks to the burning of buildings. The rugs at the Amfia village mosque were  dragged out to the front of the building and burnt there.  Shots were fired on the mosque in the village of Aryana.  Now wait, there is more.    'Greek Atrocities in the Vilayet of Smyrna (May to July 1919), Inedited   Documents and Evidence of English and French Officers,' Published by   The Permanent Bureau of the Turkish Congress at Lausanne, Lausanne,   Imprimerie Petter, Giesser & Held, Caroline, 5 (1919).    pages 82-83:  << 1. The train going from Denizli to Smyrna was stopped at Ephesus    and the 90 Turkish travellers, men and women who were in it ordered    to descend. And there in the open street, under the eyes of their    husbands, fathers and brothers, the women without distinction of age    were violated, and then all the travellers were massacred. Amongst    the latter the Lieutenant Salih Effendi, a native of Tripoli, and a    captain whose name is not known, and to whom the Hellenic authorities    had given safe conduct, were killed with specially atrocious tortures.     2. Before the battle, the wife of the lawyer Enver Bey coming from    her garden was maltreated by Greek soldiers, she was even stript    of her garments and her servant Assie was violated.     3. The two tax gatherers Mustapha and Ali Effendi were killed in the    following manner: Their arms were bound behind their backs with wire    and their heads were battered and burst open with blows from the butt    end of a gun.     4. During the firing of the town, eleven children, six little girls    and five boys, fleeing from the flames, were stopped by Greek soldiers    in the Ramazan Pacha quarter, and thrown into a burning Jewish house    near bridge, where they were burnt alive. This fact is confirmed on oath    by the retired commandant Hussein Hussni Effendi who saw it.     5. The clock-maker Ahmed Effendi and his son Sadi were arrested and    dragged out of their shop. The son had his eyes put out and was then    killed in the court of the Greek Church, but Ahmed Effendi has been    no more heard of.     6. At the market, during the fire, two unknown people were wounded    by bayonets, then bound together, thrown into the fire and burnt alive.     The Greeks killed also many Jews. These are the names of some:    Moussa Malki, shoemaker          killed   Bohor Levy, tailor               killed   Bohor Israel, cobbler            killed   Isaac Calvo, shoemaker           killed   David Aroguete                   killed   Moussa Lerosse                   killed   Gioia Katan                      killed   Meryem Malki                     killed   Soultan Gharib                   killed   Isaac Sabah                      wounded   Moche Fahmi                      wounded   David Sabah                      wounded   Moise Bensignor                  killed   Sarah Bendi                      killed   Jacob Jaffe                      wounded   Aslan Halegna                    wounded....>>  Serdar Argic\",\"ok, i have a 486dx50(ISA) w/ Diamond Stealth VRAM 1MB.

They say the 39-year-old mechanic committed suicide after     killing his wife, Jocelyne Parent, 31.       The couple had been separated for a month and the woman had     gone to his apartment to talk about getting some more money     for food. A violent quarrel broke out and Prevost attacked     his wife with a kitchen knife, cutting her throat, police said.       She was only the latest of 13 women slain by a husband or     lover in Quebec in the last five weeks.

This sounds suspiciously like a hockey fan I know, who cheers   when one of the players on His Team uses his stick to permanently   rearrange an opponent's face, and curses the ref for penalizing   His Side.  Of course, when it's different when the roles are   reversed.\",\" GM, at least, is heading in that direction.  One of the post-sale questions they asked me was if I'd like the choice of a cigarette liter or an accessory plug, and another whether I'd like the choice of an ashtray or a cup holder.  The '93 Geo Storms have the cigarette lighter vs accessory plug option (which did not exist in the '92 I bought) -- I'm not sure about the ash tray vs cup holder.  It's a step in the right direction.  The ashtray does make a convenient change-holder so it's not completely useless.\",\"The only info I have is my area is not having a large march.  They are leaving it up to each congragation.  IMO this means organizers found it too difficult to manage or no one feels the need to be involved.  I'm not casting stones, my involvement with the Lord does not include the March this year.  Maybe He is giving a message by the lack of one??

It is an LC, with 10MB of RAM and an 80MB internal drive, running system 7.1, with a few SCSI devices in a (so far as I know) properly terminated chain.  I had shut down the system for a day-- I was out of town and we sometimes have thunderstorms this time of year-- and upon restarting got a blinking question mark.  I booted from a floppy and saw that my external HD seemed okay, but there was no sign of the internal.  I installed a system folder on the external and was, indeed, able to boot from it.  I tried things like Disk First Aid and Silverlining, to inquire about the internal drive.  They either could not find it or got errors in trying to talk to it. (Silverlining claimed it was a Connor drive, but it is a Quantum... )  Well, I'd backed things up, so I was able to work.  But, at some point I noticed that the internal had reappeared.  Now, Disk First Aid says that all's well, etc.  Things seem to be fine.  But, what happened?  Was this a warning that something (the internal HD or something else) is about to die?  I'm definitely nervous.  And, if this is a signal that the internal HD is sick, is it true that I can only put up to a 127MB drive inside an LC?  Some folks have claimed there's a limitation in the LC (other'n size or power) while others (and that includes LaCie, over the phone) say anything that fits is okay.\",\"Would the person who is running the e-mail list for KANSAS CITY Royals please e-mail details regarding mailing list.

That was my point all along, Fred.      I see we are dealing with a problem in a conflict of interpretations, not least of which is your belief that only you can adequately judge what is and is not debate.  Suffice to say that I disagree with you on that last point.  Why don't you take a poll, Fred, if you want some psuedo-objective point-of-view?  And, as usual, you defend your insults with \\\"he started it.\\\"  \\\"Yeah, I took some of his research and called it my own, but he started it.\\\"  \\\"So what if I stole his car, he stole my lawnmower first.\\\"  Besides that, I think it's still open to interpretation whether Nick actually did start it. So your defense, besides being lame, and contradicting the first part of the sentence in which it occurs, may not even apply anyway.  Your defense reminds me of the guy that broke the borrowed tool:  \\\"I never borrowed it, I already gave it back, and it was broken when you gave it to me.\\\"  Make up yer mind, Fred!      First, I try to address what I think you meant, for which I am rewarded with a denial of sorts, and a smart remark.  Then, I point out that I am not clear what you did mean, rather than risking your childish ire, wrongly interpreting you a second time, and I'm stupid for it.  I just can't win, can I, Fred?  You've got a great point here somewhere, it's just that between stupid people that you must insult, and your jealous guarding of your valuable opinions, you never actually get around to making it.   *** Fred issue #2;  Nick's alleged meaning ***  Too bad the plan only exists in your mind, instead of Nick's, or you would have a really good point.  Instead you have provided a good reason to ignore your insults, since they are based on incorrect interpretations that you have made about others.  Forgive me for giving your insults more meaning than they ever should have had.  My reading of what Nick actually said is that \\\"people aren't required in all parts of all space processes\\\", so your taking issue with his opinions regarding people in the space program, I read as \\\"People are required in all parts of all space processes.\\\"  So, help me out, here, Fred, since I'm so patently stupid.  Did you read Nick wrong?  Or are you going to eat your terminal now?  If the latter, I sure hope it's one of those Cheeto and string models that all the computer mags have been raving about :-)  The point is, _I_ am not stupid because of _your_ incorrect assumption.  I'd only be stupid if I insulted you for having made it.  But, alas, that's your job, Fred.  And, finally, your style is confusing, since you tried to make two points, simultaneously, with an allegory/insult.  Sadly, one point addressed a 'plan' that only existed in your mind, and the other took issue with behaviors that you do as much as anyone.   No, no, I finally got it.  You don't like the plan that Nick's posts made you imagine.  And you don't like Nick's obnoxious behavior, even though it's no worse than your own.  Thanks for taking the time with someone as dense as myself.      Of course, Socrates.  How could it be otherwise?   Who cares who came on the net first?  If you do, consider that you saw me come on after a brief haitus, before which I was on for about 2 years. If you had seen me on the net first, you'd remember when Nick and I went down exactly the same road regarding rude, unneccesary behavior.  It's just amazing to me that you continue to take issue with behavior that's no worse than your own.  Let's see here, my complaints about your obnoxious behavior are hypocritical, while your flames against people you decide are flamers isn't, and my complaints about your name-calling are immature, while your name-calling isn't.  Yeah, right.  Maybe if you called me some more names, I might see it better, Fred.  \\\"Net.ghod wannabe\\\"?  Naturally, Fred, you've correctly interpreted my motivations, when yours are impossible to judge from your actions (as your insulting of people that try, proves).  I didn't really care about people that fill the net with personal garbage, what I really wanted was to impress everyone.  I only put my complaints with your behavior on private mail, not because it belongs there, but because I thought you were such a jerk that you'd bring it back to the Net, playing right into my hands. Alas, I had no idea what an intellectual master you were, turning tables and bringing the history of these posts to the net, for the noble and valuable purpose of embarassing me.  Whether I should feel stupid because I tried to make suggestions to such a superior intellect, or becuase I tried to communicate like an adult with a self-righteous ass, still isn't clear.  Well, Fred, you exposed me.  Now I'll never be able to get a(nother) job with NASA, since they all know that I'm stupider than Fred McCall.  Well, I just hope you're happy.

Richard Hirschhaut, director of the San Francisco branch of the ADL, art dealer Roy Bullock and former policeman Tom Gerard were also named as defendants in the suit, filed in San Francisco County Superior Court.      The 19 accuse the ADL of B'nai B'rith, a group dedicated to fighting anti-Semitism, and the other defendants of secretly gathering information on them, including data from state and federal agencies.      The suit alleges they disclosed the information to others, including the governments of Israel and South Africa, in what it alleges was a \\\"a massive spying operation.\\\"      The action is a class-action suit. It was filed on behalf of about 12,000 anti-apartheid activists or opponents of Israeli policies about whom the plaintiffs believe the ADL, Bullock and Gerard gathered information.      Representatives of the ADL in San Francisco were not immediately available for comment on Wednesday.      The civil suit is the first legal action arising out of allegations that Gerard, a former inspector in the San Francisco police intelligence unit, passed confidential police files on California political activists to a spy ring.      The FBI and San Francisco police are investigating the ADL, Bullock and Gerard over the affair and last week searched the ADL's offices in San Francisco and Los Angeles.      The suit alleges invasion of privacy under the Civil Code of California, which prohibits the publication of information obtained from official sources. It seeks exemplary damages of at least $2,500 per person as well as other unspecified damages.      Lawyer Pete McCloskey, a former Congresmen who is representing the plaintiffs, said the 19 plaintiffs included Arab-Americans and Jews -- and his wife Helen, who also had information gathered about her.      One of the plaintiffs is Yigal Arens, a research scientist at the University of Southern California who is a son of the former Israeli Defence Minister.      Arens told the San Francisco Examiner he had seen a file the ADL kept on him in the 1980s, presumably because of his criticism of the treatment of Palestinians and his position on the Israeli-occupied territories.      According to court documents released last week, Bullock and Gerard both kept information on thousands of California political activists.      In the documents, a police investigator said he believed the ADL paid Bullock for many years to provide information and that both the league and Bullock received confidential information from the authorities.      No criminal charges have yet been filed in the case. The ADL, Bullock and Gerard have all denied any wrongdoing.   REUTER AC KG CM    APn  04/14 2202  ADL Lawsuit  Copyright, 1993. The Associated Press. All rights reserved.  By CATALINA ORTIZ  Associated Press Writer    SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Arab-Americans and critics of Israel sued the Anti-Defamation League on Wednesday, saying it invaded their privacy by illegally gathering information about them through a nationwide spy network.    The ADL, a national group dedicated to fighting anti-Semitism, intended to use the data to discredit them because of their political views, according to the class-action lawsuit filed in San Francisco Superior Court.    \\\"None of us has been guilty of racism or Nazism or anti-Semitism or hate crimes, or any of the other `isms' that the ADL claims to protect against. None of us is violent or criminal in any way,\\\" said Carol El-Shaieb, an education consultant who develops programs on Arab culture.    The 19 plaintiffs include Yigal Arens, son of former Israel Defense Minister Moshe Arens. The younger Arens, a research scientist at the University of Southern California, said the ADL kept a file on him in the 1980s presumably because he has criticized Israel's treatment of Palestinians.    \\\"The ADL believes that anyone who is an Arab American ... or speaks politically against Israel is at least a closet anti-Semite,\\\" Arens said.    The ADL has denied any wrongdoing, but couldn't comment on the lawsuit because it hasn't reviewed it, said a spokesman at the ADL's New York headquarters.    The FBI and local police and prosecutors are investigating allegations that the ADL spied on thousands of individuals and hundreds of groups, including white supremacist and anti-Semitic organizations, Arab-Americans, Greenpeace, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and San Francisco public television station KQED.    Some information allegedly came from confidential police and government records, according to court documents filed in the probe and the civil lawsuit. No charges have been filed in the criminal investigation.    The lawsuit accuses the ADL of violating California's privacy law, which forbids the intentional disclosure of personal information \\\"not otherwise public\\\" from state or federal records.    The lawsuit claims the ADL disclosed the information to \\\"persons and entities\\\" who had no compelling need to receive it. It didn't elaborate.    Defendants include Richard Hirschhaut, director of the ADL's office in San Francisco. He did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment.    Other defendants are San Francisco art dealer Roy Bullock, an alleged ADL informant over the past four decades, and former police officer Tom Gerard. Gerard allegedly tapped into law enforcement and government computers and passed information on to Bullock.    Gerard, who has retired from the police force, has moved to the Philippines. Bullock's lawyer, Richard Breakstone, said he could not comment on the lawsuit because he had not yet studied it.

That is one aspect of it.  In the case of the virgin birth prophecy, it applied to the then and there, and also prophetically to Christ.  The army that threatened the king would  cease to be a threat in a very short time.  Yet it also prophecied of  Christ.  Several prophecies that refered to Christ also had application at the time they were made.  \\\"Out of Egypt have I called my Son\\\" refers both to Israel, and prophetically to Christ.   \\\"Why do the heathen rage\\\" was said of David and also of Christ.    Another example would be the Scripture quoted of Judas, \\\"and his bishoprick let another take.\\\"  Another example is something that Isaiah said of His disciples which is also applied to Christ in Hebrews, \\\"the children thou hast given me.\\\"  How does the preterist view account for this phenomenon.  Link \",\"        Here's a question:  If most marijuana is domestic and producing it here is economical, why would we expect it to be imported?          Yet it was done.  Done quite successfully for a number of years. *Somebody* thought it was worth the risk.          Your assumption is that this \\\"low\\\" dollar/pound area is sufficiently low as to make gun-running unprofitable.  On what do you base this?           And given that smuggling channels are already established, and given the economies of scale, would it really add significantly more expense to start smuggling firearms, especially considering doing so would be less hazardous (in terms of getting caught) than drugs?          Now *that* was a jump.  In any case, define \\\"local.\\\"  It's a big country.           Wow, you gotta love the speculation.         As I posted before, we import billions upon billions of raw ores across the Mexican border.  Not only that but ships come in and out of U.S. harbors every day full stuff.  And customs doesn't even have the extra advantage of being able to sniff them out.           I'd be willing to wager that a shipload of handguns would be worth more than a shipload of raw ore, *and* you're virtually guaranteed to get it past customs, because they'd have to hand search every hold of every ship which came through.         It's not simply a matter of how much money are they worth, but how much *more* money are they worth than other goods, based on the likelihood of being caught.  Less money than drugs, but also a safer thing to smuggle.

 The debate over the Second Amendment rages on. Arguments continue over what a \\\"well-regulated militia\\\" is and what TRKBA means in practical terms.  However, the ONLY authority in this area, is a binding court decision on the matter.  Even a decision in this area is subject to an overturning by a higher court.  Is there anyone who has the facts of a legal precedent, preferably a Supreme Court decision on the specific meaning of the 2nd Amendment? \",\"Has anyone got multiverse to work ?

I am having the following 2 problems.  (1) Many of my Imakefile's have contructs like                 /**/#This is a makefile         at the start of lines to pass Makefile comments thru the C         preprocessor and into the Makefile.  Most of the C preprocessors that         I have used will not treat such a # as appearing at the start of the         line.  Thus the C preprocessor does not treat the hash symbol as the         start of a directive.           However the IBM cpp strips the comment and treats the hash symbol         as the start of a directive.  The cpp fails when it determines         that \\\"This\\\" is not a known directive.  I have temporarily hacked my         imake to handle this situation but would like to come up with a better         fix.  (2) Several Imakefiles use /**/ as a parameter to a macro when a particular         use of the macro does not need a value for the parameter.  The AIX cpp         gives warnings about these situations but continues to work OK.

(Cross-posted to alt.psychology.personality since some personality typing will be discussed at the beginning - Note: I've set all followups to sci.med since most of my comments are more sci.med oriented and I'm sure most of the replies, if any, will be med-related.)     They are just responding in their natural way:  Hyper-Choleric Syndrome (HCS). Oops, that is not a recognized \\\"illness\\\" in the psychological community, better not say that since it therefore must not, and never will, exist.  :^)  Actually, it is fascinating that a disproportionate number of physicians will type out as NT (for those not familiar with the Myers-Briggs system, just e-mail me and I'll send a summary file to you).  In the general population, NT's comprise only about 12% of the population, but among physicians it is much much higher (I don't know the exact percentage - any help here a.p.p.er's?)  One driving characteristic of an NT, especially an NTJ, is their obvious choleric behavior (driver, type A, etc.) - the extreme emotional need to control, to lead, and/or to be the best or the most competent.  If they are also extroverted, they are best described as \\\"Field Marshalls\\\".  This trait is very valuable and essential in our society - we need people who want to lead, to strive to overcome the elements, to seek and thirst for knowledge, to raise the level of competency, etc.  The great successes in science and technology are in large part due to the vision (an N trait) and scientifically- minded approach (T trait) of the NT personality (of course, the other types and temperaments have their own positive contributions as well).  However, when the NT person has self-image challenges, the \\\"dark-side\\\" of this personality type usually comes out, which should be obvious to all.  A physician who is a strong NT and who has not learned to temper their temperament will be extremely business-like (lack of empathy or feeling), and is very compelled to have total control over their patient (the patient must be obedient to their diagnosis and prescription without question).  I've known many M.D.'s of this temperament and suffice to say I don't oblige them with a followup visit, no matter how competent I think they are (and they usually are very competent from a knowledge viewpoint since that is an extreme drive of theirs - to know the most, to know it all).  Maybe we need more NF doctor's.  :^)  Enough on this subject - let's move on to candida bloom.    You've helped me already by your post.  Of course, I believe that I have been misdiagnosed on the net as suffering from 'anal retentivitis', but being the phlegmatic I am, maybe I was just a little too harsh on a few people myself in past posts.  Let's all try to raise the level of this discussion above the level of anal effluent.    In my well-described situation (in prior posts), I definitely was immune stressed.  Blood tests showed my vitamin A levels were very low.  My sinuses were a mess - no doubt the mucosal lining and the cilia were heavily damaged. I also was on antibiotics 15 times in 4 years!  In the end, even two weeks of Ceftin did not work and I had confirmed diagnoses of a chronic bacterial infection of the sinuses via cat-scans, mucus color (won't get into the details), and other symptoms.  Three very traditional ENT's made this diagnosis (I did not have any cultures done, however, because of the difficulty of doing this right and because my other symptoms clearly showed a bacterial infection).  Enough of this background (provided to help you understand where I was when I make comments about my Sporanox anti-fungal therapy below).   The first question I have is this.  Can fungus penetrate a little way into poor mucus membrane tissue, maybe via hyphae, thus causing symptoms, without being considered 'systemic' in the classic sense?  It is sort of an inbetween infection.    I was concerned, too, because of the toxicity of vitamin A.  My doctor, after my blood tests, put me on 75,000 IU of vitamin A for one week only, then dropped it down to 25,000 IU for the next couple of weeks.  I also received zinc and other supplementation, since all of these interrelate in fairly complex ways as my doctor explained (he's one of those 'evil' orthomolecular specialists).  I had a blood test three weeks later and vitamin A was normal, he then stopped me on all vitamin A (except for some in a multi-vitamin) supplement), and made sure that I maintain a 50,000 IU/day of beta carotene. Call me carrot face.  :^)  Hopefully, Elaine's doctor will take a similar, careful approach and to all supplements.  I'm even reevaluating some supplements I'm taking, for example, niacin in fairly large dosages, 1 gram/day, which Steve Dyer had good information about on sci.med.nutrition.  If niacin only has second-order improvement in symptomatic relief of my sinus allergies, then it probably is not worth taking such a large dose long-term and risking liver damage.    Though I do now believe, based on my successful therapy with Sporanox, that I definitely had some excessive growth of fungus (unknown species) in my sinuses, I still want to ask the question:  have there been any studies that demonstrate candida \\\"blooms\\\" in the sinuses with associated sinus irritation (sinusitis/rhinitis)?  (My sinus irritation reduced significantly after one week of Sporanox and no other new treatments were implemented during this time - I did not have any noticeable GI track problems before starting on Sporanox, but some for a few days after which then went away - considered normal).  BTW, my doctor dug out one of his medical reference books (sorry, can't remember which one), and found an obscure comment dating back into the 1950's which stated that people can develop contained (non-lethal or non-serious) aspergillis infestations (aspergiliosis) of the sinuses leading to sinus inflammation symptoms.  I'll have to dig out that reference again since it is relevant to this discussion.    My doctor tested me (I believe a RAST or RAST similar test) for allergic response to specificially Candida albicans, and I showed a strong positive. Another question, would everybody show the same strong positive so this test is essentially useless?  And, assuming it is true that Candida can grow part-way into the mucus membrane tissue, and the concentration exceeds a  threshold amount, could not a person who tests as having an allergy to Candida definitely develop allergic symptoms, such as mucus membrane irritation due to the body's allergic response?  As I said in an earlier post, one does not need to be a rocket scientist, or have a M.D. degree or a  Ph.D. in biochemistry to see the plausibility of this hypothesis.  BTW, and I'll repost this again.  Dr. Ivker, in his book, \\\"Sinus Survival\\\", has routinely given, before anything else, Nizoral (a pre-Sporanox systemic anti-fungal, not as safe and not as good as Sporanox) to his new chronic sinusitis patients IF they have been on antibiotics four or more times in the last two years.  He claims that out of 2000 or so patients, well over 90% notice some relief of sinus inflammation and other symptoms, but it doesn't cure it by any means, implying the so-called yeast/fungus infection is not the primary cause, but a later complication.  He's also found that nystatin, whether taken internally, or put into a sinus spray, does not help.  This implies (of course assuming that excessive yeast/fungus bloom is aggravating the sinus inflammation) that the yeast/fungus has grown partway into the tissue since nystatin will not kill yeast/fungus other than by direct contact - it is not absorbed into the blood stream.  Again, I admit, lots of 'ifs', and 'implies', which doesn't please the hard-core NT who has to have the double-blind study or it's a non-issue, but one has to start with some plausible hypothesis/explanation, a strawman, if you will.    This brings up an interesting observation used by those who will deny and reject any and all aspects of the 'yeast hypothesis' until the appropriate studies are done.  And that is if you can't observe or culture the yeast \\\"bloom\\\" in the gut or sinus, then there's no way to diagnose or even recognize the disease.  And I know they realize that it is virtually impossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that cannot be easily observed since candida is everywhere in the body.  It's a real Catch-22.  Another Catch-22:  Those who totally reject the 'yeast hypothesis' say that no studies have been done (actually studies have been done, but if it's not up to a certain standard then it is, from their perspective, a non-study which should not even be considered).  I agree that the appropriate studies should be done, and that will take big $ to do it right.  However, in order to convince the funding agencies in these austere times to open their wallets, you literally have to give them evidence, and the only acceptable evidence to compete with other proposals is paradoxically to do almost the exact study needed funding.  That is, you have to do 90% of the study before you even get funding (as a scientist at a National Lab, I'm very aware of this for the smaller funded projects).  I'm afraid that even if Dr. Ivker and 100 other doctors got together, pooled their practice's case histories and anecdotes into a compelling picture, and approach the funding agencies, they would get nowhere, even if they were able to publish their statistical results.  It is obvious from the comments by some of the doctors here is that they have *decided* excessive yeast colonization in the gut or sinuses leading to noticeable non-lethal symptoms does not exist, and is not even a tenable hypothesis, so any amount of case histories or compiled anecdotal evidence to the contrary will never change their mind, and not only that, they would also oppose the needed studies because in their minds it's a done issue -  excessive yeast growth leading to diffuse allergic symptoms does not, will not, and cannot exist.  Period.  Kind of tough to dialog with those who hold such a viewpoint.  Kind of reminds me of Lister...    Aren't there also other nutrients necessary to the proper working of the sinus mucus membranes and cilia?    Again, the evidence from mycological studies indicate that many yeast/fungus species can grow hyphae (\\\"roots\\\") into deep tissue, similar to mold growing in bread.  You can continue to kill the surface, such as nystatin does, but you can't kill that which is deeper in the tissue without using a systemic anti-fungal such as itraconazole (Sporanox) or some of the older ones such as Nizoral which are more toxic and not as effective.  This is why, as has been pointed out by recent studies (sent to me by a doctor I've been in e-mail contact with - thanks), that nystatin is not effective in the long- term treatment of GI tract \\\"candidiasis\\\".  It's like trying to weed a garden by cutting off what's above the ground but leaving the roots ready to come out again once you walk away.  The $60000 question is whether a contained candida \\\"bloom\\\" can partially grow into tissue through the mucus membranes, causing some types of symptoms in susceptible people (e.g., allergy), without becoming \\\"systemic\\\" in the classical sense of the word - something in between strictly an excessive bloom not causing any problems and the full-blown systemic infection that is potentially lethal.    Also, if one is an 'anal retentive', like I've been diagnosed in a prior post, that can also provide more sites for excessive candida growth.  ;^)    As I've said in private e-mail, there are flaws in our current medical system that make it difficult or even impossible for a physician to attempt alternative therapies AFTER the approved/proven/accepted therapies don't work. For example, I went to three ENT's, who all said that I will just have to live with my acute/chronic sinusitis after the ab's failed (they did mention surgery to open up the ostia, but my ostia weren't plugged and it would not get to the root cause of my condition).  After three months of aggressive and fairly non-standard therapy (Sporanox, body nutrient level monitoring and equalization, vitamin C, lentinen, echinacea, etc.), my health has vastly improved to where I was two years ago, before my health greatly deteriorated. Of course, skeptics would say that maybe if I did nothing I would have improved anyway, but that view is stretching things quite far because of the experience of the three ENT's I saw who said that I'd just have to \\\"live with it\\\".  I'm confident I will reach what one could call a total \\\"cure\\\".  The anti-fungal program I undertook was one necessary step in that direction because of my overuse of ab's for the last four years.  (Note:  for those having sinus problems, may I suggest the book by Dr. Ivker I mention above. Be sure to get the revised edition.)    Dr. Ivker started off having chronic and severe sinus problems, and his visits to several ENT's totally floored him when they said \\\"you'll just have to live with it\\\".  He spent several years trying everything - standard and non-standard, until he was essentially cured of chronic sinusitis.  He now shares his approach in his book and I can honestly say that I am on the road to recovery following some parts of it.  His one recommendation to take a systemic anti-fungal at the beginning of treatment IF you have a history of anti-biotic overuse has been proven to him time and time again in his own practice.  I'm sure if I commented to him of the hard-core beliefs of the anti- \\\"yeast hypothesis\\\" posters that he would have definite things to say, such as, \\\"it's worked wonders for me in almost two thousand cases\\\", to put it mildly. I also would not be surprised if he would say that they are the ones violating their moral obligations to help the patient.  Maybe those doctors who are reading this who have a practice and are confronted by a patient having symptoms that could be due to the \\\"hypothetical yeast overgrowth\\\" (e.g., they fit some of the profiles the pro-yeast people have identified), should consider anti-fungal therapy IF all other avenues have been exhausted.  Remember, theory and practice are two different things - you cannot have one without the other, they are synergistic.  If a doctor does something non-standard yet produces noticeable symptomatic relief in over a thousand of his patients, shouldn't you at least sit up and take notice? Maybe you ought to trust what he says and begin hypothesizing why it works instead of why it shouldn't work.  I'm afraid a lot of doctors have become so enamored with \\\"scientific correctness\\\" that they are ignoring the patients they have sworn to help.  You have to do both;  both have to be balanced, which we don't see from some of the posters to this group.  There comes a point when you just have to use a little common sense, and maybe an empirical approach (such as trying a good systemic anti-fungal such as Sporanox) after having exhausted all the other avenues.  I was one of those who the traditional medical establishment was not able to help, so I did the natural thing:  I went to a couple of doctor's who are (somewhat) outside this establishment, and as a result I have found significant relief.  Would it not be better if the traditional medical establishment can set up some kind of mechanism where any doctor, without fear of being sued or having his license pulled, can try experimental and unproven (beyond a doubt) therapies for his/her patients that finally reach the point where all the accepted therapies are ineffective?  I'd like to hear a doctor tell me: \\\"well, I've tried all the therapies that are approved and accepted in this country, and since they clearly don't work for you, I now have the authority to use experimental, unproven techniques that seem to have helped others.  I can't promise anything, and there are some risks.  You will have to sign something saying you understand the experimental and possibly risky nature of these unproven therapies, and I'll have to register your case at the State Board.\\\"  Anyway, if my ENT had suggested this to me, I would've jumped on this pronto instead of going to one of those doctors who, for either altruistic reasons, or for greed, is practicing these alternative therapies with much risk to him/her (risk meaning losing their license) and possibly to the patient.  Such a mechanism would keep control in the more mainstream medicine, and also provide valuable data that would essentially be free.  It also would be morally and ethically better than the current system by showing the compassion of the medical community to the patient - that it's doing everything it can within reason to help the patient.  It is the lack of such a mechanism that is leading large numbers of people to try alternative therapies, some of which seem to work (like my case), and others of which will never work at all (true quackery).

Traditionally, they have used pictures, words, demonstrations,     music and dance to communicate imagery.  However, expressing     complex notions such as God and infinity or a seemingly well     defined concept such as a flower can present challenges which far     exceed their technical skills.      The explosive use of computers as visualization and expression     tools has compounded this problem.  In hypermedia, multimedia and     virtual reality systems vast amounts of information confront the     observer or participant.  Wading through a multitude of     simultaneous images and sounds in possibly unfamiliar     representions, a confounded user asks: \\\"What does it all mean?\\\"      Since image construction, transmission, reception, decipherment and     ultimate understanding are complex tasks, strongly influenced by     physiology, education and culture; and, since electronic media     radically amplify each processing step, then we, as electronic     communicators, must determine the fundamental paradigms for     composing imagery for understanding.      Therefore, the purpose of this conference is to bring together a     breadth of disciplines, including, but not limited to, the     physical, biological and computational sciences, technology, art,     psychology, philosophy, and education, in order to define and     discuss the issues essential to image understanding within the     computer graphics context.

Status: R  Redwood City, CA (API) -- A tense stand-off entered its third week today as authorities reported no progress in negotiations with charismatic cult leader Steve Jobs.  Negotiators are uncertain of the situation inside the compound, but some reports suggest that half of the hundreds of followers inside have been terminated.  Others claim to be staying of their own free will, but Jobs' persuasive manner makes this hard to confirm.  In conversations with authorities, Jobs has given conflicting information on how heavily prepared the group is for war with the industry.  At times, he has claimed to \\\"have hardware which will blow anything else away\\\", while more recently he claims they have stopped manufacturing their own.  Agents from the ATF (Apple-Taligent Forces) believe that the group is equipped with serious hardware, including 486-caliber pieces and possibly Canon equipment.  The siege has attracted a variety of spectators, from the curious to other cultists.  Some have offered to intercede in negotiations, including a young man who will identify himself only as \\\"Bill\\\" and claims to be the \\\"MS-iah\\\".  Former members of the cult, some only recently deprogrammed, speak hesitantly of their former lives, including being forced to work 20-hour days, and subsisting on Jolt and Twinkies.  There were frequent lectures in which they were indoctrinated into a theory of \\\"interpersonal computing\\\" which rejects traditional roles.  Late-night vigils on Chesapeake Drive are taking their toll on federal marshals.  Loud rock and roll, mostly Talking Heads, blares throughout the night.  Some fear that Jobs will fulfill his own apocalyptic prophecies, a worry reinforced when the loudspeakers carry Jobs' own speeches -- typically beginning with a chilling \\\"I want to welcome you to the 'Next World' \\\".\",\" Doesn't this just mean that the government might not approve something for use by other government agencies.

As for 'Cyprus', In 1974, Turkiye  stepped into Cyprus to preserve the lives of the Turkish population  there. This is nothing but a simple historical fact. Unfortunately,  the intervention was too late at least for some of the victims. Mass  graves containing numerous bodies of women and children already showed  what fate had been planned for a peaceful minority.  The problems in Cyprus have their origin in decades of  oppression of the Turkish population by the Greek Cypriot  officials and their violation of the co-founder status of  the Turks set out in the constitution. The coup d'etat  engineered by Greece in 1974 to execute a final solution  to the Turkish problem was the savage blow that invoked  Turkiye's intervention. Turkiye intervened reluctantly and  only as a last resort after exhausting all other avenues  consulting with Britain and Greece as the other two signatories  to the treaty to protect the integrity of Cyprus. There simply  was not any expansionist motivation in the Turkish action at  all. This is in dramatic contrast to the Greek motivation which  was openly expansionist, stated as 'Enosis,' union with Greece.  Since the creation of independent Cyprus in 1960, the Turkish  population, although smaller, legally had status as the co-founder of the republic with the Greek population.  The Greek Cypriots, with the support of 'Enosis'-minded Greeks in the mainland, have consistently ignored that status and portrayed the Island as a Greek island with a minority population of Turks. The Turks of Cyprus are not a minority in a Greek Republic and they found the only way they could show that was to assert their  autonomy in a separate republic.  Turkiye is not satisfied with the status quo. She would rather not be involved with the island. But, given the dismal record of brutal Greek oppression of the Turkish population in Cyprus, she simply cannot leave the fate of the island's Turks in the hands of the Greeks until the Turkish side is satisfied with whatever accord the two communities finally reach to guarantee that history will not repeat itself to rob Turkish Cypriots of their rights, liberties and their very lives.

The answers I received at that time allowed me to get a prototype of my project working. However, during this process I have come up with new problems.  1) There seems to be a limit of 255 characters for a DDE Topic string. Is this inherent in all DDE systems or just peculiar to MSACCESS or VB?  2) It is easy to query an Access database from VB using the DDE SQL command, (provided the above limitation is overcome by using short field and table names) but how is one meant to update a database?    a) A DDE SQL UPDATE command does not seem to work.    b) Initiating an Access macro using a DDE Execute command from VB cannot       be used because when the macro requests information from VB using a       second DDE channel the programs dead lock until time- outs occur.       (The VB to Access channel has to close before the Access to VB channel       is initiated, I guess.)    c) Access does not allow VB to DDE POKE the information.      The way I eventually managed to update a database was by sending key-    strokes from VB to Access using the SendKeys command. This technique has    the problem that Access cannot be minimised and it must always be in a    state ready to respond to the sequence of key-strokes VB sends.  Are all the above statements correct or have I made incorrect assumptions? Are there any better work arounds to the above?

That is reality, I agree.    \",\" You assume this because you believe in a designing creator, and you observe our ability to procreate...   .... But then you observe our ability to modify fertility through intelligence & experiment, and draw no similar conclusions about God designing us for scientific inquiry & the use of the technology that it produces.  How is it that one ability is \\\"obviously from God\\\", and the other not?   I want to know the truth, and hold the Truth as the most basic of all ethical values, because correct moral judgement relies on knowing the truth, not vice versa. Moralities that assert that assent to a belief is a moral choice, and not compelled by evidence inevitably cut off the limb they sit upon. Falsification of evidence, conscious and unconscious, follows corrupting both the intellect and the heart.   If there is a God, he has nothing to fear from truth.

There are situations in which boys and girls are apart from members of the *opposite* sex (due to social convention or whatever) and thus are safe (in at least some sense). These same situations don't (necessarily) protect the children from abuse by members of the *same* sex.

Why would any private sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that was KNOWN to be at least partially compromised? (Key escrows in this instance)  Why would any private sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that had not been properly evaluated?  (i.e. algorythm not publically released) The answer seems obvious to me, they wouldn't.  There is other hardware out there not compromised.  DES as an example (triple DES as a better one.)  My suspicion is that the prices will drop dramatically on these non clipper systems.  If not we're in trouble.  Given that the Clinton administration is not entirely stupid (although we'd like to think so) I cannot believe that they have failed to realize this. They know their initiative will fail, much as crippled DES was never taken seriously.  The only way their moves can work is by coercion.  You know little about politics if you don't realize that this is just a first step in the next move, it makes NO sense otherwise.  The next move, banning or SEVERLY crippling crypto not using the \\\"Clipper\\\" system is easily justified \\\"Why would anyone want other encryption unless they were trying to subvert the government?  We've provided you with a very secure alternative so use it or go to jail/be fined/whatever.\\\" How can you reconcile the administrations self proclaimed purpose of providing law enforcement with access to encrypted data without making the clipper system the only crypto available in the U.S... ?  You simply can't, and the administration knows it.  Anyone who wanted to keep the govt. out of their hair, be it for drug dealing or whatever, would just buy still available non-clipper systems.  Don't sell our crafty Clinton types short, they can't be THAT stupid. Either banning non clipper crypto is the next answer or the administrations collective I.Q. is about that of a potato.  Why do you think AT&T jumped on so fast?  They know it's going to be big, and NOT because it's better.  Right on the face of it, noone will buy the stuff that doesn't have to.  AT&T must know this too, THINK MAN, why the hell would they jump the gun?   I really wonder.  To wit:  The letter I just sent to Clinton:  The White House Office of the Press Secretary c/o: Presidential Comment Line (fax) (202) 456-2461   April 17, 1993   Sir and/or Madam:     I must object most strongly to the administrations evolving position on encryption and cryptography.  I am shocked at the Clinton regimes increasing lean towards a authoritarian approach with regard to privacy and freedom from government oversight in day to day life.   It is apparent to me that those who drafted the \\\"Clipper Chip Proposal\\\" (which is, incidentally, gaining notoriety as the \\\"Big Brother Proposal\\\") are either incredibly ignorant or very sly indeed.  Anyone knowledgeable in the nuances of cryptographic development and research must understand that a key step in the development of a new algorithm, especially one destined for standardization, is the full disclosure of the algorithm to the private and academic sectors.  The proper evaluation of an algorithm dep      ends on careful scrutiny by these sectors, and only such scrutiny can provide true public confidence in the security of the algorithm.  The assumption that a new algorithm will be accepted based on assurances from \\\"experts\\\" without full disclosure is plain ignorance.   In addition, the assumption that an algorithm will be marketable over other technology, such as DES, when it is characterized by key escrow is lunacy.  It seems an easy step in the logic chain that probable consumers will prefer to purchase equipment not crippled by government key escrow, no matter how \\\"tamper proof\\\" the key escrows might be.   I cannot believe that even the least educated policy maker would have failed to realize these flaws.  I can only assume then that the drafters of the \\\"Clipper Chip Proposal\\\" knew very well the difficulties of selling a crippled system to the private sector.  The only way this proposal makes any sense, or has any chance of succeeding is in coercion.  Even the language of the proposal makes it painfully clear that the next logical step is the outlawing of other encryption devices and hardware that do not uti      lize the \\\"Big Brother Chip.\\\"   Unfortunately the public at large is not educated enough on the issue to realize what they are losing.  I expect the Big Brother proposal to encounter little resistance from the American people who you will have so efficiently duped once again with pretty words like \\\"harmony,\\\" \\\"right to encryption,\\\" and \\\"voluntary.\\\"   It mortifies me that the phrase that seems to be used more and more often to characterize the Clinton administration is \\\"I can't believe it's happening here.\\\"  More startling is a question a colleague of mine posed and the realization that everyday it becomes more and more relevant; \\\"When is the Reichstag fire planned for?\\\"           Most Concerned,         [Signature]       Shaen Logan Bernhardt I uni@acs.bu.edu \",\": >The Selective Service Registration should be abolished.

The historical evidence proves that during  the period of 1914 to 1920, the Armenian Government ordered, incited,  assisted and participated in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people  because of race, religion and national origin. Armenians perpetrated acts  of sabotage, destroyed telephone cables, blew up bridges, blocked passes,  set up ambushes, attacked security stations and small Turkish outposts  behind the Ottoman Army lines on the one hand, and on the other ruthlessly  attacked Turkish and Kurdish villages, slaughtering the Turkish population  indiscriminately, women, children, old and young alike. Innocent  Muslims were one by one cruelly bayonetted to death, or massacred with  axes and swords, or else shut up in mosques or in schools and then burnt alive as can be seen below.  Widespread Armenian massacres of innocent Muslims took place in regions  of Van, Kars, Sivas, Erzurum, Bitlis, Erzincan, Mus, Diyarbakir and  Maras. The Ottoman Army, while fighting to prevent the Russian invasion, also had to deal with Armenian genocide squads who cowardly hit from  behind. The Armenian genocide of the Muslims spread to all parts of  Eastern Anatolia. Starting from late 1914, Armenians committed  widespread massacres and genocide in Eastern Anatolia, because the arena was left to the Armenians. Almost every Turkish town and village from  Erzincan up to Azerbaidjan suffered large scale massacres and genocide  by Armenians and the Turkish genocide has been documented by Armenian,  Russian, American, British, Ottoman, German, Austrian and French  journalists and officers who observed the first genocide of this century committed by the blood-thirsty Armenian genocide squads.  The Ottoman Army, liberating Trabzon, Bayburt, Erzincan, Erzurum,  Kars and other regions from the Russians, saw that the cities and their  villages had been destroyed and burnt, people slaughtered, massacred. The massacres conducted by Armenians, which became a black stain for humanity, shocked and disgusted even the Russian, British, German, Austrian, French and American authorities.  Almost every Ottoman document is related to Armenian massacres and  cruelties. The inhuman treatment, cruelties, atrocities, genocide by  Armenian genocide squads perpetrated against innocent Moslem Turkish  and Kurdish people, are sufficiently reflected in historical documents.  Even today over seventy-five years later, the terrifying screams of  the victims of these cruelties can be heard.

Don't they deserve justice, too?   Why is your criticism ALWAYS directed against Israel, but never against the Arab states, even when they are so much more guilty of the accusations you make?  Is it because you now call yourself a Palestinean?    This is why the \\\"land-for-peace\\\" formula is so foolish.  Land-for-land or peace-for-peace seems much more just, except that it would cost the Arabs something and so is not under consideration.    Let's not forget that about half of Israel's population are refugees from Arab countries.  Somehow, THEIR land now being occupied by Arab states and THEIR homes now being lived-in by Arab people are not included in any negotiations.  Is this your prescription for peace?    Again, you've somehow managed to overlook the fact that the Arab states are much more restrictive on these points.  In fact, the officially Judenrein policies of almost all of the Arab states makes them resemble Nazi Germany chillingly closely.   There are many states in which Christians can live happily, many which have official religions and Christian majorities and Christian-based laws.  There are some 2 dozen Arab and Islamic states.  There is only 1 (one) Jewish state.  Do you have a problem with this?  Is this one Jewish state too many?  There are others who might agree with you, you know.    Have you just arrived on tpm recently???  Again, the supporters of the Arab and Islamic camps are frequently and massively guilty of \\\"emotional, infantile outbursts\\\" which have weakened their positions dramatically.  Somehow, your criticisms are very one-sided and simple-minded.   P.S. How's the Fund coming along? \",\" Looking at [1] we find that during Roman times \\\"Tyre vied with Sidon for first place in the intellectual life of the period\\\"; that Tyre was the seat of a Christian bishop, eventually with 14 dioceses under it; that \\\"the most magnificent church of its kind in all Phoenecia\\\" was the basilica built in Tyre ca. 314; that Tyre was well known for its exports of glassware, wine, white marble, and dyed cloth; that Tyre, along with other seaports, \\\"provided outlets for South Arabian, Indian and even Chinese trade\\\"; that Tyre had to accomodate its growing population by \\\"following a perpendicular, rather than horizontal, line of growth\\\" (because it was running out of land to build on); that Tyre established colonies of its own.  None of this sounds like a \\\"small fishing village\\\" by any stretch of the imagination.  Centuries later, under the Abbasids, Tyre had \\\"opulent and flourishing bazaars\\\" and buildings of 5-6 stories.  During this period, Tyre was \\\"noted for its export of sugar, beads, and, as of old, glassware.\\\" During the Crusades, Tyre was the second-most flourishing city held by Franks.  (There is a lot more, but I got tired of writing.)  In [2] we read the following description of modern Lebanon: \\\"other *major cities* in Lebanon include Tripoli, Sidon, Tyre, Baalbek and Zahlah.\\\"  [my emphasis]  This source also discusses the impact of the Lebanese Civil War, and the Israeli military actions (1978, 1982) on the trading ports of Tyre and Sidon.  It notes that after Israel's withdrawel in 1984, \\\"Tyre appeared to enjoy a revival of its local economy.\\\"  If Tyre is such an insignificant little fishing village at present, why is it always called a city (or, above, a \\\"major city\\\")?  Why does it show up on all the maps?   When population figures for cities in Lebanon are given, why is Tyre always one of the cities on the list (even if the list is only a dozen cities long)?  [1] Philip K. Hitti, _Lebanon in History: From the earliest times to the present_, NY, St. Martins, 1967.    [2] Federal Research Division, Library of Congress, _Lebanon: a country study_, edited by Thomas Collelo, 1989.   A one-horse town?  Sounds like a lot of work for one horse. (Anyway, Tyre is connected by roads to the mainland.  They may even use cars these days. :-)   The 1991 Encyclopedia Britannica says \\\"Pop. (1982 est.) 23,000.\\\"   Most other references give figures in the 14-17 thousand range. (One atlas gives the population of Tyre as 60,000; the same source give comparatively high figures for Sidon and Beirut, also, so I doubt that it is a typo.  Perhaps these were figures for the cities and their surrounding areas.)  I don't doubt that the population of Tyre has fluctuated over the last few decades.  In particular, the 1982 Israeli military action hurt Tyre quite a bit.      I thought you were talking about times that Tyre was destroyed. Don't most, if not all, of these apply not just to Tyre but to  the other cities in the area?  Sidon, for example?  Can you make a case for Tyre having been singled out?   They had a good deal of autonomy under the Seleucids. From [2]: Tyre \\\"receiv[ed] the rights [of autonomy] from Antiochus Ephiphanes and from 125 BC onward enjoy[ed] complete autonomy. She started a large series of coins, occasionally in gold ...\\\"  The descriptions of Tyre under the Romans don't seem to fit your characterization, either.  And under the Abbasids it seems to have been allowed to flourish.  I still think you are stretching when you try to describe Tyre as having been nothing but a small fishing village.   A Christian apologist whose standards of scholarship are quite low. He happens to quote the same source you quote (Nina Jidejian, _Tyre through the Ages_, Beirut, Dar El-Mashreq Publishers, 1969). The same sentence, in fact.  He defends the fulfillment of the prophecy using the same argument you are using, an argument that I haven't seen in print anywhere else, which is why I jumped to the conclusion that you were quoting Josh.  (I tried to find the Jidejian book, but it isn't listed in Books in Print.  Can you tell me more about it? Her descriptions are so much at odds with everything else I've read; I'm curious to know why.)\",\" Carrying a pistol, loaded or unloaded, in the glove compartment, is considered carrying a concealed weapon in Colorado and is illegal without a concealed weapons permit.  Unless the law has been changed recently, carrying a weapon openly is legal in Colorado but concealing it is illegal. I read a newspaper account last year where police stopped a car on a traffic infraction and observed a .357 magnum revolver sitting on the seat.  The driver could not be cited for possessing or carrying the weapon because it was not concealed.  The article stated that if the gun had been discovered in the glove box, it would have been considered a crime. \",\"The parable of the Prodigal Son is not about who is and who isn't an immoral person. It is about grace and the love of God. Most people would agree with that concerning the younger son. The elder son is simply a negative example of the some thing. He thinks that he must earn his father's love, that he has earned it, that he is entitled to it. His father tells him that he is on the wrong track. He has always been loved--for the same reason his brother has always been: he is his father's son.  We are too performance oriented to consistently get the point. We are willing to be saved by grace, but once we are Christians we want to go back to earning and deserving.  \\\"Are you so foolish?

TRANSLATION   The Vedas deal mainly with the subject of the three modes of material nature. O Arjuna, become transcendental to these three modes. Be free from all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and safety, and be established in the self.                                    PURPORT   All material activities involve actions and reactions in the three modes of material nature. They are meant for fruitive results, which cause bondage in the material world. The Vedas deal mostly with fruitive activities to gradually elevate the general public from the field of sense gratification to a position on the transcendental plane. Arjuna, as a student and friend of Lord Krsna, is advised to raise himself to the transcendental position of Vedanta philosophy where, in the beginning, there is brahma-jijnasa, or questions on the supreme transcendence. All the living entities who are in the material world are struggling very hard for existence. For them the Lord, after creation of the material world, gave the Vedic wisdom advising how to live and get rid of the material entanglement. When the activities for sense gratification, namely the karma-kanda chapter, are finished, then the chance for spiritual realization is offered in the form of the Upanisads, which are part of different Vedas, as the Bhagavad-gita is a part of the fifth Veda, namely the Mahabharata. The Upanisads mark the beginning of transcendental life.   As long as the material body exists, there are actions and reactions in the material modes. One has to learn tolerance in the face of dualities such as happiness and distress, or cold and warmth, and by tolerating such dualities become free from anxieties regarding gain and loss. This transcendental position is achieved in full Krsna consciousness when one is fully dependent on the good will of Krsna.  Bhagavad-Gita As It is Books of A.C.

If you were using a IIfx, that might be another story.  Make sure there is only one terminator in the cabling and it must be at the end.  Some boxes have internal terminators; some can be switched out and others are socketted.  These count.  If the box with internal terminations cannot be put on the end to terminate the cabling, they have to be disabled, ie, switched out or pulled out of their sockets.  If you have 2 boxes with internal terminations, the terminations in one box has to be disabled...., etc.  I am sure that this has been covered by the \\\"experts\\\".  My experience with SCSI boxes that connect to the Mac indicates that they must have some software package for the Mac to 'talk' to them.  My PLI MO drive and Sharp scanner has one for each.

This week's MacWeek reports that Apple is probably planning a drop in August.  My guess is that it may come sooner if Apple decides to  change the price structure upon release of the multimedia units this summer.  Your price looks pretty good at about $50 more then I payed for mine last month.  I would have rather waited for one of the new machines this sommer (like the Cyclone) but the resale value of my IIci would have not been squat by then.  Thus, financing forced me to purchase now.  I'm happy with the machine and won't feel betrayed at all when Apple cuts the price to less then $1000 next week (heh).  Bottome line:  If the C650 does what you want, buy it.  If you wait until the Cylcones come out for a price break then you might as well wait for the PowerPCs to come out for another price break and then the units which follow them.  You may save some money but you've lost a lot of time when you could have been using the computer.  Face it, Apple's prices are going to be in a continuous state of flux.  At least they aren't going to try raising them again (grin).\",\"I recently published a new privacy-protecting off-line electronic cash system as a technical report at CWI. Being a PhD-student at David Chaum's cryptography-group, our group has a long history in research in the field of privacy-protecting cash systems.  The report is called CS-R9323.ps.Z, contains 77 pages, and can be retrieved from  ftp.cwi.nl   (192.16.184.180)  from the directory pub/CWIreports/AA. The postscript-file is suitable for 300dpi laserprinters.  ==================================================================== ABSTRACT (from coverpage): We present a new off-line electronic cash system based on a problem, called the representation problem, of which little use has been made in literature thus far. Our system is the first to be based entirely on discrete logarithms.  Using the representation problem as a basic concept, some techniques are introduced that enable us to construct protocols for withdrawal and payment that do not use the cut and choose methodology of earlier systems. As a consequence, our cash system is much more efficient in both computation and communication complexity than any such system proposed previously.    Another important aspect of our system concerns its provability. Contrary to previously proposed systems, its correctness can be mathematically proven to a very great extent. Specifically, if we make one plausible assumption concerning a single hash-function, the ability to break the system seems to imply that one can break the Diffie-Hellman problem.     Our system offers a number of extensions that are hard to achieve in previously known systems. In our opinion the most interesting of these is that the entire cash system (including all the extensions) can be incorporated in a setting based on wallets with observers, which has the important advantage that double-spending can be prevented in the first place, rather than detecting the identity of a double-spender after the fact. In particular, it can be incorporated even under the most stringent requirements conceivable about the privacy of the user, which seems to be impossible to do with previously proposed systems. Another benefit of our system is that framing attempts by a bank have negligible probability of success (independent of computing power) by a simple mechanism from within the system, which is something that previous solutions lack entirely. Furthermore, the basic cash system can be extended to checks, multi-show cash and divisibility, while retaining its computational efficiency. ====================================================================  Cryptographers are challenged to try to break this system!    I made a particular effort to keep the report as self-contained as possible.  Nevertheless, if you have any questions, please e-mail to me and I will try to reply as good as I can. Any comments are also welcome!

A reference station with a very exactly known position computes the errors in the incoming GPS signals.  These errors are due to several factors including atmospheric distortion, SA (Selective Availability) time dithering, etc.  The reference unit contains complex computational  equipment to \\\"back out\\\" the errors in its position (since it knows where it is already).  It then transmits these corrections on a  broadcast which is available to any number of relatively local receivers.  If the receivers are nearby (<300km) and are using the same satellites as the reference unit, the errors should be very similar for the reference unit and the receiver unit.  Thus, the receiver unit may apply the corrections calculated by the reference unit.  The US Coast Guard is currently (as far as I know) installing a series of coastline transmitters for differential GPS.  These stations will use existing radio towers.  I believe the frequency is to be approximately 305 kHz.  There are many other private corporations offering DGPS signals on different frequencies.  For example, PinPoint ((310)-618-7076) offers correction signals and receiver units using an FM broadcast system which has stations all across the US.  The correction codes are usually transmitted using the RTCM 104 format. Advertised accuracies espouse 1 to 5 meter errors.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------- John P. Baker                   | My opinions are my own.

In the case of chemical agents, I seriously doubt that you would even know that someone had set up a lab until after the weapons had been used.    Part of the trouble with the chemical-weapons ban treaty between the US and the USSR is that many of the precursors to chemical weapons such as GB and Sarin, etc., is that they have very valid commercial uses, and  it is very easy to divert those precursors to chemical weapons manufacture without anyone knowing about it.   \",\" Probably within 50 years, it will be possible to disassemble and re-assemble our bodies at the molecular level.

The threat is not from bad genes, but bad memes!  Memes are the basic units of culture, as opposed to genes which are the units of genetics.

The claim against the ADL is that it illegally obtained and disseminated information that was gathered by state and/or federal agencies in the course of their standard interaction with citizens such as myself.  By that I refer to things such as: address and phone number, vehicle registration and license information, photographs, etc.   You should ask the ADL, if you want an authoritative answer.  My guess is that they collected information on anyone who did or might engage in political criticism of Israel.  I further believe that they did this as agents of the Israeli government, or at least in agreement with them. At least some of the information collected by the ADL was passed on to Israeli officials.  In some cases it was used to influence, or attempt to influence, people's access to jobs or public forums.  These matters will be brought out as the court case unfolds, since California law entitles people to compensation if such actions can be proven.  As my previous posting shows, California law entitles people to compensation even in the absence of any specific consequences -- just for the further dissemination of certain types of private information about them.\",\" The P&G pots are very good.

Of course, I said \\\"No problem\\\" and went to work. Unfortunately, the DRDOS refuses to recognize the hard drive during  installation, even though I am still able to boot off of the hard drive using the old DOS.  After openning it up I discovered it was using an 8-bit  Seagate SCSI controller on a ST-157N SCSI 40Mbtye drive.  I then booted  with DRDOS 6.0 off of the floppy a second time and ran fdisk to see if  I could access the drive.

I inject on my legs and gut, and prefer the gut.  I can stick it in at a 90 degree angle, and barely feel it.  I'm not fat, just have a little gut.  My legs however, are muscular, and I have to pinch to get anything, and then I inject at about a 45 degree angle,and it still hurts.  The rate of absorbtion differs for subcutaneous and   muscular injections however--so if it's a daily thing it would be best not to switch places every day to keep consistencey.  Although some suggest switch legs or sides of the stomach for each shot, to prevent  irritation.  When you clean the spot off with an alcohol prep,  wait for it to dry somewhat, or you may get the alcohol in the puncture, and of course, that doesn't feel good.  A way to prevent irratation is to mark the spot that you injected.  A good way to do this is use a little round bandage and put it over the  spot.  This helps prevent you from injecting in the same spot, and spacing the sites out accuartely (about 1 1/2 \\\" apart.)  This is from experience, so I hope it'll help you.

That's possibly a good way to judge the use of the Bible in teaching Jewish morality today, but it hardly seems fair to claim that this highly-interpreted version is what was \\\"enlightened for its times\\\".

It was created to meet to the daily research needs of scientists  conducting climate investigations using satellite data and remote sensing techniques.        Intuitive Graphic Interface   Sphinx features an interactive interface with pop-up menus and  point-and-click dialog boxes which makes image processing and analysis simple and fast.  This accessible menuing enables you to build attractive image  layouts quickly while also providing you the flexibility of returning to the main menu to conduct other image analysis and processing operations.        Image Format Compatibility   Using smart read/write functions, Sphinx allows you to easily open and save image files in a variety of formats using bit, integer or real data values.  Sphinx also reads and writes the common TIFF and GIF formats as well as compresses and decompresses image formats to save disk space.        Image Analysis & Processing   For image and pixel analysis, the Sphinx package includes an assortment of processing tools that perform useful statistical and  mathematical filtering operations, such as Fourier transforms, convolution  product or principal component analyses. An interactive interpreter for both algebraic equations and images allows the user to manipulate and combine individual data channels interactively. Standard FORTRAN notation is used for formula entry and for trig onometric and transcendental functions.        Satellite Spectra & Orbit Analysis   Sphinx possesses functions to simulate satellite signal sensitivity for various meteorological satellites (e.g., GOES, METEOSAT, NOAA, Spot etc.). The simulations are conducted for a selection of standard atmospheric and surface conditions and instrument spectral bands. A geometry model computes the solar zenith angles, warping, orbit simulation, and 3-D image projection.        Easy External Program Interfacing   Sphinx allows users the flexibility to integrate externally developed software algorithms for processing and converting satellite observations.  Sphinx exports and imports image files and image parameters to external programs using special interface functions.        Quick Quality Presentation   Sphinx rapidly displays, manipulates, and enhances high-resolution multispectral images and color tables.  Using six 8-bit 1024x1024 image planes and one graphics plane, the package conveniently combines color images, graphics and text to generate sharp digital images for articles and reports. Sphinx's 2-D and 3-D graphics editor provides complete flexibility for modifying and integrating vector graphics and analysis plots with images, such as  histograms and radial graphs.  The package supplies color and gray scale output for standard inkjet and laser printers.  Other Capabilities Sphinx also performs image animation, external  graphics importing, mosaic fitting... what else?        Software Support & Development    Sphinx was developed at the Laboratoire d'Optique Atmospherique (LOA)  of the Universite de Lille, France. The package has received critical feedback and support from scientists at the French national laboratory, Centre National de Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), and the French space agency, Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES). At LOA, Sphinx undergoes continued refinement and development to meet changing research needs and advances in computer technology.  The package, which features on-line help, is supported by an Internet address   sphinx@loasil.citilille.fr through which questions can be answered and  version updates provided without delay.        Performance Tested    CNES has selected Sphinx to analyze and process the satellite data  collected during the upcoming ADEOS/POLDER satellite mission.  Today, the Sphinx package is in use at the NASA - Goddard Space Flight Center and is widely used in many French laboratories, including the Centre de Recherche en Physique de l'Environnement, Ecole Normale Superieure , Laboratoire d' Etudes et de Recherches en Teledetection Spatiale,  Laboratoire  de Meteorologie Dynamique.

If you are caught with one it will be confiscated on the spot and will not be returned until after you appear in court and pay your fine.  The fine for having a radar detector accessible in a motor vehicle (even if it is not on) is $250.00.  Sorry, tourist, ignorance of the law is no excuse - they will get you too!  It used to be that the only way the law could be enforced was for an officer to actually see the radar detector.  Not any more!  Many law enforcement agencies are now using radar detector detectors.  Right, a super sensitive receiver that is capable of picking up RF from the radar detector itself.  My first reaction was \\\"no way!\\\"  But, guess again, these little buggers really work and the police are writing citations right and left for people using radar detectors.  One news story quoted an officer as saying that he had found the radar detector in all of the cars he stopped except one, and he could never figure out where it was - but he knew it was there.  This tends to make one assume there are few false arrest.  Now, before I get flamed, please understand that I do drive at or near the speed limit.  I do not need a radar detector to keep me from getting a speeding ticket.  But, I do like to know when my speed is being clocked or a speed trap is functioning.  My radar detector now stays locked in my trunk when I am in Virginia (which is what they want - and yes, what the law says, and I intend to obey the law!) and is only used in states where it is legal.  For my fellow hams, I am not a microwave person - my mind only works in the HF spectrum between 10 and 80 meters.  Microwave enlightment may be necessary.  So, the questions are -   What do the radar detector detectors actually detect?   Would additional shielding/grounding/bypassing shield stray RF generated by   a radar detector, or is the RF actually being emitted by the detector   antenna?   Are any brands \\\"quieter\\\" than others?\",\"Philadelphia at Chicago:  Teams tied for 1st after Sunday      Dick Redding battled Chet Brewer in the first game of a dramatic four game series.  One Friday, one Saturday, and a good-old Sunday doubleheader. \\\"What could be better,\\\" declared Ernie Banks.  Perhaps the fact that the Cubs are challenging?      \\\"It's pitching, it's always been pitching that we've lacked,\\\" announced Ryne Sandberg.  \\\"If we can get by Brewer, then beat Carlton, Alexander, or Bunning - preferrably 2 of the last three - we'll know we might be able to win.      \\\"Lord, I hope we pull it off.\\\"      The Phils scored once in the top of the first; Richie Ashburn singled, Pete Rose followed with a hit, sending Ashburn around second.  Kiki Cuyler cut the ball off in left center, and threw a bullet in to Ernie Banks, who threw to Ron Santo to get Ashburn at third.  Rose went to second on the play.      Christobel Torrienti lifted a long fly to center, moving Pete Rose to third.  Schmidt was walked - the Cubs were absolutely refusing to let him beat them.  Both Torrienti and Schmidt will likely draw 130-150 walks this year.  Chuck Klein is starting to hit very well, and he lashed a double into a gap in right-center.  \\\"Cool Papa\\\" Bell's speed allowed him to cut the ball off and prevent Schmidt from scoring.  Nellie Fox was walked, and Bob Boone grounded out to second, ending the threat.        \\\"Teams are starting to realize that you don't have to pitch to Schmidt or Torrienti, and that is lowering their run total.  It puts a lot of pressure on Klein and Dick Allen (who platoons with Chuck Klein and occasionally spells Rose at first), and it's a credit to the Phillies that they've been able to sustain their pace.  The picthers have slumped at times.\\\"  So came the analysis from Frank Chance.      The Cubs got that run back when Bell bunted for a hit, Thomas' grounder moved him to second, and - after Sandberg made out - Billy Williams singled home a run.  In the sixth, Ron Santo launched a two-run homer to make it 3-1.  Dick Redding got in trouble in the eighth, as Schmidt singled and Klein singled him to third.  Ed Reulbach entered to face Fox, but Dick Allen popped out of the dugout to hit.  Allen doubled to right, but luckily for the Cubs, Williams had moved to left and Andre Dawson had been inserted for defense. He fired a bullet to home plate to keep Klein at third.  Lance Parrish, hitting for Boone, was walked, and Bruce Sutter entered.  Larry Bowa grounded into a 1-2-3 double play, but Ed Delahanty walked as a pinch-hitter.  Desiring a strikeout, since Ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quick Trillo pinch-running at third, Chance brought in Lee Smith, who induced a pop-up to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder, ending the inning.  The Cubs took the win, 3-2, moving a game behind the Phillies.      Steve Carlton was called upon to battle 3-Finger Brown Saturday.  To get another righthander in the lineup, Ron Santo moved to first and Bill Madlock played third.  Unfortunately, Brown allowed six doubles, and the Cub bullpen was worn down even more, as the Cubs tried to maintain a lead against Lefty.  Madlock, batting sixth, had knocked two doubles of his own, driving home four runs.  Gabby Hartnett hit two home runs, and Cuyler added another, and the score was 8-6, Cubs after six innings.  The Phillie bullpen had more troubles in the bottom of the eighth, as the Cubs grabbed 3 more runs to ice an 11-7 triumph.      Sunday's twin bill saw Cool Papa Bell gather seven straight hits at one point, including a rare outside-the-park home run in the second game, off Robin Roberts.  Grover Alexander of the Phils took the first contest, 4-2, but the Cubs captured the second one 5-4, with Waddell gaining the win.  Bruce Sutter tossed two innings for the save, though he allowed one run in the eighth.  The Cardinals stood half a game behind these co-leaders, and would conclude their series with the Expos on Monday. -------------------------------------------------------------------      Montreal at St. Louis(August 3-6): 3-way tie for 1st      Dennis Martinez is on a roll, and he continued it versus John Tudor Friday. The Expos have a wide variety of hitters, and - while they aren't among the all-time greats, they are getting the job done.  After winning their first first two games, they suddenly found themselves only 2 1/2 games out of first in this wacky season.      Martinez triumphed 5-3 on Friday, and WIlliams outdueled Dizzy Dean 3-2 Saturday.  However, the Cardinals refused to give up, winning 6-2 on Sunday. The Cards captured Monday's game, too, as Steve Carlton outdueled Steve Rogers 3-2.  \\\"We're really good against ground ball pitchers because of our team speed,\\\" remarked Lou Brock.  \\\"I don't see why we can't win this division.\\\"      The Phillies and Cubs may have some reasons for them.  Two-thirds of the way through the season, there is a 3-way tie for first. -------------------------------------------------------------------      New York at Pittsburgh(August 3-6): 3 straight 3-2 wins for Bucs, now 2 back - but in 4th!     \\\"When your team is in a slump like we are, the worst thing is to play in a pitcher's park like this,\\\" spoke Gil Hodges before the series.  Keith Hernandez added that \\\"their defense takes away quite a few runs per year, and it must be giving them an extra 6-7 wins.\\\"  The Pirates have made only 26 errors all season, 6 ahead of the second place Dodgers.  Error totals tend to be around 50 for the best defensive All-Time teams.      Rube Foster defeated Sid Fernandez 5-2 Friday, and Candelaria outshone Seaver 3-2 Saturday, in a game featuring some outstanding defense.  When Nolan Ryan and two relivers 6-hit the Mets in another 3-2 win Sunday, the Pirates could once again look forward to a victory getting them back to the .500 mark.  They had been unable to several times in the past month.  Bert Blyleven met Dwight Gooden in the afternoon game.  Both pitchers possessed fantastic stuff, and the only runs scored through eight innings were on home runs - a solo shot by Rusty Staub of the Mets and a two-run blast by Ralph Kiner for the Pirates.  The Mets' Darryl Strawberry singled home a run in the top of the ninth off Jesse Orosco, working his second inning, after Mookie Wilson pinch-ran for Gary Carter at second.  With one out and a runner on first, Lee Mazilli was sent in to pinch-hit.  The Pirates countered with Kent Tekulve, placing him in the fifth spot in the order and putting Barry Bonds in left field as the ninth place hitter.  Tekulve induced a groundout forcing Strawberry at second.  He slid hard into Honus Wagner, preventing the Pirates from turning their fifth double play of the afternoon.  Tekulve allowed a hit, but Clemente threw Mazilli out at third from near the right field line, ending the inning.  Tug McGraw relieved Randy Myers, who entered to pitch the eighth, and got one out before Bonds launched a rocket to deep center, running through the stop sign at third to score an inside-the-park homer to win.  The Pirates had scored an improbable 3 straight 3-2 wins, and had moved to within 2 games of first place, with seven weeks to go. ------------------------------------------------------------------      San Francisco at Boswaukta(August 3-5):      Another Sunday doubleheader appeared on the schedule, as the Giants managed to close the gap on the other teams thanks to some starting pitching that just wouldn't tire.  In fact, reported manager John McGraw, \\\"once this rough part of the schedule is over, maybe as early as this coming week, we may shift to a 4-man rotation again for a little while.\\\"      Juan Marichal continued his hot pitching Friday, beating Lew Burdette and the Braves 4-1.  Willie Mays had all four r.b.i.s on 3 hits.  Rick Reuschel faced Joe Niekro Saturday in a slugfest.  The Braves' park had been a homer haven, but this took the cake, as the Giants won a seesaw affair 16-13. Willie Mays had three homers, Willie McCovey, Eddie Matthews, and Don Baylor had two, and Hank Aaron, Ernie Lombardi, Biz Mackey, and Mel Ott had one each.  The Braves had collected 149 home runs going into Sunday's doubleheader, putting them on a pace for 223, which would be 4 short of the National League record.  They were still a tad behind the '61 Yankees' pace. They had allowed over 120, though.  Vida Blue actually got the win after retiring 2 batters in the fifth.  He allowed only a run in the sixth, but faltered in the seventh.  Joe McGinnity earned the save.      In the doubleheader, the Braves' Hoyt Wilhelm failed to hold a lead in the first game, but Hank Aaron homered off Bill Foster in the eighth as the Braves won, 4-3.  The Giants took the second game, however, by a 6-2 score. The homer by Aaron was a magical #150 by the Braves; however, they fell to three game below .500, making a comeback extremely unlikely. -------------------------------------------------------------------      San Diego at Cincinnati(Aug. 3-5):  Randy Jones faced Ewell Blackwell in the first of this 3-game series, and the Padres felt rather good.  With Don Mattingly straining his back in the last Cleveland game, the trade looked even better.  McGriff's batting average was even rising.  Of course, the bench was very poor, and Joe Gordon was only adequate in the outfield, but these were minor problems, since the pitching was holding up.      Jones pitched a good game Friday, and won 6-3.  McGriff launched two home runs.  Mel Harder earned a win with the help of Mark Davis and Ray Narleski Saturday; 5-4 was the final score.  Tom Candiotti battled Satchel Paige to a 3-3 tie through eight innings before departing.  The game was scoreless for 4 more innings until the thirteenth.  Paige had departed after 10, and John Franco hurled a scoreless inning.  Tom Browning was working his second scoreless inning, when Dave Winfield doubled with one out and Joe Gordon was pitched around.  Thurm Munson doubled both runners home, and the Padres gamed a 5-3 win.  The three-game sweep had pulled the Giants into a tie with the Reds.  Though the Reds denied it, the highly emotional series with the Dodgers may have taken too much out of them. -------------------------------------------------------------------      Brookangeles at Houston(August 3-5):      Another series capped off by a weekend doubleheader took place in the wide open plains of the Astrodome.  The Astros sent Joe Niekro to the hill in the first game, opposite Don Drysdale.  \\\"Normally,\\\" Drysdale remarked, \\\"I would be challenging hitter by being ready to throw at them.  I can't afford to with this team, though; we have to get our own runners going; we can't Davis will get decked once.\\\"      The fact that Glenn Davis leads the team in homers with six (!) is primarily why he would be decked, but it should be understood that his current pace would give him nine for the season.  The hitting on this team is a little better, but the power is all doubles and triples.  Still, Carl Furillo is the main reason no Astro home runs were hit over the weekend, as he threw two runners out trying for inside-the-park homers.  For those unaware of the nastness of the Astros' park, they have a 23-foot high gray wall all around the outfield; balls must be hit into the seats to be home runs.  The foul poles are 355 feet from home plate, but the alleys are 400 feet away, with center field at 420 feet.  \\\"It's as if some three-year-old threw a tantrum and told his playmates: 'If I can't hit home runs, nobody will hit home runs',\\\" remarked Roy Campanella.      The Dodgers stole five bases Friday, but the Astros decided to revitalize the Baltimore chopping that had failed 6 weeks before; for tonight, anyway, Davis, Jim Wynn, and Jose Cruz did not have to mess with their swings, according to the manager.  After Poles and Willie Wells reached base via the Baltimore chop, Drysdale decked Jose Cruz with a pitch.  He responded with a two-run double, but Wynn - playing first for Davis - popped up, and the Astros didn't score any more in that inning.  They did score 3 in the fourth to erase a 3-2 deficit, and the Astros wound up winning 6-4.  They threatened to do even better the next game, as Tommy John would be their opponent. Walt Alston met privately with the starters at 6 A.M. before the game.      \\\"I think I know how we can beat the Baltimore Chop,\\\" he explained.      \\\"How can we do that,\\\" Pee Wee Reese wondered.      \\\"They're going to be beating the ball down, so we've got to be ready to throw on the run.  Steve will start at first to dig balls out of the dirt, but I want all of you to practice your barehanded picks and throws.  We'll go with a shallow infield almost the whole time.\\\"      The plan almost worked.  Mike Scott allowed only two runs through eight innings, but the Astros got three; two of them scored when Bill Doran pushed a bunt into the outfield in the fourth with runners on second and third.  3-2 Astros was the final, with Dave Smith earning another save.  The Dodgers scored a victory in the first game of the twin bill Sunday, as Nolan Ryan walked five, three of whom scored in a 4-1 Dodger win.  Fernando Valenzuela lost the second game 4-2 to Don Sutton, however, as the Dodgers' thirteen stolen bases in the series proved to not be enough.      \\\"We're mostly a power team,\\\" remarked Ron Cey.  \\\"Jackie and, when he plays, Maury Wills are our only real speed demons, though a couple other plays can do it now and then.  We're sunk in a place like the Astrodome.  I guess that's why they're so successful there.\\\"  Indeed, it seems that basestealing teams give them the most trouble in the dome.  The 'Stros swiped 12 bases in 16 attempts, giving them 230 on the season.

He is trying to explain the Immaculate Conception and the Assumption of Mary.]   If this is true than why in the Genesis story is God concerned that Adam and Eve might also eat from the Tree of Life and live forever and be like gods?  Eating of the tree of life would not take away the effects of eating of the Tree of Knowledge.  Is there any reason to assume that they had already eaten of the Tree of Life and so had already attained to eternal life?  If so, what basis is there for saying that this was taken away from them?  To me the wages of sin are a spiritual death, not necessarily a physical death.  I can attest to the truth of this interpretation from my own experience. I suspect that many others could attest to this as well.   Peace Will  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- \",\"{Send follow ups to comp.sys.mac.advocacy.

CPUs Comparison List As a general rule of thumb Motorola chips are faster than Intel chips at the  same frequency {030/25 ~= 386/33; 040/25 ~= 486dx/50}, but Intel has chips at  higher frequencies than Motorola, so this evens out.  The Macintosh Bible 4th  ed. supports the comparisons between Intel and Motorola chips for the 68020  and above.  <=80186    ~ 68000 {16-bit vs 16/24/32-bit chip [data path/address  lines/data & address registers].  The 4MB limit on the 68000 Macs brings it  down to the 80186 and lower chips, otherwise it would compare to the 80286.}  286        ~ 68020 {hardware segmenting vs. 68020's 32-bit ALU and these chips  come have no usable built-in MMU unlike their successors [80386, 68030].

The use of the hardware segmenting and their 16-bit nature put the 286 between  the 60000 and 68030 in features and the LC's 16-bit data path strenghthens the  286 ~ 68020 comparison.}  386       ~ 68030 {Two 32-bit chips with MMUs, and protected memory.  A/UX 3.0  is at present the only Mac OS to use the 68030's protected memory feature for  apps.  System 7.x uses this feature to protect a RAM disk created by the  Memory control panel but this is supported only on Powerbooks and Quadras.

These chips may flounder against the cheaper (PC Week 3/08/93;  4/12/93; PC Mag 4/27/93:110), earlier released (PC Week 12/7/92; MacWeek  12/14/92; PC Week 2/08/93), less leat producing {160 degrees F for Pentium (PC Mag 4/27/93:118)}, and partly ported to PowerPC chips.}   PowerPC   = PowerPC {This CPU line is planned to run programs from DOS,  Windows 3.x, OS/2 and Mac OS on top of PowerOpen-A/UX 4.0 [UNIX] and later  Pink [Taligent OS] by using emulators or, if necessary, the OSes themselves in  a 'shell' a.k. how SoftPC or OS/2 does DOS.}  Hardware  {In an effort to remove the 'reconfiguring the system almost every time you  add something' requirement for add-in cards, drivers, video, and operating  systems in the IBM world, Intel, Microsoft and 12 other hardware and software  developers are working out 'plug and play' standards (PC Week 03/08/93).} Color Support/Display  Mac: 30.24 MHz Pixel Clock standard.  All present Macs support the use of  32-bit color through 32-bit color QuickDraw in ROM.  32-bit color QuickDraw  allows an almost transparent capability to display and edit X-bit images in Y- bit color and retain ALL the colors of Y-bit color [Where X and Y  independently are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32] regardless of monitor resolution {63  dpi [12\\\" color] to 94 dpi [PaletteBook]} or monitor type {including  autosynchronous VGA, MCGA and SVGA monitors with ranges including 66.7 hz  vertically and 35 kHz horizontally and only a hardware video adaptor (MacUser  Aug 1992: 158-176).  Older machines that supported color {SE/30, II, IIX, and  IIcx} had only 8-bit color in ROM and needed a software patch to use 32-bit  color (MacUser Special 1993:28-29).   To keep costs down and speed up most Macs have only 8 or 16 bit display  capability built-in, but most of those can be expanded to display 24-bit  color.    Presently QuickDraw is optimized for 72 dpi display; QuickDraw QX  will change this. In addition, QuickDraw allows, in Macs with a NuBus slot, more then one  monitor to be used in any combination, from two monitors showing the same  thing to multiple monitors acting as one large large monitor with any degree  of overlap of the pictures. VRAM: Video RAM.  Standard for present non-PowerBook Mac's handling of   built-in video {from a 32-bit color palette}. VRAM provided runs a 8-bit  color 640x480 display; expandable to 16-bit color or a 8-bit 832x624 display.  Sound output:  Standard in all Macs since the 128K.  Stereo sound became   standard with the SE/30.  IBM:  Even though PCs have ROM BIOS definitions of how the operating system  interacts with the video hardware (Nan Zou), the use of drivers bypassing  BIOS, video hareware inconsitancies {see Super VGA below} and nonstanderzation of clone BIOS have left resolution of video display hardware, OS and program  interaction up to the OS and video hardware in question (Faisal Nameer  Jawdat). In addition, IBM and clone makers never bothered to provide a  standard hardware mechanism for software to determine what display mode is  actually present (Matt Healy) nor a standardized screen-drawing toolbox {like  Mac's QD}. As a result the OS must be very well written to detect some modes,  especially with some third party cards or to use them consitantly {At present  things are so dependent on the interaction of the program, OS, print driver  and monitor card that editing 32-bit pictures regardless of color mode, OS,  and monitor type/card combination as one can do on the Mac is impossible with  an IBM.  For example, one cannot edit a 32-bit color picture done on a OS/2  486 with a SVGA monitor on a 386 with VGA {18-bit color palette} and DOS 5.0  and still have ALL the colors one started out with}. Later IBM machines will have integrated graphics accelerators, faster  processors, and modular upgradeability and may have built-in sound cards, CD  ROM, and Ethernet (PC Week 12/14/92).   MDA: Monocrome Display Adapter  original character-mapped video mode, no graphics, 80x25 text. CGA: Color Graphics Array  320x200 4 colors or 640x200 b/w, 16 color palette, bad for the eyes. EGA:  Enhanced Graphics Array  640x350 16 colors from 64 color palette [and some lower res]; some versions   could run at 256 colors, bearable on the eyes. VGA:  Video Graphics Array*  320x200 at 256 colors, 640x480 at 16 colors, and some others, these two are   the most commonly used.  All modes have a 256K CLUT, from a   18 to 24-bit {IBM} or a 32-bit {Mac} color palette.  25.175 MHz Pixel Clock  (Mel Martinez).  Monitors use analog input, incompatible with TTL signals  from EGA/CGA etc.  MCGA:  Multi-Color Graphics Array*  subset of VGA that provides all the features of MDA & CGA, but lacks some EGA   and VGA modes, like VGA 640x480x16 (Dictionary of Computer Terms-DCT).    Common on the initial PS/1 implementation from IBM and some PS/2 Models. SVGA:  Super VGA*  This is not a standard in the way the others were, but instead was a 'catch   all' category for a group of video cards.  As such, with each manufacturer   using their own implementation scheme, SVGA was chaos with people debating  as to what is SVGA and what is not.  In an effort to make SVGA more of a   standard VESA was established and is used in the newer units, but things  are still a mess.  Video is either 512K [~1990] or 1M [today], resolution  of 800x600 and 1024x768 at 16 and 256 colors are common, newer ones [since   1990] have the Sierra HiColor RAMDAC, giving 15-bit 32,768 colors at 800x600,   some of the very newer ones [~6/92] can do 24 bits per pixel [usually   at 640x480].  Speedwise, too much variation, some very slow [Western Digital   Paradise based, for example], some very fast [S3 86C911 based, for example],   some are so-so [like Tseng ET4000, a very popular chipset].  Some limiting   factors overcome by 40MHz VL Bus & 386's linear address mapping were:   8.33 MHz ISA bus, AT architecture where the CPU looks at the card through a   64K \\\"window\\\", etc. Other non-SVGA standards:  8514/a:  IBM's own standard, interlacing graphics accelerator with graphics functions   like linedraw, polygon fill, etc. in hardware. Some clone implementations   from ATI are the fastest video available today, though some clone models do   not have interlacing.  TMS34010/34020: high end graphics co-processors, usually >$1000, some  do 24-bit, speeds up vector-oriented graphics like CAD. XGA:  eXtended Graphics Array  newer and faster than 8514/a, only available for MCA bus-based PS/2s, clones   are coming out soon.  Emulates VGA, EGA, and CGA (DCT).  Max resolution at   1024x768x8b, same as 8514/a, also some 16 bpp modes. XGA-2  Accelerates graphics functions up to 20 times faster than standard VGA in  Windows and OS/2, including line draws, bit and pixel-block transfers, area  fills, masking and X/Y addressing. Has an intelligent way to detect and co-  exist with other XGA-2 cards, so multiple desktops like on the Mac may not be   far away.  Since this is an architecture, its resolution and color depth   isn't fixed {IBM implements only 16-bit [65,536] color, while other   companies can have 24-bit color through IBM technical licenses}. Refresh   rates up to 75 Hz, ensures flicker free, rock solid images to reduce visual   discomfort, and is VGA compatible. Up to 1280x1024 on OS/2. *some monitor types usable by Mac-See Mac section above for specific details.  Expansion Both Mac & IBM SCSI: only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM.  Allows the use of any device: hard drive, printer, scanner, Nubus card   expansion {Mac Plus only}, some monitors, and CD-ROM.    Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal   terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port   {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and at the   end.  Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}.  SCSI-1:  7 devices per SCSI controller.  8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}  and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfers.  Difference is due to SCSI-1 software  drivers.  \\\"Fast SCSI-1\\\" is a misname for 8-bit SCSI-2 in SCSI-1 mode  {see SCSI-2 for details}. SCSI-2: 10 devices per SCSI controller in SCSI-2 mode.  SCSI-2 is fully  SCSI-1 compliant and 8-bit SCSI-2 tends to be implemented as a very fast  SCSI-1 since it does not require the different controller interfaces in    hardware and software that 16 and 32-bit SCSI-2 do.  Transfer speeds are  4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and  15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst {32-bit/wide and fast}.  Since 8-bit SCSI-2 can  use SCSI-1 software drivers and hardware at 8-bit SCSI-2 speeds and as such  is limited to 7 devices sometimes it is mistakenly called \\\"fast SCSI-1\\\".   16-bit fast SCSI-2 requires a SCSI-2 software driver and SCSI-2 electronics  but can still use the SCSI-1 ports.  Wide 16-bit and 32-bit SCSI-2 require a  different SCSI port, electronics, and software driver from SCSI-1 {Which  makes them more expensive than other SCSI interfaces}. Mac SCSI: asynchronous SCSI-1 built-in standard since the Plus.  Even though   Apple developed some specifications for SCSI controlers, the OS SCSI Manager  needs to be rewritten to take full advantage of the features of both SCSI  interfaces.  As a result present SCSI-2 Macs use 8-bit SCSI-2 as a fast   asynchronous SCSI-1.  Presently Quadras are the only Macs with a SCSI-2  controller chip built-in (Digital Review, Oct 21, 1991 v8 n33 p8(1))   though they lack some other parts of the hardware, like the wide SCSI-2 port   interface.  Since other Macs require a NuBus card to use SCSI-2, older NuBus   Macs had a bottleneck due to the speed of the NuBus and CPU.  Rumor-some  Cyclone Macs {June} will come with a wide & fast SCSI-2 port standard   and have a rewritten OS SCSI manager. IBM SCSI:  SCSI-1 is not too wide spread yet, generally not bundled with   systems, except as add-on {EISA and VESA Local Bus adapters avalable}.  Like the Mac, 8-bit SCSI-2 is used as a very fast SCSI-1 by most controllers  out there.  Unlike the Mac, IBM has no exact SCSI controller specifications  which results in added incompatibilities for SCSI.  Mac Memory expansion: with a few exceptions the Mac has used non-parity 30-pin   8-bit SIMM memory expansion since the Plus.  While 32-pin 9-bit parity SIMMs  could be used in these Macs, only special IIcis could make use of the parity   feature {By convension both SIMM types are called 32-pin SIMMs}.  The IIfx   used 64-pin parity SIMMs.  The LC III, C610/650 and Q800 all use a new   72-pin SIMM that is accessable by 32-bits at a time and is used in IBMs.  The Mac does a complete memory check at startup by writing/reading every  memory location; if something is seriously wrong with a SIMM the Mac will  not boot and give a sound chord indicating what the problem is.  Since Macs made before Feb 15, 1993 managed memory baced on data path, SIMMs   had to be installed in pairs {16-bit} or in sets of 4 {32-bit}.  The Centris   650 and Quadra 800 eliminate this with a new memory management setup that   allows memory to be upgraded one SIMM at a time.  If the SIMMs are the same   size are used then the memory is 'interleaved' across the two SIMMs resulting   in a 10-15% performance boost on RAM access (MacWorld Apr 93: 108-109). Printers, ADBs, and modems: built-in interfaces standard. Monitor interface and sound input: built-in on most present macs.  PDS: Available in SE & all present non-Powerbook Macs. 16-bit {SE,   Portable, LC, LC II, Classic line} and 32-bit.  Operates at CPU's MHz.    Maximum through put: data path in bytes*CPU's MHz {Q700/900 & C650:   4 * 25Mhz = 100MB/s; Q800 & Q950: 4 * 33Mhz = 132MB/s}. Standardized with  the LC and 040 bus designs.  With an adapter one NuBus card can be used in   IIsi and C610.  Problem: some cards have timing dependency which slows   through put down. NuBus Mac II: 32-bit, 10 MHz bus clock, 1-to-1 transaction/bus cycle ratio,  and contiguous, hand-shake transactions at ~10-20MB/s; theoretical peak:  40MB/s.  Built-in on all Modular Macs except the LC series, C610, and   Performa 400.  The SE/30 could be adapted to use this and there was even a   Mac Plus SCSI NuBus.  Supports every possible expansion from CPU to Ethernet   to DMA. NuBus 90: NuBus Mac II back compatable. 20MHz bus clock, avg throughput:  ~30MB/s; burst mode: 80MB/s.  Future card designs will be 7\\\" instead of the   old 12\\\". QuickRing:  A peer-to-peer bus used in parallel with NuBus 90.  Apple's   VLBus - \\\"Architecture is identical to that of VLBus\\\" (Byte 10/92:128).  Burst mode: 350MB/s (Byte 10/92:128). In development. CPU expansion: handled either through the PDS or the NuBus.  Unlike PDS,    Nubus CPU cards {example-Radius Rocket} allow use of multiple processors at   the same time.  This is like having two or more Macs in the same box able to   dual task or joinly process depending on the card or software involved {Each   NuBus card needs its own memory but most NuBus cards of this type come with   8MB RAM SIMMs on the card standard}.  IBM Memory expansion:  parity SIMMs, non-parity SIMMs {some newer models do a Mac- like SIMM memory check}, or a dozen or so different types of memory boards.  HD Interfaces {limited to hard drives by design or lack of development}:  MFM:  Modified Frequency Modulation, RLL:  Run Length Limited  only used with smaller [\\u00b2 60mb] hard drives. IDE:  Integrated Device Electronics   Asynchronous {~5MB/s max} and synchronous {8.3MB/s max} transfer.  currently the most common standard, and is mainly used for medium sized   drives. Can have more than one hard drive.  ESDI:  Enhanced Small Device Interface  ~1.25MB/s throughput. generally considered better interface than SCSI-1 in  many ways but not common enough for practical consideration.  Outside of  hard drives, device choices are very limited compared to SCSI-1.   BUS interfaces {New 'plug and play' ISA and EISA compatable cards may have problems working  with old cards (InfoWorld; PC Week 03/08/93; Vaporware 4/93).} ISA  8 & 16-bit interfaces common. Has 24-bit data path limit {which produces a  16MB limit for which there are software workarounds} (PC Mag 4/27/93:105).  1.5 MB/s (Byte 3/93:132).  Uses edge-triggered interrupts, can't share them,  hence comes the IRQ conflict.  Limited busmastering capabilities, some cards  aren't bandwidth limited {COM  ports, LPT ports, game ports, MIDI card, etc.}  while others are {video and disk controllers}.  Dominant factor, but it's  showing its age.  Most ISA motherboard designs are 16-bit  (PC World Feb 1993: 144-5)}.   MCA {Micro Channel}  IBM's 16 and 32-bit bus; \\\"allows use of more than one CPU in a computer\\\"   (DCT) and anything can talk to anything, as fast as the two components   involved can handle it. Never took off because it was incompatible with ISA   and EISA.  Planned to be bus interface of IBM PowerPC 601 (Carl Jabido). EISA {NuBus Mac II is closest Mac equivalent}  32-bit, 8.33 MHz, burst mode: 33MB/s.  It also has the ability to   self-configure cards like MCA and allows multiple bus masters, sharable   interrupt and DMA channels and multiple CPU use. VESA Local Bus: VLB {Sometimes mistakenly refereed to as PDS}  Local Bus standard. Runs at CPU clock rate,  Burst modes: ~130 MB/s{32-bit}  250 MB/s{64-bit} (Byte 10/92:128).  Limited to three slots but allows bus   mastering and will coexist with either ISA or EISA. Consitered ideal for   video and disk I/O.  DELL has filled a claim that this violates one of  their patents (Mel Martinez). QuickRing: Apple's faster {350 MB/s burst} version of VLB architecture  (Byte 10/92:132).  Might show up in some IBM and PowerPC machines  (Byte 10/92:132-133). In development. PCI  Intel's version of Local Bus that is intended to totally replace   ISA/EISA/MCA.  In development.  OSes {assumes full installation [print drivers, fonts, Multifinder, etc.] and multiple application use.} Mac 512K to 1MB of OS and hardware commands have been put into ROM.  This allows  Apple to control its machine by putting key hooks for the Mac OS {QuickDraw,  menu commands, print, mouse, SCSI & sound drivers, etc} in ROM, which require  clone makers to use the ROM chip or read ROM on to disks {Which requires  access to the proper Mac since different Macs have slightly different ROM  chips; Plus vs Classic for example.}  With key hooks for the OS support  interface in ROM, programers do not have to worry as much whether the disk OS  has the necessary hardware commands or that those commands are consitant and  therefore can write smaller programs.  This also allows Apple greater control  over hardware-software standards and that the disk OS can be smaller and, with  some of the tookbox command code in ROM, with lower RAM requirements then a  totally disk based OS.  Macs use Masked ROM which is as fast as DRAM (Jon  Wtte). 6.0.7: Single program usage base requirements: 1 MB and DD floppy,   cooperatively-multitasking base requirements: 2MB and HD floppy.    Features a GUI, cooperative-multitasker [MultiFinder], standard program   interface, & standard stereo sound support [snd]. Network receiving part of   AppleShare software is bundled with the OS. Has a 8MB RAM barrier and is a   24-bit OS. Some third party products allow 14MB of Virtual Memory as long as   real RAM is below 8MB. 6.0.8: 6.0.7 with 7.0.0 print drivers. 6.0.8L:  System 6 for some Macs that require System 7.0.X. 7.0.X: Base requirements: 2MB, 40MB Hard Drive, and 68000; De-facto standard   to run all features well: 4MB, 80MB Hard Drive, and 68030 {lowest present   non-portable Mac configuration}.  Using up to 10.08MB {This is EVERYTHING on  system disks} of hard disk space this has 6.0.7 features plus program linking   within and between computers [IAC], built-in server capabilities {Filesharing   can be used by older OSes using AppleShare Client software and can be   accessed by 10 macs max; 4-5 is more speed practical, IAC requires 7.X},   Virtual Memory in machines with MMU{1.6 times real RAM for least noticeable   IIsi speed degradation}, drag and drop, QuickTime & built-in TrueType   support.  Supports sound input [AIFF and snd formats] for most present   machines.  Can access up to 1GB of true RAM and 4GB of virtual memory and is   both a 24 and 32-bit OS.  To use real RAM beyond 8MB it must be in 32-bit   mode and on older machines requires the 'Mode 32' extension.  Apple's last   'free' OS. 7.1.0: 7.0.1 with WorldScript support, speedier, and less RAM usage than   7.0.dot (MacWeek 8/24/92; 9/14/92; PC Week 9/7/92). To run in 32-bit mode   on older machines it requires the 'Mode 32' or '32-Bit Enabler' extension.   Marks the start of Apple saling its Mac OS instead of allowing free upgrades  {Bundled with new machines, $49 for 7.0.X upgrades, $99 otherwise}.  [The installer has a bug that when upgrading it may keep some old system   fonts from the previous system inside the system file.  This can eat up any   RAM benefits and cause other problems.  Apple itself recommends removing all   fonts from the system file.] A/UX 3.0 [UNIX]: Needs 8MB RAM {12-20MB suggested}, 160MB hard drive, and   a 68030 or 68040 equivalent to run.  This 32-bit preemptive multitasking OS   is large due to being UNIX and needing translators between it and the Mac   ROMs.  Price: $709. Note: sound output was supported in OSes 3.2 to 6.0.5 by many formats  including the following:  snd, WAVE, ASND, FSSD, QSSN, SMSD, SOUN, dc2d, and  DCFL.  In 6.0.7 the sound manager was optimized for the sound standards 'snd'  and AIFF which causes some playback problems for the old formats, though most  still play.  IBM  Machiness have little GUI code, data, and hooks present in hardware for  programmers to work with, so most of the coding must be provided in the OS.   Since hard disks were slow the disk OS code is read into RAM.  In addition,  what little ROM code there is also read into RAM {a process called Shadow ROM}   This results in faster implementation since RAM is faster then PROMS or  EPROMS.  Having most of the OS code on disk has the advantage of being able to  better optimize the code given a certain piece or collection of hardware which  is harder with a ROM based system due to the 'patches' needed.  In addition it  reduces the need for and size of patches if a major revision of the hardware  support is needed. Side note:  The FTC charged that MicroSoft formed a OS trust by not providing  all feature documentation for its OSes to developers outside MS and designing  its Windows and DOS apps to fail under OS/2 (\\\"Undocumented Windows\\\") and  \\\"There is deliberate code in [Windows] NT Beta which causes the install to  abort if OS/2 Boot Manager is present\\\" (Gregory Hicks, Info-IBMPC Digest V92  #201).  Due to a conflict of intrest by one member the vote of the FTC  judicial council for action against Microsoft was a tie which resulted in no  action.  Rumors-the FTC will presue the matter, likely to the point of  choosing a new member or whole new council.  In addition the government has  turned down Microsoft's copyright of \\\"Windows\\\" which would allow it to charge  a fee for developers using their hooks (PC Week 03/08/93). MicroSoft OSes DOS 5.0: Has a 640K barrier with its own memory manager, a 1 MB barrier   with third party memory managers.  This 16-bit OS requires that each program   must provide its own print drivers and be 16-bit {Programs need to be DOS   Protected Mode Interface (DPMI) compliant and running on a 386dx [32-bit   Protected Mode] to break these barriers}.  Contains the GUI shell present in  DOS 4.0. DOS 6.0: DOS 5.0 with the added features of a built-in file compresion, disk   defragmenter, debugger for the CONFIG.SYS file. It needs a $80 module for   networking {Cost: $50 through 5/93, after that $129.99}   (Byte April 1993:44-46). DOS 7.0: 32-bit DOS. In development (PC Week 04/05/93). Window 3.0: Runs on top of DOS.  Breaks 640K and 1M barriers but still has to   deal with DOS file structure.  Base requirements: 1MB, floppy and 286; to  run well 2MB, hard drive, 386sx and fast display adapter {> 8-bit}.  Has the  equivalent of Mac's QD called Windows GDI [Graphics Device Interface].  This does not have a consistent application interface {Like early Mac  programs  (1984-1985)} nor a very large program base {compared to DOS} and  still tends to slow the machine down (Info-IBMPC Digest V92 #186) with speed  is more dependent on the display adapter then on the CPU (Bill Coleman).  Window programs tend to be disk and memory hogs compared to their DOS  counterparts (Byte April 1993:98-108). Window 3.1: A faster version of Window 3.0 with better memory managment. Base   requirements 1 MB, hard drive and a 286 ;to run well 2MB, hard drive, 386sx.   Apple plans to release its print drivers for this (PC Week 12/28/92). Windows for Workgroups:  To run well: 4MB RAM and 386dx (PC World Feb/93:160).    Intermediary between Win 3.1 and Windows NT.  It is basically Windows 3.1   with built-in peer to peer networking support. Windows NT:  Beta release takes about 50MB of disk space [including the   swap file], and 12MB RAM {Betas are notorious for RAM usage especially in   the interaction between debuging code and program compliers, hence the   reports of 24MB requirements}.  Released version supposed to need 8MB RAM   but, Gates himself now recommends 16MB RAM (PC Week 04/15/92).  This 32-bit OS has Protected mode multitasking, multithreading, symmetric   multiprocessing, a recoverable file system, and 32-bit GDI.  Has built in  networking that is OSF DCE compliant and can handle up to 4GB of RAM.  Even  though some people see a July 4 release date (InfoWorld Nov 16/92), rumor  is that the final version will not be available before Oct 1993  (InfoWorld May 25/92; July 6/92; Vaporware 07/92; 08/92) or 4th quarter 1993  (PC Week 09/28/92). Windows upgrades will be $295, otherwise $495  (PC Week 04/15/92; 03/15/93). Other OSes PC-DOS 6.0: IBM's version of DOS 6.0.  It runs Windows much faster then DOS   6.0 due to faster file I/O and video handling (InfoWorld Feb 1, 93). DR DOS 6.0: same as DOS 5.0 with some extras {like built-in data compression}   and memory management enhancements. Still has 640K/1MB barrier.  A later   version {Novell DOS} of this may use a version of the Mac finder and Apple   file management system (PC Week 12/14/92; InfoWorld Dec 14/92). OS/2 2.0: Unix like features and unix like requirements; 8-16MB RAM,  60MB {uses 17-33MB} hard drive, and 386dx CPU. This 32-bit multithreaded,   multitasking OS can address up to 4GB of RAM but has to use a fast swap file   to use more than 16 MB RAM on ISA systems using DMA {Direct Memory Access}.   IBM plans to use Taligent's OOPS in future versions of this   (InfoWorld Oct 26/92). AIX:  IBM's UNIX system, planned to be a subset of PowerOpen and Taligent OS. NeXTStep: GUI UNIX to provide NeXT features on IBM machines.  Beta out, final   version to be out by May 25, 1993. Solaris OS for x86: a SunSoft port.  A 32-bit OS with symmetric   multiprocessing and multithreading, built-in networking capabilities with   tools to allow remote configuring and adminstration features, and   communication package.  Client: $795,  50 users server: $1,995, 1000s users  server: $5,995.  Developer kits-software: $495, hardware: $195. Mac 7.1 [working name: Star Trek]:  Apple had System 7.0 running off Intel   Chips and is looking at making a 7.1 version available for IBM   (ComputerWorld Nov 2/92; MacWeek 03/22/93). At present this is planned to run   on top of Novell's DR DOS, require a 486 or equivalent to run and that apps   will need to be recompiled (MacWeek 03/22/93).  Viewed as Novell's answer to   Windows NT.  The complexity of PC hardware set ups is one reason for slow   progress {This seems to Apple/IBM's way of leading to the PowerPC line out in   late 1993/early 1994 and Pink OS in late 1994-early 1995.}  PowerPC Rumor-IBM will build its PowerPC 601 by late 1993 (InfoWorld June 8 & 15, 92;  MacWeek 7/13/92; PC Week 3/15/93).  It will have MicroChannel bus and XGA  video (Carl B Jabido), and will run native version AIX and Mac apps (PC Week  3/15/93); there have been no comments on compatablity of DOS or Windows apps. Apple's PowerPC 601 machine {Tesseract} is planned to be out Jan 24, 1994 and  to have MC98601/50 MHz, 4/8MB RAM, a 2.8-Mbyte floppy drive and expected to  sale near LC line prices {~$2000, down from projections of ~$3000 (MacUser  9/92:146)} (MacWeek 3/22/93). PowerOpen [A/UX 4.0]: A 32-bit preemtive multitasking OS planned to run on  PowerPCs and 68030/40 Macs (MacWeek 7/13/92).  Intel compatibility uncertain  (See Mac 7.1 above).  Planned base requirements:  68030, 8MB RAM, 80MB hard  drive (MacWeek 4/19/93). Rumor-ahead of schedule; COULD be out by mid 1993.  Rumor-this could be the OS for IBM's PowerPC 601 which is due by late 1993. Pink [Taligent OS]: Expecting delivery in 1994 (Wall Street Journal 1/12/92)   and may have some parts shipping in OS/2 and AIX in 1993 and Mac OS and   PowerOpen with the PowerPCs (MacWeek 01/25/93). Windows NT: Possible port (MacWeek 04/05/93).  See IBM OS section for details. Solaris OS: Version of this Sun Microsystems Inc UNIX OS to run on the  Power PCs in 1994 (MacWeek 04/05/93).  One of the few OSes to directly state   that it will run Windows/DOS programs.  IBM OS section for details NeXTStep: possible port see IBM OS section for details.  OS Number Crunching (Mel Park) Mac  Arithmetic is done in a consistent numerical environment {SANE or Standard  Apple Numerics Environment}. Floating point numbers are 96 bits long when an  FPU is present and 80 bits otherwise. Exceptions, such as dividing by zero or  taking the square root of a negative number, do not cause an abort but are  handled in a logically consistent manner. 1/0 produces the internal  representation for infinity (INF).  1/(1/0) produces zero. The above treatment  of 1/(1/0) occurs in an FPU-equipped machine even when SANE is bypassed and  the FPU programmed directly.  IBM  Floating point numbers are 80-bits with a hardware FPU, 64-bits when  emulated.  The way they are handled is dependent on the coding of whatever  compiler or assembler was used for a program. On older DOS complilers  exceptions could cause program aborts; 1/0 and 1/(1/0) would abort to the DOS  prompt at the point where they occured.  Most present compilers handle this  better.  Result: there is little consistent handling of numbers between DOS,  Windows and OS/2 programs nor between programs for just one OS.  Networking [Includes printing] WYSIWYG printing can be a problem with either Mac of IBM machines especially  if one sends TrueType fonts to a older style PostScript printer. Mac Hardware: Built-in LocalTalk network port and a built-in printer port.   LocalTalk has moderate speeds (230.4 Kb/s) requires special connectors for  each machine ($15 and up) and can be run off of either the printer port {to  include very old macs} or the network port {standard today}.  Built-in  Ethernet is becoming common but many older Macs require a PDS or Nubus card at  about $150-$300 for each machine.  These cards provide three connectors and  transceivers {thick, thin, and 10BaseT} for Ethernet. The Macintosh Quadra family and some Centris models includes Ethernet  interface on motherboard, with transceivers available. TokenRing has been a  network option since 1989. Software: AppleTalk {the suite of protocols} standard with Mac OS, which can  use variety of media types.  AppleShare client software included with the OS  as well and can connect to file servers such as Novell Netware, 3Com 3+Open,  Banyan Vines, DEC Pathworks, Apple's AppleShare servers, System 7 File Sharing  machines, and AFP servers running on variety of UNIX hosts.  MacTCP allows  typical TCP/IP communications (telnet, ftp, NFS, rlogin).  A later version  will have Unix X/Open Transport Interface (XTI) built-in by the end of 1993  (MacWeek 04/12/93).  Third-party software to connect to NFS servers.  DEC  Pathworks provides DECnet support.  Peer-to-peer file sharing software  built-in to System 7.1 (See OS section).  Full server software is extra.  Printing requires connection of the printer and the printer being selected in  the chooser.  Changing printers is by selecting a different name in the  chooser.  The same is true of connecting to servers. Printing bugs:  Monaco TrueType font is different then the screen bitmap font.  {QuickDraw QX is suppossed to fix this and similar problems.}  IBM   Hardware: LocalTalk [not widely used], Ethernet,  and TokenRing. Software: Novell Netware, Banyan Vines, DECNet, Windows/Work Groups, AppleTalk  protocols, and AppleShare {subset of AppleTalk}. Each of the MS-DOS networking schemes are, in general, totally incompatible  with the others. Once you have chosen one, you are pretty much locked-in to  that product line from then on.  Windows/Work Groups is a little more  forgiving and removes some of this problem.  Novell Netware is the biggest,  {~80 percent of the corporate market.} and in general is more powerful and  offers better control/management/security than AppleShare, but it's also more  complex to set up and manage.  This will change due to the use of the Mac  finder and file management system by Novell. (PC Week 12/14/92 & 12/28/92;   InfoWorld Dec 14/92; MacWeek 3/22/93) Printing {Very OS dependent} DOS: If it's a single user, then you plug the printer into the parallel port,   and don't worry about it {Tweeking may be needed with poorly written   software}.  Network Printing is not controlled by the system, but is mostly   implemented by the actual program, therefore performance varies from one   software program to the next. Windows 3.x: supports standard drivers and can do a good job of showing \\\"jobs\\\"   in the print queue, but it always lists printers as \\\"active\\\"... even if they   are not.  This becomes a problem if there are several incompatible printers   on the same net, because there's no way for software to reliably determine   which printer is active right now.  Windows for Workgroups is more Mac-like   and intelligent about this. OS/2: Mac-like; the os deals with printers, with apps making calls to the OS. Printing bugs: due to poor programing some programs for all the above OSes do  not have WYSIWYG printing.  This is the fault of the programs in question and  not that of the OS involved.  Price issue: This is very dynamic with Mac providing more build-in features  than IBM and IBM being more 'get only what you need' then Mac and price wars  by both worlds. The IBM machines' modualar nature prevents any kind of true hardware  standarization, which in turn requires OSes and programs to be very complex to  handle ALL the variation in hardware.  When one adds all the standard Mac  hardware features to an IBM {built-in input/output sound support, SCSI, PDS,   built-in monitor support, built-in networking, standard mouse interface, and  NuBus 90 in higher machines} the Mac tends to be cheaper then an equivalent  equipted IBM machine {Especially since some IBM monitors can be used with Macs  which cuts some more of the Mac's cost (MacUser Aug 1992:158-176)}.  Some prices using some of the info in this sheet and MacUser April 1993. All Macs below come with a PDS slot, VRAM, and SCSI-1 built in.  Except where  noted, monitor is extra and a built-in monitor interface is provided {no card  needed except for 24-bit color display}. IBM planned a $1,200 386SLC/25MHz model with a 60MB hard drive and color VGA  monitor {~VRAM} (MacWeek 8/17/92) {sounds like a Color Classic without SCSI-1,  sound support, built-in network support, FPU socket, built-in expansion to  16-bit color, etc}. Color Classic:  $1,389 - 030/16MHz with 16-bit data bus {~386sx/20MHz  equivalent}, 4/80, FPU socket, and built-in monitor. LCIII: $1,499 - 030/25MHz {~386dx/33MHz equivalent}, and 4/160. Centris 610: $2,899 - 68LC040/20MHz {Depending on the program ~486sx/40 or  ~'486dx2sx'/20[40]MHz equivalent}, 8/230, built-in ethernet, 300i CD-ROM, a  PDS/NuBus 90 slot and VRAM for 16-bit color. Centris 650: 040/25MHz {Depending on the program ~486dx/50 MHz or 486dx2/50  MHz equivalent} with a PDS and 3 NuBus 90 slots. $3,189 {ethernet, 8/80};  $3,559 {ethernet, 8/230}; $3,999 {ethernet, 8/230, CD-ROM, VRAM for 16-bit  color}  Bibliography notes 'Vaporware' is available in the digest/vapor directory by FTP on sumex- aim.stanford.edu [36.44.0.6] and was by Murphy Sewall {last issue: April 93.} 'Info-IBMPC Digest' back issues are available from wsmr-simtel20.army.mil in  directory PD2:<ARCHIVES.IBMPC> 'Dictionary of Computer Terms 3rd ed.'

Wouldn't it just make more sense to find some way to cut down on the cost of malpractice insurance?  And maybe that's not such a good thing.

Oh no. Don't let the AMA know about this. They have enough power as it is. Ask most Americans whether they'd like the doctors' lobby to get more powerful.   Well, yeah, tell us about the National Defense Medical Centre outside Ottawa. Theoretically it's limited to service personnel, but some studies I've heard about have suggested that about half the patients there are civilians who not only have connections but aren't \\\"urgent\\\" at all.  The problem is, in a system where hospitals' annual budgets are approved by the government, how do you keep political considerations out of medical decisions? I bet that if you're an MP or MPP, or good friends with one, you're put on any hospital's \\\"urgent\\\" care list no matter how minor your problem. Which is OK  unless you're someone who gets bumped off the list for some bigshot.   Hmm. How much difference would it make in the figure of percentage of GNP spent on health care if dentistry and optometry were included in the accounting?  Maybe Canada spends proportionately just as much on health care as we do.   So what happens if the health care systems financially collapse.

He didn't say so, but I knew he meant the OHIP. What would happen if his warning turned out to be the  truth? Would the private insurers take up the slack? They'd be under no  obligation to. Of course, they could eventually make money again, but if what you say is true, they'd be loathe to do so (and out of practice in handling  such basic services, too).   Would that it were free.

In some environments (entry level R3000 Indigo w/ 4.0.5) all windows are getting properly connected to their designated color maps, but on others (an IRIS 4D 240/GTX; also a different entry level Indigo) the color mapping is unreliable and changes behavior when I compile at different times.  The most common problem is that all non-top-level windows fail to be displayed according to their colormap.  My application starts out by creating three top-level windows; in some cases all but the first of these also fail to be displayed by their colormap.  This is spectacularly aggravating.  I would dearly appreciate   1. an explanation of the standard, RIGHT, CORRECT way to give a window   a colormap such that the Window Manager will Honor and Obey it;    2. any advice about problems that could cause my failure to get my   desired colormaps.

A not-overly critical but still useful overview of 32 alternative health therapies.]    ...the Russian engineer Semyon Kirlian and his wife Valentina during the   1950s.  Using alternating currents of high frequency to 'illuminate'   their subjects, they photographed them.  They found that if an object   was a good conductor (such as a metal) the picture showed only its   surface, while the pictures of poor conductors showed the inner   structure of the object even if it were optically opaque.  They found   too that these high frequency pictures could distinguish between dead   and living objects.  Dead ones had a constant outline whilst living ones   were subject to changes.  The object's life activity was also visible in   highly variable colour patterns.    High frequency photography has now been practised for twenty years in   the Soviet Union but only a few people in the West have taken it up   seriously.  Professor Douglas Dean in New York and Professor Philips at   Washington University in St Louis have produced Kirlian photographs and   others have been produced in Brazil, Austria and Germany.    Using Kirlian photography it is possible to show an aura around people's   fingers, notably around those of healers who are concentrating on   healing someone.  Normally, blue and white rays emanate from the fingers   but, when a subject becomes angry or excited, the aura turns red and   spotty.  The Soviets are now using Kirlian photography to diagnose   diseases which cannot be diagnosed by any other method.  They argue that   in most illnesses there is a preclinical stage during which the person   isn't actually ill but is about to be.  They claim to be able to   foretell a disease by photographing its preclinical phase.    But the most exciting phenomenon illustrated by Kirlian photography is   the phantom effect.  During high frequency photography of a leaf from   which a part had been cut, the photograph gave a complete picture of the   leaf with the removed part showing up faintly.  This is extremely   important because it backs up the experiences of psychics who can 'see'   the legs of amputees as if they were still there.  The important thing   about the Kirlian phantoms though is that the electromagnetic pattern   can't possibly represent a secondary phenomenon -- or the field would   vanish when the piece of leaf or leg vanished.  The energy grid   contained in a living object must therefore be far more significant than   the actual object itself.    [...]    Kirlian photography has shown how water mentally 'charged' by a healer   has a much richer energy field around it than ordinary water...   From the incredulous side: [MacRobert, Alan, \\\"Reality shopping; a consumer's guide to new age hokum.\\\", _Whole Earth Review_, Autumn 1986, vNON4 p4(11).  An excellent article providing common-sense guidelines for evaluating paranormal claims, and some of the author's favorite examples of hokum.]    The crank usually works in isolation from everyone else in his field of   study, making grand discoveries in his basement.  Many paranormal   movements can be traced back to such people -- Kirlian photography, for   instance.  If you pump high-voltage electricity into anything it will   emit glowing sparks, common knowledge to electrical workers and   hobbyists for a century.  It took a lone basement crank to declare that   the sparks represent some sort of spiritual aura.  In fact, Kirlian   photography was subjected to rigorous testing by physicists John O.   Pehek, Harry J. Kyler, and David L. Faust, who reported their findings   in the October 15, 1976, issue of Science.  Their conclusion: The   variations observed in Kirlian photographs are due solely to moisture on   the surface of the body and not to mysterious \\\"auras\\\" or even   necessarily to changes in mood or mental state.  Nevertheless,   television shows, magazines, and books (many by famous   parapsychologists) continue to promote Kirlian photography as proof of   the unknown. \",\": >After agreeing to terms I signed the contract and drove home in my new : >car.

While I don't know the full scope of the activities of the EFF,  from what little I've seen I think it would be better to lobby for  strong cryptography through a distinct organization.  The EFF has been associated with efforts to prevent the banning of sex and pictures newsgroups at various universities. Horror stories about the contents of those groups (e.g. exploitative pictures of possibly underaged models) have already surfaced in the press. The White House bulletin already raised the specter of drug-dealing and terrorism, which is only one step removed from the old \\\"crypto-wielding child molester\\\" argument.  An EFF lobbying effort for cryptography would be too easily derailed by the connection to child pornography and the like.  Similarly, LPF is connected with Stallman and his Gnu project.  In light of, say, the Gnu Manifesto, this means that in a public debate it stands to be labelled as \\\"communist\\\", \\\"anarchist hackers\\\", radical, etc.    I don't know about CPSR, but if it is an offshoot of Physicians for Social Responsibility (best known for Helen Caldicott and her hysterical antinuclear lobbying) then it probably also carries unwelcome political baggage.  Perhaps for practical reasons a lobbying organization for cryptography would best be formed under the umbrella of EFF or some other existing group, but its charter should then be distinct, independent, and limited to advocacy for the right to cryptography.  To reiterate Dan Bernstein's question: does any suitable organization exist?  If not, what are you going to do about it?  Having mentioned the possible dangers of unwelcome political associations, I would be remiss not to suggest something in the opposite direction: gathering the support of the NRA by emphasizing the RKBA side of the issue as well as the First-Amendment side.  \",\"I tried to e-mail you but it bounced so...

Regarding the verses relevant to nature, I prefer to use Dr. Maurice Bucaille's translations (in his book, \\\"The Bible, the Qur'an and Science\\\") for in general his translations are more literal.   Maurice Bucaille translates the portion of the verse you are addressing as   \\\"...Each one is travelling with an orbit in its own motion.\\\"  (Also note that \\\"the celestial bodies\\\" in the first translation quoted by you above is the translator's interpolation -- it is not existent in the original Arabic, which is why it is included in brackets.)

Can't believe people actually put win as first in a tie breaker......   \",\"I dreamed that the great judgment morning had dawned,      and the trumpet had blown. I dreamed that the sinners had gathered for judgment      before the white throne. Oh what weeping and wailing as the lost were told of their fate. They cried for the rock and the mountains. They prayed, but their prayers were too late. The soul that had put off salvation,  \\\"Not tonight I'll get saved by and by.  No time now to think of ....... religion,\\\"  Alas, he had found time to die. And I saw a Great White Throne.  Now, some have protest by saying that the fear of hell is not good for motivation, yet Jesus thought it was.  Paul thought it was.  Paul said,  \\\"Knowing therefore, the terror of the Lord, we persuade men.\\\"  Today, too much of our evangelism is nothing but soft soap and some of it is nothing but evangelical salesmanship.  We don't tell people anymore, that there's such a thing as sin or that there's such a place as hell.    As Jayne has said, this doesn't mean we have to come on so strong so as to hit people over the head with a baseball bat.  Yet the fact remains, there is a place called hell.  A place so fearful that God died to save us from having to experience it.  Whatever you or I, as Christians, do, we should do whatever we can to win people to the Lord, if for no other reason, to keep them from going to \\\"outer darkness.\\\".    Jesus, in Mt. 25, tells us that He didn't prepare hell for people.  He prepared it for the Devil and his angels.  No where in the Bible do I read -anywhere, that God predestined anybody to go to hell.  D.L. Moody use to say that the elect are the \\\"whosoever will\\\" and the nonelect are the \\\"whosoever wont's.\\\"  Whether or not that's theologically sound, I couldn't defend, but its practical.  Jesus said to the people of Israel, \\\"Ye would not.\\\"    Now, some of you may not be students of the Bible, heck -some of you may not be Christians.  Have you ever said to somebody, \\\"I don't believe in hell.  I believe in the religion of Jesus.\\\"  But did you know that Jesus talked more about hell than He did about heaven!  \\\"Oh I believe in the religion of the sermon on the mount.\\\"  You find hell taught by Jesus in the sermon on the mount.  You'll read that Jesus talked about the tree being cast into the fire.  Several times he talks about hell and about judgment.  In fact, over and over in the synoptics, Matthew, Mark and Luke, Jesus talks about hell.  Not Isaiah.  Not Moses.  Not John the Baptist, though he did, but Jesus, the Son of God.  The great Beloved One preached about hell because He loved people and didn't want to see them go there.  Now, if there is no hell then Jesus preached in vain.  It was our Lord Jesus, not some angry Baptist preacher, that said, \\\"where the worm never dies, and where the fire never goes out.\\\"  Jesus said that.  It was Jesus who called hell a \\\"furnace of fire.\\\"  It was Jesus that used the word, \\\"condemnation.\\\"  \\\"And this is the condemnation, that men love darkness rather than light because their deeds are evil.  Jesus said that.    How can we get it across to you that a loving, dying Jesus preached about hell?  Not only that, but He went through hell.  That's what Calgary was all about.  When my Lord was on the cross, darkness fell.  He called hell, \\\"outer darkness.\\\"    Do you have this idea that hell is a place where the gamblers are gambling over here, the drunks are getting drunk over there, and the prostitutes are prostituting their bodies over there?  That's not what hell is.  Hell's not a party.  There's no fellowship there.  He called it \\\"outer darkness.\\\"  \\\"Outer\\\" -away from God.  \\\"Darkness\\\" -God is light.    No when He was on the cross, He was made sin for you and for me.  God treated Jesus the way sinners have to be treated.  That's is a sobering thought.  As my son would say, an \\\"awesome\\\" thought.    \\\"My God, My God why hast Thou forsaken me?\\\"  Hell is isolation.  There's no fellowship in hell.  There's no friendship in hell.  There's no loving embrace in hell.  There's no hand shake in hell.  There's no word of encouragement in hell.    \\\"I thirst.\\\"  It goes much deeper than physical thirst.  Hell is eternal craving with no satisfaction.  The man whose life was lived for drugs, will crave it eternally.  The man whose life was lived for the lust of a woman's body, will crave it eternally -and not be satisfied.  One theologian has put it this way and I think it deserves merit.  What is hell?  Hell is just the kind of environment that matches the internal condition of the lost.    In a recent post, I was trying to remember the founder of The Word of Life ministries.  I've remembered his name, Jack Wertzen, and found that the illustration that I gave wasn't his.  His illustration was that he was talking to his barber and his barber's wife and daughter had just recently been saved and he was commenting about it to Jack.  \\\"They sing these songs and read Bible verses, and their praising this and that -I can't stand it!  Jack, do you think God would send me to hell?\\\"  Jack answered by saying, \\\"Yes I think he would!\\\"  Of course the barber said, \\\"What do you mean by that.\\\"  \\\"Well if you can't stand living at home with your wife and daughter who sing hymns and praises to God now, what would you do in heaven where they'll do it for eternity?  You'd be miserable.  Because God loves you, He'd put you where it would match what you really are.\\\"   It makes a man think.  The crucifixion of Jesus Christ is a fact that necessitates the eternal existence of hell because on the cross He performed an eternal act.  Don't ask me how, I don't know.  But He is God and He is the infinite/eternal and when He died, He died an infinite/eternal death.  It is by that eternal act that He purchased eternal life for the \\\"whosoever wills.\\\"  He suffered eternal judgment.    A lot of people would like to detour around hell by saying \\\"Everybody is going to be saved eventually.\\\"  -universalism.  My Bible says no, He'll separate them.  The sheep from the goats.  \\\".After you die there's a probationary period in which God prepares you for heaven.\\\"  No, my Bible says that \\\"It is appointed unto men once to die and then comes judgment.\\\"  Some of the cultist believe in annihilation.  After you die, sssswish.  Just like a mosquito you're squished out.  No, in Rev we are told that their is eternal existence in hell just as there is in heaven.    I don't enjoy making these kind of statements and maybe you don't enjoy listening to them, but we have to preach the entire Word of God.  -There is a place called hell.  If I could give one verse of Scripture that could give any hope that people aren't going there, I'd give it to you, but I haven't found it.  That fact that there is a place called hell, the fact that our God is a God of holiness and must judge sin, the fact that He has made us the kind of creatures we are and therefore we're responsible, the fact that He has placed us in a \\\"uni\\\"verse that has purpose and design behind it, the fact that sin is such an awful thing and the fact that God Himself went through hell to save us from hell leads us to two applications.  1)  As I've already mentioned.  If you are a Christian, you must worn others.  Its not good enough to stop and fix their flat tire and not tell them that just around the bend the bridge is out.  \\\"Knowing therefore the terror of Lord, we persuade men.\\\"  2)  If you haven't accepted Jesus are your Savior, you're taking an awful chance.  As I say to the Jehovah Witnesses (who no longer frequent my door), if you are right and I am wrong, then I will have lived a good life and will die and cease to exist, but if I am right and you are wrong, then you will die and suffer eternal damnation.  I don't mean to make fun at this point, but its like Dirty Harry said, \\\"You've got to ask yourself, 'Do I feel lucky?'  Well do you?\\\"  \\\"A man's got to know his limitations.\\\"  Don't be one of the \\\"whosoever wont's.\\\"  \",\" Would if only it were true ...  If only MIT would fix the !@&$^*@ twm \\\"InstallWindowColormaps()\\\" crash bug once and for all, then I could say that I've (almost) unable to crash either \\\"twm\\\" or \\\"tvtwm\\\", which would be a remarkable feat - and most desirable to boot.

Just do an 'xbiff -xrm \\\"XBiff*shapeWindow: on\\\"'.  Blammo.) \",\" [...stuff deleted...]  Andy-- I think we do agree, given your clarification of how we were  each using the terms fact and theory.  I'll only add that I think perhaps I feel more strongly about separating them, though your usage is quite valid.   I'll add here that any falsification or rejection does not in any way reduce its current usefulness.  So long as it accurately predicts or  describes things we can observe.  Not to be a pain in the ass, but is there any reason you don't just say _the theory of evolution_ rather than the _fact of evolution is still a theory_.  I'm asking because this whole thread got started because I was bothered by a post that referred to _the fact of evolution_, basically leaving off the phrase _is still a theory_.  Without a  clarification, like the one you just gave, just saying _the fact of evolution_ has a very different meaning to me.  I'm not sure I agree here.  Again, it may be because I feel stronger about separating terms.  I was trying to say that the _theories_ proposed to explain the _mechanisms_ and the _mechanisms_ themselves are the only realities here.  It is the existence of mechanisms, not  the things themselves, that are so predictive as to be considered  fact (as you would say).  There aren't really little planetary particle  systems called atoms out there.  Or I should say, and more to my original  point, it would be a leap of faith to say there are, because we observe only  the mechanisms.  There is no need to _believe_ there are _actually_ atoms out there as we have decided to think about them.  It's enough to discuss the mechanisms.  At any rate, I'm not sure I am being  any clearer than before, but I thought it was worth a shot.  The bottom line, though, is I think we agree on two fundamental ideas:     1. --evolution is a theory supported by observational evidence (my way)       --the fact of evolution is a theory supported by observational         evidence (your way)     2. --creation is just an opinion.  If a theist wants to call it         a theory then he can.  I won't:  it has no supporting evidence   and it neither predicts nor supports any observations that can         be made.  With no mechanisms to talk about, there really isn't  much to say.  Do you agree? \",\"As the subjects says, Windows 3.1 keeps crashing (givinh me GPF) on me of   late.  It was never a very stable package, but now it seems to crash every   day.  The worst part about it is that it does not crash consistently: ie I   can't reproduce crashes, and they are not always GPF's in the same   application. Sometimes I can recover by simply closing the application   that caused an error, but other times, windows acts very strange, and I   need to re-boot.  Some background:  I have a Leading Edge 486sx25 with Phoenix BIOS.  When I   first got it it had 4Mg of memory.  It ran windows fine (not too many   GPF's).  Then, a couple of weekends ago, I installed Lotus 123 for windows   (with ATM), a game card and an additional 4  1Mg SIMMS.  The Leading edge   machine is kind of strange, in that it has the IDE controler built into   the motherboard, the CPU is actually on a sparate board that plugs into   the motherboard and the SIMMS it uses are Macintosh SIMMS! Apparently I   was told that the Leading Edge had the parity bit built into the mother   board.  The original 4Mg 80ns SIMMS where of the 2 chip variety from   SAMSUNG, and the ones I installed are 8 chip SIMMS. They are recognized   fine by the BIOS RAM check. The game card is a generic $20 gamecard.  The reason why I mention the hardware like this is that sometimes   rebooting the machine using the reset button or ctl-alt-del still leaves   the machine kind of flaky, but turning it on and off doesn't.   I haven't tried taking out the RAM or the game card, because as I said   these GPF are not reproducible at will.  I have gone through and entire   day using the computer with no problems and then I might get 5 or so GPF's   in the sppace of 20 minutes?  What can I do.  This situation is most annoying... Are there any good   diagnostic tools for hardware? Do you think that this might be a software   problem (ie EMM386 etc.)? If it helps, i have manage to get GPF's on After   Dark, quicken, Paint shop pro. A lot of them have been in user.exe or   gdi.exe.

WSM is a compilation of submissions from shareware/freeware authors in a single Windows .HLP (Help System) file.  All types of software may be submitted for entry in WSM - utilities, applications, games, programming tools, etc.  WSM benefits Windows shareware/freeware authors by allowing them to publicize their software releases, inform users of updated versions, and to increase their installed base of users.  Those searching for specific Windows software will benefit by having a complete list of available software available at their fingertips - complete with feature lists, current prices, and any other relevant information.  Windows software authors may submit entries to Windows Shareware Monthly in the following manner:  1. Compose a short summary of the function of the software.  Include all    special features which are unique to your product and which set it apart    from other programs in the genre.  Be sure to include specific details    such as: the current release version, where the software is available,    how much the registration fee costs, how much disk space is required, any    special requirements (e.g. sound card, or VBRUN200.DLL, etc.), how the    author may be contacted, etc.  Because text is highly compressible, the    summary may be as long as is necessary, however, it is best to keep it    short.  A good guideline is a single screenful of 12-point text at 640x480    resolution.  Order forms and other such addendum may be included if desired.    All submissions whould be in plain text (ASCII) format.  Formatting will    be exactly as it is submitted - I will simply cut and paste text files    into a Help Authoring system.  If you require special formatting     conventions - such as boldface text or italics, or a larger font size,    indicate so CLEARLY within the text file.  For best results, use Windows    NotePad to create the .TXT file.    2. Include up to 100k of Windows-format .BMP (bitmap) screen-shots which    display the workings or special features of each program.  Special cases    (rendering applications for example) which require 256-color bitmaps may    submit up to 250k of .BMP files - all other should observe the 100k limit    and use 16-color format.  For maximum compatiblity with the software which    will be used to create the WSM .HLP file (Stefan Olson's Help Writer's    Assistant for Windows), please save the bitmaps with Windows Paintbrush or    WinGIF.   3. Include a 16-color .BMP of the program's icon (.ICO file).  Many programs    are available to convert .ICO to .BMP format, or Windows Paintbrush may be    used.  The .BMP will be embedded in the summary text.  4. Double-check for spelling errors, formatting corrections, etc.    5. Compress the .TXT file, the .BMP of the program icon, and any additional    .BMPs into a single file using PKZIP (any version).  6. Submit the entry by UUENCODING the .ZIPfile, and e-mailing it to:        DAA7365@TAMUTS.TAMU.EDU     if submitting via the Internet or Compuserve. If submitting via America    Online, send a brief message indicating submission, and append the .ZIP    file, then e-mail to:     DiegoAA  7. If any changes are required, or a new version is released, complete    the above procedures again.  Send all submissions to the @TAMUTS address,    and any comments, suggestions, criticisms, to DAA7365@RIGEL.TAMU.EDU.  All entries received before the deadline will be included in the subsequent edition of WSM.  The editor will not be held responsible for any errors, and we reserve the right to make changes to the entries.  WSM is not limited to shareware/freeware software.  A special area will be devoted to commercially available Windows 3.x and NT software.  Commercial software authors should follow the same steps above, with the exception of the limitations on size - the .TXT file and .BMPs may be as large as required (and as large as is practical for transmission over phone lines).  There is no charge for the publishing of either shareware/freeware or commercial product entries.    Advertisements for computer hardware, software, bulletin boards, etc. may be submitted as well. Again, the same procedures apply, with the exception of the size limitations.  There is no charge for advertising space.  The first ten advertisements submitted each month will be included; subsequent submissions will not be included due to size constraints.  WSM is currently looking for persons willing to devote the time to author columns within WSM.  A C/C++ programing section, a Visual Basic section, and two Windows-specific opinion/advice columns are envisioned.  All work will be on a voluntary basis.  If you wish to aid WSM and author a monthly column on one of the above topics, please send us mail at DAA7365@TAMUTS.TAMU.EDU or DiegoAA on America Online.\",\" You are nto alone.

Simpler shading models are implemented already, f.i. in x3d (ask archie where to get the latest version). For Gouroud, a fast implementation will be possible utilizing some extension only, either MIT-SHM to do the shade in an image and fast update the window with it, or PEX/OpenGL which should be able to shade themselves. The portable 'vanilla X' way would be to shade in a normal XImage and use XPutImage(), what would be good enough to do static things as f.i. fractal landscapes or such stuff.

You see, I don't just treat little old ladies that wouldn't know any  different of what is being done, but a bulk of my patients consist of  teachers, lawyers, judges, nurses, accountants, university graduates,  and various health practitioners.  If these people have gotten results with my method after having been  unsuccessful with yours or their own, I certainly wouldn't lose any   sleep over whether you or your peers approve of my treatments ---   let's face it, with all the blunders committed by \\\"scientific\\\" MDs   over the years, I know a lot of people who hold your *scientific*   method in much lower esteem than they hold mine!

But Gordon, you already knew that -  you just wanted to make my system look a bit more far out, right?    I use homeopathy very little, since my cellular test (EMR) is hard to  beat for accuracy and minerals are more predictable, while homeopathy  does have a problem with reliability, especially in acute conditions.

Since I have financed every research project that I have undertaken   entirely myself, I don't need to follow any of your rules or guide-  lines to satisfy any aspects of a grant application, which YOU may   have to; neither am I concerned of whether or not my study designs   meet your or anyone else's criteria or acceptance.

I think there would be more justification for an uneducated person  growing up in an uncivilized environment to believe in a flat earth,  than for a civilized, well educated and scientifically trained mind  to follow the doctrine of evolution.  Genetic engineering of course is now the final frontier to show God  how it is (properly) done. Now we've become capable of creating our  own paradise and give disease (and God) the boot, right?

It's more likely that the Moon will never be the site of major commercial activity. As far as we know it has no materials we can't get cheaper right here on Earth or from asteroids and comets, aside from the semi-mythic He3 that *might* be useful in low grade fusion reactors. Exploring it would satisfy a curiosity itch,  and it's position in the gravity well of Earth coupled with it's heat  sink capacity could offer some military utility for \\\"high ground\\\" military weapons systems, but it holds very minute commercial value. If space  travel becomes cheap enough, it might become a tourist attraction as  Mt. Everest and the Antarctic have become, but that's a very minor  activity in the global scope of things.  Luna has an inconvienent gravity field. It's likely too low to prevent calcium loss, muscle atrophy, and long term genetic drift. Yet it's too high to do micro-G manufacturing. Space based colonies and factories that can be spun to any convienent value of G look much better. Luna has a modest vacuum and raw solar exposure two weeks a month, but orbital sites can have better vacuums and continous solar exposure. Luna offers a source of light element rocks that can serve as raw materials, heatsink, and shielding. The asteroids and comets offer sources of both light and heavy elements, and volatile compounds, and many are in less steep gravity wells so that less delta-v is required to reach them.  We don't use 2/3rds of the Earth now, the seafloors, and we virtually ignore Antarctica, a whole continent. That's because we don't have to deal with those conditions in order to make a buck. Luna is a much more expensive place to visit, or to live and work. I think we'll use the easier places first. That pushes Lunar development back at least a few centuries, if not much longer.  Luna's main short term value would be as a place for a farside radio astronomy observatory, shielded from the noisy Earth. Or as the site of a laser, particle beam, or linear accelerator weapons system for defending Earth, or bombarding it as the case may be. The first is unlikely because of the high cost for such a basic science instrument. The second is just as unlikely because conventional nukes are good enough, and the military would really rather see the Earth safe for conventional warfare again. There's little glory in watching from a bunker as machines fight each other over continental ranges. Little ultimate profit either.

Were the two tapes that it unwound of the same type from the same batch?  The reason I ask is that I bought some generic tapes that did this and found that the tape markers were not fully punched out and had closed the little marker hole.  It was only on a few tapes of a set.  Did you open up the tape cartridge and put the tape back on the reels?  If you have not yet, open it up by removing the two screws on the bottom of the tape cartridge and snap the plastic shell away from the metal base.   As you are pulling the tape through the assembly try not to touch any more  than you have to.  As you are doing it, look for a couple of little holes in  the tape.  These are the marker holes which let the tape drive know when it is  at the end of the tape.  The holes are spaced a couple of inches apart.  My best guess is that the drive finds the first marker and then stops on the second marker?    Anyhow, If the tape has the holes, then check to see if the mirror on the tape is clean.  The function of the mirror is to detect the marker holes.  The tape drive shines a light at the mirror and has a pickup in the area where the reflection would come out.  When the hole goes by, the pickup detects the  light that was allowed to pass and it knows when to stop.  If the mirror is dirty or out of alighment (unlikely since it is made into the case) you might have a problem detecting the end of the tape.  If the tape drive does it on all tapes and the tapes all look good, then either the pickup or the LED of the sensor system has failed or is dirty.  If you open the drive door you will see the sensor assembly to the left of the R/W head assembly.  If it looks clean and nothing is in its way, then the drive may need to be serviced.  It is possible that the LED is burned out or the sensor is out.   If it is still in warranty, you might be able to send it back to CMS for repair.   --- Scott Hiles whiles@relay.nswc.navy.mil\",\"From the Santa Rosa (Cal.) Press-Democrat, April 15, 1993, p. B2:      Male sex survey: Gay activity low      A new natonal study on male sexual behavior, the most thorough     examination of American men's sexual practices published since     the Kinsey report more than four decades ago, shows about 2     percent of the men surveyed had engaged in homosexual sex and     1 percent considered themselves exclusively homosexual.      The figures on homosexuality in the study released Wednesday     by the Alan Guttmacher Institute are significantly lower than     the 10 percent figure that has been part of the conventional     wisdom since it was published in the Kinsey report.  The article also contains numbers on the number of sexual partners. The median number of sexual partners for all men 20-39 was 7.3. Compared to the table I have already posted from Masters, Johnson, and Kolodny showing male homosexual partners, it is apparent that homosexual men are dramatically more promiscuous than the general male population.  It's a shame that we don't have a breakdown for straight men vs. gay/bi men -- that would show even more dramatically how much more promiscuous gay/bi men are.\",\"I am selling my Macintosh Classic and Stylewriter 1 to the highest bidder.

The parts are mostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest. We don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask. Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.  The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu  as /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography  FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers  every 21 days.   Contents:  * What is the National Security Agency (NSA)? * What are the US export regulations? * What is TEMPEST? * What are the Beale Ciphers, and are they a hoax? * What is the American Cryptogram Association, and how do I get in touch? * Is RSA patented? * What about the Voynich manuscript?   * What is the National Security Agency (NSA)?    The NSA is the official security body of the U.S. government. It   was given its charter by President Truman in the late 40's, and   has continued research in cryptology till the present. The NSA is   known to be the largest employer of mathematicians in the world,   and is also the largest purchaser of computer hardware in the   world. Governments in general have always been prime employers of   cryptologists. The NSA probably possesses cryptographic expertise many   years ahead of the public state of the art, and can undoubtedly break   many of the systems used in practice; but for reasons of national   security almost all information about the NSA is classified.    Bamford's book [BAMFD] gives a history of the people and operations of   the NSA. The following quote from Massey [MAS88] highlights the   difference between public and private research in cryptography:    ``... if one regards cryptology as the prerogative of government,   one accepts that most cryptologic research will be conducted   behind closed doors. Without doubt, the number of workers engaged   today in such secret research in cryptology far exceeds that of   those engaged in open research in cryptology. For only about 10   years has there in fact been widespread open research in   cryptology. There have been, and will continue to be, conflicts   between these two research communities. Open research is common   quest for knowledge that depends for its vitality on the open   exchange of ideas via conference presentations and publications in   scholarly journals. But can a government agency, charged with   responsibilities of breaking the ciphers of other nations,   countenance the publication of a cipher that it cannot break? Can   a researcher in good conscience publish such a cipher that might   undermine the effectiveness of his own government's code-breakers?   One might argue that publication of a provably-secure cipher would   force all governments to behave like Stimson's `gentlemen', but one   must be aware that open research in cryptography is fraught with   political and ethical considerations of a severity than in most   scientific fields. The wonder is not that some conflicts have   occurred between government agencies and open researchers in   cryptology, but rather that these conflicts (at least those of which   we are aware) have been so few and so mild.''  * What are the US export regulations?    In a nutshell, there are two government agencies which control   export of encryption software. One is the Bureau of Export   Administration (BXA) in the Department of Commerce, authorized by   the Export Administration Regulations (EAR). Another is the Office   of Defense Trade Controls (DTC) in the State Department, authorized   by the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). As a rule   of thumb, BXA (which works with COCOM) has less stringent   requirements, but DTC (which takes orders from NSA) wants to see   everything first and can refuse to transfer jurisdiction to BXA.    The newsgroup misc.legal.computing carries many interesting   discussions on the laws surrounding cryptographic export, what   people think about those laws, and many other complex issues which   go beyond the scope of technical groups like sci.crypt. Make sure to   consult your lawyer before doing anything which will get you thrown in   jail; if you are lucky, your lawyer might know a lawyer who has at   least heard of the ITAR.  * What is TEMPEST?    TEMPEST is a standard for electromagnetic shielding for computer   equipment. It was created in response to the discovery that   information can be read from computer radiation (e.g., from a CRT) at   quite a distance and with little effort.    Needless to say, encryption doesn't do much good if the cleartext   is available this way.  * What are the Beale Ciphers, and are they a hoax?    (Thanks to Jim Gillogly for this information and John King for   corrections.)    The story in a pamphlet by J. B. Ward (1885) goes: Thomas   Jefferson Beale and a party of adventurers accumulated a huge mass   of treasure and buried it in Bedford County, Virginia, leaving   three ciphers with an innkeeper; the ciphers describe the   location, contents, and intended beneficiaries of the treasure.   Ward gives a decryption of the second cipher (contents) called B2;   it was encrypted as a book cipher using the initial letters of the   Declaration of Independence (DOI) as key. B1 and B3 are unsolved;   many documents have been tried as the key to B1.    Aficionados can join a group that attempts to solve B1 by various   means with an eye toward splitting the treasure:    The Beale Cypher Association   P.O. Box 975   Beaver Falls, PA 15010    You can get the ciphers from the rec.puzzles FAQL by including the   line:    send index    in a message to netlib@peregrine.com and following the directions.   (There are apparently several different versions of the cipher   floating around. The correct version is based on the 1885 pamphlet,   says John King <kingj@hpcc01.corp.hp.com>.)    Some believe the story is a hoax. Kruh [KRU88] gives a long list of   problems with the story. Gillogly [GIL80] decrypted B1 with the DOI   and found some unexpected strings, including ABFDEFGHIIJKLMMNOHPP.   Hammer (president of the Beale Cypher Association) agrees that this   string couldn't appear by chance, but feels there must be an   explanation; Gwyn (sci.crypt expert) is unimpressed with this   string.  * What is the American Cryptogram Association, and how do I get in touch?    The ACA is an organization devoted to cryptography, with an emphasis   on cryptanalysis of systems that can be attacked either with   pencil-and-paper or computers. Its organ ``The Cryptogram'' includes   articles and challenge ciphers. Among the more than 50 cipher types in   English and other languages are simple substitution, Playfair,   Vigenere, bifid, Bazeries, grille, homophonic, and cryptarithm.    Dues are $15 for one year (6 issues); more outside of North America;   less for students under 18 and seniors. Subscriptions should be sent   to ACA Treasurer, 18789 West Hickory St., Mundelein, IL 60060.  * Is RSA patented?    Yes. The patent number is 4,405,829, filed 12/14/77, granted 9/20/83.   For further discussion of this patent, whether it should have been   granted, algorithm patents in general, and related legal and moral   issues, see comp.patents and misc.legal.computing. For information   about the League for Programming Freedom see [FTPPF]. Note that one of   the original purposes of comp.patents was to collect questions such as   ``should RSA be patented?'', which often flooded sci.crypt and other   technical newsgroups, into a more appropriate forum.  * What about the Voynich manuscript?    nelson@reed.edu (Nelson Minar) says there is a mailing list on the   subject.  the address to write to subscribe to the VMS mailing list   is: <voynich-request@rand.org>    the ftp archive is: rand.org:/pub/voynich\",\"jayson stark (i trhink that's him) fits perfectly in this category.  anyone who writes \\\"dean palmer has 2 homers  - at this pace, he'll  have 324 home runs!\\\" should be shot.  if, at the end of april, he has 11, and anyone writes \\\"at this  pace, he'll have 100+ homers!\\\" they shouldbe shot too.\",\"From:  Kayhan Havai # 1026 --------------------------                                                o Dr. Namaki,  deputy minister of health stated that infant   mortality (under one year old) in Iran went down from 120    per  thousand before the revolution to 33 per thousand at   the end of 1371 (last month).      o Dr Namaki also stated that before the revolution only   254f children received vaccinations to protect them   from various deseases but this figure reached 93at   the end of 1371.      o Dr. Malekzadeh, the minister of health mentioned that   the population growth rate in Iran at the end of 1371   went below 2.7     o During the visit of Mahathir Mohammad, the prime minister   of Malaysia, to Iran, agreements for cooperation in the   areas of industry, trade, education and tourism were   signed.

And one recalls that the Jews took up their abode in 'fanatic' Turkey  when they were expelled from Europe, especially Spain, by Saintly Christians,  and they have lived here for centuries in at least as much tranquility and  liberty as their fellow Turkish subjects, all being exposed alike to the  rapacity of their common rulers. To one brought up, as most Americans have   been, in the Gladstonian and foreign-missionary tradition, the condition of   the Jews in Turkey is almost a mathematical demonstration that religious  differences have had an influence in the tragedy of Turkey only as they  were combined with aspirations for a political separation which every   nation in the world would have treated as treasonable.

Shaw  (History),  who  recently completed  two books:  The Jews  of  the Ottoman  Empire and  the Turkish Republic, and Turkey and  the Holocaust: Turkey's Role in Rescuing  Turkish  and  European  Jewry  from  Nazi  Persecution, 1933-45. Shaw  chairs the undergraduate  interdepartmental degree program in Near Eastern Studies and has organized the Program for the Study of Ottoman and Turkish Jewry. He is affiliated with the G. E. von Grunebaum Center for Near Eastern Studies.  Editor: How did  you come to write these two  books on Turkey and European and Turkish Jews?  Shaw: Basically, I'm  an Ottoman historian, but  I'm also Jewish. I've  spent twenty-five  years studying  Ottoman history,  and as time went along, whenever I  found materials on the Ottoman Jews, I collected  them. But  I never  did anything  with them  until a couple of years  ago, when I suddenly realized that  1992 was the 500th  anniversary of  the  Jews being  expelled  from Spain  and coming  to Turkey.  Then the  Sephardic Temple  down on  Wilshire Avenue invited me  to give a series of three  lectures on Ottoman Jewry.  These lectures  were  greatly appreciated,  and I  became motivated to  undertake further research  to develop a  book, The Jews of the  Ottoman Empire and the Turkish)  Republic. This book is quite different from the  works of most Jewish historians, who tend to look  at the Jews in any country  more from the viewpoint of the Jews  and the Jewish community, and rely  mainly on Jewish sources.  I  view my  subject  as  an  Ottoman historian,  and  I approach the Jews of the Ottoman Empire largely from the point of view of Ottoman  society, using largely Ottoman  sources. After I finished  this book  and  sent it  to the  press,  I came  across additional documents  relating to  Turkish Jews during  World War II. In the completed book, I had said that Turkey had done a good deal  to rescue  the Jews  during  World War  II, but  I did  not actually have many details. Then I  found a batch of documents in the Foreign Ministry archive relating to actions taken by Turkish diplomats to  help the Jews  before and during the  Holocaust. It was too late to add this new information to the book in press, so I decided to  write a second book. I  conducted further research, mainly in the archives of the  Foreign Ministry in Ankara and the Turkish Embassy and Consulate in Paris. The result was the second book, Turkey and  the Holocaust, which details  how Turkey helped rescue Jews from the Nazis.  - How exactly did they do this?  The story takes  place over a number of years.  The book presents the material in three parts, first of which deals with the period before the Holocaust. When the Nazis  came to power in Germany in 1933,  they immediately  started  dismissing  Jews and  anti-Nazi Germans from universities,  hospitals, scientific institutes, and the like. Turkey at that moment was just beginning the process of reforming its  universities, and it  saw in these Jews,  who were being fired from their positions in Germany, a good source of new talent to  help modernize the Turkish  universities. Within three months  after the  Nazis  started dismissing  these Jews,  Turkey arranged to take many of them in. They were brought to Turkey and were   given   appointments   as  professors   in   the   Turkish universities, as  heads of scientific institutes,  and as medical personnel in hospitals. About 300  to 500 major Jewish professors came to  Turkey in  the 1930s. Ernst  Reuter, a  German political scientist,  spent the  war  years teaching  political science  in Turkey. After  World War II,  he was  mayor of Berlin  during the Berlin Airlift.  Fritz Neimark, a major  German Jewish economist, came to Turkey and helped  establish a modern school of economics in Istanbul.  A man named  Reichenbach, who was rescued  from the Nazis by  Turkey and  spent the war  years in  Turkey, eventually came to  UCLA, where he  became a professor of  philosophy. Other German Jewish  emigres engaged in cultural  activities in Turkey. One  such was  Karl  Ebert,  who had  been  a leading  theatrical producer in Berlin until he was expelled by the Nazis. He went to Turkey, where he  organized the Turkish National  Theater and the Turkish National Opera  Company in Ankara, with the  help of Paul Hindemuth. So  the first  section of the  book covers  this first phase, when Jews were being  persecuted in Germany and rescued by Turkey.  Oddly enough,  the  German emigres,  when  they were  in Turkey, did not seem to think too badly of Germany. They regarded themselves more  as Germans than Jews,  and they did not  join in the anti-Nazi activities of the local Turkish Jewish community. I even  found  letters  from  the Nazi  representatives  to  Turkey praising these German Jewish refugees for their work in promoting the idea  of German  culture. Even though  these people  had been persecuted by the Nazis and rescued by the Turks, they shared the Nazis' feelings of  Aryan racial superiority over  the Turks. The second part of the book deals  with the Holocaust, which began in 1940 when the Nazis occupied France.  In Europe at that time, and especially in France, there were  about 20,000 Turkish Jews. They had migrated to Europe for various reasons from about the turn of the century onward. Most of them had settled in Europe during the Turkish war for  independence after World War I,  when Greece was threatening to overrun Turkey. The Greeks had persecuted the Jews throughout the nineteenth century, and the Jews feared what might happen to them if the Greeks  took over in Turkey. Many Jews fled to France during  the 1920s and 1930s. Many  also abandoned their Turkish  citizenship and  became  French  citizens. Suddenly  the Nazis invaded France in 1940 and started introducing all sorts of anti-Jewish laws.  The Turkish  Jews soon found  that it  was not worth very much to  be a French Jew, but that it  was worth a lot to be a Turkish Jew.  - How so?  Turkey remained neutral through most of World War II. It retained its embassies  and consulates in all  the Nazi-occupied countries until it finally entered the war on the side of the Allies at the end of 1944. During the war,  therefore, Turkey was in a position to  defend its  citizens  against anti-Jewish  measures, and  the actions that  Turkish diplomats took  form the second  chapter of the  book. Turkish  diplomats  who were  stationed  in France  in particular intervened to protect Jews of Turkish citizenship from the Nazis. For those Turkish  Jews who had retained their Turkish citizenship,  there  was  generally  no  problem.  If  they  were arrested and sent to a  concentration camp, the Turkish diplomats would  communicate with  the  commanders of  the  camp and  other officials and say in effect:  \\\"These people are Turkish citizens. You  can't do  this  to  them.\\\" And  the  Turkish  Jews would  be released.  If  their  businesses were  confiscated,  the  Turkish diplomats would protest and the businesses would be restored.  The Nazis  in general  wanted to keep  the friendship  of Turkey. They hoped to be able to use  Turkey as a gateway for an invasion of the Middle  East, and they also wanted to  obtain chromium and manganese from Turkey. In order  to keep Turkish friendship, they usually accepted  these interventions on behalf  of Turkish Jews. The Turkish  diplomats sometimes went to  the concentration camps to secure the release of Turkish Jews. At times they even boarded trains hauling  Turkish Jews  to Auschwitz for  extermination and succeeded in getting them off the train. Most of the foreign Jews were sent  to a concentration  camp at  a place called  Drancy in Paris,  and that's  where  most of  the  intercession by  Turkish consuls took place.  The greater problem came with  the Turkish Jews who had abandoned their  Turkish citizenship  and had  become French  citizens. The consuls couldn't declare that  these people were Turkish citizens because  they were  not.  My book  includes  photographs of  Jews lining  up in  front  of  the Turkish  consulate,  either to  get passports to  return to Turkey or  to get a restoration  of their Turkish  citizenship.   This  was   a  bureaucratic   matter,  so processing the application would take  some time. In the meantime it was a  real emergency, because the Nazis would  arrest Jews on the streets for almost nothing.  The Nazis would even arrest them if they  had radios  or telephones  in their  apartments, because radios and  telephones were  forbidden to Jews.  To take  care of these  former  Turkish Jews,  the  Turkish  diplomats invented  a document called  gayri muntazem  vatandash, or  \\\"irregular fellow citizen.\\\" The  document said in  effect \\\"This person is  a former Turkish  citizen  who has  applied  for  the restoration  of  his Turkish citizenship.  In the meantime  we would appreciate  it if you  would treat  him  as  if he  were  a  Turkish citizen.\\\"  The diplomats wrote  the document in  Turkish and put their  seals on it. Since  the Nazis could  not read  Turkish, on the  whole they accepted  these papers  as certificates  of citizenship.  By this means, the  Turkish diplomats were  able to rescue many  Jews who had relinquished their Turkish citizenship.  Actually the Nazis were of two minds about the Turkish defense of Jews. On the one hand the  Nazi Foreign Ministry, which wanted to retain the friendship of Turkey,  was in favor of accepting these interventions. On the other hand, Himmler and Eichmann wanted all Jews exterminated.  At times  Himmler and  Eichmann were  able to prevail and some  of the Turkish Jews were sent  off to Auschwitz before the Turkish consuls could do anything.  - Do you have statistics on how many Turkish Jews were rescued?  There were about  20,000 Turkish Jews in Europe  before world War II,  about 10,000  of whom  were living  in France.  Most of  the information in this section of  the book relates to the situation in France. I have published  the letters that the Turkish consuls sent to  the Nazi  officials and  the letters  that came  back in reply. Generally the Nazis said  that if the Turkish consul would present  documents  certifying   that  arrested  individuals  are Turkish citizens,  and promise  to send them  out of  France, the Nazis would release them from the concentration camp. The Turkish consuls also organized  special trains to take  Turkish Jews from Nazi-occupied  territory   back  to  Turkey.  These   trains  ran regularly in 1943 and 1944. The Nazis gave the Turkish Jews visas so they  could pass out  of Nazi  territory, but the  trains were often  held  up by  the  Nazi-influenced  governments of  Eastern Europe  -   Croatia,  Serbia,   and  Bulgaria  -   because  these governments really didn't want the Jews to escape. As a result of the Turkish consuls' efforts, about 3,000 to 4,000 of the Turkish Jews  in  France were  saved.  Another  3,000  were sent  off  to Auschwitz, where  most of them  died. The remaining  3,000 either escaped  across the  border into  Spain or  fled to  the area  of southern France occupied  by the Italians, who  treated Jews much better than  the Nazis did.  At the  end of 1943,  however, Italy fell out of the war, and that was the end for those Jews as well. Incidentally, the Turkish diplomats  in Nazi-occupied Greece also worked to rescue Jews in that country.  - The second part of your  book then deals with Turkish diplomats acting to  rescue Jews of  Turkish citizenship or  Turkish origin from Nazi persecution.  Yes,  and  there  is  an  aside   I  might  add  here:  In  their interventions on  behalf of Turkish  Jews, the Turks  cited their treaty with Germany which stated  that Turkish citizens in German territory would be treated the same as German citizens in Turkey. On  that basis  the Turks  maintained  that the  Nazis could  not discriminate  against Turkish  citizens who  are Jews.  The Nazis claimed  (and the  Vichy government  agreed) that  they were  not discriminating  because  they  were treating  all  Jews  equally. Turkey  protested,   saying,  \\\"You  are  dividing   our  citizens according to religion, but the Turkish constitution requires that all  citizens   be  treated  equally,  regardless   of  religion. Therefore, you cannot single  out Turkish Jews.\\\" American consuls in  Paris,  by contrast,  accepted  the  Nazi argument  and  told American Jews  who were being  persecuted by the Nazis  that they couldn't do  anything about  it, because  the American  Jews were being treated the same as other  Jews. The third part of the book takes place in Turkey, which  was the principal center during the Holocaust for activities aimed at  the rescue of Eastern European Jews. The  kwish Agency, an  organization established by  Jews in Palestine to help resettle Jews to Palestine, set up an office in Istanbul  in 1940  under the  leadership of  Chaim Barlas.  Other Jewish organizations in Palestine, especially the kibbutzes, also sent representatives  to Istanbul  to set up  headquarters. These groups first tried to contact Jews  in Eastern Europe to find out what was  happening. Today  we know about  the Holocaust,  but at that  time people  didn't know  what  was going  on. They  didn't imagine the Nazis could do the things they were doing. And so the first step was to get information, and the Turkish government let them use the Turkish mails to send letters to their relatives and friends  in Eastern  Europe. The  Jewish organizations  found out what was happening when they  received replies. Later on when the Nazis  began  to  intercept   such  letters,  the  Jews  received assistance  also from  the  Vatican nuncio,  Angelo Roncali,  who served as  the Vatican  representative in  Istanbul from  1935 to 1944  and   later  became  Pope   John  XXIII.  As   the  Vatican representative  during the  war, he  used the  facilities of  the Catholic  Church to  supplement what  the Turkish  government was doing to  assist Jewish  agencies in  contacting Jews  in Eastern Europe.  With the  cooperation of  the Turkish  government, these agencies  then  sent  hard  currency, food,  clothing,  and  even railroad  and  steamship  tickets   to  Jews  in  Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary. They weren't able to help much in Poland because  by then the  Nazis had  wiped out almost  all the Polish Jews.  Whenever possible the rescue  agencies arranged for the Jews to get out of Eastern Europe either by train through the so called  Orient Express route  to Istanbul, or by  boat through the Black Sea to Istanbul.  Turkey was not eager for all  these refugees to remain within its borders during  the war, because  it was being blockaded  and was suffering   terrible  shortages   of  food   and  clothing.   The government,   therefore,   facilitated   the  movement   of   the non-Turkish Jewish  refugees from Turkey to  Palestine, either by the Taurus  Express Railroad through  the mountains to  Syria and Palestine,  or by  small boats  across the  eastern Mediterranean from southern  Turkey to  Palestine. These efforts  were bitterly opposed not only  by the Nazis, but also by  the British, who did not want  any more Jewish  immigration to Palestine  because they feared it would hurt their  relations with the Arabs. The British constantly pressured the Turkish  government to stop this traffic and send those Jews back. In  a few cases the Turkish government, yielding  to  British pressure,  did  send  the boats  back.  For example, in  one incident,  the steamship  Struma, with  some 700 Jewish  refugees  from Romania,  was  sent  back by  the  Turkish government  as  a  result  of the  intervention  of  the  British ambassador. When  that ship was  sunk by a Soviet  submarine, all were lost except one person.  Nevertheless, all told, the Turkish government allowed no fewer than 100,000 Eastern European Jews to pass through  Turkish territory and  move on to  Palestine during the Second World War. The Turkish authorities also provided these refugees with facilities  and money, and gave  them permission to send money and food out of the country.  - Many  of these  Jews who  passed  through Turkey  may still  be living in Israel.  Yes, and  their children. But  let's return  for a moment  to the first group, the Turkish Jews who  came from Europe. They did not go  on  to   Palestine;  they  stayed  in  Turkey.   It  was  the non-Turkish, Eastern  European Jews who passed  through Turkey en route to Palestine. Their story is very interesting.  - And you have rescued it from obscurity.  Many studies have been made of the Holocaust, but most of them do not focus on the Eastern European or Middle Eastern Jews. Most of the scholarship  has centered  on the  Western European  Jews, of whom 6 million were massacred by the Nazis. My study deals with a much smaller  number of  people. I  have tried  to round  out the picture,  and I  hope my  book  will persuade  other scholars  to undertake further investigations in the history of Eastern Jews.  When it  comes to numbers,  the German Jews were  also relatively small in number. Most of the millions slain were Polish Jews. The rescue  of  100,000  Eastern  European   Jews  may  not  seem  so significant  compared  with  the  total of  6  million  who  were murdered, but it meant a lot to those who were saved.  About  three-fourths   of  the  book  consists   of  documents  - translations  of many  documents. They  are included  because the story is not well known. Not  only are people in the West unaware of  the courageous  actions of  the Turkish  diplomats; even  the people of Turkey  did not know the story. I  felt that they would not  fully understand  this  remarkable  achievement unless  they could see the documents.  - What languages are used in the documents?  Most of them are in Turkish  or French; some are in Hebrew. There is a great  deal of material in Hebrew about  the organization of the boats  going to Palestine, the  passengers, and so on,  but I did not go into those details extensively. I describe mostly what Turkey did, so  most of my documents are in  Turkish or French. A few documents are  in English. The Jewish groups  in Istanbul did not necessarily  cooperate with  one another  to rescue  Jews; in fact, they often fought with  one another. They took turns trying to  get  the  Turkish  government to  deport  rival  groups.  For example, some of  the kibbutz groups felt that  the Jewish Agency was  run by  Western European  Jews who  were interested  only in helping  Western  European  Jews.  Finally,  in  1944,  President Roosevelt sent a personal  representative, Ira Hirschman, who had been an executive of Bloomingdale's  department store in New York City, and  Hirschman managed to reconcile  their differences. The documents related to his mission are in English.  I also obtained many documents  from Serge Klarsfeld, a Holocaust historian in France,  who mainly worked on the  French Jews. (His father was  killed by  the Nazis.)  He gave  me materials  he had gathered in the German archives on  the Turkish Jews, so I didn't personally consult the German archives.  I believe that much more can  be learned  from the  German  archives, and  I hope  someone someday will make the effort.  - This new book fits in well with your teaching, doesn't it?  Right. I'm  giving a  course on  the history of  the Jews  of the Ottoman  Empire.  I first  gave  the  course  two years  ago.  In addition to  research, writing, and teaching,  I've been actively involved in  the commemoration  of the  500th anniversary  of the coming of the  Jews to the Ottoman Empire. Among  other things, I helped organize  a large international conference  on the subject which was held in Istanbul in 1992.  - Now that your  books are finished and the  conference has taken place, what do you plan to do next?  I'm working on two new books. One is a history of the Turkish War for Independence, which took place  after World War I, during the years  1918 to  1923. The  Turks warded  off the  efforts of  the victorious  European   powers  to  occupy  Turkey   and  end  its independence. The  second book is  a study of Sultan  Abdul Hamid II, the last major sultan, who ruled from 1876 to 1909. He was an important modernizer in his own  way, although he also suppressed all sorts of political movements.  Stanford  J. Shaw  received  a B.A.  in History  and  an M.A.  in British History. He then shifted to Near Eastern History, earning a second M.A.  and a Ph.D. at Princeton. As  a doctoral candidate at Princeton, he  spent two years abroad, studying  at the School of  Oriental  and  African  Studies, University  of  London;  the University of  Cairo, the American  University at Cairo,  and the University of  Istanbul. He  taught at  Harvard before  coming to UCLA in 1966. His postdoctoral research has been supported by the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation, the American Research Institute in  Turkey, the  Social  Science Research  Council, the  National Endowment for the Humanities, the Fulbright Program, and ISOP. He has  received  honorary  degrees   from  Harvard  University  and Bosporus University, Bebek, Istanbul, Turkey, and medals of honor for lifetime contributions  to the fields of  Islamic and Turkish studies from the Center for Research in Islamic History, Art, and Culture in  Istanbul and from  the American Friends of  Turkey in Washington,  D.C. In  addition to  undertaking many  professional service activities and public lectures  in both the United States and Turkey,  Shaw has  also produced eight  books and  one edited volume. His  History of  the Ottoman Empire  and Modem  Turkey (2 vols.)  has been  published  in many  editions  (six editions  or reprints  from 1977-1991),  and  translated  into Turkish  (1983, 1991) and French (1984). His book  The Jews of the Ottoman Empire and  the  Turkish  Republic  (MacMillan,  London,  and  New  York University Press, 1992) will  be published in Turkish translation by the Turkish  Historical Society, Istanbul. His  Turkey and the Holocaust: Turkey's  Role in Rescuing Turkish  and European Jewry from Nazi  Persecution, 1933-1945 will be  published by Macmillan Publishers,  London, and  New York  University Press  in 1993.  A pamphlet summarizing the book was published in Ankara, Turkey, in 1992.  Serdar Argic\",\": It is a dead and useless faith which has no action behind it.  Actions : prove our faith and show the genuineness of it.  A good example of this is Abraham (referred to in the James passage). Hebrews says that Abraham was justified by faith -- but his faith was demonstrated through his works (i.e., he obeyed what God told him to do).  Reading Abraham's ``biography'' in Genesis is very instructive. He was a man beset by *lack* of faith a lot of the time (e.g. lying about Sarah being his wife on 2 occasions; trying to fulfil God's promise on God's behalf by copulating with Hagar). . . yet it seems that God didn't evaluate him on the basis of individual incidents. Abraham is listed as one of the ``heroes of  faith'' in Hebrews 11. i.e., when it really came to the crunch, God declared Abraham as a man of faith. He believed God's promises.  This gives us confidence. Although real faith demonstrates itself through works, God is not going to judge us according to our success/failure in performing works.  ``Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy he saved us, through the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Spirit.''

For providing me this forum I would sincerely like to thank the U.S. Space Foundation.  My topic today is the Single Stage Rocket Technology rocket or SSRT.  By I intend to speak of more.  How to lower the cost and make rapid progress.  SSRT is to my mind -- and I hope to convince you -- the erupting a new rallying cry for our generation in space -- Faster, Cheaper, and Better.       Faster, Cheaper, Better and SSRT represent the passing of a torch from one technical generation to another.  It is a new thing to be sure -- but it is also a relearning of old things from past masters.       When we rolled out the SSRT baby two weeks ago, so called experts told us it violates the laws of physics -- it made no sense.  For example, Dr. Eberhart Rachtin - former president of the Aerospace Corp., said of SSRT in the L.A. Times that it, \\\"defies the best principles of launching payloads into space.\\\"  Well Dr. Rachtin -- you've made us mad!  What are these principles that SSRT defies?       Well I'll tell you.  It violates the principle that you need a giant program office to build space hardware.  It violates the \\\"fact\\\" that it takes 20 years to build something new.  And it violates the truism that you cant do anything significant for less than many billions of dollars.       It took some of the last generation's experts to teach us some new/old lessons.  Werhner Von Braun's first rocket was not a Saturn V.  General Schriever's ICBM's didn't take ten years to demonstrate.  And the X-1 airplane didn't cost $1 billion.       It took one of the great engineers of the 1950's to remind us of these truths -- Max Hunter.  Max, to remind you, was a senior engineer in the Thor IRBM program, and old faster, better, cheaper success story.  Max has been persistent in a vision of a single stage reusable space launch system since the 1960's.  Because he knew it had to be done in affordable steps - Build a little, Test a little.       Next he persuaded us to do a technology demonstration.  We didn't solicit a bunch of requirements -- they'd just change every few years anyway.  [ not included in the speech -- The ALS/NLS has such ephemeral requirements that it would better known as \\\"Shape Shifter\\\" than \\\"Space Lifter.\\\"  We didn't spend a lot money -- this X-Rocket only cost $60 million.  When's the last time we even built a new airplane for that?  And it didn't take a lot of time to build -- McDonnell Douglas completed it in 18 months.  Finally, the government program office consisted of one very over-worked Air Force Major -- motivated in part by the threat that he'd get to ride on it in a strapped-on lawn chair if it ran over cost or schedule.       As I described what SSRT is -- and isn't keep in mind its only a first step.  There are several more steps -- and steps that can easily fail -- before the U.S. can field an SSTO.  But each step should follow the same principles -- a small management team -- a few years technology demonstration -- and a modest budget.       Let me show a few details on SSRT and how it might evolve: (See charts)       I'm embarrassed when my generation is compared with the last generation -- the giants of the last great space era, the 1950's and 1960's.  They went to the moon - we built a telescope that can't see straight.  They soft-landed on Mars - the least we could do is soft-land on Earth!       But we do have an answer.  We can follow their build a little, test a little philosophy to produce a truly affordable and routine access to space.  I know there are nay sayers among you -- those who say SSRT is a stunt.  It needs more thermal protection, the engines are wrong, it would be better to land horizontally, etc, etc.       I say to you -- we'll see you at White Sands in June.  You bring your view-graphs, and I'll bring my rocketship.  If we do what we say we can do, then you let us do the next step.  [ not included in the speech:  If we fail -- you still have your program offices, staff summary sheets, requirement analyses, and decade long programs.]\",\"From: pmetzger@snark.shearson.com (Perry E.

Biblical teaching expects us to celebrate the resurrection of Christ not once a year but every time someone is baptized.  Col. 2:12-Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead.\\\"  Rom. 6:4-Therefore we are buried with him in baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.\\\" Those really want to celebrate the resurrection should by faith walk in newness of life after baptism.  It is not necessary to celebrate a pagan goddess in the process.  Paul answered your question in Romans 9.  In v. 4 he stated that the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the service of God, and the promises were given to the Israelites.  It is a package deal.  He goes on to identify those who are true Israelites.  Vs 6-8 makes it plain that the true Israelites are not those who are born that way but those who accept the promise of God.  Paul continued to emphasize that he was an Israelite in 2 Cor. 11:22, then in Gal 3:29 he says that all those who belong to Christ are Abraham's seed, and heirs to all the promises given to the Israelites.  The promises come with the law.  It is all or nothing.  Why is it that you only want to discard one part of the law?  Certainly you would want your husband to be faithful to you.  Or do you believe that adultery is no longer forbidden?  Same law.  BTW  please give a reference for your statement that the Gentiles are only required to observe the basis commandmants.

The name of the company is Secure Communicatiions Technology (Information will be given at the end of this message on how to contact them).     Basically they are disturbed about the announcement for many reasons that we are. More specifically however, Mr. Bryen of Secure Communications brought to light many points that might interest most of the readers.     His belief is that AT&T was made known of the clipper well before the rest of the industry. This is for several reasons, several of which are:   - A company of AT&T's size could never be able to make a decision to use    the new chip on the SAME DAY it was announced.   - Months ago they proposed using their own chip for AT&T's secure telephone    devices. AT&T basically blew them off as being not interested at all.    This stuck them as strange, until now...      Also I spoke with Art Melnick, their cryptographer, he expressed several concerns over the new Clipper Chip:    - The obvious backdoor will be able to let many people decrypt the code.    - Once the key is released to authorities the security of the crypto     system is lost forever. These keys can end up in the hands of any agency     of the government.    - The fact that the escrowed keys never change means that the algorithm     is vulnerable over time to an attacker.    - The classified algorithm may hide another backdoor. But he feels that     it is probably to keep people from forging fake serial numbers, or     changing the keys themselves.    - Additionally he feels that the NSA has probably spent enough time and     money in working on a way to keep this chip from being reversed     engineered, that he feels that reverse engineering it will be very     difficult to do. He feels that they have developed a suitable technique     to protect the chip from this attack. Also he feels that the chip is     hardware encoded with the algorithm and not microcoded onto the chip.  Additonally I spoke with Mr. Melnick about their algorithm. He couldn't tell me much about their new agorithm because it hasn't been patented yet. However he told me a little:   - The algorithm will be released for public review after patents have been    granted for it. This is so the crypto community can see that it is    secure.   - The algorithm is called NEA for New Encryption Algorithm.    The details were sketchy because now it is held as a trade secret    until the patent was issued, but I was told that it will incorporate    the following:      - It will have fast encryption of data (Exact specs not given, but       Mr. Melnick stated \\\"Much faster than what an RS-232 can put out.\\\")      - It is a symmetric cipher, just like IDEA and DES.      - It will use 64 bit data blocks for encryption (like DES and IDEA).      - The key length was not given to me, but Mr. Melnick states that       it is _adujustable_ and is \\\"More than adequate for security.\\\"      - The algorithm is written in C and Assembler in software form, and       can be ported to many platforms (Unlike the the Clipper Chip which       is hardware ONLY and cannot be made into software) This I       consider a definite plus for the NEA for widespread use.      - The algorithm will accomodate public key distribution techniques       such as RSA or Diffie-Hellman. This will also be supported in the       hardware chip.      - Right now the projected cost of the NEA chip will be about 10 dollars       for each!! (Clipper will run 25 each chip [that is if it is produced       enough, which probably won't happen]).      - They currently sell a program called C-COM that uses the algorithm       and a special streaming protocol that does not divide the encrypted       data into \\\"blocks.\\\" This could prevent plaintext attacks if you know       what the block header is. This program operates at all supported       RS-232 speeds and uses the software implementation of the algorithm.      - Most importantly: IT DOES NOT HAVE A BACKDOOR!!    Right now the company is afraid that the new clipper chip will put them out of business. This is a very real possibility. So they really need help in stopping the clipper chip from becoming a standard. If you want to contact them, they can be reached at..

You can keep a guy on the 15-day for as long  as you want, IF he's still certified as injured.  The player must be  periodically re-evaluated to determine if he's still injured (thus you  cannot park a player on the DL who maybe is out of options and you do not  wish to expose to waivers).  If you get someone qualified for the 60-day  that reduces the frequency of re-evaluations.  There is no longer, I  believe, any limit to the number of players you can place on the DL.

I don't find anywhere that God restricts heaven to particular    ethnic groups or religious denominations or any other category    that we humans like to drop people into. But He does REQUIRE    that we believe and trust Him. In Hebrews it says that God spoke    of old by the prophets (the old testament), but in these last days    he has spoken to us by His son Jesus Christ.

It should also be able to tell the difference between a blank screen (about 300 mv) and a dim screen (say, around 310 mv).  Oh yes, it also needs to be cheap.    My first circuit was a dismal failure.  I used 3 compariators; each compariator had the + input going to one of the guns, the - input went to a reference created by a voltage divider(a potentiometer).  The first problem was that the compariator was way too slow.. I needed to get several pixels in a row before it would fire the compariators, so I could have a whole screen full of text, but my circuit would not detect it.     The second problem is that there was more noise on the reference then the smallest difference between a blank screen and a dim screen.  In fact the difference between completely black and completely white is only 650 mv.  I am wondering if I am going to have to amplify the video signals to make this work.

Jewish religion was the foundation for Christianity and Islam.  In other words Judaism has fathered both religions. Now Islam has turned against its father I may say. It is Ironic that after communizem threat is almost gone, religion wars are going to be on the raise.  I thought the idea of believing on one God, was to Unite all man kind. How come both Jews and Islam which believe on the same God, \\\"the God of Ebrahim\\\" are killing each other? Is this like Dr. Frankenstien's story? How are you going to stop this from happening? How are you going to deal with so many Muslims. Nuking them  would distroy the whole world? Would God get mad, since you have killed his followers, you believe on the same God, same heaven and the same hell after all? What is the peacefull way of ending this Saga?   Man kind needs religion, since it sets up the rules and the regulations which keeps the society in a healthy state. A religion is mostly a sets of rules which people have experienced and know it works for the society. The praying, keeps the sole healthy and meditates it. God does not care for man kinds pray, but man kind hopes that God will help him when he prays. Religion works mostly on the moral issues and trys to put away the materialistic things in the life. But the  religious leaders need to make a living through religion? So they  may corrupt it, or turn it to their own way to make their living. i.e Muslims have to pay  %20 percent of their income to the Mullahs. I guess the rabie  gets his cut too!   Is in it that religion should be such that everybody on planet earth respects each other, be good toward each other helps one another, respect the mother nature. Is in that heaven and hell are created on earth through the acts  that we take today?  Is in it that within every man there is good and bad, he could choose either one, then he will see the outcome of his choice.  How can we prevent man kind from going crazy over religion. How can we stop another religious killing field, under poor Gods name? What are your thoughts? Do you think man kind would to come its senses, before it is too late?   P.S. on the side  Do you think that Moses saw the God on mount Sina? Why would God go to top of the mountain? He created the earth, he could have been anywhere? why on top the mountain? Was it because people thought to see God you have to reach to the skies/heavens? Why God kept coming back to Middle East? Was it because they created God through their imagination?  Is that why Jewish people were told by God, they were the chosen ones?  Profit Mohammad was married to Khadijeh. She was a Jewish. She taught him how to trade. She probably taught him about Judaism. Quran is mostly copy right of Taurah (sp? old testement). Do you think God wrote Quran? Makeh was a trade city before Islam. Do you think it was made to be the center of Islamic world because Mohammad wanted to expand his trade business? Is that why  God has put his house in there?   I think this religious stuff has gone too far. All man kind are going to hurt from it if they do not wise up. Look at David Koresh, how that turned out? I am afraid in the bigger scale, the Jews and the Muslims will have the same ending!!!!!!!!

But you would be   perfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags, wouldn't you, since   it makes your other claim seem more plausible.  To which Awesley replied:   John, again, strawman techniques.  Do you feel you're losing it so you   have to stretch what I said and knock that down?  What I read said   nothing about what they fired.  And so I put nothing in there.  If you   need some help, let me know and I'l take your side of this for a   while.  You're not scoring here, you're boring here.  But why did you mention grenade launchers at all?  Because it supports the notion that the tanks shelled buildings.  And it supports that notion because it conjures images of troops launching fragmentary grenades.  But that too is ludicrous.    If tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit, people would have been   screaming about it for the past two and half decades.  I would know about   it.   Awesley relied:      Glad to know you're such an expert.  Nice to hear some an   authority.  I especially appreciate your basis of knowledge -- if it   had happened, you would have know it.  Since you are such an   authority, you probably know that people did scream about an alleged   massive cover-up in the number of people killed in the Detroit riot.   Some claimed 100+ dead, others said 300.  The offical number is 43 but   the Concise Columbia Encyclopedia says it was \\\"several\\\".  I've also   heard some things about that but I won't dare repeat them.  You'd   assert that I claimed they were truth.  Yes, if it happened I would have heard about it.  Everybody would have.  Army tanks don't fire their cannons in American cities in the 1960's without it becoming common knowledge, without minority leaders seizing on it and condemning it over and over again, without civil libertarians saying \\\"this has gone far enough.\\\"  So, yes, my never hearing of it was the basis for my disbelieving the claim.  Now I have more reasons to disbelieve it.  Not one poster has written to say, yes, I lived in Detroit at that time and everybody knew that the tanks had fired shells.  This is the UseNet.  If it had happened, somebody here would remember it.  Furthermore, your own research failed to come up with any support for the claim.  The claim is extraordinary and it has no supporting evidence, extraordinary or not.  Unless you count the brags of a couple of guardsmen shooting the shit.  I do not.    Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up.        Taking the tour after the riots, it was pretty easy to tell the    difference between Army and Guard troops.  Or so I recall from 26    years ago.  And I seem to recall it was the Army running the tanks.   So it would have been an Army cover-up.  Quibble.  Fine, it was an Army cover-up.  Six years in the Reserves has taught me the difference also.  But do you think that in two and half decades not one guilt-ridden participant has come forward and said \\\"yes, I shelled Americans,\\\" or \\\"I gave the orders to fire the cannons,\\\" or \\\"I helped cover it up\\\"?    If your mind is open enough to believe that, well, good for you.  I prefer   to live in reality.   And here in reality, I find it hard to believe that   those tanks even had any shells, much less fired them.  Awesley replied:     Given the level in destruction in Detroit, I'm quite willing to believe   that they did fire their guns.  Good.  Then we can drop the junk about you not claiming that they did.  Your belief fails a basic reality check: why isn't it known?  Awesley concludes:      Now then, we've bored the shit out of anyone whose bothered to read   this far and all you've managed to say is that you don't believe the   account I cited.  Actually, now we have established that I don't believe what you believe, as well as why I don't believe it.  And if it's boring, then I yield the last word to you, if you want it.  You may say anything you like with impunity--I am dropping the subject.\",\"*** 10 MONTH OLD POLK SYSTEM FOR SALE ***  Excellent condition 10 month old (proof available) Polk Monitor 4.6 bookshelf speakers are being offered for sale.

I've been using the standard Windows VGA driver with other similarly configured computers.  I am thinking that my problem is with the way Windows refreshes it's screen.  The problem is that once Windows has been envoked, the colors start changing themselves.  At first I thought it was hardware, but if you open a full screen DOS program from within the Windows session, you don't have any problems until you get back to Windows - however, when you initially return to Windows, the original colors get refreshed properly.  Also, it is not a uniform color change - so if you are in solitaire, the design on the back of the card maintains it's original color scheme, but the white fronts of the cards will turn grey, then blue, etc.  The color changes keep getting darker until finally everything is a dark purple-ish black.  If you pop out to DOS and exit back to Windows - the screen gets refreshed again.  If I don't log into Windows and just do DOS things from the Novell network, everything is fine.  I originally loaded the software by bouncing it down to the net from the other machine I had just finished configuring, then from the net to this machine.  When I ran into problems, I deleted everything on this machine and the net, and tried bouncing it again.  When that didn't work, I tried reloading Windows to no avail.

In the Brock2 model, Bill James calculated predicted RBIs as RBI=.235*(Total Bases) + Home Runs.  This  completely ignores the context, which was all that Brock2  could do, since context was unknown to it.  So I thought I'd take that idea as a starting point and look how good a fit to the data you get by comparing (RBI-Home Runs) to SLG*RISP.  I've started with team data, using data from the Elias's that I've picked up over the years when a) I could afford them and b) I could stomach the thought of increasing Elias's profits. That gave me the years 1984-1986, 1988, and 1990.  (I don't  have team RBIs for '87 or I could add that year.)  If you run a simple least squares fit to the data you get   (RBI-Home Runs) = 0.81*SLG*RISP.  The correlation between the LHS and the RHS is 0.86, which is significant at a ridiculously high level.  So, I feel like the fit is good at the team level.  I've no started to move on to  the player level and have looked at 4 players (Will Clark, Ozzie Smith, Joe Carter, and Don Mattingly).  I hope to  add quite a few more during my copious free time this year.  It doesn't do too badly, except the equation underpredicts the low HR hitter (Smith), which may be a fault of the model or it could just be Ozzie.  The results:                             RBI-HR          Years        Actual   Predicted Carter  (84-88,90)     400       402.6 Clark   (87,88,90,92)  269       269.6 Matt'ly (84-88,90)     471       460.8 Smith   (84-88,90)     317       280.6  I think we can make a case (and I hope to make it stronger) that RBIs can be predicted simply from knowing how a player slugs overall and how many men are in scoring position when he comes up.  More later, Harold\",\"   Well they don't export anywhere near 50% of their GNP. Mexico's perhaps but not their own. They actually export around the 9-10% mark. Similar to most developed countries actually. Australia exports a larger share of GNP as does the United States (14% I think off hand. Always likely to be out by a factor of 12 or more though) This would be immediately obvious if you thought about it.   It is their import routes that count. They can do without exports but they couldn't live without imports for any longer than six months if that.   Too true! But one that is unstable and hence a source of serious worry.

We are doing a bible study (at my college) on Revelations.  We have been doing pretty good as far as getting some sort of reasonable interpretation.  We are now on chapters 17 and 18 which talk about the woman on the beast and the fall of Babylon.  I believe the beast is the Antichrist (some may differ but it seems obvious) and the woman represents Babylon which stands for Rome or the Roman Catholic Church.

The assertion was made, unequivocally that no Christian ever sufferred for their faith by believing in the Resurrection.  Luke's account suggests otherwise, and in the absence of direct eyewitnesses who can claim that Luke is mistaken, then I suggest that this unequivocal assertion is suspect.    --  John G.

It was an answer to the claim that the witnesses couldn't be lying because they were willign to suffer for their beliefs. Thus it's not necessary to show that no Christian ever suffered for believing in the Resurrection.  Rather the issue is whether those who witnessed it did.  I do agree that the posting you're responding to shows that there can be liberal as well as conservative dogmatism.\",\"Archive-name: rec-autos/part5  [this article is one of a pair of articles containing commonly asked automotive questions; the other article contains questions more geared to the automotive enthusiast, and so is not crossposted to misc.consumers.  -- rpw]     [changes as of 14 April 1993: revised brake fluid section, as     non-silicone DOT-5 fluids are now apparently available -- rpw]                   Commonly Asked Automotive Questions   Tire Questions:  Q:  What do the funny numbers on the sides of my tires mean?  A:  Typically, you will see something like 195/60HR14.  the 195 is the     overall width of the tire in millimeters, the tread is usually     narrower.  The 60 is the `aspect ratio'; it indicates the height of the     sidewall of the tire relative to the overall width.  Our example tire     has a sidewall height of 0.60 * 195 ~= 117 mm.  The 14 is the wheel     diameter in inches; there are also some special tires called `TRX'     tires which have three digit metric wheel diameter designations, like     390, which is in millimeters.  The R means Radial, and the H is a speed     rating indicating the highest speed at which the tire, when properly     inflated and carrying an appropriate load, may safely operate.  Common     speed ratings are S (112MPH), T (118MPH), H (130MPH), and V (up to     150MPH.)      Recent changes to the method for specifying tire sizes move the speed     rating to a different part of the designation; you may therefore find     designations like 195/60R14 85H; the 85 indicates the per-tire load     associated with the speed rating -- exceeding this load in continuous     operation at the rated speed is dangerous practice.  What follows is     a table showing a number of `load indices' and corresponding maximum     per-tire loads:      Load Index       50   51   88   89   112   113   145   149   157     Max Load (Kg)   190  195  560  580  1120  1150  2900  3250  4125      Note that the usual mass vs. weight confusion occurs in this table.      In some cases, the letters P or LT may be found in front of a tire     size; the LT designation indicates Light Truck, and the P designation     indicates Passenger car.  If no letter is given, then the application     of the tire is Passenger car usage.  As far as I know, these letters     only appear in the US market.  The LT designation is prinicipally of     interest to owners of light trucks and other utility vehicles.  For     the owner of a passenger vehicle, there is no meaningful difference     between a tire with a P designation and one with no designation at     all.      If the aspect ratio is omitted, it is probably 80, but may be 78.      Tires with an MS (mud/snow) designation may have their speed rating     reduced by 20 km/h (about 12mph.)      There is an additional set of ratings on tires for temperature,     traction, and treadwear.  Temperature and Traction are graded     A, B, and C (with A the best and C the worst); treadwear is     a numeric rating.  These values are of limited value, as they     are assigned somewhat arbitrarily by tire manufacturers and are     thus not useful in comparing different brands of tires.  Q:  My car has tires with a funny size designation:  185/65HR390; can i put     normal tires on the car?  A:  Your tires are called TRX tires; they were devised by Michelin.     Because of a somewhat different bead design, they are incompatible     with normal tires; Michelin used a different diameter wheel for them     so that they could not be mounted on the wrong type wheel (and so that     more conventional tires could not be mounted on TRX type wheels.)     You will need to aquire different wheels to put a normal tire on your     car; it is barely possible to fit normal tires on TRX wheels, and horribly     dangerous to do so (the tires may simply peel off the rims in a corner,     or possibly blow out at high speed.)  TRX type tires are becoming hard     to find; in addition to Michelin, Avon makes suitable tires.  Goodyear     has apparently discontinued their line of TRX tires.  Q:  Can I rotate radials from side to side, or rotate them only on one side     of my car?  A:  Car and tire manufacturers have differing views on this subject; many     say that swapping radials between the left and right hand sides of a     car is now ok (this group includes Michelin and Goodyear); others     (for example, Pirelli and Nokia) will void warranties if such swapping     is done.  The best advice is to read your tire manual carefully before     rotating your tires, and stick to the manufacturer's recommendations.  Q:  How many snow tires should I buy, and if I buy 2, which end of the     car should I put them on?  A:  In short, 4, and both ends.  To explain, many drivers in areas that don't     get excessive snow or who don't drive agressively (or at all) in snow     conditions get away with only two snows on the drive wheels, but there     are circumstances where this can be dangerous practice.  With a rear     wheel drive car, you can choose between being able to start the car     going (a function of the rear axle) or stopping and turning the car     (a function of the front axle.)  In a front wheel drive car, you start,     stop, and turn with the front end.  The primary risk of putting the     snow tires on the front only is that if you have to put on the brakes     while going downhill, you run a serious risk of going downhill backwards.  Radar Detectors and Speed Limits:  Q:  Why aren't there any comments on Radar Detectors and Speed Limits     in this Q&A posting?  A:  Because questions about detectors and speed limits crossposted between     misc.consumers and rec.autos.* always start long, tedious, and pointless     flame wars.  If you want to talk about either of these topics, please     subscribe to rec.autos or alt.flame and keep it there.  Safety Equipment:  Q:  Do airbags really work?  A:  Preliminary statistics suggest the following:  Airbags work much     better than no belts; good 3 point belts alone work much better than     Airbags alone, and AirBags + 3 point belts work slightly better than     3 point belts alone.  The con to airbags is that some designs tend     to burn the driver's hands when venting the byproducts of the     explosion that occurs inside the bag, and that some designs (but     not all) may knock the driver's hands from the wheel, making retention     of control of the vehicle after the bag deflates more difficult.  Brake Questions:  Q:  Do I always need to get the rotors on my disk brakes turned?  Midas     always wants to do this.  A:  No.  There are specific conditions that mandate turning or replacing     rotors; some shops try and make a little extra money by replacing rotors     more often than is strictly necessary.  if the rotors are not warped     warped, and only lightly grooved, then there is no need to replace or     to turn them.  Note also that some rotors (the rotors on many Hondas     are a good example) are so narrow to begin with that it is not practical     to turn them; they must be replaced when they become too thin, warped,     or badly grooved.  Q:  They tell me I should downshift when braking to slow my car down.  Is     this really a good idea?  A:  It used to be a very good idea, back in the days of mediocre, fade     prone drum brakes.  In modern disc brake equipped cars, use of     downshifting to slow the car is not really necessary, except in cases     of long, steep downhill runs.  Otherwise, modern disc brakes are more     than adequate to stop a passenger car in all circumstances, and they     are much cheaper to repair than clutch linings.      On the other hand, many standard driver's license tests in the USA     still specify that the driver being tested downshift under braking; I     suggest that before taking a US driver's test, you either 1) learn to     do this smoothly (which takes some time and practice) or 2) borrow a     car with an automatic to take the test.  Q:  How often should I replace my brake fluid?  A:  Probably more often than you do.  Traditional brake fluids tend to     absorb water; this water can corrode internal parts of the brake     system and also lower the boiling point of the fluid.  DOT-3 type     are older fluids; DOT-4 and DOT-5 are newer specifications.  The     principal differences are in wet and dry boiling points; the dry     boiling point is important in fresh brake fluid, but the wet boiling     point is important in older brake fluid.  DOT-3 fluids have the lowest     wet and dry boiling point _requirements_; DOT-4 fluids have better     boiling point requirements; and DOT-5 fluids have the best boiling     point requirements (but DOT-5 fluids are not clearly superior; see     the next Q&A for more details.)  While the requirements imply that     DOT-4 fluids are better than DOT-3 fluids, there may be specific     cases where a DOT-3 fluid is preferable, but these are mostly     competition applications.  Otherwise, DOT-4 type fluids offer _much_     improved brake pedal feel.  Replacement once a year is recommended for     DOT-4 fluids, although agressive drivers may profit by changing out     fluid more frequently, or at least bleeding a modest amount of fluid     out of the brake calipers fairly regularly.  Q:  What about DOT-5 brake fluids?  A:  This breaks down in to two parts.  The DOT-5 specification looks     excellent for performance, but the first DOT-5 fluids were Silicone     based.  Silicone fluids are a tricky proposition.  Unlike DOT-3 and     DOT-4 fluids, they do not absorb water at all.  While this may sound     like a feature, the problem is that any water present pools up in     such systems, interfering with braking performance and corroding any     metals at the spot where the pooling is occuring.  The water will tend     to migrate downwards in the braking system to the brake calipers, where     most of the corrosion occurs.      Because of this phenomenon, it is essential when converting to     Silicone to empty the entire brake system and flush it throughly     beforehand; some even recommend replacing all rubber parts in the     brake system when converting to Silicone fluids.      Two other issues that come up with silicone fluids:  1) they are     difficult to pour cleanly (that is, without air bubbles), which     interferes with getting a good brake pedal feel, and 2) while they     generally have much higher boiling points than DOT-4 fluids, they     do have high temperature failure modes which are indistinguishable     in effect from boiling DOT-4 fluids.  SIlicone fluids may make sense     in some street car applications, but they are certainly not     recommended for high performance driving applications, and the     economics are questionable for street use.      I have recently become aware of new fluids that meet the DOT-5 standard     that do not contain Silicones; these fluids appear to be reasonably     compatible with the older DOT-3 and DOT-4 fluids, but I have little     information at this time.  Q:  ABS is available on some of the cars I'm looking at, but it costs     more.  Is it worth it?  A:  This does not have a cut and dried answer; therefore, this answer will     be quite long in order to cover the pros and cons.  The short answer     is that ABS costs more, both initially, and to maintain, will generally     work better for the `average driver' (that is to say, a driver who does     not have extensive experience in high performance driving techniques),     and may require the `unlearning' of some obsolete braking techniques     like pump braking which should be unlearned in any case.      Now for the long answer.  ABS works by monitering the wheels of the     car, looking for signs of locked brakes.  It may or may not be able     be able to distinguish between the different wheels (there are several     systems on the market.)  It cannot detect impending lockup (which is     what you would really want in an ideal world), but only the existence     of lockup.  The sensors used vary; some of the less well designed     sensors are sensitive to tire size, and to brake pad material, and     may cease to function properly if the owner deviates from original     equipment or OE-equivalent components.      When the sensors detect lockup, the ABS system responds by unlocking     the brakes (either individually, or all at once, depending on the     system.)  If the driver keeps their foot firmly planted, the ABS     will end up cycling between the locked and unlocked states (if a     sensor existed that could detect _impending lockup_, then we could     sit right at that point, which is where maximum braking effect is     achieved.)  This pulsing can often be felt in the brake pedal, as     the system cycles.  The percentage of the time that the brakes are     truly engaged is called the `duty cycle'; typically in an ABS system     this is about 40%  On dry pavement, a trained driver can beat this     duty cycle quite reliably using a technique called threshold braking;     on wet pavement, braking is so chancy that ABS will outperform     threshold braking nearly every time.  Unfortunately, on mud and on     snow, often maximum braking effect can be acheived with the brakes     locked; only Audi, of the manufacturers producing ABS-equipped cars,     has seen fit to provide a disable switch for the ABS system for this     eventuality.      A particularly important feature of ABS is that it preserves     steering control.  This is the case simply because, if you are     braking near the limit and turn the wheel, the ABS will release     the brakes if it sees steering-triggered lockup, and back off     on the percentage of the time that the brakes are applied.     Braking distances will lengthen accordingly.      An important caution:  ABS cannot exceed the maximum theoretical     braking force in any given situation; if you start sliding on     glare ice, don't expect an ABS system to help you out very much.     The coefficient of friction is not changed by the presence of an     ABS system in your car.      As far as maintenence goes, in addition to the potential     restrictions I've listed above, you have to worry about the     following:  1) parts costs are much higher; the OE master cylinder     for my obscure european sedan lists for $185, but the OE master     cylinder for the ABS-equipped version of the same car lists for     over $1000.  Most manufacturers explicitly forbid use of DOT-5     (silicone) brake fluids in ABS-equipped vehicles.  Because of     the potential cost of replacement of corroded brake system     components, regular (I suggest annual) replacement of brake fluid     becomes very important.  Q:  What about this threshold braking business?  A:  [normally, I'd not put this in the consumers Q&A, but recent     publicity about a number of accidents involving police drivers     in ABS-equipped Chevy Caprices suggests that this section is     needed here -- rpw]      Threshold braking is a technique practiced by all serious high     performance drivers; if made a habit, it replaces the `stab     the pedal and lock 'em up' panic habit entirely, and is much     to be prefered.  Basically, the premise is that tires generate     maximum braking force when they have just started to slide, but     just before the wheels lock up entirely.  Drivers who threshold     brake learn to feel what this `threshold' feels like, and learn     to search for it and hit it on the application of the brake     pedal.  In many cars, you can feel that you are near the     threshold when the pedal starts to firm up as you depress it.     In any case, if you can't hear the tires whine just a bit, you're     not very near the threshold.      In a car with ABS, often there is a twinge in the pedal just     before the system starts cycling; if the driver backs off on     the pedal just a tad when the twinge is felt, then they are very     close to the threshold and they'll probably achieve better     stopping distances than if they just punched it and let the ABS     take over.      Recently, there has been a rash of publicity over a number of     accidents, and one death, involving police cars equipped with     ABS systems.  The police departments in question quickly blamed     the new ABS systems, but according to Autoweek magazine, it now     seems clear that the problem was a lack of training; none of the     involved officers had any recent performance driving training.     There is reason to believe that the drivers reacted to the pulsing     brake pedal by `pump braking', an old and discredited technique     of stabbing and releasing the brake pedal, the goal being to     try and get brakes back with a failing hydraulic system.  If you     think about it for a minute, you'll realize that pump braking must     cut the effective operation of a working brake system by at least     1/2, so if you cut the 40% duty cycle of an ABS system by that     much, you are giving up most of your brakes for the wrong reason.     Threshold braking has the advantage in that it is an effective     and useful technique regardless of whether your car has ABS; if     you do fear a failed hydraulic system, then one or two stabs at     the pedal will be sufficient.      Gas Questions:  Q:  Does High Octane gasoline help?  A:  Maybe, maybe not.  Some cars have knock sensors, and can adjust the     engine timing or turbocharger boost to suit the gasoline being used.     On most cars, however, you should use the cheapest gas that makes your     car run well.  Check your owner's manual for details on what your car     needs.  Q:  My car was made for leaded gasoline.  Will unleaded gas hurt it?  A:  It is possible that unleaded gas may *slightly* increase valve wear,     although the Amoco Oil company argues otherwise.  The actual increase     in valve wear will be almost unnoticeable, however, as modern leaded     gasolines actually contain very little lead.  You should, however,     check your owner's manual; many cars from the early 1970s do not     actually require leaded gasoline.  Q:  Do fuel treatments help?  What kind should I use?  A:  Some do and some don't.  During the winter, it is a good idea to use     dry gas; however, some may be harmful to fuel injection systems.     Never use an additive containing Methanol (sometimes called Methyl     Alcohol); such additives may damage fuel systems in cars with carbs     and almost certainly will damage cars with fuel injection.      Manufacturer's opinions vary on additives containing Ethanol (sometimes     called Ethyl Alcohol); if your car has fuel injection, check the owner's     manual on your car before  using these.  Most manufacturers consider     10% Ethanol acceptable in gasoline.  Additives with Isopropyl Alcohol     (Isopropanol), and Petroleum  Distillates are fine in fuel injected     cars.      An occasional bottle of fuel injector cleaner is helpful in cars with     fuel injectors, although many premium gasolines contain detergents that     do the same job.  Some off brands of fuel injector cleaners contain     Ethanol or Methanol; always check the ingredients before putting anything     in your gas tank.      There are a small number of particularly good additives; these are     noticeably more expensive that the run-of-the-mill ones, but work     much, much better.  Among these are Chevron Techron, Redline SL-1,     Wurth `Lubrimoly Ventil Sauber', and BG 44K.  A bottle of one of these,     once every six months, is highly recommended.  Q:  What about detergent gasolines?  A:  The quality of detergent packages in gasolines varies somewhat; BMW     has instituted a testing program, and gasoline brands which pass this     test may advertise that fact.  Stickers indicating passage of the test     are now beginning to appear on fuel pumps at gas stations.  If such     gasolines are used, then fuel injector cleaners are probably optional.     Beforewarned that while use of BMW approved gasolines will keep a clean     engine clean, they may not clean a motor with bad valve deposits.  Lubrication Questions:  Q:  What do the numbers and letters in a motor oil designation mean?  A:  There are several different items encoded.  There is a two-letter     code indicating the type of detergent package that the manufacturer      uses in the oil; this looks like SE,SF,CD or such.  The S codes are     for gasoline engine applications; the C codes are for diesel engine     applications.  The second letter is assigned in sequence as new levels     of protection are developed; thus SF is considered better than SE,     SE is considered better than SD, and so forth.      The more noticeable designation is the oil weight.  This is either     a single number (e.g., 30 weight) or a pair of numbers separated by     the letter W (e.g., 10W30.)  The latter type is much more commonly     used these days, and are the only type that most automobile     manufacturers specify in operators manuals.  The first number in the     designation (10W) is the apparent viscosity of the oil when it is cold;     the W stands for `winter'.  The second number (30) is the viscosity     of the oil when hot.  There is a trick here; the oil doesn't actually     get thicker (turn from 10 weight to 30 weight) as it gets hotter.  What     is actually happening is that when the oil is cold, it has the viscosity     of a cold 10 weight oil.  as it gets hotter, it doesn't get thin as fast     as a 10W oil would; by the time it is up to temperature, it has the     viscosity of a hot 30 weight oil.      Note that these numbers actually specify ranges of viscosities; not     all 10W oils have exactly the same viscosity when cold, and not all     30 weight oils have the same viscosity when hot.  Note also that the     novel behaviour of multi-grade oils is caused by additives, and it has     been reported that with the sole exception of Castrol GTX, 10W40 oils     do not retain their multi-grade characteristics well over time.  10W30,     15W40, and 20W50 oils work very well, though.  Q:  Are `quick lube' places any good?  A:  Some do adequate work, but there are quite a few incompetent ones out     there.  Let the buyer beware, watch them while they work, make sure     that they don't overtorque the oil drain plug, and keep your hand on     your wallet at all times.  Q:  Are oil additives like Slick-50 or Tufoil any good?  A:  Slick-50 and Tufoil are PTFE-based additives.  Many of these have     come onto the market recently; they are different from the moly-based     additives that have been around since the early 50's.  PTFE is the     chemical name for Teflon(TM), a trademark owned by DuPont. In general,     auto manufacturers do not recommend use of these products.  Most USENET     responses to questions on these additives are favorable (slight     increase of MPG after application, smoother revving) but long term     results (whether PTFE additives are effective after 5K miles) are     debatable.  Some manufacturers (such as Saab) claim that either the     product or the engine flush that preceeds application causes     deterioration of the oil seals and eventual leakage.  Some BMW owners     have reported death of valve seals shortly after the addition of     Slick 50 to their cars.  This writer has been cautioned by a Slick-50     Dealer (!) that Slick-50 should _not_ be used in Japanese motors, as     it may clog the oil return passages in the engine.  Otherwise, there are     no known reports of damage caused by PTFE additives.      On the other hand, there are satified Slick 50 customers in the world.  Q:  Do synthetic oils really work?  A:  Yes, but.  More specifically, most auto manufactuers accept synthetics,     but disagree with the extremely long oil change intervals claimed by     oil manufacturers.  Auto manufacturers recommend that you continue to     change oil at the intervals recommended in the owners manual for your     car.  Even if you decide to try the longer intervals, at least change     the oil filter at regular intervals, as synthetics get just as dirty     as conventional oils.      Synthetic gear lubricants for manual transmissions are another matter     entirely; Amsoil, Redline, and AGIP are very highly regarded and very     effective.  Mobil 1 synthetic gear lube gets mixed reviews, however.  Q:  Manufacturers are specifying longer and longer oil change intervals.     How often should I change my oil?  A:  It depends on how you drive.  If your car always (or nearly always)     gets warmed up, and you don't drive it very hard and keep the revs     down, the manufacturer's recommendation is probably fine.  If, however,     you drive it hard, drive it at high revs, or alternatively, if you     only drive it to and from the supermarket so that it doesn't get up     to temperature, then you may wish to change oil much more often,     perhaps at 3000 mile intervals (given that most manufacturers are     now specifying 7500 mile intervals.)  If you don't drive your car     much at all (say 7500 miles a year), then you probably want to change     oil every six months anyway.  If you are storing a car during the winter,     then change oil before storing it and change oil when you bring it out     of storage.  Misc. Questions:  Q:  My car has a timing belt.  I hear that bad things happen when they     break.  What's the story?  A:  It depends on the internal design of the motor.  Early Ford Escorts,     for example, will suffer severe valve damage if the belt breaks, but     the newer cars will just require a tow and installation of a new belt.     Some Honda motors will not be damaged, but others will be.      If no replacement interval is specified for your car, then change the     belt at least every 60,000 miles; some cars may require more frequent     replacement.  Ask your dealer or independent mechanic.  Also, ask if     there are any related repairs that should take place at the same time     (for example, the same Ford Escorts that suffer valve damage also have     a timing belt driven water pump, which has been known to seize,     destroying the timing belt, and which then causes major valve damage     as a side effect.  Replacing the timing belt while ignoring the water     pump can be a costly mistake.)  Q:  Why would anyone be stupid enough to design a motor so that it     self destructs when the timing belt breaks?  A:  For performance reasons.  Compromising piston design so that the     valves and pistons will not collide requires that the compression     ratio of the engine be reduced significantly; this is why you are     more likely to avoid valve damage in economy cars than in performance     oriented vehicles.  Q:  What causes Unintended Acceleration?  A:  The final report of the National Highway, Transportation, and Safety     Administration concluded that unintended acceleration could not be     caused by any mechanical failure of the vehicle in question and at the     same time be consistent with the physical evidence.  The NHTSA report     goes on to conclude that `pedal misapplication' by the vehicle operator     is probably the cause.\",\"Since I'm not all too keen on this area of hooking them up, I'm  asking for help.

I have come across a few that look good:    Zapp 1.1 from Inmark   Zinc 3.5 from Zinc software   C++/Views from Liant   Win++ from Blaise  Some considerations I'm using:    Being new to Windows programming (I'm from the UNIX/X world), the quality and intuitivness of the abstraction that these class libraries provide is very  important.  However, since I'm not adverse to learning the internals of Windows programming, the new programming methodology should be closely aligned with the native one.  I don't believe arbitrary levels of abstraction, just for the sake of changing the API, are valuable.    Since we will be developing for the 32bit Windows NT system the memory management issues and issues particular to the Windows 3.1 API are less important.     We will probably buy another C++ class library (something like Tools.h++ or Booch components from Rational) to handle data structures and other miscellaneous stuff  (allocators etc...).  So those features are not that important for this toolkit to have.  The two that I have narrowed it down to are ZApp and Zinc, they seem to be the two toolkits that have received the most attention from the media.  I was wondering if anyone had any first-hand experience with any of these toolkits (especially ZApp and Zinc).  A couple of observations about these toolkits that seem particularly noteworthy are:  ZApp ----   Seems to have the most extensive coverage of Windows functionality and     also includes some other miscellaneous useful classes.   Has new fancy 3D-style controls available, and support for custom controls.   Has a Windows NT version (Essential)   Redirectable graphics display/output architecture (useful for printing)   Sizer class for automatically managing control layout after resize.   Seems to be the newcomer, this could be an advantage in designing a better system.   Zinc ----   Has a platform independent resource strategy.  (Not too important for me right now)   Comes with a interface builder tool   Has a Windows NT version (Essential)   Seems to have been around longer (more mature), but grew up out of a DOS version.

Thiokol provided me with samples and data on a reinforcement to solid motor grains for high accelerations.  Solid motor propellants usually have a substantial percentage of  aluminum in the mix.  For example, the Space Shuttle SRBs are 16 percent Aluminum.  The technique is to use a 'foamed aluminum' structure. The structure looks like the inverse of a set of bubbles (an I suspect some bubbling process is used to form it).  In other words, if you made a bunch of bubbles in molten aluminum, then froze it, this is what you get.  It forms a strong network of effectively aluminum wires in all directions.  The remaining solid fuel mix is infiltrated into the voids, and you get aluminum-reinforced solid propellant.  The foamed-aluminum makes up about 6 percent of the total propellant, so there is still aluminum particles in the bulk grain.  The major improvement is the higher resistance to grain cracking, which is the principal failure mode for solid propellant.  Dani Eder \",\" I don't find this a credible argument, for two reasons.  One you have supplied below: unless I care about entering the USA at any time in the future (eg. the Taiwanese backyard cloners - who BTW have been known to decap custom silicon and reproduce it on daughterboards when pirating high-profit arcade machines and the like - who wouldn't care less), I am not  going to care much about US confidentiality, am I?  Only people like the real me, who does care about travelling to various countries for business reasons, will sit up and follow laws like this, but I would contend that we're not the main threat.  I also have grave doubts whether an algorythm widely distributed in silicon could possibly be called \\\"classified.\\\"  It's like handing out military secrets to the whole world in envelopes marked \\\"don't open me.\\\"  I can imagine several credible defences which could be employed if it came to a trial.  One would be the stupidity of the government's actions.   Amusing thought: could they have employed an algorythm which is infeasable for a fast software implementation, but which is easy in custom hardware? In DES, the extensive use of permutation tables (trivial in hardware: you just swap bus lines), but relatively slow in software have had a big effect on the speed difference between hardware and software implementations of that cipher (indeed, I suspect that Lucifer's designers were well aware that it would be, and approved.)  Certain algorythms (usually parallel search algorythms) can be very slow in software, yet can fly in custom hardware. I have no proof of their employment in Clipper -- it is pure conjecture.   However, as a software implementation of this cipher is something that its  designers would have been trying to avoid at all costs, then the inclusion  of such techniques seems credible.  Hmmm... I also wonder what Intergraph thinks about the use of the name \\\"Clipper\\\" for this device. :) \",\" In case anyone missed it, I'm reposting this and I'm also selling some other stuff.

And, as long as I'm posting (end of car stuff),  o Miscellaneous Darkroom Equipment ........................ $75.00      Solar enlarger (several objective lenses) with easel and       timer, negative carriers for 35mm and 2 1/4 x 3 1/4, misc.      printing masks.  Developing tanks, thermometer, trays,       constant-temperature bath, ground glass, mirrors, darkroom      lamps, glassware, el-cheap-o tripods..... and (as they say)                              MUCH   MORE!   o Beautiful Antique Buffet ............................... $1500.00      Solid cherry (no veneer).  Handmade, with very interesting      dovetail corners in the drawers.  Built (we think) around       1880.  Not gaudy or covered with gew-gaws; a simple, elegant       piece of furniture, but too big (60\\\" long, 37\\\" tall, 24\\\"       deep) for our little Cape Cod house.   Will deliver pricier items (ie, over $10) anywhere in the Rochester  area.  (And will consider delivering the others.)  Will deliver any  of it on UofR Campus between now and graduation.\",\"   --Minnesota definitely deserves an NHL franchise!!!  You'll see the Minnesota Whalers pretty soon, so fear not Minnesota fans.  No Norm Green, 'cept for the team color (sorry, bad pun!)     --What a difference two years makes!  Minnesota finished 29-37-14 in 1992 and made the finals.  They finish with a better record at  38-38-10 thi year and move to Dallas.  Every team in the playoffs has a winning record!!! Finally!!!  It's about time, NHL!!!\",\"I've just managed to get xdm running from an NCR 3000 (an SVR4 486 box running XFree86 1.2) to my NCD XDisplay.  It's pretty much working, but I'm encountering a weird error.  I'm attempting to start an xterm from my .xsession file, but nothing happens.  Redirecting stderr to a file using 'exec 2>$HOME/.xerrors' in .xsession reveals the error message:    \\\"xterm: Error 14, errno 1: Not owner\\\"  Now, if I start xterm from the window manager, or from the command line, it works fine.  And starting other clients, like the window manager (mwm), and a clock, from my .xsession also works.  Anyone encountered this?  Suggestions?  aTdHvAaNnKcSe\",\"      I meant to comment on this at the time.  There's just no way baserunning could be that important - if it was, runs created wouldn't be nearly as accurate as it is.    Runs Created is usually about 90-95% accurate on a team level, and there's a lot more than baserunning that has to account for the remaining percent.\",\"I need information on the Display PostScript strokeadjust feature. This feature adjusts the endpoints of lines so that the displayed line looks better on low resolution devices.  The PostScript literature explains the process to some extent.  They also give an example of how to \\\"emulate\\\" strokeadjust in PostScript environments where it is absent.  The suggested emulation is to modify the coordinates of the endpoints of a line using the following formula for each coordinate:   new_coord = (round (old_coord - 0.25)) + 0.25   Doing this we end up with all coordinates ending in \\\".25\\\".  From reading I thought that what they might actually do is:   new_coord = ((trunc (old_coord * 2)) / 2) + 0.25   This results in all the coordinates ending in either \\\"0.25\\\" or \\\"0.75\\\"  whichever is closer.  By doing some actual comparisons with Display PostScript, I find that neither of these is what DPS really uses.  Since I like how the DPS result looks better than how my stuff looks, I'd like to know if anyone who knows how DPS does it is willing/able to tell me.  Thanks,\",\"  Oh, yeah.  Dave Winfield--marginal player.  Guy didn't hit a lick, had negligible power, was a crap fielder and had no staying power.  Dave Winfield, now entering his (I believe) 20th big league season, is still a damn decent hitter.  Admittedly, his defense has slipped a great deal, but in his prime, he had a powerful arm and great range.  Take a look at the stats:  I don't  know where you even BEGIN to make an argument that Winfield and Kingman are similar players.  Kingman was a one-dimension power hitter--he couldn't field, he ran like an anvil, hit for a low average (though, if I remember right, his OBP wasn't THAT hideous...), and (for those who consider such things important) was a absolute-primo-dick.    Eddie Murray?  Yup, only the best 1st baseman of the 80's.  I know that MVP votes are conducted by mediots, but given that he got jobbed out of the MVP he deserved in 1983, it seems that he wasn't overrated by the media.    Lee Smith?  Hmmmm... This one's actually pretty close.  He's had a s solid, dependable career as a closer despite pitching in some nasty parks  (Wrigley, Fenway...).  I'd have to take a closer look at the stats (it's been  a while), but it seems Lee Arthur is of HOF caliber.    You do make a legitimate point about the HOF credentials of relievers, simply racking up a lot of saves doesn't mean a whole hell of a lot if you  blow a bunch, too.  Simply because Minnesota and Boston and (for a month) Atlanta used Reardon as a closer for longer than he should have been one,  the Equalizer has racked up an impressive number of saves.  No way should  HomerMan be in the HOF, IMHO.  Darrell Evans?  Nice career, actually a bit underrated (kinda like Ted Simmons, IMHO), but not a HOF'er.    Lemme ask you this.  Who the hell playing the game ISN'T marginal?    Now, wait a goddamn minute here.  Ozzie Smith absolutely REDEFINED the position of shortstop.  His defense was SO good that he's won something along the lines of 10 Gold Gloves.  Again, Gold Gloves are mediot-biased, and a  good argument could be made that Larkin deserved one or two of Ozzie's more recent awards, but usually, this is tempered by someone else in the early 80's getting the Gold Gloves Ozzie deserved earlier in his career.  Ozzie's offense, you ask?  Good OBP, great speed numbers, in a park which, for most of his career, depressed offense, admittedly, no power ('cept against Tom Niedenfuer :-|), but still, a definite asset offensively.  Yount?  3,000 hits, MVP at two different positions, uh-huh, a real stiff.  His '82 was one of the great years EVER by a player in recent memory, and probably ranks behind only the peak seasons of Wagner and Banks, as far as SS numbers go.  He's a clear HOF'er, IMHO.    Well, as far as Garvey goes, you're right.  Garvey is a \\\"mediot\\\"  candidate, pushed because of his \\\"winning attitude\\\" (a minor factor, if one at all), and his \\\"great defense\\\" (no errors, admittedly, but the range of a tree stump...).  Garvey shouldn't be in the HOF.  SkyJack?  I've said a lot of nasty things about SkyJack in the last year or so, but this is mostly in response to mediots and woofers who talk about Morris' \\\"ability to win\\\" which is nothing more than Morris' \\\"ability to pitch when Toronto to score tons of runs\\\".  At this point, Morris is an average pitcher (although from his early returns in '93, he may be damned  close to done.).  But, in all fairness, Morris was a dominant pitcher in the 80's for up-and-down Tiger teams.  While 1984 was (obviously) a great year for Detroit, the rest of the decade, the team was generally in contention, but not favorites.  Morris' career numbers are quite good, and worthy of HOF \\\"consideration\\\".    Ryan?  Of course, but be careful.  I guarantee you that someone will throw back your earlier logic about \\\"Yount and Smith being shortstops who  hung around a long time\\\".  After all, Nolan never won a Cy...  Damn, he's  just pitcher who hung around for 99 years...  His W-L record is mediocre... (Of course, Nolan's a HOF'er...)  Puck?  Probably, although he's got to play reasonably well for a few more years (10 years, even good ones, aren't enough to make the HOF, most likely).  That said, I believe Puckett WILL make the HOF, pretty much regardless of how the rest of his career turns out (barring something REALLY  tragic or sudden).  He's very popular in the media and with fans, and legitimately has been one of the best CF's in the game since he joined the league.  I've always liked the guy, and I hope he does make it.  And, in the end, I think the Puck will make it in.  But, really, it's too early to sell.   This debate comes up rather frequently on the net, and, believe it  or not, I never tire of it.  It's an interesting subject.  Here's an off the top of my head list of potential HOF'ers from each team.  I probably left a couple of guys off, so feel free to follow up.  I won't consider ANYONE who started playing after about 1985 (again, too early to tell.) [Note: these are all active players, I'm not counting recent retirees]  Baltimore:  Cal Ripken (should be a lock by now, even if Gehrig's record stands) Boston: Roger Clemens (might be a lock already, which is amazing), Dawson (?) Detroit: Alan Trammell and Lou Whitaker (possibilities) Milwaukee: Robin Yount (discussed earlier) New York: Wade Boggs (possibly), Mattingly (long shot) Toronto: Paul Molitor and Jack Morris (possibilities)  Kansas City: George Brett (lock) Minnesota: Kirby (too early to tell), Winfield (lock) Oakland: Eckersley (lock), McGwire (too early), Rickey (lock), Welch (LONG shot) Texas: The Mighty Nolan [Too early to consider Canseco or Strange :-)]  Cubs: Sandberg (lock) St. Louis: Ozzie (lock), Lee Smith (probably) New York: Murray (almost a lock), Saberhagen (obviously, he's got to regain              past form) [And most certainly, NOT Vince Coleman, despite what he'll tell you :-)]  Los Angeles: Butler, Strawberry, and Hershiser are all long shots. San Diego: Tony Gwynn (pretty good shot) Colorado: Dale Murphy (a good shot), Ryan Bowen (just to see if you're awake)   [Before I get flames: this is an off-the-top-of-the-head list, there's probably a few deserving candidates that I left off, and, I didn't include Barry Bonds, Will Clark, Any Atlanta Starting Pitcher, Frank Thomas, Canseco, McGriff, etc. because I only considered guys who started playing before 1985)]   E-mail or post, I almost fear what I may have started here... \",\" Question: If a team uses 40 players in a season do you merely divide the total +/- by 40?  If so, a player who plays in only 1 game is considered equally valuable as a player who plays in all of them.   Since the standard deviation for each team is different, I am unsure how  \\\"transferable\\\" between teams that these stats are.  Shouldn't the average standard deviation in the league be used?  I am interested in seeing each method. But I still think that mine is the best. If for no other reason than familiarity.\",\" : > Does anyone have any  other suggestions where the 42 came from?  Yep, here's a theory that I once heard bandied around.  Rather than thinking of the number think of the sound. For Tea Two.

Over Easter I increased the memory from 4Meg to 8Meg, and found that POVray reboots the system every time under DOS5.  I had a go at running POVray in a DOS window when running Win3.1 on the same system and it now works fine, even if a lot slower.  I would like to go back to  using POVray directly under DOS, anyone any ideas???  John\",\"      Better yet, instead of thrashing around on the DOS file system, take it a step further.  Write yourself a minimal \\\"file system\\\" program that is used to create/delete files, en/decrypt them to ramdisk, list a directory. Put the util, password protected, on a floppy.     The catch is that the storage space used by this util is NOT part of the DOS file system.  Instead, defrag your disk, thus packing all allocated clusters into clusters 0-n.  Then use the back end of the partition to hold your 'stealth' file system.  Or, leave a small 2nd partition on the disk that is not assigned to DOS.  Another approach might be to use a directory that contains a set of invariant files (DOS system files, for instance).  Due to DOS allocating a minimum storage  unit of a \\\"cluster\\\" there is unused physical space on the disk between the tail end of each file and the end of its associated cluster. These dead spaces could be concatenated and used to hold your stealth file system.     Now you have a situation where no encrypted data \\\"appears\\\" on your disk at all :-). \",\"From what I've seen in my 17 years as an MOA member, most of the folks in the RA are also in the MOA... I guess it's called covering all the bases to get some idea of what is really happening.. How else does one think the RA gets all the juicey news about what's happen' inside the  MOA?\",\"  Just want to back this up with a personal anecdote.  My grandparents have a Navajo rug made in the 1920's, which they received in trade  from the weaver while living in Flagstaff, Arizona.  The decorative motif consists of 4 large black swastikas, one in each corner.  What's more, the color scheme is black, white, and red.  To the casual glance it would undoubtedly appear to be a Nazi relic of some kind.  Yet they owned it ten years before Hitler and the National Socialists came to power.    As I recall, they took it down in the 30's, and didn't feel quite right about putting it back up until the 60's.  It still draws comments from  those who don't know what it is.  --ccm  --  Christopher C. May * U. of Ariz.

Larson's comprehensive            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he            calls the \\\"Reciprocal System\\\", is built on two fundamental            postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of            space and time:                      (1) \\\"The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE            component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE            UNITS, and in two RECIPROCAL forms, SPACE and TIME.\\\"                      (2) \\\"The physical universe conforms to the relations of            ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its magnitudes are            ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN.\\\"                      From these two postulates, Larson developed a COMPLETE            Theoretical Universe, using various combinations of            translational, vibrational, rotational, and vibrational-           rotational MOTIONS, the concepts of IN-ward and OUT-ward            SCALAR MOTIONS, and speeds in relation to the Speed of Light            (which Larson called \\\"UNIT VELOCITY\\\" and \\\"THE NATURAL            DATUM\\\").                        At each step in the development, Larson was able to            MATCH objects in his Theoretical Universe with objects in the            REAL physical universe, (photons, sub-atomic particles            [INCOMPLETE ATOMS], charges, atoms, molecules, globular star            clusters, galaxies, binary star systems, solar systems, white            dwarf stars, pulsars, quasars, ETC.), even objects NOT YET            DISCOVERED THEN (such as EXPLODING GALAXIES, and GAMMA-RAY            BURSTS).                            And applying his Theory to his NEW model of the atom,            Larson was able to precisely and accurately CALCULATE inter-           atomic distances in crystals and molecules, compressibility            and thermal expansion of solids, and other properties of            matter.

Some of the early            books are out of print now, but still available through            inter-library loan.                      \\\"The Structure of the Physical Universe\\\" (1959)                      \\\"The Case AGAINST the Nuclear Atom\\\" (1963)                     \\\"Beyond Newton\\\" (1964)                      \\\"New Light on Space and Time\\\" (1965)                      \\\"Quasars and Pulsars\\\" (1971)                      \\\"NOTHING BUT MOTION\\\" (1979)                      [A $9.50 SUBSTITUTE for the $8.3 BILLION \\\"Super                                                              Collider\\\".]                      [The last four chapters EXPLAIN chemical bonding.]                 \\\"The Neglected Facts of Science\\\" (1982)                       \\\"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\\\" (1984)                     [FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL astrophysical                                                             mysteries.]                        \\\"BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER\\\" (1988)                 All but the last of these books were published by North            Pacific Publishers, P.O. Box 13255, Portland, OR  97213, and            should be available via inter-library loan if your local            university or public library doesn't have each of them.                  Several of them, INCLUDING the last one, are available            from: The International Society of Unified Science (ISUS),            1680 E. Atkin Ave., Salt Lake City, Utah  84106.  This is the            organization that was started to promote Larson's Theory.             They have other related publications, including the quarterly            journal \\\"RECIPROCITY\\\".                         Physicist Dewey B. Larson's Background                     Physicist Dewey B. Larson was a retired Engineer            (Chemical or Electrical).  He was about 91 years old when he            died in May 1989.  He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in            Engineering Science from Oregon State University.  He            developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE            chemical properties based only on the elements used.                      Larson's lack of a fancy \\\"PH.D.\\\" degree might be one            reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is            NOT A VALID REASON.  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider            to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES.  At the same            time, it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX            physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer,            well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC            ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, ETC..                       Larson did NOT have the funds, etc. to experimentally            test his Theory.  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so.             He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER            researchers' experimental and observational data.  And in            many cases, HIS explanation FIT BETTER.                      A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX            physicists and astronomers have!  They CLAIM to be looking            for a \\\"unified field theory\\\" that works, but have been            IGNORING one for over 30 years now!                      \\\"Modern physics\\\" does NOT explain the physical universe            so well.  Some parts of some of Larson's books are FULL of            quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who            agree.  And remember that \\\"epicycles\\\", \\\"crystal spheres\\\",            \\\"geocentricity\\\", \\\"flat earth theory\\\", etc., ALSO once SEEMED            to explain it well, but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG.                           Prof. Frank H. Meyer, Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior,            was/is a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson's Theory, and was (or            still is) President of Larson's organization, \\\"THE            INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE\\\", and Editor of            their quarterly Journal \\\"RECIPROCITY\\\".  He moved to            Minneapolis after retiring.                   \\\"Super Collider\\\" BOONDOGGLE!                           I am AGAINST contruction of the \\\"Superconducting Super            Collider\\\", in Texas or anywhere else.  It would be a GROSS            WASTE of money, and contribute almost NOTHING of \\\"scientific\\\"            value.                      Most physicists don't realize it, but, according to the            comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist            Dewey B. Larson, as described in his books, the strange GOOFY            particles (\\\"mesons\\\", \\\"hyperons\\\", ALLEGED \\\"quarks\\\", etc.)            which they are finding in EXISTING colliders (Fermi Lab,            Cern, etc.) are really just ATOMS of ANTI-MATTER, which are            CREATED by the high-energy colliding beams, and which quickly            disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible            with their environment.                      A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a            few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not            seen there before, and the physicists will be EVEN MORE            CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW!                      Are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $8.3            BILLION cost?!!  Don't we have much more important uses for            this WASTED money?!                            Another thing to consider is that the primary proposed            location in Texas has a serious and growing problem with some            kind of \\\"fire ants\\\" eating the insulation off underground            cables.  How much POISONING of the ground and ground water            with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of            the \\\"Supercollider\\\"?!                                 Naming the \\\"Super Collider\\\" after Ronald Reagon, as            proposed, is TOTALLY ABSURD!  If it is built, it should be            named after a leading particle PHYSICIST.                     LARSONIAN Anti-Matter                           In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe, anti-matter is NOT a simple case of            opposite charges of the same types of particles.  It has more            to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the            photons of which they are made, in relation to the            vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light,            which Larson calls \\\"Unit Velocity\\\" and the \\\"Natural Datum\\\".                       In Larson's Theory, a positron is actually a particle of            MATTER, NOT anti-matter.  When a positron and electron meet,            the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their            respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each            other.                        In Larson's Theory, the ANTI-MATTER half of the physical            universe has THREE dimensions of TIME, and ONLY ONE dimension            of space, and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our            MATERIAL half.                      LARSONIAN Relativity                           The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury            has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the            rate of 574 seconds of arc per century.  531 seconds of this            advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational            perturbations from the other planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter,            etc.).  The remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to            help \\\"prove\\\" Einstein's \\\"General Theory of Relativity\\\".                      But the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieved results            CLOSER to the 43 seconds than \\\"General Relativity\\\" can, by            INSTEAD using \\\"SPECIAL Relativity\\\".  In one or more of his            books, he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH            ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury.                      Larson TOTALLY REJECTED \\\"General Relativity\\\" as another            MATHEMATICAL FANTASY.  He also REJECTED most of \\\"Special            Relativity\\\", including the parts about \\\"mass increases\\\" near            the speed of light, and the use of the Lorentz Transform on            doppler shifts, (Those quasars with red-shifts greater than            1.000 REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT,            although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME.).                       In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe, there are THREE dimensions of time instead            of only one.  But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured            from our material half of the physical universe.  The one            dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time.  At low            relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are            NEGLIGIBLE; but at high speeds, they become significant, and            the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR.            [Larson often used the term \\\"COORDINATE TIME\\\" when writing            about this.]                            In regard to \\\"mass increases\\\", it has been PROVEN in            atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near            the speed of light.  But the formula for acceleration is            ACCELERATION = FORCE / MASS, (a = F/m).  Orthodox physicists            are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR: FORCE.  In Larson's Theory,            mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero.  FORCE is            actually a MOTION, or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS, or RELATIONS            BETWEEN MOTIONS, including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS.             The expansion of the universe, for example, is an OUTward            SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of            the so-called \\\"Big Bang\\\" (which is yet another MATHEMATICAL            FANTASY).                                                                 THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION                 I wish to recommend to EVERYONE the book \\\"THE UNIVERSE            OF MOTION\\\", by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North Pacific            Publishers, (P.O. Box 13255, Portland, Oregon  97213), 456            pages, indexed, hardcover.                      It contains the Astrophysical portions of a GENERAL            UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by that            author, an UNrecognized GENIUS, more than thirty years ago.                      It contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL Astrophysical            mysteries, including the FORMATION of galaxies, binary and            multiple star systems, and solar systems, the TRUE ORIGIN of            the \\\"3-degree\\\" background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma-           ray bursts, and the TRUE NATURE of quasars, pulsars, white            dwarfs, exploding galaxies, etc..                      It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL            looking for, if they are ready to seriously consider it with            OPEN MINDS!                      The following is an example of his Theory's success:            In his first book in 1959, \\\"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL            UNIVERSE\\\", Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING            GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding            them.  They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson's            comprehensive Theory.  And when QUASARS were discovered, he            had an immediate related explanation for them also.                    GAMMA-RAY BURSTS                 Astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching            their heads about the mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS.  They were            originally thought to originate from \\\"neutron stars\\\" in the            disc of our galaxy.  But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in            Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions            uniformly, and their source locations in space do NOT            correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of            directional coincidence).                      Gamma-ray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by            the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson.  According to page 386 of            his book \\\"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\\\", published in 1984, the            gamma-ray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the            ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls            the \\\"Cosmic Sector\\\".  Because of the relationship between the            anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and            the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can            pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at            random.  (This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do            not correspond with known objects, and come from all            directions uniformly.)                      I wonder how close to us in space a source location            would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most            life on Earth!  There would be NO WAY to predict one, NOR to            stop it!                      Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past, which            are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were            actually caused by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS!                   LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation                           About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the            vicinity of the sun are binary or double.  But orthodox            astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory            theory about how they form or why there are so many of them.                      But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY            CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of            the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey            B. Larson.                      I will try to summarize Larsons explanation, which is            detailed in Chapter 7 of his book \\\"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\\\"            and in some of his other books.                      First of all, according to Larson, stars do NOT generate            energy by \\\"fusion\\\".  A small fraction comes from slow            gravitational collapse.  The rest results from the COMPLETE            ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements (heavier than IRON).  Each            element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT.  The heavier the            element is, the lower is this limit.  A star's internal            temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and            absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually            reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and            lighter elements.                      When the internal temperature of the star reaches the            destructive temperature limit of IRON, there is a Type I            SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION!  This is because there is SO MUCH iron            present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms            and the atom building process, which Larson explains in some            of his books [better than I can].                      When the star explodes, the lighter material on the            outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less            than the speed of light.  The heavier material in the center            portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to            the speed of light, because of the high temperature.  The            explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light, and            it expands OUTWARD IN TIME, which is equivalent to INWARD IN            SPACE, and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while.                      Over long periods of time, both masses start to fall            back gravitationally.  The material that had been blown            outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star.  The            material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a            WHITE DWARF star.  BOTH stars then start moving back toward            the \\\"MAIN SEQUENCE\\\" from opposite directions on the H-R            Diagram.                      The chances of the two masses falling back into the            exact same location in space, making a single lone star            again, are near zero.  They will instead form a BINARY            system, orbiting each other.                       According to Larson, a white dwarf star has an INVERSE            DENSITY GRADIENT (is densest at its SURFACE), because the            material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown            outward) in time.   This ELIMINATES the need to resort to            MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about \\\"degenerate matter\\\", \\\"neutron            stars\\\", \\\"black holes\\\", etc..                   LARSONIAN Solar System Formation                 If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the            exploding star is relatively SMALL, then, instead of a single            white dwarf star, there will be SEVERAL \\\"mini\\\" white dwarf            stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably            still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affected            by its heat, etc.).  These will become PLANETS!                        In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, Larson used all            this information, and other principles of his comprehensive            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, to derive            his own version of Bode's Law.                         \\\"Black Hole\\\" FANTASY!                 I heard that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently            completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO \\\"black            holes\\\" merging together into a SINGLE \\\"black hole\\\", and            concluded that the new \\\"black hole\\\" would have MORE MASS than            the sum of the two original \\\"black holes\\\".                      Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED            FLAG, causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of \\\"black            holes\\\", etc.!                      After reading Physicist Dewey B. Larson's books about            his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe, especially his book \\\"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\\\", it is            clear to me that \\\"black holes\\\" are NOTHING more than            MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES!  The strange object at Cygnus X-1 is            just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR, NOT the \\\"black            hole\\\" that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want            to \\\"prove\\\" their theory.                           By the way, I do NOT understand why so much publicity is            being given to physicist Stephen Hawking.  The physicists and            astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawking's severe physical            problem somehow makes him \\\"wiser\\\".  It does NOT!                      I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist            Dewey B. Larson while he was still alive.  Widespread            publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson's            Theory, books, and organization (The International Society of            Unified Science).                                             ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION                 I heard of that concept many years ago, in connection            with UFO's and unorthodox inventors, but I never was able to            find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed.                      I found a possible clue about why they might work on            pages 112-113 of the book \\\"BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER\\\", by            the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson, which describes part of            Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe.  I quote one paragraph:                      \\\"As indicated in the preceding chapter, the development            of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally            different concept of the nature of electrical resistance.             The electrons, we find, are derived from the environment.  It            was brought out in Volume I [Larson's book \\\"NOTHING BUT            MOTION\\\"] that there are physical processes in operation which            produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that,            although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in            many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities            for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are            limited.  It follows that there is always a large excess of            free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the            universe, most of which are uncharged.  In this uncharged            state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension            space, because they are inherently rotating units of space,            and the relation of space to space is not motion.  In open            space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently            in the same location with respect to the natural reference            system, in the manner of a photon.  In the context of the            stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron,            like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by            the progression of the natural reference system.  All            material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons            similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation.             Meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later,            whereby electrons are returned to the environment.  The            electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth            therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level.\\\"                            Note that in Larson's Theory, UNcharged electrons are            also massLESS, and are basically photons of light of a            particular frequency (above the \\\"unit\\\" frequency) spinning            around one axis at a particular rate (below the \\\"unit\\\" rate).             (\\\"Unit velocity\\\" is the speed of light, and there are            vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light,            according to Larson's Theory.)  [I might have the \\\"above\\\" and            \\\"below\\\" labels mixed up.]                      Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass-           LESS UN-charged electrons flying around at the speed of            light!                      If this is true, then the ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION            fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these            electrons, or other particles in space, perhaps GIVING them a            charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to            achieve propulsion. (In Larson's Theory, an electrical charge            is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular            frequency (above the \\\"unit\\\" frequency) superimposed on the            rotation of the particle.)                        The paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to            confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is            generated in clouds.               SUPPRESSION of LARSONIAN Physics                 The comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson has            been available for more than 30 YEARS, published in 1959 in            his first book \\\"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE\\\".                      It is TOTALLY UN-SCIENTIFIC for Hawking, Wheeler, Sagan,            and the other SACRED PRIESTS of the RELIGION they call            \\\"science\\\" (or \\\"physics\\\", or \\\"astronomy\\\", etc.), as well as            the \\\"scientific\\\" literature and the \\\"education\\\" systems, to            TOTALLY IGNORE Larson's Theory has they have.                      Larson's Theory has excellent explanations for many            things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers, such            as gamma-ray bursts and the nature of quasars.                      Larson's Theory deserves to be HONESTLY and OPENLY            discussed in the physics, chemistry, and astronomy journals,            in the U.S. and elsewhere.  And at least the basic principles            of Larson's Theory should be included in all related courses            at UW-EC, UW-Madison, Cambridge, Cornell University, and            elsewhere, so that students are not kept in the dark about a            worthy alternative to the DOGMA they are being fed.
