I argued this thoroughly about 3-4 weeks ago.  Men and women are different ... physically, physiologically, and psychologically.  Much recent evidence for this statement is present in the book \\\"Brainsex\\\" by Anne Moir and David Jessel.  I recommend you find a copy and read it. Their book is an overview of recent scientific research on this topic and is well referenced.   Now, if women and men are different in some ways, the law can only adequately take into account their needs in these areas where they are different by also taking into account the ways in which men and women are different.  Maternity leave is an example of this -- it takes into account that women get pregnant.  It does not give women the same rules it would give to men, because to treat women like it treats men in this instance would be unjust.  This is just simply an obvious example of where men and women are intrinsically different!!!!!  Now, people make the _naive_ argument that sexism = oppression. However, maternity leave is sexist because MEN DO NOT GET PREGNANT.  Men do not have the same access to leave that women do (not to the same extent or degree), and therefore IT IS SEXIST.  No matter however much a man _wants_ to get pregnant and have maternity leave, HE NEVER CAN.  And therefore the law IS SEXIST.  No man can have access to maternity leave, NO MATTER HOW HARD HE TRIES TO GET PREGNANT.  I hope this is clear.  Maternity leave is an example where a sexist law is just, because the sexism here just reflects the \\\"sexism\\\" of nature in making men and women different.  There are many other differences between men and women which are far more subtle than pregnancy, and to find out more of these I recommend you have a look at the book \\\"Brainsex\\\".  Your point that perhaps some day men can also be pregnant is fallacious. If men can one day become pregnant it will be by having biologically become women!  To have a womb and the other factors required for pregnancy is usually wrapped up in the definition of what a woman is -- so your argument, when it is examined, is seen to be fallacious.  You are saying that men can have the sexist maternity leave privilege that  women can have if they also become women -- which actually just supports my statement that maternity leave is sexist.   There is no official priesthood in Islam -- much of this function is taken by Islamic scholars.  There are female Islamic scholars and female Islamic scholars have always existed in Islam.  An example from early Islamic history is the Prophet's widow, Aisha, who was recognized in her time and is recognized in our time as an Islamic scholar.   You have no evidence for your blanket statement about all religions, and I dispute it.  I could go on and on about women in Islam, etc., but I recently reposted something here under the heading \\\"Islam and Women\\\" -- if it is still at your news-site I suggest you read it.  It is reposted from soc.religion.islam, so if it has disappeared from alt.atheism it still might be in soc.religion.islam (I forgot what its original title was though).  I will email it to you if you like.    Your statement that \\\"other religions are no different\\\" is, I think, a statement based simply on lack of knowledge about religions other than Christianity and perhaps Judaism.   Aisha, who I mentioned earlier, was not only an Islamic scholar but also was, at one stage, a military leader.   The Prophet's first wife, who died just before the \\\"Hijra\\\" (the Prophet's journey from Mecca to Medina) was a successful businesswoman.  Lucio, you cannot make a strong case for your viewpoint when your viewpoint is based on ignorance about world religions.\",\"Are there any vendors supporting pressure sensitive tablet/pen with X?

Two requests -- first, note the roles of S1 and S2.  It appears to me and others that anyone who knows those values can construct the unit key.  And the nature of the generation process for K1 and K2 is such that neither can be produced alone.  Thus, the scheme cannot be implemented such that one repository generates the first half-key, and another generates the second.  *That* is ominous.  Second -- these postings are not revealed scripture, nor are they carefully-crafted spook postings.  Don't attempt to draw out hidden meanings (as opposed to, say, the official announcements of Clipper). Leave Denning out of this; given Hellman's record of opposition to DES, which goes back before some folks on this newsgroup knew how to read, I don't think you can impugn his integrity.  Oh yeah -- the folks who invented Clipper aren't stupid.  If you think something doesn't make sense, it's almost certainly because you don't understand their goals.    --Steve Bellovin  -----  Date: Sun, 18 Apr 93 07:56:39 EDT From: denning@cs.georgetown.edu (Dorothy Denning) Subject: Re:  Clipper Chip To: (a long list of folks)  I was also briefed by the NSA and FBI, so let me add a few comments to Marty's message:          The Clipper Chip will have a secret crypto algorithm embedded in   The algorithm operates on 64-bit blocks (like DES) and the chip supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  The algorithm uses 32 rounds of scrambling compared with 16 in DES.   In addition to the system key, each user will get to choose his   or her own key and change it as often as desired. Call this key   plain old K. When a message is to be sent it will first be   K is the session key shared by the sender and receiver.  Any method (e.g., public key) can be used to establish the session key.  In the AT&T telephone security devices, which will have the new chip, the key is negotiated using a public-key protocol.    encrypted under K, then K will be encrypted under the unit key UK,   and the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part   message which will then be encrypted under the system key SK   producing        E{ E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number;  SK}  My understanding is that E[M; K] is not encrypted under SK (called the \\\"family key\\\") and that the decrypt key corresponding to SK is held by law enforcement.  Does anyone have first hand knowledge on this?  I will also check it out, but this is 7am Sunday so I did not want to wait.          The unit key   will be generated as the XOR of two 80-bit random numbers K1   and K2 (UK=K1+K2) which will be kept by the two escrow   The unit key, also called the \\\"chip key,\\\" is generated from the serial number N as follows.  Let N1, N2, and N3 be 64 bit blocks derived from N, and let S1 and S2 be two 80-bit seeds used as keys. Compute the 64-bit block           R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1]   (Note that this is like using the DES in triple encryption mode with two keys.)  Similarly compute blocks R2 and R3 starting with N2 and N3. (I'm unlear about whether the keys S1 and S2 change.  The fact that they're called seeds suggests they might.)  Then R1, R2, and R3 are concatenated together giving 192 bits.  The first 80 bits  form K1 and the next 80 bits form K2.  The remaining bits are discarded.   authorities. Who these escrow authorities will be is still to be   decided by the Attorney General, but it was stressed to me that   they will NOT be NSA or law enforcement agencies, that they   must be parties acceptable to the users of the system as unbiased.   Marty is right on this and the FBI has asked me for suggestions. Please pass them to me along with your reasons.  In addition to Marty's criteria, I would add that the agencies must have an established record of being able to safeguard highly sensitive information.  Some suggestions I've received so far include SRI, Rand, Mitre, the national labs (Sandia, LANL, Los Alamos), Treasury, GAO.   When a court order obtains K1 and K2, and thence K, the law   enforcement agency will use SK to decrypt all information   flowing on the suspected link [Aside: It is my guess that   they may do this constantly on all links, with or without a   court order, since it is almost impossible to tell which links   over which a message will flow.]   My understanding is that there will be only one decode box and that it will be operated by the FBI.  The service provider will isolate the communications stream and pass it to the FBI where it will pass through the decode box, which will have been keyed with K.   for \\\"the wiretap authorizations.\\\" When Levy asked for  the details so he could review the cases as required by  law, the agent told him that his predecessors just turned  over 40-50 blank, signed forms every time.

In fact, doing \\\"man X\\\" on pretty much any X11 machine will tell you:       The X Consortium requests that the following names  be  used      when referring to this software:                                    X                            X Window System                              X Version 11                      X Window System, Version 11                                  X11  There is no such thing as \\\"X Windows\\\" or \\\"X Window\\\", despite the repeated misuse of the forms by the trade rags.  This probably tells you something about how much to trust the trade rags -- if they can't even get the NAME of the window system right, why should one trust anything else they have  to say?  With regard to dialup X11 implementations, there are several.  You can buy serial X11 terminals from a couple of companies, including both  GraphOn and NCD.  (In fact, I'm composing this from an NCD running X11 over serial lines across 14.4 kbaud connection.)    NCD also sells a software-only package that provides XRemote (which is NCD's implementation of serial X11) for PC's.  There may be other such  software packages available.  X11R6 is supposed to include a standardized compression scheme for running X11 over low-speed connections.  It's called Low Bandwidth X (LBX), and  is based on improved versions of the techniques used in NCD's XRemote.   It seems likely that once LBX is released as a Consortium standard, there will be several vendors willing to supply implementations for various  sorts of hardware.

The Islanders lost in OT and the Devils tied the Pens.  That means if the Isles beat the Devils on Friday, the will meet the Caps in the playoffs.   However, I have some more comments on the Islanders and hockey in general that I need to get off my chest :).  First of all, with the Islanders  back-to-back lackluster performances against the Whalers, one may think that  the Islanders are out of shape.  These guys always suck wind in the 2nd period, come on a little in the 3rd and run out of gas too soon.  It is unbelieveable how many one goal games these guys have lost.  Anyway, the games was pretty  wide open.  The Isles still have tons of trouble scoring.  The Whalers played  a golie in is 1st NHL start, I think his name was Lenarduzzi (sp?).  (His NHL  debut was the Tuesday tie against the Isles).  Like I mentioned before, this  guy looked like the best golie on the planet for a while (until he misplayed a  Mahlakov slap shot to go to OT).  I say it's because the Isles don't shoot  correctly.  Has anyone else noticed this?   Also, I think it is really a shame for hockey when I guy like Mick Vukota gets as much ice time as he does.  This guy has about as much hockey talent as Jiggs MacDonald (who did play hockey, I think).  Anytime he gets the puck it gets stolen, and he always starts fights and gets needless penalties.  Richard Pilon is another guy who is on the ice to stir up crap.  And he's a defenseman.  He's got to be approaching negative infinity for his plus/minus.  This guy gets beaten all the time.  Why the need for such \\\"enforcers\\\"?  Not only do fights slow the game down ALOT, but it takes away from the guys who are really trying to play the game.  I'll be one of the few to admit, I do enjoy a  good fight once in a while, but only when it's \\\"called for\\\".  You know, when a guy checks the goalie too hard.  In other words, a violation of \\\"hockey ethics\\\" might cause you to get puched.  But there is no need to start crap when you are losing or becuase you can get away with it!! Does anyone agree that referees need to be a little less lenient in the 3rd and OT?  I mean COME ON already.  I'm sick of seeing teams pulling guys down, holding guys etc. just becuase the referee doesn't call it.  OT and late in the 3rd should be a time for strategy, not physical prowess.  Trying to set up a goal should be first and foremost.  If you are so afraid that the other team is going to score that you have to pull a guy down to prevent it, you don't deserve to win in the first place.  Just My Honest Opinion,\",\" Sure, why not? But, are you using Paul to correct the words of Jesus?   \\\"So *anyone* who dissolves even one of the smallest commands and teaches others the same way, will be known as the lowest in the kingdom of the skies; whereas *anyone* who keeps the commands and teaches them too, will be known as *someone* great in the kingdom of the skies.\\\" Mat5:19 (Gaus)  Are you an \\\"anyone\\\" or are you a \\\"no one?\\\"  Why not assume, that since Jesus didn't say that his words apply only to Jews, that they apply to all human beings, irregardless of race or sex?  Why not assume, that even though Jesus did not mention your name, still Jesus was talking directly to you?   Does it say that it applies to *you*? Are you anyone or no one?   Ex20:8-11(JPS) Remember the sabbath day and keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a sabbath of the LORD your God; you shall not do any work - you, your son or daughter, your male or female slave, or your cattle, or the stranger who is within your settlements. For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth and sea, and all that is in them, and He rested on the seventh day; therefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day and hollowed it.  Note: There is no specific requirement for worship here, however I for one would not be so bold as to call these verses a \\\"ceremonial detail.\\\"   Don't many Christians still practice circumcision?   It's unfortunate that Jesus didn't use your name directly, or maybe Jesus did? Are you somebody or nobody?   If you don't see a problem, then perhaps there is none.

The problem is that there is no guarantee that this premium would be lower for those who chose this type of contract.

For an illustrative example in the opposite direction, it may be possible to ADD services to an insurance contract and REDUCE the premium.

The tires that were on it when I just bought it are old and cracked. I do not have an owners manual for it (yet), but the tires listed in the Haynes manual are: Front, 3,50 H 18 ; Rear 4.10 H 18, and pressures recommended are 26 front and 33 rear. Oddly, the pressure for the same tire on the T-3 is listed at 29 psi instead. Anyone know the reason? As I know though, the pressure I should run at is that recommended by the manufacturer of the new tires I purchase.  The real question I have is this. The old tires that are on the bike are for the front, a Metzler Touring Special, 4.10 H 18, and for the rear an Avon Roadrunner 4.70 H 18, (120/90) H 18 as marked on each tire. Both are larger than that listed in the Haynes Manual. What does the owners manual recommend, and was it common to go up one size for this bike? Also, this will be my first motorcycle with innertubes. Any comments on the various manufacturers inner tube qualities?  The above sizes are inches (except for the additional mark on the current rear tire). What is the best metric match? The local BMW dealer thought 100/90 H 18 on the front and 120/90 H 18 on the back. He also happens to be very good at getting close to matching mail order prices.  I am thinking of going with a Metzler ME33 Laser (possibly Comp K) on the front and ME88 on the back, both in MBS variety if possible (the longer  lasting belting system). I already use the ME33 on both the Vision and FJ for the front, and like it, and I thought that with the shaft drive behavior and torque from the Guzzi that the ME88 might give more predictable back end control and sliding behavior than a ME55 might, as well as giving much better tire milage life. Any comments?  A friend told me he thought that my bike had Boranni rims which are very good, but are relatively soft and have delicate sidewalls. I do not wish to mount the tires myself this first time, so aside from warning the shop to be careful, any other comments I should make? I havn't looked at the rim to check out the make yet, if it is marked. He just told me late yesterday and I havn't had a chance to check the rim type.  On another note. I will remove the ugly (but in good shape....anyone want it?) Vetter fairing, and I will run without a windscreen for a while, but eventually I would like a simple rounded cafe' style quarter fairing for it. It could be fork/handlebar mounted. Any suggestions? Is there such a thing as a frame mounted quarter fairing of the cafe' style for this bike? How about lower bars/clip-ons for it? I would like to restore the bike into a good condition runner with a few modern updates, but while not being historically exactly accurate still have it reflect relatively well a representation of the cafe' style. (Yes I know to be picky, that period really predates this bike....it is just that this bike has such potential for _that_ look.)  -----------------------------Edward Walsh----Hewlett-Packard Company-------                              edw@boi.hp.com  Disk Memory Division, MS475                              (208)323-2174   P.O.

It might be that pre-back problems, he was quick enough to cover up any deficiencies the stance caused, but now he's lost just enough bat speed that the stance hurts him. The old saying if you're hot its a trigger mechanism, if you're cold, its a hitch.    The biggest problem IMHO is he never has found a stance he's comfortable with for more than a few months. He changes his stance so much, he loses track of where the strike zone is. In Wednesday's night game, he was  clearly mad at strike calls on both corners that looked pretty good to me. I think he no longer knows where the strike zone really is because he's changed his stance so much.

According the the Los Angeles Police Department, illegal manufacture is one the three primary sources of machine guns and submachine guns used in crimes (sumggling and theft from the police and military being the other two.) Washington D.C. police have stated that 40% (If I'm remembering the figure correctly) of the guns they conficate were illegally built.   It takes about 6 hours and a few tools to make one (at least one of reasonable quality). Unless the drug dealer enjoyes messing around on a lathe (say, as a hobby), he's going to have to  pay someone anyway. Materials plus six hours of a machinist's time for something legal would run about $100. The blackmarket prices for guns are usually in the $50 to $200 range (at least those few I've seen cited in newspaper articles were...)   Washington D.C. has a total ban on handguns and prohibits assembled rifles within city limits. It's homicide rate is almost ten times the national average. It is also illegal for a D.C. resident to drive to the Virginia or Maryland suburbs and buy a gun (dealers are required by federal law to check IDs and make sure the buyer isn't from another state) so the ban  can not be easily side-stepped.   Sure. But it you couldn't buy one, you would write your own (in fact, people _did_ write their own 15 years ago...) More likely, you would find a friend who was a particularly good programer and get him give you a copy of his. Software is a _very_ bad example for your case: How many people do you know with illegal copies of $400 word processors? If people want something, and it isn't available (or affordable) legally, they will usually get it illegally.   Quite.   13-3-2. The formula has been around for half a million years. Or are you going to restrict sales of sulpher, charcoal and saltpeter? That's alot cruder than modern smokless powder, but it works very well. The only real problems are a ~25% reduction in energy (so a .357 magnum would \\\"only\\\" be as deadly as a 9mm) and it makes alot more smoke... Of course, a smart black marketeer could just make the gun in 9mm and steal the ammunition from the police (the police are often corruptable, and things are known to disappear from police evidence rooms and armories and reappear on the streets...)

Hmmm, 21 runs in 11 innings.  Suppose he starts 30 more games, and winds up w/200 innings pitched.  If he allows 4 runs a game in the next 189 innings, he'll have a 4.75 ERA or so at the end of the year. (I think I have his totals right.) This is going to be hard to come back from.        My 1st hunch is that Morris is very gutsy, and that he may be pitching through an injury and not telling anyone.  My 2nd guess is that he will be banished to the bullpen the remainder of the season after a few more starts. (Perhaps when Stewart comes off the DL?  Or will Danny Cox, who went 3 or 4 scoreless innings against the Tribe today, start for Morris?  He looks like a really good one.  Gaston is scrambling to find starters, I'd imagine. Luckily, the Jays have a very good offense.)      I don't think they would dare release him before the end of the year. He'll just be replaced by Stewart or Cox.\",\" I must admit that this point has been running through my mind for most of the discussion: one the dice are out there, it won't be long before someone decaps it and, after a bit of work, has full details of the Clipper algorythm.  This isn't trivial to do, but then again, it is not impossibly difficult either.  Any half way decent VLSI design student should be able to take a photograph of a technology s/he is familiar with, and given a description of the input, output, control and supply lines, figure out  the function of various subsystems on the die.  Indeed, this is not an uncommon exercise performed during training (because it makes you think about design decisions made by other designers.  I could speculate that these chips are going to be manufactured using \\\"tamperproof\\\" carriers (unlikely - such techniques are *very* expensive and this thing is supposed to be relatively cheap to produce), or that there will be some legal or legislative framework to prevent publication of the algorythm (unlikely - please correct me if I am wrong but aren't these supposed to be sold internationally?).  I suppose that the most likely reason the algorythm is remaining secret for the moment is that some idiot bureaucrat, untrammeled by the realities of the situation, decided that \\\"well, we should keep it a secret because it is supposed to be secret, isn't it?\\\"  Just some random thoughts... \",\"  I know it was used several times in the south, to prosecute the murders of blacks, after all white juries had cleared the accussed.

We've kept things on a painfully polite, Christmas-card sort of level for most of this time. Attempts to see each other end disastrously, with his wife throwing a screaming fit and storming out over either our imagined slights to her, or his inattention or insensitivity to her (I mean, this'll happen by the end of a single restaurant meal). He seems, from what I've seen, to live in a state of quivering anxiety, hoping futilely to keep the next storm from breaking. He has sacrificed not only meaningful contact with us but also other friends and outside interests. Now, this is his choice, and I need to accept it even if I deplore it. But it's hard.    From time to time I've wanted to drop the pretense that we have a relationship--by cutting off contact--or trying to have a real if painful relationship, by talking honestly with him, but I've always thought, \\\"Why be dramatic? And you know he'll only get evasive and then find some excuse to get off the phone. Just leave the door open, in case he ever decides to come back.\\\" It's been an unsatisfying choice, to allow us to go on with the superficial trappings of a relationship, but it was the best I could think of.    Now, this weekend, my mother finally decided that she wasn't going to pretend any more and has cut off relations with them. This was the outcome of a phone conversation in which my sister-in-law screamed and raved at my mother, blaming her for everything wrong in their lives, and in which my brother evaded, temporized, claimed the situation was beyond his control, and as always expected my mother to make all the allowances and concessions. Mom said she would not, that she would not quietly take abuse any more, and that if these were the terms of their relationship, she didn't want to talk to or see them any more. And she hung up. (I have never seem my mother lose her temper, and I think that this is the first time she's ever hung up on someone.) Mom says she feels as if she's divorced my brother, and that it's a relief in some ways to have the break out in the open and done with.       I have mixed feelings. I'm proud of Mom for sticking up for herself; angry at my brother and sister-in-law for hurting her, for being jerks, for persisting in such a wretched life, which hurts us all and is warping their children; angry at my sister-in-law for being so hateful, and angry at my brother for being a coward and having so little respect for himself or us that he's willing to throw us aside and use up all his energy trying to appease an unappeasable, emotionally disturbed woman; pained for their children, who are a mess; scared for the future, since this marks the time when either things will change and improve or the break will become irrevocable; nastily self- righteous over this bit of proof that they can't \\\"get away\\\" with treating us or each other this way, and then disgusted with myself for even beginning to gloat over others' misery; and finally, mostly, sad, sad, sad, to see my parents hurt and my brother and sister-in-law trapped in a horrible, destructive situation that they can't see a way out of--or they can't bear to take whatever paths they do see. And I'm frustrated because I don't know what if anything to do, and doing nothing drives me up the wall. I try to pray, about my own feelings of rage, impotence, and vindictiveness, and about their situation, but I am not free of the desire to *DO* something concrete. (The desire to *DO* something, to define a problem and fix it, is one of my besetting vices; I'm having a terrible time quieting down my internal mental chatter enough to listen for God.)   Do you thoughtful and kind people on the net have advice for me? Is this a time to reach out to my brother? To let things be? How can I conquer my rage AT him enough to be there FOR him?   Here's the big question I've been evading throughout this long, long post: Is it ok, as a Christian and a proponent of faith, hope, and charity, to accept the destruction of a relationship? To give up on my own brother, or at least to accept that I am powerless to help him and can only wait and see what happens? Do please answer--by e-mail or post.

Oak Park also has an illegal handgun ban as well, but does allow those with a \\\"collectors FFL\\\" to possess (\\\"collectible?\\\") handguns.   Probably a fine in practical terms.   It wouldn't impede your defense at all. There was an actual incident in Oak Park where a gas station owner engaged in a shootout with a handgun; the grand jury decided not to presecute. On the other hand, a black man used an illegally owned handgun in Oak Park to defend himself, and the Village tried to make an example out of him. An NRA Director who lived there made a stink about this, and it was decided not to charge the guy. Of course, pissing off anti-gun police thugs has it's own drawbacks, like when the Oak Park Police Chief came to his house, and told him: \\\"this is stepping over the line; this could get dangerous for you.\\\" Whereupon the few black Oak Park police officers watched over his house to ensure that the white anti-gun police chief and his anti-gun cronies wouldn't f*ck with him, his home or family.

Roger, on one front you flamed him rather severely on the grounds that his was a \\\"jingoistic rant\\\", but you also supported the name-changing on the grounds that the current names are inappropriate because of the individuals they represent. FWIW, I do not think the flaming was warranted, nor do I  think you enhanced what credibility you have with it at all.  Just an  observation...  However, that aside, the real question is whether you like the idea of changing the names based on the reasons given for it (making it easier for the 'casual fan'), or whether you like the idea of unique divisional names based on individuals who do deserve the honour.  IMO, the latter is a nice and unique touch that differs from other sports.  In addition, I do not think that changing divisional names will have an effect on the number of people that are interested in hockey, so it's a pointless exercise anyway.  If the current names are inappropriate, then that is a separate issue, not  central to the original article.  Something to consider additionally is whether or not players like Orr who 'contributed to the glory of the sport' would have been able to do so _without_ an organized professional league to play in.  In this case, honouring builders of the _league_ as opposed to builders of the _sport_ becomes a chicken-and-egg type question. (although it was the chicken.....)

But the next paragraph says telecoms networks and wireless communications links.

Yes, Cripple *might* be for end-to-end encyption, dropping to clear when the other end doesn't have Cripple.

A standard of conduct does exist, but we are free to ignore it or misunderstand it or distort it in whatever ways we find convenient, but our response to God's edicts can in no way be used to question God's existence. The behavior of believers is a completely separate question from that of God's existence; there is nothing contradictory here.  To say that something defined contadictorily cannot exist, is really asking too much; you would have existence depend on grammar. All you can really say is that something is poorly defined, but that in itself is insufficient to decide anything (other than confusion of course).  Your point that there are better reasons for the phenomenon of belief than the object of belief may lead to a rat's nest of unnecessary complexity.

According to my always questionable newspaper, there's a silver dollar being minted in Canada, the back of which commemorates the anniversary of the Stanley Cup.  Now, I know full well what coins are used every day in Canada.  I can easily fish a few out of my pocket change right now, in fact.  My question is, since the loon is the only dollar coin that I know is legal tender, is this just a commemorative coin with no monetary exchange value, or what?  Is it the sort of thing that only hockey buffs and coin collectors might covet, with no chance of it being circulated?  If it is an uncirculated coin, what's the current cost and what's its potential value?  Just curious.  If no one knows, I'll take this to soc.culture.canada and rec.collecting (or whatever it is).

One approach is simply to try and move political opinion and hope a new more libertarian consensus lasts for a while.  Another approach is to try and amend the constitution.  The original constitution restrained the U.S. government from economic intervention for 100 to 150 years, depending on just how one wants to count it. The First Amendment, though weakened in many ways, still restrains government (particularly state and local), even though on many particular issues the majority is in favor of censorship.  I think libertarians would be happy with another 100 years of restraint via an amendment or two (not that I think that's likely to happen).  Not necessarily Mr. Hendricks, but other posters seem to see this as a problem with libertarianism, that it cannot be stable.  That might be true, but it is not an objection to libertarianism per se.  If a libertarian political consensus forms for a decade or two and then falls apart again, we would just be back where we are now.  This is unlike the case for socialism where a socialist consensus that held for a while and then fell apart would not leave us where we are now, but instead with lots of bureaucracy that would be hard to get rid of, if not tyranny as the end condition of a strong socialist consensus.\",\"  Since I repost this message again for the second time, I hope to hear from some folks on this topic.

They aren't even real.  What scientists call an atom is nothing more than a mathematical model that describes  certain physical, observable properties of our surroundings.  All of which is subjective.    What is objective, though, is the approach a scientist  takes in discussing his model and his observations.  There is no objective science.  But there is an objective approach which is subjectively selected by the scientist.  Objective in this case means a specified, unchanging set of rules that he and his colleagues use to discuss their science.  This is in contrast to your Objective Morality.  There may be an objective approach to subjectively discuss your beliefs on morality.  But there exists no objective morality.  Also, science deals with how we can discuss our observations of  the physical world around us.  In that the method of discussion is objective ( not the science; not the discussion itself ).  Science makes no claims to know the whys or even the hows sometimes of what we can observe.  It simply gives us a way to discuss our surroundings in a meaningful, consistent way.

If most people }use scissors to cut paper, shouldn't Consumer's Reports }test scissors for paper-cutting ability, even though }scissors may have been designed originally to cut cloth?  That's possibly a good way to judge the use of the Bible in teaching Jewish morality today, but it hardly seems fair to claim that this highly-interpreted version is what was \\\"enlightened for its times\\\". To (attempt to) extend the analogy, this is like saying that the original scissor-makers were unusually advanced at paper-cutting for their times, even though they only ever cut cloth, and had never even heard of paper.  I'm not arguing that the Bible is \\\"disgusting\\\", though some of the history depicted in it is, by modern standards.  However, history is full of similar abuses, and I don't think the Biblical accounts are worse than their contemporaries--or possibly ours.  On the other hand, I don't know of any reason to think the history described in the Bible shows *less* abuse than their contemporaries, or ours.  That complex and benign moral traditions have evolved based on particular mythic interpretations of that history is interesting, but I still don't think it fair to take that long tradition of interpretation and use it to attack condemnation of the original history.\",\"I know what the 68HC811E2 is all about, but I'm trying to figure out what the 68SEC811E2 is... specifically, what does the SEC stand for? \",\"  It is incompetent, like almost anything you have posted here, so you'll be flamed, sorry.   %/$( your \\\"20 years of background in two Fortune 50 companies\\\"; I've lived 30 years under a totalitarian regime, and boy, I *can* recognize a totalitarian plot when I see one...

You are merely expressing \\\"approval\\\" of the consequences I find therein. Which says more about our politics and cultural trappings than about my (or any) religion.  \\\"Love\\\" is a highly ambiguous word, of which Christians can write both the \\\"gentle\\\" words Paul uses of it in 1 Corinthians -- in a passage that even the \\\"conservatives\\\" will quote at you :-) -- and the words of T. S. Eliot in his Pentacost Hymn, \\\"Love is the unfamiliar Name that wove the intolerable shirt of flame ...\\\"  This is in any case rather to the side of what I was attempting to raise in my note, as will become more evident below.   blechhh.  I think you are misreading me, rather seriously.  Though, given my principle that one CANNOT force one's own notion of \\\"sin\\\" on another, and my unshakeable \\\"disestablishmentarianism\\\", Russel Turpin and others (believers and unbelievers alike) are under no threat of my legislating my own understanding of Christian love.   You misread.  I can do (and have repeatedly done) a complete bill of accusation against the Inquisition by exhibiting in as thorough a form as anyone might want a demonstration of the harm it has done to human beings (in the first place) and to respect for (let alone love of) \\\"God\\\" in near succession.  Please go back to my quoted words above:  The \\\"possibility that always exists\\\" is that I (or, to revert to proper time sequence, my predecessors over the last several centuries) could persuade \\\"Christian B\\\" of my case that the Inquisition *does* indeed constitute an egregious violation of the Law of Love.  I must also note that the majority of Christians HAVE been so persuaded.  By Christian argumentation, as well as by secular [both Christian and non-Christian] prohibitions.  What Mr. Turpin alludes to is a trickier point:   A.  I demonstrate the human pain and violation of love involved      in the Inquisition.   B.  The Inquisitor responds that Mother Church must, however      painful this *seems*, \\\"discipline\\\" her children for their      own good -- in this case the salvation of their souls (or      if the tortured heretic will not recant, than by bad example      \\\"deterring\\\" others from the same loss-of-soul.)   A.  I point out that this \\\"justification\\\" of a failure in love      depends on a highly speculative construal of texts and of      philosophical assertions that are quite undemonstrable.   B.  Burns me at the stake.  My rhetoric has failed, but the point I am making is sustained.  What is going on here has a *lot* to do with \\\"cultural baggage.\\\"  In this case, the baggage includes a (nearly universal, and absolutely secular) belief that an accused person must prove innocence and that testimony is most believable if taken under torture.  The elimination of Inqisitorial practice (in those places where it *has* been eliminated, or at least greatly reduced) has very little, if anything, to do with the discussion of sin in the exchange between A and B.  Mr. Turpin is pointing out that, if I am A versus the Grand Inquisitor's B, then my persuasion is not very likely to work.  I know this; and in what- ever personal agony, I consign the issue to God and my ghostly defense attorney.  So, \\\"one possibility\\\" fails in this case -- as it will fail in may others.  At the other extreme, the \\\"persuasion\\\" will succeed when it properly SHOULD not, if it entails mistaken assumptions I share with the Inquisitor.  And that is potentially an even more troubling case, in that many of the victims of Inquisition will have \\\"accepted\\\" that they were in fact sinful (in such random cases as they may actually have been guilty of charges brought against them.)  The point is that the \\\"persuasion\\\" breaks down when the parties do NOT share enough to agree on all the cultural baggage -- and given the main thrust of the Inquisition, against \\\"heresy\\\", it is *bound* to break down in precisely the \\\"worst\\\" cases.  The \\\"conservative\\\" (I don't think that is the right word, BTW) will take refuge in what I attribute to B above, that he is \\\"justified\\\" in causing harm because he *thinks* that works to a \\\"greater good.\\\"  But this is a violent and extravagant REFUSAL to follow the gospel, as if one's theories about \\\"sin\\\" entitled one to cast aside Jesus' words on dealing with sinners (cf. Matthew 5:39ff).  I am a \\\"radical\\\" Christian *only* in that I take the gospel seriously.   Well, the whole *point* of making these the \\\"base\\\" commandments is that they *aren't* reducible to rules.  A set of rules is a moral code or a law code or an algorithm for acting.  Such things can be very helpful to individuals or societies -- but not if they are used *instead* of a personal involvement in and responsibility for one's actions.  The Great Commandment is, more than anything else, a call to act *as if you were God and accepting ultimate responsibility* in your every action.  A demand that I, like most, would rather *not* hear, but it keeps popping up nonetheless (along with the reassurance that it is more important that I be open to trying this, than succeeding at it).  \\\"Conservatives\\\" may twist this \\\"act as if you were God\\\" to mean \\\"lay down rules for other people and be as nasty to them as possible if they don't keep YOUR rules.\\\" They are so insistent (and obvious) about this that they have convinced a lot of people (who rightly reject the whole concept!) that such idiocy IS how God acts.  That, after all, is the standard accusation \\\"against God\\\" by the atheists here and elsewhere.  That the \\\"conservatives\\\" have confused THEIR manipulative, hoop-jumping notions of coercing other people with the Nature of God is almost the entire content of standard American atheism -- and I quite agree with it on this point.   And different bodies of Christians have, from the beginning, urged *different* \\\"ethical systems\\\" (or in some cases, none).  As a result, it is bizarre to identify any one of these systems, however popular (or infamous) with Christianity.  Christianity DOES NOT HAVE A TORAH. It does not have a QU'RAN.  Specifically Christian scripture has very little, if anything, in the way of \\\"commandments\\\" -- so little that the \\\"Christians\\\" who desperately *want* commandments go \\\"mining\\\" for them with almost no support (and thus almost no obvious limitation :-)) for their efforts.  The one, single, thing in the gospels which Jesus specifically \\\"gives\\\" as \\\"a commandment\\\" to us is \\\"love one another.\\\"   [I will be expanding on this point in a reply to Paul Hudson   that I hope to get to in a day or so -- it is quite true that   SOME Christians infer LOTS of commandments from the NT; I'll   point out what has to be going on in these inferences, and why   there is a huge amount of \\\"cultural baggage\\\" involved.]  You are quite right that this is \\\"goo\\\" if one is looking for an ethical system.  But why should anyone BE looking for an ethical system, since our society is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do?  It may be that we need a principle for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems -- in which case I will profer the _agapate allelou_ once again.   I think you are begging the question. Why don't I and the (myriads of) other Christians like me tell you something about Christianity? [Nor is this very new in Christianity -- you might want to look up the origins and fundamental doctrines of the Quakers, from the 17th century onwards, and they are not at all the first to understand the gospel in a manner that is congenial to my case.]\",\"why does my keyboard not have a cents key ?

I have used MacKermit and VersaTerm on the Mac side. I have used Procomm, Kermit, and Softerm (on OS/2) on the PC (or PS) side. I have used non-Hardware handshaking and hardware ahdshaking cables. And know MY hands are shaking from the effort. Nothing has allowed file transfers from the Mac to the PS.  In general, I can type back and forth with no trouble, but only if both sides are set to speeds OVER 9600 baud. I cannot send files from the Mac to the PS at all, and file transfers from the Duo to the PS are not possible. When I do a straight ascii send, I can send from the PS to the Duo flawlessly. I can send Binhex files this way quite fast, and I know that the transmission is error free. But straight ascii sent from the Mac to the PS is full of errors. Unless, of course, I do text pacing so slow that it is like human typing. (well, like 2-3 times faster than human typing).  I would like to hear from ANYONE who has been able to transfer files from a Duo 210 to a PS via modem or null modem. If you can do it, please tell me your EXACT combination of hardware and software. Obviously, I am talking of a true serial port modem, not the express modem. Maybe some kind soul with access to a modem and a Duo 210 can check this out for me.  Right now, I am of the opinion that it won't work at high speeds because of the power interrupts on the Duo, and it won't work at low speeds because of some crazy reason I don't understand.  Could I hear from someone attesting that they can really pump information out the serial port of a Duo 210 fast? Like via a modem or via a sys-ex dump?  Could anyone with a Duo help me out?? I am going absolutely INSANE. I wanna know if the problem is MY Duo, or all Duo 210s, or all Duos, or just me.  Yes, I have checked the cable 1,000,000 times. And not only can I type back and forth, but Zterm alerts the users if s/he uses hardware handshaking and CTS is down. So I know that hardware handshaking is working. And also, According to Zterm port stats, the buffer never overflows.  Please help me figure out what's going on...\",\"frank@D012S658.uucp (Frank O'Dwyer) writes ...  While I'll agree that these are generally held to be \\\"good things\\\", I question whether they come very close to being objective values. Especially considering that at one time or another each has been viewed as being undesirable.  I doubt you could even come up with anything that could be said to be universally \\\"good\\\" or \\\"bad\\\".  And when I referred to \\\"the truth\\\" I was using the term hypothetically, realizing full well that there may not even be such a thing.   True enough.  But they cannot be said to be anything more than personal morals.  One thing notably lacking in most extremists is any sense of _personal_ accountability - the justification for any socially unacceptable behaviour is invariably some \\\"higher authority\\\" (aka, absolute moral truth).   An objective truth that says one cannot know the objective truth? Interesting notion.   :-)  Certainly one can have as one's morals a belief that compromise is good.  But to compromise on the absolute truth is not something most people do very successfully.  I suppose one could hold compromise as being an absolute moral, but then what happens when someone else insists on no compromise?  How do you compromise on compromising?   Almost invariably when considering the relative value of one thing over another, be it morals or consequences, people only consider those aspects which justify a desired action or belief.  In justifying a commitement to peace I might argue that it lets people live long & healthy and peaceful lives.  While that much may well be true, it is incomplete in ignoring the benefits of war - killing off the most agressive member of society, trimming down the population, stimulating production.  The equation is always more complex than presented. To characterize relative morals as merely following one's own conscience / desires is to unduly simplify it. \",\"         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Because of this I cannot in good faith recommend a Seca Turbo.

In fact, after this season, KDKA will no longer be the flagship station for the Pens.  The Penguins and KBL have struck a new  deal regarding the TV and radio rights to the games.  It seems more than likely that WDVE will be the flagship radio station next  season.  KBL will carry 62 games on tv,  with 17 of the games to be  simulcast on KDKA-TV.  The remaining 22 games, as well as some of the  early round playoff games, will be available by \\\"subscription tv\\\" only. To receive the games, you'll have to pay a one time hook up fee, and then a monthly fee of $11-12 dollars.  Also, under the new deal, there will no longer be radio/tv  simulcasts.

This article will provide the essential information for doing so on standard Unix systems.  A shell script and examples of alias file setups are included which presently run on a Sparc 2 here at balltown.cma.com for a number of mailing lists.  Note that if you do set up an automotive mailing list, please let me know of the -request address so that I can list it in the montly rec.autos posting.  Also inform the keeper of the Usenet list-of-lists (check news.answers for this monthly posting.)  First of all, to get anywhere, you need to either 1) be a sysadmin, or 2) have some measure of assistance from your sysadmin.  It is also important that you have reasonably good network connectivity; if it seems like you get everything several days after anyone else, or that you have trouble getting email through, then your network connectivity is probably not good enough.  Listserv:  There is a handy automated mailing list package named listserv, which is available from several ftp servers on the network.  Details of the installation and operation of listserv are beyond the scope of this article, but anyone who is considering running a large mailing list should probably  look at listserv carefully.  The Alias file:  On a typical unix system; there is a file named /usr/lib/aliases on whichever file server is your mail host; it contains lines such as:  foo:   bar, baz, bletch   which means that any email sent the name `foo' on that host is redistributed to users bar, baz, and bletch.  thus, the simplest possible email list is   my-favorite-car:  member1, member2, member3, my-address my-favorite-car-request: my-address  this has a couple of problems; the most noticeable one being that you have to be superuser to edit the alias file.  however, you can do the following, with the connivance of your sysadmin:  my-favorite-car: :include:/home/mydir/misc/autos/my-favorite-car-list my-favorite-car-request: my-address  Where the file specified is a list of comma and newline separated addresses.  This file can be in the list admin's home directory, owned by the list admin.  Bounced Mail:  this still has a problem; bounced mail usually gets distributed to all the members of the list, which is generally considered somewhat irritating. Therefore, the way that the driving school mailing list is set up is instructive (Thanks to harpal chohan of the bmw list for this setup, by the way.  I'm not sure where he got it from.)   school-request:   welty school-rebroadcast:  :include:/home/newwelty/misc/autos/school/list school: \\\"|/usr/local/adm/bin/explscript school\\\" owner-school: school-request owner-school-out: school-request   here's what is going on here:  the owner- and -request addresses are intended as traps for bounced mail coming from the network.  the -request address also serves as the point of contact for administrative duties.  school is what people send mail to; instead of pointing at addresses, it points at a shell script which rewrites headers before resending the email.  school-broadcast (of which nobody except me knows the name; the name has been changed here to protect my own sanity) points at the actual list members.  the shell script i use is as follows:  ----------------- #!/bin/sh cd /tmp sed -e '/^Reply-To:/d' -e '/^Sender:/d' -e '/^From /d' | \\\\         (echo Reply-To: ${1}@balltown.cma.com; \\\\          echo Errors-To: ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com; \\\\          echo Sender: ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com; \\\\          cat -) | \\\\         /usr/lib/sendmail -om -f ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com \\\\                 -F \\\"The ${1} Mailing List\\\" ${1}-rebroadcast exit 0 -------------------  note that this script does not know the name of the list; the name is passed in from outside, so that the script may be used for multiple lists (i run several out of this site.) the script excises Reply-To:, Sender:, and From lines from the incoming message, substitutes for Sender: and Reply-To:, and adds Errors-to: 99.9% of all email bounce messages end up being sent to the -request or owner- addresses if this header rewrite is done.  For digested lists, there is some digestification software around.

I can't imagine why you included it. \",\" To boorishly reply to myself, I found I did have the Instrutech information already. The specs (to use the term loosely) are as follows:  A/D: 16 bit converter, with 14 bit accuracy to 100 kHz, 12 bit accuracy to 200 kHz. No specs for S/N, monotonicity, linearity. There are 8 multiplexed inputs sharing the single A/D, so that all inputs are not samples at the same time, and in the above conversion specs the all-channel sample rate must be used. Thus, for two channels, you only have 14 unknown quality bits at 50 kHz per channel. This is poorer quality than the national Instruments, at the same sample rate.  D/A: 16 bit converter. No specs for S/N, monotonicity, linearity. Each of the 4 output channels has its own converter.\",\"Concerning the proposed newsgroup split, I personally am not in favor of    doing this.  I learn an awful lot about all aspects of graphics by reading    this group, from code to hardware to algorithms.  I just think making 5    different groups out of this is a wate, and will only result in a few posts    a week per group.  I kind of like the convenience of having one big forum    for discussing all aspects of graphics.  Anyone else feel this way?    Just curious.  I disagree.  You could learn the same amount by reading all the split groups, and it would make things easier for those of us who are less omnivorous.  There is no \\\"waste\\\" in creating news groups -- its just a bit of shuffling about.

We ran into one of my relatives at the  bus station and got to talking. A lot of people had gathered not far away, near the store. Well at first we didn't know what was happening, and then a fellow I know comes up to me, an Azerbaijani guy, and says, \\\"What are you standing here for? Go home immediately!\\\" I asked, \\\"What's going on?\\\" He says,  \\\"What's the matter, can't you see, they've overturned a car and they're  killing Armenians!\\\" He helped me catch a cab and we got home safely.  We sat at home for two days. During that time a gang of bandits came into our  courtyard. But the neighbors wouldn't let them in the building. There were  about 80 of them. They had sticks and pieces of armatures in their hands. They were shouting something, but you couldn't understand it. It wasn't one voice  or two, all of them were shouting in a chorus. They turned toward Building 35. They went up to the third _floor, and we see that they're breaking glass and  throwing things out the window. After a while they come out the entryway: one  has a pair of jeans in his hands, another has a tape recorder, and a third a  guitar. They went on toward the auto parts store.  We had to save ourselves. After midnight on March 1 we went to hide at School  No. 33, which is in Microdistrict 13. There were two other Armenian families  there with us. There were 13 of us altogether. Out of all of them I had only  known Ernest before, he had moved to Sumgait from Kirovabad. The Azerbaijani  guard at the school let us in. At first he didn't want to, but there was  nowhere else for us to go. We had to plead with him and talk him into it. We  were told that on that day, the 1st, there would be an attack on our  microdistrict.  We went upstairs to a classroom on the second floor.  On the city radio station they announced three telephone numbers that could be used to summon assistance or communicate anything important. I called one of  them and the First Secretary of the Sumgait City Party Committee answered. I asked him for assistance. I say, \\\"We're in School No. 33, we need to be  evacuated.\\\" Well he says, \\\"Got it, wait there, I'm sending out help now.\\\"  I know his voice. The First Secretary had been to our plant, I had spoken with him personally. When I called he said, \\\"Muslimzade here.\\\"  About two hours after the call we heard shouts near the school. We looked out the window and about 100 to 120 people were outside saying, \\\"Armenians, come  out, we're here to get you.\\\" They have clubs, axes, and armature shafts in  their hands. The guard sat there with us, and asked, \\\"Where should I go?\\\" I  say, \\\"If your life is of any value to you you'll go down there and say that  the Armenians were here and that they left.\\\" That's what he did. He went down  there and said, \\\"The Armenians were here,\\\" he said, \\\"I let them out the back  door, they went that way.\\\" And pointed with his hand. And with shouts and  noise the mob set off in the direction he had pointed.  So the assistance we had been promised did come. They sent us help, all right! Instead of sending real soldiers he had sent his own. I am positive that Muslimzade did that. No one had seen us entering the school, no one knew that  we were there. In any case, we stayed at the school until seven in the  morning, and no soldiers of any sort came to our aid.  In the morning we went to my relative's in Microdistrict 1, and the soldiers  took us to the SK club from there. The club was jammed with people, and there  were lots of people ahead of us--there was no space available. One small boy,  about three months old, died right in my arms. There wasn't a single doctor,  nothing. The boy was uninjured, there were no wounds or bruises on him. He was just very ill. They gave him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, they did everything they could under the circumstances, but were unable to save him. And his  mother and father, a young Armenian couple, were right there, on the floor ...  I searched for a spot for us in the SK, we have a small child of our own, I wanted to find a room or something to put my family in. I went up to the third floor, there were a lot of soldiers up there, bandaged, with canes, limping,  with their heads broken open. They were a terrible sight. Young guys, all of  them.  There were a lot of bandaged Armenians, too. Everyone had been beaten,  everyone was crying, wailing, and calling for help. I think that the City Party Committee ignored us completely. True, there was a snack bar: a sausage  was 30 kopeks or 40 kopeks, a package of cookies that cost 26 kopeks was being sold for 50, a bottled soft drink cost a ruble . . . But there was no way to  get the things any cheaper.  I met my old uncle, Aram Mikhailovich, there. He saw me and tears welled up in his eyes. My whole life he had told me that we were friendly peoples, that we  worked together, he always had Azerbaijanis over at his house. And now he saw  me and there was nothing he could say, he just cried. You can understand his  feelings, of course.

You all are an insult to you race! {assuming you are also semitic}  Now I have a comment concerning Israeli terrorism during the 1930's and 1940's.  The Hirgun, and other branch - off militant groups, did fight the British do get them out of Palestine.  Yet I fail to see how this Israeli form of terrorism was better than the terrorism practiced now by the Arabs.  These Jewish terrorist groups killed innocent British soldiers, but not only thta also killed many Jews who were in favor of a compromise with the Palestinians.  In addition, they massacred an entire Palestinian village in 1948, contributing to the exodus of the frightened Palestinians who feared their very lives.  I mention this not because I'm anti semitic [I'm part Jewish] but because this self righteousness on the part of the Israelites pisses me off so.  I'm not as critical of the Palestinians because they were indeed screwed over by the Jews.

Going into the 1992/93 season, the numbers of Euros on NHL teams have escalated to the following stats:  Canadians: 400 Americans: 100 Europeans: 100     Please note that these numbers are rounded off, and taken from the top 25 players on each of the 24 teams. My source is the Vancouver Sun.     Here's the point: there are far too many Europeans in the NHL. I am sick of watching a game between an American and a Canadian team (let's say, the Red Wings and the Canucks) and seeing names like \\\"Bure\\\" \\\"Konstantinov\\\" and \\\"Borshevshky\\\". Is this North America or isn't it? Toronto, Detriot, Quebec, and Edmonton are particularly annoying, but the numbers of Euros on other teams is getting worse as well.       I live in Vancouver and if I hear one more word about \\\"Pavel Bure, the Russian Rocket\\\" I will completely throw up. As it is now, every time I see the Canucks play I keep hoping someone will cross-check Bure into the plexiglassso hard they have to carry him out on a stretcher. (By the way, I'm not a Canucks fan to begin with ;-).       Okay, the stretcher remark was a little carried away. But the point is that I resent NHL owners drafting all these Europeans INSTEAD of Canadians (and some Americans). It denies young Canadians the opportunity to play in THEIR NORTH AMERICAN LEAGUE and instead gives it to Europeans, who aren't even better hockey players. It's all hype. This \\\"European mystique\\\" is sickening, but until NHL owners get over it, Canadian and American players will continue to have to fight harder to get drafted into their own league.      With the numbers of Euros in the NHL escalating, the problem is clearly only getting worse.      I'm all for the creation of a European Hockey League, and let the Bures and Selannes of the world play on their own continent.      I just don't want them on mine.       --  Richard J.

SCSI-1 {with a SCSI-1 controler chip} range is indeed 0-5MB/s and that is ALL you have right about SCSI SCSI-1 {With a SCSI-2 controller chip}: 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit}  Note the INCREASE in SPEED, the Mac Quadra uses this version of SCSI-1  so it DOES exist. Some PC use this set up too. SCSI-2 {8-bit/SCSI-1 mode}:          4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst SCSI-2 {16-bit/wide or fast mode}:  8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst SCSI-2 {32-bit/wide AND fast}:     15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst   By your OWN data the \\\"Although SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI\\\" is correct With a SCSI-2 controller chip SCSI-1 can reach 10MB/s which is indeed \\\"20% faster than IDE\\\" {120% of 8.3 is 9.96}. ALL these SCSI facts have been posted to this newsgroup in my Mac & IBM info sheet {available by FTP on  sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6) in the info-mac/report as  mac-ibm-compare[version #].txt (It should be 173 but 161 may still be there)}  Part of this problem is both Mac and IBM PC are inconsiant about what SCSI is which.  Though it is WELL documented that the Quadra has a SCSI-2 chip an Apple salesperson said \\\"it uses a fast SCSI-1 chip\\\" {Not at a 6MB/s, 10MB/s burst it does not. SCSI-1 is 5MB/s maximum synchronous and Quadra uses ANsynchronous SCSI which is SLOWER}  It seems that Mac and IBM see SCSI-1 interface and think 'SCSI-1' when it maybe a SCSI-1 interface driven in the machine by a SCSi-2 controller chip in 8-bit mode {Which is MUCH FASTER then true SCSI-1 can go}.\",\"   Hello, I know that this has been discussed before.

CAPITAL letters, or NOT, the above is pure nonsense.  It BM] seems to me that short sighted Armenians are escalating the hostilities        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^      Again, Armenians in KARABAKH are SIMPLY defending themselves. What do      want them to do. Lay down their ARMS and let Azeris walk all over them.  BM] while hoping that Turkey will stay out.  Stop and think for a moment, BM] will you?  Armenia doesn't need anyone to drag her into the conflict, it BM] is a part of it.    Armenians KNEW from the begining that TURKS were FULLY engaged  training AZERIS militarily to fight against  KARABAKHI-Armenians.   henrik] The KARABAKHI-ARMENIANS who have lived in their HOMELAND for 3000  henrik] years (CUT OFF FROM ARMENIA and GIVEN TO AZERIS BY STALIN) are the  henrik] ones DIRECTLY involved in the CONFLICT. They are defending  henrik] themselves against AZERI AGGRESSION.   BM]  Huh?  You didn't expect Azeri's to be friendly to forces fighting with them BM]  within their borders?     Well, history is SAD. Remember, those are relocated Azeris into          the Armenian LAND of KARABAKH by the STALIN regime.  henrik] At last, I hope that the U.S. insists that Turkey stay out of the  henrik] KARABAKH crisis so that the repeat of the CYPRUS invasion WILL NEVER  henrik] OCCUR again.  BM] You're not playing with a full deck, are you?  Where would Turkey invade?     It is not up to me to speculate but I am sure Turkey would have stepped    into Armenia if SHE could.   BM] Are you throwing the Cyprus buzzword around with s.c.g. in the header BM] in hopes that the Greek netters will jump the gun?     Absolutely NOT ! I am merely trying to emphasize that in many         cases, HISTORY repeats itself.   BM] Yes indeed Turkey has the military prowess to intervene, what she wishes  BM] she had, however, is the diplomatic power to stop the hostilities and bring BM] the parties to the negotiating table.  That's hard to do when Armenians  BM] are attacking Azeri towns.   So, let me understand in plain WORDS what you are saying; Turkey         wants a PEACEFUL END to this CONFLICT. NOT !!   I will believe it when I see it.   Now, as far as attacking, what do you do when you see a GUN pointing         to your HEAD ? Do you sit there and WATCH or DEFEND yoursef(fat chance)?  Do you remember what Azeris did to the Armenians in BAKU ? All the  BARBERIAN ACTS especially against MOTHERS and their CHILDREN. I mean  BURNING people ALIVE !  BM] Armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the  BM] futility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that  BM] leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis that's  BM] going to cause incessant skirmishes.     Armenians in KARABAKH want PEACE and their own republic. They are          NOT asking much. They simply want to get back what was TAKEN AWAY   from them and GIVEN to AZERIS by STALIN.   BM] Think of 10 or 20 years down the line -- both of the newly independent  BM] countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe  BM] the other out.   These people will be neighbors, would it not be better  BM] to keep the bad blood between them minimal?   Don't get me WRONG. I also want PEACEFUL solution to the  conflict. But until Azeris realize that, the Armenians in  KARABAKH will defend themselves against aggresion.  BM] If you belong to the Armenian diaspora, keep in mind that what strikes BM] your fancy on the map is costing the local Armenians dearly in terms of  BM] their blood and future.    Again, you are taking different TURNS. Armenia HAS no intension         to GRAB any LAND from Azerbaijan. The Armenians in KARABAKH         are simply defending themselves UNTIL a solution is SET.  BM] It's easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize  BM] craziness to have your feelings about Turks tickled.  The Armenians BM] in Armenia and N-K will be there, with the same people you seem to hate  BM] as their neighbors, for maybe 3000 years more.  The sooner there's peace in BM] the region the better it is for them and everyone else.  I'd push for BM] compromise if I were you instead of hitting the caps-lock and spreading BM] inflammatory half-truths.\",\"Clinton has backed off from the $16 billion jobs bill.

EDT                  Q   Why was the 10:00 a.m. postponed?                  MS. MYERS:  Just due to scheduling conflicts.  So as we  put out, the President will meet with the leaders of the national  police organizations at 2:00 p.m. in the Rose Garden, as opposed to  10:00 a.m.  The only other things on his schedule today are:  At  11:00 a.m. he'll meet with General Vessey, who, as you know, is on  his way to Vietnam to continue working on the MIA-POW issue.  At  12:30 p.m. he'll have lunch with the Vice President in the Oval  Office.  And at 2:00 p.m. he'll meet with the police organizations. Then from 3:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. he'll do his weekly photos with the  various groups.              Q   A photo op with Vessey?              MS. MYERS:  There's no coverage on the Vessey meeting.              Q   Why?              MS. MYERS:  Why?  It's a closed meeting.                Q   What about the lunch?              MS. MYERS:  The lunch?  No, there's no coverage.              Q   Is he meeting with any congress people today?              MS. MYERS:  Nothing scheduled.              Q   There are no meetings --              MS. MYERS:  There are no congressional meetings today,  no.              Q   Has the President been given any information by the  Pentagon or reached any conclusion about the validity of this report  from Hanoi?  Any instructions to Vessey on how to deal with the  Vietnamese on that subject?              MS. MYERS:  Well, clearly, the report is the first order  of business.  It's high on the agenda on something that they'll  discuss.  I think the President and General Vessey will discuss the  parameters of his visit to Vietnam today, but the President hasn't  drawn any conclusions about the report yet.  Certainly, it's  something that he wants General Vessey to talk with the Vietnamese  about first.              Q   Did the President talk with any Republican senators  yesterday about the stimulus package?              MS. MYERS:  He spoke with Senator Dole.              Q   How many times?              MS. MYERS:  I believe once during the day and once last  night.              Q   What was the outcome of that?              MS. MYERS:  They're continuing to work toward some kind  of an agreement on a jobs package.              Q   Is it your impression that Senator Dole is in any  way flexible on this?              MS. MYERS:  Well, I think we're hopeful that we're going  to get some kind of jobs package through the Senate, and we'll  continue to work with Senator Dole and others until we reach some  kind of an agreement.              Q   Did they discuss the VAT tax?              MS. MYERS:  I don't know if that came up.              Q   Can you check that?              MS. MYERS:  Sure.        Q   So what are they -- is the President offering to  scale down his program -- is that what he's trying to do, buy it down  to where Dole will sign on?              MS. MYERS:  Well, he's trying to protect as much of it  as he can.  But it's important to him to get some kind of a jobs  package through the Senate and through Congress now.  And as soon as  we reach some conclusions on that, we'll let you know.  But at the  moment, he's continuing to consult with members of Congress  including, obviously, Senator Dole.              Q   Is he talking to anybody else?              MS. MYERS:  I don't believe he talked to any other  Republicans yesterday.              Q   Is he talking to anybody today?              MS. MYERS:  I don't think anything is scheduled, but I  wouldn't rule it out.              Q   We were led to believe that the President called  Mr. Dole on the subject of Russian aid and that Bob Dole brought the  conversation around to stimulus package.  Is that correct?              MS. MYERS:  I think the President has contacted several  people on Russian aid.  I think that it was always expected that the  stimulus package or the jobs package will be part of any conversation  he would have with Senator Dole.  The primary objective of the  conversation was Russian aid.  That was the first order of business,  but it was both.              Q   In the President's mind, are they linked  politically in that if the Republicans continue to reject the  stimulus package, he thinks it will be harder to sell Russian aid to  the American people?  Has he made that argument?              MS. MYERS:  I can't talk about specifically what  arguments he might have made.  The President is obviously committed  to both.  He liked to see a jobs package to the American people  first.  But as you know, we outlined the details of additional  Russian aid last night in Tokyo.              Q   But does the President believe that the stimulus  package will make it more difficult to persuade Americans to vote for  Russian -- to accept a vote for Russian aid?              MS. MYERS:  I think that the President is going to  continue to work to pass the stimulus package, to pass a jobs  package, and we're still hopeful that we'll get some kind of jobs  package through the Congress.              Q   Is it fair to say that the President is negotiating  now with Dole?              MS. MYERS:  He's discussing options with him.              Q   On the stimulus, is it your understanding that over  the break some Democrats, themselves, have left the support that they  had earlier for the package, the stimulus package?              MS. MYERS:  I think we still have wide support in the  Senate for the jobs package.              Q   But specifically, that you've lost Democrats other  than Shelby?              MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so.  There hasn't been a  vote.              Q   What about Kohl?              Q   Kohl and Feingold?              MS. MYERS:  There hasn't been a vote yet.  And we'll  continue to work with senators to try to get a majority to try to  bring the package to a vote, because we believe that a majority of  the members of the United States Senate support the package.              Q   If you're weren't worried about Kohl and Feingold,  why did George mention Milwaukee projects the other day?              MS. MYERS:  I think George pointed out a number of  projects in a number of states that stand to be funded, or to lose  funding if this jobs package doesn't pass.              Q   No Democrats.  (Laughter.)              MS. MYERS:  I'll let you draw your own conclusions.              Q   Does he plan to talk to Dole again today or any  other Republicans again today?              MS. MYERS:  There's nothing specifically scheduled, but  again, I wouldn't rule it out.              Q   Does he plan to put out any more press releases to  any other states today?              MS. MYERS:  What we've done is we're in the process of  breaking down the benefits of the jobs package state by state.  I  think it's entirely feasible that as we sort of are able to sum those  up, we'll send out press releases to the various states that suggest  how their states would benefit from this package.              Q   Will you share those with us?              MS. MYERS:  Sure.  As we did yesterday.              Q   Do you have copies of the ones you sent --              MS. MYERS:  Yes, we made those available yesterday.  And  we certainly can continue to provide them today.              Q   Dee Dee, since yesterday's questions and subsequent  stories about the VAT, what further consideration of this issue has  been given?              MS. MYERS:  Nothing's changed since yesterday.  I think  the President commented on it this morning to say only that it was  something he knew was being considered by the task force and that he  has not made a decision on, and I don't think we have anything to add  to that.              Q   But he also said that business and labor groups are  telling him they support it.  Can you tell us --              MS. MYERS:  I think that there has been -- I'm not going  to speculate on who supports it.  I think the President said that  there has been some support among business and labor groups.  I don't  think he said he was directly contacted by them.              Q   Are we to take that to mean that the administration  has sounded out business and labor groups on this --              MS. MYERS:  I think there's been plenty of public  discourse on this over the years and even recently, but I don't think  I want to add to that.              Q   In February, though, the President said that this  was something to be considered 10 or 15 years down the road.  What  has happened between then and now to cause this administration to  change its mind?              MS. MYERS:  I think as we said yesterday, it is  something that the working groups are looking at.  They're  considering a wide variety of options on everything from funding to  specific options that will be covered by the President's health care  plan.  The President has not taken it up yet, has not made a decision  on it.  And beyond that, I don't have anything to add.              Q   You haven't answered the question.  It wasn't being  considered by anyone in the White House after the President's  comments in February, and George reaffirmed that in a briefing.              Q   And then suddenly --              Q   What happened?        MS. MYERS:  The working groups, as we have said  throughout, we instructed to consider a wide variety of options  across-the-board.  And one of the things that has been talked about  and that they are clearly considering is some kind of a value-added  tax.        Q   But the President himself took this off the table,  Dee Dee, and suddenly it reappears.  And this goes to the credibility  of this administration in a way.  What has happened in the meantime?        MS. MYERS:  The President has not looked at this, it  hasn't been presented to him, again, yet.  The working groups are  looking at it, as they're looking at a wide variety of options, and  no decisions have been made.        Q   And it raises the question of how independently the  task force is working.        MS. MYERS:  The task force was instructed to consider  all options, and they've taken that mandate seriously and they're  considering all options.        Q   But that's not the impression that the President  left in February.  The impression he left was that this was something  that was long-range, to be looked at 10, 15 years down the road.  The  clear implication of his remarks was that this was something that was  not on the table, not an option.         Q   \\\"If it changes I'll tell you.\\\"              Q   Bring him on.        Q   And you repeatedly referred to the President's  remarks, telling us that those were still in operation.              MS. MYERS:  It's changed, and we told you.  (Laughter.)              Q   But that's what Alice Rivlin's comments and Donna  Shalala comments were about.  I mean, that seemed like an  orchestrated effort because you have two independent Cabinet officers  --        MS. MYERS:  I wouldn't -- no, Alice Rivlin's not a  Cabinet member, first of all.  Second of all, it was not  orchestrated, but clearly, they both said yesterday and in the last  couple of days that it's something that's being looked at.  We  confirmed that yesterday.  And I don't have anything to add to that.        Q   Is it because he has very few options?        Q   Is this something that it will be incumbent upon  the task force to convince the President about?  In other words, has  the President himself personally ruled it out and it's now up to the  task force to convince him to put it back on the table?  Or is it, in  fact, back on the table, having been placed there by discussions with  the President?          MS. MYERS:  It is not the working group's mission at  this point to convince the President of anything.  It is their  mission to put before him his options and to explain the benefits and  the costs and the basic pros and cons of each of those options.  I  think that they will certainly present the VAT to him in that  context, and at this point he's not -- that presentation has not been  made, but it's something that he will hear and he has not made a  decision on.        Q   They will present it to him as one of his options,  though he specifically ruled it out?        MS. MYERS:  Correct.        Q   Dee Dee, is this more than a trial balloon?  Is  this a serious consideration that the working groups are giving to  this form of taxation?        MS. MYERS:  It's simply a statement of fact.  The  working groups are considering a wide variety of options on a number  of issues relating to health care reform.  One of the options that  they're looking at is the VAT.         Q   Dee Dee, when the working groups were examining  this possibility, was this on the table during the same time period  that you were telling us that it was not?        MS. MYERS:  I don't know what the specific timing of  their drafting of options is.  I don't know.        Q   Who was telling you that it was not under  consideration?        MS. MYERS:  I was referring back to the President's  comments.        Q   Have they discovered that the sin taxes won't raise  enough money to fund the core benefit package?        MS. MYERS:  No, there's no decisions that have been made  on how to pay for the health care plan.              Q   I'm asking whether the projections --              MS. MYERS:  There's a number of options depending on how  the plan is structured.  You can't decide how much the plan is going  to cost until you decide what the plan is going to look like.  And so  you can't discuss what financing options have been ruled in our out  until you know.        Q   Dee Dee, we've been told that they have a computer  models on a number of possible packages.        MS. MYERS:  Correct.          Q   The question is whether they have now determined  whether sin taxes would not produce enough money for even the barest  minimum package.  That is not a very difficult computation.        MS. MYERS:  It is a question that you know that we're  not going to answer until -- there's a number of options being  considered.  It depends on how the package is structured.  The exact  details of the package and the financing mechanisms used to pay for  them are all among the decisions that have yet to be made.                Q   And when the President has been meeting with health  care -- his health care advisors, which we are told he has been doing  --              MS. MYERS:  Correct.              Q      they have never once said to him, these are your  funding options, including the VAT?  He has never heard the word VAT  in his --              MS. MYERS:    I am not going to comment on the specific  nature of the daily -- they're not daily, but the quasi-regular  briefings.              Q   Well, you have.              MS. MYERS:  I have not, other than to say that he's not  considered the VAT.  And I think that is a true statement.              Q   No, but you said that it has not been presented to  him as an option.              MS. MYERS:  Correct.              Q   That doesn't mean he hasn't heard about it.              MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to get into the details of  what's discussed.  I think that statement stands for itself.              Q      specific, Dee Dee.  When you say he hasn't  looked at it, do you mean that he hasn't looked at it in terms of  paying for medical coverage, or hasn't looked at it in general?   Because back in Chilicothe he was very specific in defining how it  works, what the advantages are, the whole thing.  It sounds like --              MS. MYERS:  But that was -- I think in Chilicothe, if  you go back to his remarks there, it was a broader philosophical  discussion of the tax structure.  And I think the comments were  generally in reference to the overall economic plan.  But clearly,  it's something that he's thought about in the broad context.  I mean,  that was clear in Chilicothe.  What I'm saying is that in the process  of the working groups it's something that he hasn't considered yet.   It's something that the working groups will present to him among the  number of options, and that no decisions have been made.  And I'm not  going to comment any further on the details of the meetings where  health care issues are being discussed.              Q   It's your statement from this podium that no  discussion of this has taken place.  You say that no option -- that  the option has not been presented to him.              MS. MYERS:  That is correct.              Q   Do you stand by -- does the White House still stand  by George's statement in March that this will not be in the proposal?              MS. MYERS:  No decisions have been made.  We have  nothing to add to what's already been said.              Q   Let me follow up here.  Do you stand by what Rivlin  said yesterday, that if any kind of VAT were to be used or  considered, that other changes to the tax code would have to be made  so that it would be less regressive?              MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to comment any further on what  might happen if.              Q   But do you stand by the previous conversations in  February that if there were to be a VAT, I think the President said  you'd exclude food and energy --              MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to comment on the specific  structure of a decision that hasn't been made.              Q   Was the President aware prior to Donna Shalala's  comments yesterday that this was under consideration by the working  groups?              MS. MYERS:  I don't know specifically what --              Q   Could you check for us, because that's a real  important credibility question?              MS. MYERS:  Sure.              Q   Since the task force was brought together this  issue has been discussed, at the beginning and throughout, as one  fairly painless way to raise a lot of money.  Were you all kept in  the dark?  Was the Press Office kept in the dark over the past month  and a half when you've been denying that a VAT tax would be  considered that it was actually on the table over there as an option?              MS. MYERS:  I think we've said all that we have to say.   It is something the working groups are looking at.  The President has  not made a decision about it yet.  And beyond that, I have nothing to  add.              Q   Well, sorry, Dee Dee, there are still a couple of  questions that we are going to have to ask because we have a problem  with credibility here -- yours primarily.  What we're asking is, if  you all were not told at all that this thing was being considered  while you were coming out here and telling us that it was not, or if  it's a case that you were coming out here and deliberately misleading  us.              MS. MYERS:  I don't believe that anyone has ever come  out here and deliberately misled you from this podium -- ever --ever.              Q   Has anyone tried to shade it a little bit to  indicate something -- has anybody told anybody to come out --              MS. MYERS:  We're not trying to shade answers or  deliberately mislead anybody.  I've said what I have to say about  this issue.              Q   All we were trying to find out --              MS. MYERS:  I understand what you're trying to find out  and I've given you the answers, Helen.              Q   We're trying to find out what changed -- what made  it an option again.  That's the --              MS. MYERS:  The working groups were given a broad  mandate to investigate all options, and they are doing that.                Q   Yes, but it wasn't an option before.  How can you  investigate it if the President has taken it off the table?              MS. MYERS:  It is something that they're obviously  considering and the President has not made a decision on.              Q   Yes, but he took it off the table in February.              MS. MYERS:  Working groups are considering it.  They'll  present it to the President at some point and he'll make a decision.              Q   Why would they consider it if he has taken it off  the table?              MS. MYERS:  It's clearly on the table.               Q   Yes, but he took it off the table.  Did he change  his mind?              MS. MYERS:  It's back on the table, Bill.              Q   Did he change his mind?              MS. MYERS:  He said this morning that he hasn't made a  decision about it.  He obviously knows that it's on the table.  It's  something that he will look at at some and when we have a decision on  this we'll let you know.              Q   So he must have changed his mind, right?              MS. MYERS:  At some point it will be looked at.  I mean,  --              Q   Dee Dee, there's like two options -- either he  changed his mind or the working groups think they're authority  exceeds the President's.              MS. MYERS:  The working groups were given a broad  mandate to look at all options; they've done that.              Q   Are you going to put out his income tax?              MS. MYERS:  Yes, there will be something available on  his income tax probably later this afternoon.  His return will be  available.               Q   Will there be any kind of briefing to go through  it?              MS. MYERS:  No, nothing's planned.  I think someone will  be available, probably not in a briefing setting, but to walk you  through the questions.              Q   We're used to be walked line-by-line through the  presidential tax forms.              MS. MYERS:  I've seen those briefings.  (Laughter.)              Q   Could we have one?              MS. MYERS:   No, I don't think there will be any kind of  a formal briefing, but there will be somebody available to answer  your questions about it.              Q   Did they file a joint form?              MS. MYERS:  Yes.              Q   When did he file it?              MS. MYERS:  I believe it's being filed today.              Q   Dee Dee, is there going to be a backgrounder for  Miyazawa?              MS. MYERS:  No, there will be a readout after the  meeting.              Q   No backgrounder today?              MS. MYERS:  No backgrounder today.              Q   This is complicated stuff.  We need help.   (Laughter.)              MS. MYERS:  We can't give you taxes and Miyazawa all in  one day, it's too confusing.  (Laughter.)              Q   Vance and Owen have opened the doors on the use of  force in Bosnia.   They've both said that, A, they never ruled it  out, and B, it might be necessary now.  Does that influence your  thinking on whether or not to change your approach?              MS. MYERS:  There's been no change in our policy towards  Bosnia.  We have always said that we'd consider --              Q   But does that impact upon your decision?  Are they  people whose opinions would carry weight with you?              MS. MYERS:  They're people whose opinions carry weight  certainly.  I mean, the President supports the process that they've  initiated.  But there's been no change in our policy for Bosnia,  although we're considering a number of options right now.  If the  Serbs don't come back to the negotiating table, if they don't sign on  to some kind of an agreement, we will consider additional options,  which we've been saying regularly.              Q   One follow-up question then?  We cannot get a  straight answer from anyone in the administration.  Why do you not  set a deadline for the Serbs?  Can you tell us the strategic or  tactical reasons for not giving them a deadline to come to the table?              MS. MYERS:  We're continuing to put pressure on them  every day.              Q   Which doesn't work so --              MS. MYERS:  Well, we think it is having some effect.   We're going to continue to tighten sanctions.  As you know, we  support the omnibus resolution.  We expect that to come to a vote on  the 26th.                Q   You say it's having an effect -- can you give us  any documentation?              MS. MYERS:  I'd be happy to provide somebody to talk to  you about the impact of the sanctions and things like that.              Q   There's been no -- you have not been able to  provide anybody who can tell us that the sanctions have had any  effect in Bosnia.  Serbia, yes; in Bosnia, no.              MS. MYERS:  I think that they've had effect in Serbia  and we think they've had some effect in Bosnia.  And again, I'll be  happy to provide somebody to walk you through the details of that, if  you'd like.              Q   We would like to hear from someone who can show us  what the effect has been in Bosnia.  We had the briefing on all of  the terrible things that are happening in Belgrade, but we haven't  seen anything that indicates an impact on the fighting.  Can you  provide something along those lines?              MS. MYERS:  I will see what I can get you.              Q   On the extra Russian aid that Christopher announced  this morning -- where is that money coming from?              MS. MYERS:  We'll have to work with Congress on the  details of that package.              Q   So that would be new money that you would hope to  get?              MS. MYERS:    Yes, that's new money, in addition to the  $1.6 billion announced in Vancouver.  So I assume that you all have  seen the $1.8-billion package that was announced this morning in  Tokyo by Secretary Christopher.              Q   Isn't there a concern, though, about offering  something which you have to get in Congress?  I mean, that was the  concern with Vancouver; you didn't want to do that.              MS. MYERS:  The concern with Vancouver was to do  something immediately, which required money that was already approved  in the Fiscal '93 budget.  What we're looking at now is a little bit  longer-term plan to build on top of the $1.6 billion that we  announced in Vancouver.  This clearly will require congressional  approval, or some of it will anyway, and we're going to continue to  work with Congress to make that happen.              Q   To what extent has that been vetted or agreed to by  Congress?              MS. MYERS:  The President has had a number of  conversations with members and will continue to work with them as  this process moves forward.              Q   Was Christopher able to put this package out with a  fair degree of understanding that you will be able to get it through  Congress?              MS. MYERS:  It was created in consultation with  Congress.              Q   In meeting with the law enforcement officials, is  that -- does that have a set speech and a goal?  A direction?              MS. MYERS:  Yes, the President will talk about -- and  the law enforcement organizations are endorsing the President's jobs  package.  They believe particularly the summer jobs package will help  give kids something to do.              Q   Who are they?              MS. MYERS:  It's members or leadership from three  organizations:  NAPO, which is the National Association of Police  Organizations; IBPO, which is the International Brotherhood of Police  Organizations, I believe; and IUPA, which is the International Union  of Police Associations.              Q   Will the FBI chief be there?              MS. MYERS:  The FBI chief?  No.              Q   Or any other federal law enforcement officials?              MS. MYERS:  No, it will be the President and these  national law enforcement organization leaders.              Q   Does the $1.8 billion announced today include the  $400 million that's in the FY '94 budget for disarmament?              MS. MYERS:  No.  The Nunn-Lugar money is separate.              Q   So this would be the $700 million that's in the  budget already, plus another $1.1 billion?              MS. MYERS:  I believe all of this is on top of the $700  million already in the budget.              Q   Is this going to be part of the supplemental or  Fiscal '94 --              MS. MYERS:  We'll work with Congress on the exact  funding mechanism -- on exactly how this will be paid for.              Q   This $1.8 billion on top of --              MS. MYERS:  On top of $700 million -- on top of the $400  million Nunn-Lugar money we announced earlier.              Q   And this is what prompted the President to call Bob  Dole -- it was on this tranche, not on the previous money he was  calling Bob Dole?              MS. MYERS:  Correct.              Q   Is there a briefing on Miyazawa?              MS. MYERS:  There will be a readout after the meeting  with Miyazawa.  Tomorrow.              Q   Dee Dee, on a totally unrelated matter, some  Republicans who are active in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are  complaining about this new cozy relationship between the White House  and the Chamber of Commerce.  There are -- the town hall meeting the  other night, the satellite and all of this relationship. Does the White House feel that you're getting too close to these  Chambers of Commerce?              MS. MYERS:  That's an interesting charge.  (Laughter.)   After how many years of Democrats being accused of not paying any  attention to the Chambers, now there are those who would accuse us of  being too close.  I think that's interesting.  But no, we're thrilled  by the support we've received from the national Chamber and local  Chambers across the country and we'll continue to work with them on  this and other initiatives.              Q   What's the status of the President thinking about  going to this Democratic retreat?              MS. MYERS:  It's on his calendar.  I think he'll almost  certainly go.              Q   All three days?              MS. MYERS:  We haven't figured out exactly when he'll be  there yet.                Q   Is it open to coverage?              MS. MYERS:  No, I believe the whole thing is closed.              Q   Is he going to have any kind of address, statement,  anything at all on the gay rights march on the 25th?              MS. MYERS:  We're still looking at that.  We haven't  made a final decision about how we'll -- who will make a statement or  what --              Q   Any meetings scheduled with any of the leaders?              MS. MYERS:  Nothing is scheduled, but I wouldn't rule it  out.              Q   What about an AIDS czar?              MS. MYERS:  It's coming.              Q   Anything on the weekend?              Q   There's been a suggestion that he's going to this  retreat to avoid having to participate in the gay rights -- or appear  or have any involvement in the gay rights march.              MS. MYERS:  No, I think this is something he's been  discussing for a long time -- appearing at the Senate Democratic  retreat.              Q   The weekend?              MS. MYERS:  Weekend?  Don't know -- the only thing on  right now is the radio address on Saturday.              Q   Any travel plans?              MS. MYERS:  If it changes -- none right now.              Q   He's not going to be off campaigning for his  stimulus package?              MS. MYERS:  No specific plans right now.              Q   What about mid-week?  Anything likely?              MS. MYERS:  It's possible.  Yes, I think it's likely  that we'll travel next week -- certainly the weekend.              Q   Has he called Thurmond about his daughter?              MS. MYERS:  I don't know.  I'll check.              Q   Going to name a drug czar this weekend?              MS. MYERS:  This weekend?  I don't believe so.              Q   And the radio address on Saturday -- is that going  to be focused on the stimulus package?              MS. MYERS:  I'm sure it will.              THE PRESS:  Thank you.\",\" ...

Note the early use of PostScript technology, predating many of this year's papers listed in the April 1st SIGGRAPH Program Announcement posted here a few days ago.  -- Eric   Intersection Between a Line and a Polygon (UNDECIDABLE??),  by Dave Baraff, Tom Duff   From: deb@charisma.graphics.cornell.edu  Newsgroups: comp.graphics  Keywords: P, NP, Jordan curve separation, Ursyhon Metrization Theorem  Organization: Program of Computer Graphics   I think that this is a very difficult problem.  To start with, lines and polygons are semi-algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of points.  Here are a few off-the-cuff ideas.  First, we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated.  Now, the Jordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into exactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions.  Thus, the line lies completely inside the polygon, the line lies completely outside the polygon, or possibly (but this will rarely happen) the line intersects the polyon.  Now, the phrasing of this question says \\\"if a line intersects a polygon\\\", so this is a decision problem.  One possibility (the decision model approach) is to reduce the question to some other (well known) problem Q, and then try to solve Q.  An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem.  In recent years, many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a new language called PostScript.  (See \\\"PostScript Language\\\", by Adobe Systems Incorporated, ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).  So, given a line L and a polygon P, we can write a PostScript program that draws the line L and the polygon P, and then \\\"outputs\\\" the answer.  By \\\"output\\\", we mean the program executes a command called \\\"showpage\\\", which actually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon.  A quick examination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q, and thus the original problem.  There are two small problems with this approach.    (1) There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into the  reduced problem Q.  So, we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of  Choice (or equivalently, Zorn's Lemma).  But the use of the Axiom of  Choice is not regarded in a very serious light these days.   (2) More importantly, the question arises as to whether or not the  PostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper; or in  other words, will it halt?   Now, PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a  Turing Machine might do; thus the halting problem (for PostScript) is  undecidable.  It is quite possible that the original problem will turn  out to be undecidable.   I won't even begin to go into other difficulties, such as aliasing, finite precision and running out of ink, paper or both.  A couple of references might be:  1. Principia Mathematica.  Newton, I.

Organization: AT&T Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill NJ  The situation is not nearly as bleak as Baraff suggests (he should know better, he's hung around The Labs for long enough).  By the well known Dobbin-Dullman reduction (see J. Dullman & D. Dobbin, J. Comp. Obfusc. 37,ii:  pp. 33-947, lemma 17(a)) line-polygon intersection can be reduced to Hamiltonian Circuit, without(!) the use of Grobner bases, so LPI (to coin an acronym) is probably only NP-complete.  Besides, Turing-completeness will no longer be a problem once our Cray-3 is delivered, since it will be able to complete an infinite loop in 4 milliseconds (with scatter-gather.)  --------  From: deb@svax.cs.cornell.edu (David Baraff)  Well, sure its no worse than NP-complete, but that's ONLY if you restrict yourself to the case where the line satisfies a Lipschitz condition on its second derivative.

The explanation    we were given (at least at one point) was that they thought the cult    members would be at religious services.  My only comment on this bit    of idiocy is that if you're going to operate as a quasi-military unit,    you'd better understand basic military tactics.  One cardinal rule    is that only a fool plans an operation where if one assumption is    incorrect, the operation will fail disastrously.  2. We were told that ATF got four agents killed because they were    outgunned, they didn't expect such heavy resistance.  When    questioned about why such an overwhelming military-style assault    was planned, we were told that it was because the cultists were    thought to be heavily armed.  Can you say contradictory?  I knew    you could!  3. The BATF has had a bad reputation for years as a bunch of arrogant,    hotdoggers.  I was talking to relatives a couple of weeks ago and    referred to them as a bunch of Crockett and Tubbs wannabes.  I'm    more than ever convinced that's right on target.  An anecdote not    related to the Waco fiasco is that apparently the BATF screwed up    some of the evidence in the World Trade Center bombing.  There's    now an excellent chance some of the forensic evidence gathered by    the FBI will not be admissible in court.  This is not hearsay.  I    was told this by a relative of my wife's who happens to be an FBI    agent.  His opinion of the BATF was, ummm, well, let's just say    uncomplimentary.  4. I have *still* not been presented with one iota of evidence that    the BD's had *any* of the alleged illegal weaponry which was the    reason for the raid in the first place.  BTW, we're *still* hearing    this justification.  AG Reno, on CNN yesterday, made references    to this issue, without any substantiation.  She also waved around    the \\\"He's a child abuser and we heard he was beating the children!\\\"    flag.  Sigh.  5. A point re the Feds in general: their handling of the whole siege    reflected a complete lack of understanding of the probable thought    processes of the cultists.  AG Reno said they pushed the button    because they were afraid a mass suicide was in the offing.  My    only comment on that is that if the cultists were that close to    the edge, what the hell did she think their reaction would be to    an hours-long assault on the compound where holes were punched in    the walls and CS gas pumped in?  If I were a BD, I'd expect the    forces of the godless government to assault me at any time.  In    that light, whether they torched themselves or drank Jim Jones    Kool-Aid is irrelevant.  Also, look at how the siege was conducted:    Bright lights, loud rock music, cutting off communications and    other contact with the outside.  All measures designed to make the    BD's feel more and more isolated and threatened.  This might have    been a great strategy - if they were dealing with criminals.  As it    was, it looks to me like everything they did fed into Koresh's    paranoid delusions.     --   #include <std_disclaimer.h>\",\"     1. Get the friend to uninstall it.     2.

Just because it is hard for you  : to believe this doesn't mean that it isn't true.  Liars can be very pursuasive : just look at Koresh that you yourself cite.  This is whole basis of a great many here rejecting the Christian account of things. In the words of St. Madalyn Murrey-O'Hair, \\\"Face it folks, it's just silly ...\\\". Why is it okay to disbelieve because of your incredulity if you admit that it's a fallacy?\",\" I'll pose a question here that's got me thinking:  what distinguishes \\\"true\\\" religion from cults (I'm speaking generally here, not specifially about Christianity)?  Jerry Falwell was on Good Morning America on  Tuesday ostensibly to answer this question.  Basically, he said that true religion follows a message whereas a cult follows a person. But, then, Christianity is a cult because the message of Christianity IS the person of Jesus.  So what distinguishes, for example, the Branch Davidian \\\"cult\\\" from the Presbyterian \\\"church\\\"?  Doctrinal differences don't answer the question, IMHO, so don't use them as an answer.    -- Scott at Brandeis   \\\"But God demonstrates His     \\\"The Lord bless you, and keep you;   own love for us, in that      the Lord make His face shine on you,   while we were yet sinners,    and be gracious to you;   Christ died for us.\\\"        the Lord lift up His countenance on you,            and give you peace.\\\"   -- Romans 5:8 [NASB]  -- Numbers 6:24-26 [NASB]\",\" The documentary interviewed Koresh and current and ex-members.   The documentary disucussed Koresh's \\\"Christ\\\" status inside the cult,  cult brain-washing techniques, and unusual sex practices (the leader  gets any he wants, and tells others when they can or can't).  I will let  others decide if using religious authority to have sex with a minor is  technically child abuse or not.   All true.   Well, if a fire was deliberately set by members of the cult, then the  history and background of the cult is very relevant.  The history  and backgournd of the Jones cult was very important in understanding  what happened at Jonestown.  Not taking into account the history and background of Koresh's cult may  also help explain why the FBI and BATF so badly predicted the reponses  they would get from inside the compund nearly every step of the way in  this badly handled affair.   It is likely that there will be at least two investigations (JD and congress)  at this point.   Interesting and conflicting details are starting to come out.  I have  reverted back to wait mode to find out whether the fire was intentional  or accidental and how it started and why it spread so fast.   \",\" 740 Turbo in UK was good for 124mph.

Thanks!\",\" I'm still catching up from Spring Break, but bear with me...    Javy Lopez has proven, over 1400+ AB in the minor leagues, that he is ready to play in the majors. He is *not* being rushed. Players who are clearly too good for AA and play behind stiffs at the major league level are wasting their time, and may actually have a court case against major league management for keeping them, at AAA.   Unless Lopez is *me* defensively (I'm 5'7'', 165 and born to play second base :-)), he belongs in the major leagues.   Valentine isn't saying he should back up. He's saying he should be put in a position to *win* the job in the major leagues, which, IMHO, he would if given the opportunity. (Val, if I'm misinterpreting, please let me know.)    But the players who *are* ready are 1)the best and 2) the ones most likely to benefit from being in the majors. Javy Lopez is not a middle- of-the-road prospect. He's the real thing. NOW.   Again, the most important thing a player can do is hit. Lopez does that miles better than Olson or Berryhill. If his defense is good enough for Greenville, or Richmond, it's good enough for Atlanta. If he really was awful defensively, he would no longer be a catcher. See Sprague, Ed.   Oh, where to start... OK. First of all, solid != good. I want good players. Solid is one of those words used to describe nice white guys who really aren't very good at baseball. Think of it as \\\"TWG\\\" without the caps. It's a losing strategy to say, \\\"We have solid guys, we don't need to improve.\\\" You used it four times in that paragraph, BTW.  Same for experienced. I might add, though, that Greg Olson and Damon Berryhill aren't exactly Carter and Fisk. Olson has played three years, Berryhill five, although 90 and 91 were a wash. The only difference, IMHO, between Olson and Valle is the supporting cast.  \\\"Two big bats.\\\" Hrm. I like Justice, but I find Mr. Gant's trend disturbing. Call it one and a maybe. The Braves' platoon is OK, but neither player has *any* value outside of the platoon. Bream vs. LH and Hunter vs. RH are awful. I'll leave the thirdbase comment alone. Pendleton has wasted too much bandwidth already. If the CF platoon hits .300, I'll retrace Mr. Likhani's midnight run down Forbes, and I live in NY and LA. (Got that, Mike?)  And doesn't Cox call pitches, anyway?   Nope. They're baseball management, possible the most short-sighted  collection of people in the nation. Do you not believe this goes on, Mark? Do you think Frank Thomas needed those three months in AAA in 1990? Or Cal Eldred wasn't *really* better than Ricky Bones last year?

(They say)  (Does this have anything to do with the rally on the Capital steps yesterday  in support of the RKBA????)  Even the rally made the 5 pm news on 3 channels :-) \",\" That depends entirely upon the advertiser whose number you circled. Radio Electronics compiles all of the cards, then each advertiser gets a computer printout of the names and addresses of all of the readers who circled their number. Some magazines also provide the data on self-adhesive labels, and the really big magazines provide the data on computer disk.  The advertiser decides what to do with the data they get. You will notice that the Radio Electronics information card (commonly called a \\\"bingo card\\\" in the industry) includes lines for a company name and a business phone number. My guess would be that the big, national advertisers make a distinction between hobbiests and professionals as best they can. For example, if you include Motorola as your company and include a business phone (and a mail stop), Tektronics will probably send you a copy of their hard-bound catalog and have a sales engineer call you about a week later. If you leave it blank, odds are they will send you a slick brochure and direct you to a local retail outlet. Medium and small companies are more likely to send you th e whole catalog. And then some companies, like Digikey or Jameco, have nothing to mail out accept the catalog.  A couple of other interesting points about bingo cards: Free, industry magazines like EDN and such also log your card to their computer. They use the information at least three ways. They note that you really do read the magazine and are more likely to continue your subscription or push you, through repeated mailings, to re-subscribe. They also compile how many people requested which data for their marketing demographics. This way thay can tell a prospective advertiser that \\\"23% of readers requesting data were interested in capacitors.\\\" And finally, some magazines rent lists of readers who request certain information. For example, Tektronics can rent a list of everyone who requested information about test equipment OTHER THAN TEKTRONIC's, in the past 6 months.  The other point, in the data the advertiser receives, many magazines include how many items you circled on the card. If they want, the advertiser can attempt to cull out the \\\"literature collectors\\\" from the serious potential customers.  \\\"Can you say qualified sales leads? I thought you could.\\\"  What's the BEST way for a hobbiest to deal with bingo cards?    Never circle more than 8 number on the card. If you want more   than 8 items, use the second card and mail it a couple of   weeks later.    If you are really, really serious and you really, really want   the information, CALL THE ADVERTISER AND ASK! This will also   cut about 15 days off the the response time. Virtually   everyone takes a voice on the phone more seriously than data   on a computer printout.    To help insure you keep getting a trade magazine that you're   not really \\\"qualified\\\" for, send in a bingo card at least every   other month and circle two or three numbers.    Include a business name and phone number, even if it's your house.   Advertisers almost never call. \",\"   # I hope I gave you a fairly solid answer to this one: I simply don't agree # with the embodied version of a Satan who is a separate creation or a force.    # And there are quite physical descriptions of Heaven and Hell in the # Holy Qur'an, the Bible, etc.  There have been times in the spiritual # and intellectual evolution of the modern human when these physical # descriptions of Heaven, Hell, and Satan were taken quite literally # and that *worked* for the time.  As I mentioned in the Tradition # cited above, for example, it was sufficient in the absence of a theory # about germs and disease spread by worms to simply describe the \\\"evil\\\" # which was passed to a consumer of spoiled food as \\\"satanic.\\\"       Which begs the question: if Satan in this case is      metaphorical, how can you be certain Allah is not      the same way?  # The bottom line here, however, is that describing a spiritual plane # in human language is something like describing \\\"color\\\" to a person # who has been blind from birth.  You may want to read the book # FLATLAND (if you haven't already) or THE DRAGON'S EGG.  The first # is intended as a light hearted description of a mathematical con- # cept...  [some deleted for space saving]  # When language fails because it cannot be used to adequately describe # another dimension which cannot be experienced by the speakers, then # such conventions as metaphor, allegory, and the like come to be # necessary.  The \\\"unseen\\\" is described in terms which have reference` # and meaning for the reader/listener.  But, like all models, a compro- # mise must be made when speaking metaphorically: clarity and directness # of meaning, equivalence of perception, and the like are all # crippled.  But what else can you do?       This is why I asked the above.  How would you then      know God exists as a spirit or being rather than      just being metaphorical?  I mean, it's okay to say      \\\"well, Satan is just metaphorical,\\\" but then you      have to justify this belief AND justify that God is      not some metaphor for something else.       I say this because there are many, many instances of      Satan described as a being (such as the tormentor in       the Old Testament book of Job, or the temptor in the      New Testament Gospels).  In the same way, God too is      described as a being (or spirit.)  How am I to know      one is metaphorical and not the other.       Further, belief in God isn't a bar to evil.  Let's      consider the case of Satanists: even if Satan were      metaphorical, the Satanist would have to believe      in God to justify this belief.  Again, we have a       case where someone does believe in God, but by      religious standards, they are \\\"evil.\\\"  If Bobby      does see this, let him address this question also.

All advice was taken to heart, if not directly used.  My friend found out about the matter quite accidently.  After reading some of my mail, I quit from the mail reader & went about my business.  I must have trashed my mail improperly, because he got on the same terminal the next day & saw my old messages.  He thought they were responses to a post he placed in alt.atheism earlier that week, so he read some of them before realizing that they were for me.  I got a message from him the next day; he apologized for reading my mail & said that he did not want to appear to be a snoop.  He said that he would be willing to talk to me about his views & didn't mind doing so, especially with a friend.  So we did.  I neither changed his mind nor did he change mine, as that was not the point.  Now he knows where I'm coming from & now I know where he's coming from.  And all that I can do is pray for him, as I've always done.  I believe the reason that he & I \\\"click\\\" instead of \\\"bash\\\" heads is because I see Christianity as a tool for revolution, & not a tool for maintaining the status quo.  To be quite blunt, I have more of a reason to reject God than he does just by the fact that I am an African-American female.  Christianity & religion have been used as tools to separate my people from the true knowledge of our history & the wealth of our contributions to the world society.  The \\\"kitchen of heaven\\\" was all we had to look forward to during the slave days, & this mentality & second-class status still exists today.  I, too, have rejected an aspect of Christianity----that of the estabished church.  Too much hypocricy exists behind the walls of \\\"God's house\\\" beginning with the images of a white Jesus to that of the members:  praise God on Sunday & raise hell beginning Monday.

Thus no need to go to court.  A friend of mine did this and he got the money so it does work. \",\"I heard that Eli is selling the team to a group in Cinninati. This would help so that the O's could make some real free agent signings in the  offseason. Training Camp reports that everything is pretty positive right now. The backup catcher postion will be a showdown between Tackett and Parent although I would prefer Parent. #1 Draft Pick Jeff Hammonds may be coming up faster in the O's hierarchy of the minors faster than expected. Mike Flanagan is trying for another comeback. Big Ben is being defended by coaches saying that while the homers given up were an awful lot, most came in the beginning of the season and he really improved the second half. This may be Ben's year.   I feel that while this may not be Mussina's Cy Young year, he will be able to pitch the entire season without periods of fatigue like last year around August. I really hope Baines can provide the RF support the O's need. Orsulak was decent but I had hoped that Chito Martinez could learn defense better and play like he did in '91. The O's right now don't have many left-handed hitters. Anderson proving last year was no fluke and Cal's return to his averages would be big plusses in a drive for the pennant. The  rotation should be Sutcliffe, Mussina, McDonald, Rhodes, ?????. Olson is an interesting case. Will he strike out the side or load the bases and then get three pop outs? You never know. The way I see the AL East this year (with personal biases mixed in) Baltimore New York Toronto Milwaukee Cleveland Boston Detroit (The top 4 are the only true contenders in my mind. One of these 4 will definitely win the division unless it snows in Hell/Maryland :). I feel that this Baltimore's season to finally put everything together.) __________________________________________________________________________ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   \",\"  I agree that a fully-loaded SL2 would come close in price to a LOWER-END Ford Taurus.  A FULLY-LOADED Taurus, on the other hand, would still be substantially more expensive than even the most glitzy SL2.  A fully loaded SL2 would run somewhere around $17,000, while a fully loaded Taurus LX would be somewhere around the $22,000-$23,000 range.  A base Taurus (GL I believe) might start around $15,000.  Of course there is the Taurus SHO which can push $30,000 if you really try, but this is a totally different car than your mainstream Taurus sedan.  Your statement was not entirely faulty, just a little inaccurate.   Well, that's ok.  At least you're not bitching about dealer profits like some of the other netters are.  You seem to have rationally picked out the car that is best for you.

I'm hoping someone knows what this board is, or, even better, what the various switches and jumbers are used for.  Anyway, here's  description of the card:  It is a 16-bit card, although I noticed that none of the contacts in the 16-bit extension are connected to anything.  It has 4 NS16550AN chips in sockets, and 4 corresponding connecters labeled COM1 - COM4.  There is also an external female connector with 37 pins.  There are 8 banks of 8 switches, 2 banks of 4 switches, and 7 jumpers.  I believe that I have determined, by following traces, that SW5 and SW6 (12 switches in all) control the interrupt level for each of the COM ports.  SW5[1-4] are for IRQ3, SW5[5-8] are for IRQ4, and SW6[1-4] are for IRQ5.  The other switches are beyond my meager ability to follow.        The only identification printed on the board is \\\"MULTI SERIAL PORT BOARD\\\" across the bottom.  There is a box for serial number, but it is blank. Immediately below the words \\\"SERIAL NO\\\", but not in the box left for the S/N, are the numbers \\\"1990 2 8\\\".  Anyone have any clues?  Your help is greatly appreciated. \",\"Device........

He will have mercy on whom he will have mercy and compassion on whom he will have compassion (Ex 33:19).  However, if he enjoyed punishing people and sending them to hell, then why would he send Jesus to \\\"seek and save that which was lost\\\" (Luke 19:10)?  You asked for it.  2 Peter 2:4-ff talks about how those who are ungodly are punished. Matthew 25:31-46 is also very clear that those who do not righteous in God's eyes will be sent to hell for eternity. 2 Thessalonians 1:6-10 states that those who cause trouble for the disciples \\\"will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord\\\". 2 Thessalonians 2:9-12 talks about those who refuse to love the truth being condemned. Revelation 21:6-8 talks about the difference between those who overcomes and those who do not.  Those who do not, listed in verse 8, will be in the \\\"fiery lake of burning sulfur\\\". Revelation 14:9-12 gives the indication that those who follow the beast \\\"will be tormented with burning sulfur\\\" and there being \\\"no rest day or night\\\" for them because of it. Psalm 9:17:  \\\"The wicked return to the grave, all the nations that forget God.\\\"  I think those should be sufficient to prove the point.   Joe Fisher  [In the following I'm mostly playing \\\"devil's advocate\\\".  I'm not advocating either position.  My concern is that people understand that it's possible to see these passages in different ways.  It's possible to see eternal destruction as just that -- destruction.  Rev often uses the term \\\"second death\\\".  The most obvious understanding of that would seem to be final extinction.  The problem is that the NT speaks both of eternal punishment and of second death.  I.e. it uses terms that can be understood either way.  My concern here is not to convince you of one view or the other, but to help people understand that there's a wide enough variety of images that it's possible to understand them either way.  As Tom Albrecht commented, the primary point is to do our best to keep people out of the eternal fire, whatever the details.  (To make things more interesting, Luke 20:35 implies that the damned don't get resurrected at all.  Presumably they just stay dead. -- yes I'm aware that it's possible to  understand this passage in a non-literal way.)  2 Peter 2:4-ff is talking about angels, and talks about holding them in hell until the final judgement.  This isn't eternal punishement.  Matthew 25:31-46 talks about sending the cursed into eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.  The fact that the fire is eternal doesn't mean that people will last in its flames forever. Particularly interesting is the comment about the fire having been prepared for the devil and his angels.  Rev 20 and 21 talk about the eternal fire as well.  They say that the beast and the false prophet will be tormented forever in it.  When talking about people being thrown into it (20:13-14), it is referred to as \\\"the second death\\\". This sounds more like extinction than eternal torment.  Is is possible that the fire has different effects on supernatural entities such as the devil, and humans?  2 Thessalonians 1:6-10 similarly, what is \\\"everlasting destruction\\\"? This is not necessarily eternal torment.  This one can clearly be understood either way, but I think it's at least possible to think that everlasting is being used to contrast the kind of destruction that can occur in this life with the final destruction that occurs in eternity.  2 Thessalonians 2:8 again talks about destruction. Revelation 21:6-8: see comment above Revelation 14:9-12 is probably the best of the quotes.  Even there, it doesn't explicitly say that the people suffer forever.  It says that the smoke (and presumably the fire) is eternal, and that  there is no respite from it.  But it doesn't say that the people are tormented forever.  Psalm 9:17:  I don't see that it says anything relevant to this issue.\",\"Inguiry by address:er1@eridan.chuvashia.su \",\"  This is one of the differences between OT prophecy and NT prophecy.  In the NT, it is expected that when believers gather,   - people will prophesy   - the prophecy must be judged (1 Cor 14:29) There is nothing about killing someone who makes a mistake.   Scripture is scripture; there is no \\\"gift of scripture\\\".  And I don't know about you, but I know that _I_ have made mistakes while filled with the spirit.  If you don't give grace to allow people to make mistakes, they will never grow in the use of the spiritual gifts!  When we minister in my small group, I encourage people to speak out any impressions or images they think might be from the Lord.  Only by trying will they know whether they were right or wrong -- and in either case, they'll have a better handle on it the next time.  Didn't you fall when you were learning to ride a bicycle?  But you kept on trying, and you learned both from your failures and your successes. Spiritual gifts are no different -- you get better with experience.   The canon of Scripture is complete.  Does this mean that God no longer speaks?  I have heard his voice -- not audibly (though some have), but clearly nonetheless.  Is what I heard equivalent to Scripture?  No.  I have never heard contemporary prophets claim that what they receive from the Lord is on the same level as Scripture; on the contrary, those who are mature obey the Scriptures by submitting their prophecies to fellow believers for judgement.  And the most reliable yardstick for judging prophecies is, certainly, the Scriptures themselves.  The canon is closed -- but God is not silent!   Does it matter what it is called?  The question is not how to label it, but how to receive it.  Words of knowledge, incidentally, are similar to prophecy (and sometimes the two overlap), but generally it is supernatural knowledge of some fact that could not be known otherwise.\",\"        The joystick reads in anolog values through a digital port.

Teel:   Well, the two nifty letters giving concrete proof that the  Income Tax is voluntary and giving specific procedures for  stopping withholding, et cetera have been out there for a  while now.  Humbug.  Those letters don't provide \\\"concrete proof\\\" of anything at all in the absence of any case law that demonstrates the method will actu- ally work for ordinary people in everyday situations.  Specifically, show us some case law in which the courts have ruled that income tax is illegal and/or that ordinary working types do not have to pay income tax (and that they can legally avoid paying income tax with- out declaring themselves to be churches or some such silliness).  This issue is sufficiently important that I think we have a right to expect something squarely on point from the US Supreme Court (in the case of federal tax) or a state's supreme court (for a state's income tax).  Unless you can do that, I for one am unwilling to call your material \\\"concrete proof\\\".   There has been no refutation to date.  Have the nay-sayers  finally given up as defeated?  Sure would like to hear their  reasons for disbelief at this point.  Refutation??  Refutation of what?  You haven't made a case yet.  You've posted plenty of claims, but you haven't given us any valid reason to believe that any court in the US will agree with you.  Your claims seem on the surface to deviate so radically from the legal mainstream that I feel the burden of proof is still on =you= to show that your arguments have any merit whatsoever.  And the cases you've cited involve such strange situations that I see no reason to assume that the rulings are applicable to anyone else, or that they will ultimately stand on appeal to the Supreme Court.  Why can't you just cite us a case in which Joe Schmoe, a regular employee earning regular wages from a regular company, refuses to pay his income tax, gets hauled into court, is convicted of wilful tax eva- sion, and then has his conviction overturned by the US Supreme Court with a landmark 7-2 majority ruling that income tax is indeed totally voluntary?  What, you say?  No such case exists?  Hmmm, I wonder why not; why haven't you?   Shall I conclude that the point has been received and the  opposition has forfeited the field?  With all due respect, you can conclude anything you want.  I just hope, for your own sake, that you don't conclude that anyone in a position of authority in the United States or any legitimate or illegitimate polit- ical subdivision thereof is going to agree with your conclusions.  For that matter, I confess I'm thoroughly confused as to =why= you would be looking for court rulings in your favor anyway -- since I thought you told us earlier that every court in the US has been in cahoots with big banking interests since the 1938 \\\"admiralty jurisdiction\\\" coverup thing. Do you honestly expect us to believe that they'd go to all the trouble to subvert the system, and yet would still promptly slink back into their burrows in the face of anyone who knew enough to invoke the right combination of magic spells and mystic mumbo-jumbo?  Not only that, but why do you even =care= what the US courts say anyway? Didn't you tell us a while back that you've disavowed all attempts by US officials to classify you as a \\\"14th Amendment federal citizen\\\"?  When the FBI comes to haul you away for tax evasion, why don't you just tell them they're out of their jurisdiction and should go back to Washington, D.C., where they belong?  Or maybe we should all just go back to mediaeval common law, which you suggested would be better than all these statutes, codes, and the like. If you want to renounce society's legal framework, fine; we can just declare you an outlaw, OK?, and anyone who sees you driving on the roads with no license plate on your car and no driver's license in your wallet can just take you like a game animal and stew you for their supper (with plenty of veggies and a pinch of salt, but WITHOUT PREJUDICE UCC 1-207).  Sorry, everyone, it's getting late, and I'm sick and tired of all this garbage.  If I know what's good for me, I'll just clam up and stop try- ing to refute this nonsense, and if anyone falls for it and winds up in jail for tax evasion or what-not, it'll be on their own head.  Needless to say, none of the above represents the opinions of my current employer -- who, in any case, is a Canadian and doesn't really need to care too much about US tax law.

Our constitution was built by men who had to risk their lives to ensure freedom in our country. They designed the system to make it difficult for tyranny to arise. For instance, one of the reasons the fourth amendment was put there was to make it harder for the government to try to make smuggling a crime. Think I jest? John Hancock made all his money smuggling rum, which is, after all, a drug.  Think about it.

Coups have happened in countries that have had stable democracies for over a hundred years. Governments throughout history have fallen. No government has lasted for more than a few hundred years. Often, they are replaced by dictatorships. Do you really believe so intensely that it could never ever ever happen here that you are willing to bet your own life and the lives of your children and other loved ones on it?  If we construct the tools with which tyranny could be enforced, we make it orders of magnitude more likely that it could happen, because if it happened with the tools already in place it could actually stick.   Naive fools such as our leadership believe they can protect us where hundreds that have gone before have failed. Thriving democracies led by men far more skillfull than Bill Clinton have fallen to dictatorship. Rome had a thriving republic run by exquisitely skilled men before they became a tyranny.  I, for one, am unwilling to trust that it could never happen here. Only hubris would allow us to believe we are immune to what has happened elsewhere.  -- Perry Metzger  pmetzger@shearson.com\",\" What can you expect from a buffoon who said that the Pens should have drafted Kirk Muller instead of Mario Lemieux?

THOSE INTREPID ISRAELI SOLDIERS       Israeli soldiers have sexually taunted Arab women in the occupied Gaza Strip   during the three-week-long closure that has sealed Palestinians off from the   Jewish state, Palestinian sources said on Sunday.    The incidents occurred in the town of Khan Younis and involved soldiers of  the Golani Brigade who have been at the centre of house-to-house raids for  Palestinian activists during the closure, which was imposed on the strip and  occupied West Bank.    Five days ago girls at the Al-Khansaa secondary said a group of naked  soldiers taunted them, yelling: ``Come and kiss me.'' When the girls fled,   the soldiers threw empty bottles at them.        On Saturday, a group of soldiers opened their shirts and pulled down their  pants when they saw girls from Al-Khansaa walking home from school. Parents   are considering keeping their daughters home from the all-girls school.        The same day, soldiers harassed two passing schoolgirls after a youth  escaped from them at a boys' secondary school. Deputy Principal Srur   Abu-Jamea said they shouted abusive language at the girls, backed them   against a wall, and put their arms around them.    When teacher Hamdan Abu-Hajras intervened the soldiers kicked him and beat  him with the butts of their rifles.    On Tuesday, troops stopped a car driven by Abdel Azzim Qdieh, a practising  Moslem, and demanded he kiss his female passenger. Qdieh refused, the   soldiers hit him and the 18-year-old passenger kissed him to stop the   beating.    On Friday, soldiers entered the home of Zamno Abu-Ealyan, 60, blindfolded  him and his wife, put a music tape on a recorder and demanded they dance. As  the elderly couple danced, the soldiers slipped away. The coupled continued  dancing until their grandson came in and asked what was happening.        The army said it was checking the reports.                   ....................           ISRAELI TROOPS BAR CHRISTIANS FROM JERUSALEM    Israeli troops prevented Christian Arabs from entering Jerusalem on Thursday   to celebrate the traditional mass of the Last Supper.        Two Arab priests from the Greek Orthodox church led some 30 worshippers in  prayer at a checkpoint separating the occupied West Bank from Jerusalem after  soldiers told them only people with army-issued permits could enter.        ``Right now, our brothers are celebrating mass in the Church of the Holy  Sepulchre and we were hoping to be able to join them in prayer,'' said Father  George Makhlouf of the Ramallah Parish.        Israel sealed off the occupied lands two weeks ago after a spate of  Palestinian attacks against Jews. The closure cut off Arabs in the West Bank  and Gaza Strip from Jerusalem, their economic, spiritual and cultural centre.       Father Nicola Akel said Christians did not want to suffer the humiliation  of requesting permits to reach holy sites.        Makhlouf said the closure was discriminatory, allowing Jews free movement  to take part in recent Passover celebrations while restricting Christian  celebrations.        ``Yesterday, we saw the Jews celebrate Passover without any interruption.  But we cannot reach our holiest sites,'' he said.        An Israeli officer interrupted Makhlouf's speech, demanding to see his  identity card before ordering the crowd to leave.                      ...................

It sounds like you might want to send an exposure using XSendEvent and specifying a region. If you know the region you need to send the exposure, generally you have the bounding rectangle of the objects, you can use XCreateRegion to create a region, XUnionRectWithRegion to add the new object polygons to the region, and then either use the region to clip your GC for the redraw or use XRectInRegion to test which of your other objects need to be redrawn.

TIMUCIN  \",\"  One interpretation I've heard of this verse is that it refers to the sin  of physically abusing one's wife.  The husband is usually physically  stronger than his wife but is not permitted to use this to dominate her.   He must honor her as his sister in Christ.  This would therefore be an  example of a specific sin that blocks prayer.  This verse also makes me think of the kind of husband who decides what  is God's will for his family without consulting his wife.  God reveals  His will to both the husband and the wife.  There needs to be some  degree of mutuality in decision making.  Even those whose understanding  of the Bible leads to a belief in an authoritarian headship of the  husband need to incorporate this in order to have a functional family.   One way to look at it is that God speaks to the wife through the husband  and to the husband through the wife. \",\"Anyone know of a phillies mailing list out there? .... they don't get much coverage up here in Grand Rapids, MI *sob*  --\",\"  It is MUCH easier, faster, and probably even more secure to use Norton Utilties 6.0 (I'm talking IBM PC here) and to tell WipeInfo to (a) clean the free disk space and (b) clean the slack space at the end of the files.

I am running Linux as my main OS, with a small DOS partition left for my flatmates' games.  My current setup is a 386SX-25 (AMD) with 387SX-25 (ITT - I think) and 9 Mbytes of 70ns SIMMS, and (120+100)Mbyte IDE.  Basically I have two choices  1) Get a 386DX-40 + 387DX-40  or 2) Get some sort of 486.  Unfortunately I live in the UK where computer prices are far too high. The first option works out at about \\\\pounds 200. 486 m/boards start at this price for a SX-25.  I have a couple of questions.  1) How much of an improvement in speed should I notice if I get a 386DX+copro. Remember I'm using a 32 bit OS, and alot of Floating Point operations.  2) How much faster would a 486DX-33 be than the 386DX-40+copro ?  Should I get an upgradeable m/board with a 386DX-40 and wait for AMD/Pentium price pressure to reduce the costs of the 486 ?   Any experiences will be most helpful ...    Kenny.  PS. Example prices:   386DX-40+copro M/board ~$270  486DX33 M/board  ~$580  ----------------------------------------------------------- Kenneth MacDonald  E-mail kenny@castle.ed.ac.uk Dept. of Geology & Geophysics University of Edinburgh  Scotland\",\"Does anyone have any information/advice on large color monitors (17\\\"-21\\\") to use with a 486 system running X server software?

It's small enough that I will attach it.  I have also measured some real programs with and without the 64 KB cache.  The speedup varies a lot from app to app, ranging from 0% to 40%.  I think an average of 20%-25% is about right.  The subjective difference is not great, but is sometimes noticable.  A simple cache card certainly does not transform a IIsi into something enormously better.  I do not have an FPU.  The conventional wisdom says that cache cards from all of the makers offer about the same speedup and that there is not much difference between 32K and 64K caches.  I bought mine from Third Wave for well under $150.  I have had absolutely no problems at all with it.  If you get *complete* speedometer runs for a 32K cache, I'd like to see them.

Whatthey do not tell you is that if you get mace directly   on the linings of the lungs (such as a direct snort to   the face) above certain quantities, it reacts similarly   to a mustard gas inhalation.     I know:  my father and grandfather were exposed    to poison gas in WWI and WWII; Dad went through    the side effects of any WEAPON, including those    \\\"non-toxic\\\" aerosols.    WHat the label ACTUALLY means is ::     usually, it wont kill you    it may give you permanent CSS asthsma    but that's better than blowing a hole in your     head ...    ALL aerosols are flammable IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH OXYGEN   AND HIT IT WITH THE RIGHT IGNITER.  SOme of the most   non-flammable substances known will BOOM or SEARFLAME   if you hit it with the right combo.     Let's take one:  a trash can fire.  Makes black smoke;   already burned right?  Can't go boom, right?  Wrong.    Suck that smoke (made up of paper that has carbonized,   or burned about 35% of the fuel in it) into an air   conditioning return, mix with about 5:1 air, and light   a match.  200 feet of conduit is about the same, when   filled with that smoke mixture, as oh, say 200 pounds TNT     THAT is why the fire codes say NO OPEN CEILING    TILES IN BUILDINGS.  Because 3-5 stories of    a building have blown OUT by \\\"nonflammable _smoke_\\\"   So:   Take a little \\\"nonflammable aerosol\\\"   Mix with gasoline or kerosene fumes     NO electricity, remeber?  A bit of heating    on the WACO plains?  Boil water to drink    since the water was cut off?    liberally mix and allow to settle for 1-4 hours    Fumes vent down into the bus underground, and the Davidians   move the children UPSTAIRS to a saferoom (they had one,   armor plated, remember?) to BREATH, because kids get sick   and die from tear gas.    and along comes a tracer, a spark, what have you:     everyone burns to death.

did I get sucked into this?   Assuming you're serious, I guess you'd be surprised to hear that us GUYS don't think so. I would guess that a tiny fraction of 1% of the folks reading your post agree with it. I kind of doubt that even you agree with it.  I'm not going to go through your points one at a time, because,  after all, not many of them have anything at all to do with baseball.  I'm only replying to this because you brought up Pam Postema, the AAA umpire who sued (is suing?) baseball on the grounds of sex discrimination because she wasn't promoted to the majors.   I've never seen her ump a game. I have no first hand experience with her ability as an umpire.  But I have seen her on talk shows. And her point seems to be that she can call balls and strikes as well as any of the umpires and she knows the rulebook better than most. It seems to me that she is missing the point and if that's how she sees the role of umpires in the game, well I wouldn't promote her either.  The umpires primary role has nothing to do with calling baserunners safe or out; hell, Joe Lundy could do that. Their primary function is to maintain order in the game, keep the game moving, and keep the players from trying to kill each other.   Umpires have to be extremely tough people. That disqualifies most of us, both men and women. And if Ms. Postema thinks that she deserves to be a major league umpire because of her command of the rulebook, then I think that disqualifies her as well. Umpires need to command the game; command of the rulebook is secondary.   \",\": >After agreeing to terms I signed the contract and drove home in my new : >car.

However, if you agree some terms, and then, when about to sign, the dealer slips you a contract with different terms, and leads you to believe that it embodies the terms you verbally agreed to, that is fraud.  There is no 3 day limit on restitution for fraud.  You may have to sue (and win) to get out of this.  You will almost certainly have to threaten to sue. -- \",\"  I was hoping for something like \\\"The chassis exhibits X  degrees of flex when subjected to forces of more than Y units. Forces of more than Y units begin to manifest at Z miles per hour.\\\"   Not \\\"Well, gee, it wasn't designed to go fast because, uhh, well, gee, it wasn't designed to go fast.  It's not a Porsche, you know\\\".    Well, as compared to the normal Taurus, the SHO comes with more supportive seats,better brakes,a stiffer suspension, different tires, and a body design that takes advantage of aero effects to keep the car on the ground (or at least I think that's what all that boy-racer plastic is for).  You're kidding yourself if you think any car on the road has a passenger compartment made to withstand 130 MPH impacts.      Oh, right.  Only 120,000 dollar cars should be driven fast. They drive goddamn Rabbits at 120 MPH in Europe, pal, and I reckon a Taurus is at least as capable as a Rabbit.    Of course not.  \\\"Speeding-is-bad.  Speeding-is-illegal.  I-will-not-speed.

Some other owners on the ford-probe@world.std.com mailing list have commented  about this problem, but I haven't seen it happen on my 3 month old  '93 Probe GT.  I think this may be something that Ford has corrected since  the initial batch of cars.  Also, someone said that Ford has issued a  service bulletin to inform dealers about how to correct this problem, so you  may be able to get your dealer to fix it.   Haven't seen any of these problems, nor have I seen these mentioned on the mailing list, so these might just be having bad luck with these.   Definitely!   No problems like these either.  I haven't been able to find any obvious  places where they screwed up.   Hmmm!  I got two keys with my car.  Something tells me you got stiffed by your dealer on this.  (Actually, if you count the \\\"credit card\\\" key that  came in the owner's binder, I got 3 keys, but since the credit card key doesn't have any teeth cut in it yet, I guess I won't count it. :-))   The latter is probably because of the air bag.  It's pretty much takes up all the space where you'd expect to find the horn.  Speaking of the horn, I was surprised to find that the Probe comes with one of those nice 'merican sounding horns instead of the Japanese sounding kind. The previous Probes had Japanese horns.   Yeah, not very badly, but enough to be annoying sometimes.   I agree strongly with all of the above, especially about the engine.  The interior is very, very nice too.  Very pleasing to the eye, and ergonomically sound.  ...  Yes, this car's stiff suspension isn't for everyone.  I personally like it, but if you find it a little harsh but otherwise like the car, I'd strongly suggest looking into the MX-6.   The problem with the back seat is that there's no leg room.  Plenty of  head room, though.  Shorter people fit back there without any complaints, so long as the seat they are sitting behind is pulled forward a bit to  give them a place to put their feet.   The power moonroof can greatly improve the ventilation throughout the car. :-) I really enjoy the moonroof, by the way, but then I've always been a sucker for open air driving.  No leakage problems or anything like that...yet!   I haven't heard about this one.  I know that some of the very early Probes ('89 and maybe '90) had problems with prematurely rusting mufflers (which Ford will replace at no charge), but I haven't heard about anything like this concerning the '93 Probes.  I haven't had any real trouble with this car outside of a CV joint boot that was leaking, but the dealer took care of that promptly, and even gave me a free rental car for the day and a half that I was without my car.

A definition of any type of 'phobe comes from : phobia = an irrational fear of.  Hence a homophobe (not only in ACT UP meetings, : the word is apparently in general use now.

Obviously you keep to the : Monty Python song:  \\\"Every sperm is sacred\\\".  And if, as *you* say, it has : a purpose as a means to limit population growth then it is, by your own  : arguement, natural.  Consider the context, I'm talking about an evolutionary function. One of the most basic requirements of evolution is that members of a species procreate, those who don't have no purpose in that context.  :  : |> Another point is that if the offspring of each generation is to : |> survive, the participation of both parents is necessary - a family must : |> exist, since homosexuals do not reproduce, they cannot constitute a : |> family.

Also the parent from single : parent families should put the babies out in the cold now, cos they must, : by your arguement, die.  By your argument, homosexuality is genetically determined. As to your second point, you prove again that you have no idea what context means. I am talking about evolution, the preservation of the species, the fundamental premise of the whole process. :  : |> But it gets worse. Since the overwhelming majority of people actually : |> -prefer- a heterosexual relationship, homosexuality is a social : |> abberation as well. The homosexual eschews the biological imperative : |> to reproduce and then the social imperative to form and participate in : |> the most fundamental social element, the family.

These days sex is less to do with procreation (admittedly : without it there would be no-one) but more to do with pleasure.  In pre-pill : and pre-condom days, if you had sex there was the chance of producing children. : These days is just ain't true!  People can decide whether or not to have  : children and when.  Soon they will be able to choose it's sex &c (but that's  : another arguement...) so it's more of a \\\"lifestyle\\\" decision.  Again by : your arguement, since homosexuals can not (or choose not) to reproduce they must : be akin to people who decide to have sex but not children.  Both are  : as \\\"unnatural\\\" as each other.  Yet another non-sequitur. Sex is an evolutionary function that exists for procreation, that it is also recreation is incidental. That homosexuals don't procreate means that sex is -only- recreation and nothing more; they serve no -evolutionary- purpose.  :  : |> Since homosexuals have come out the closet and have convinced some : |> policy makers that they have civil rights, they are now claiming that : |> their sexuality is a preference, a life-style, an orientation, a : |> choice that should be protected by law.

Here's pretty obvious dodge, do you really think you've said anything or do you just feel obligated to respond to every statement? I am not telling anyone anything, I am demonstrating that there are arguments against the practice of homosexuality (providing it's a merely an alternate lifestlye) that are not homophobic, that one can reasonably call it perverse in a context even a atheist can understand. I realize of course that this comes dangerously close to establishing  a value, and that atheists are compelled to object on that basis, but if you are to be consistent, you have no case in this regard. :  : |> To characterize any opposition to homosexuality as homophobic is to : |> ignore some very compelling arguments against the legitimization of : |> the homosexual \\\"life-style\\\".

Neil Smith                     LETTER TO A LIBERAL COLLEAGUE  [AUTHOR'S NOTE:  \\\"Adrian\\\" -- name changed to protect the guilty --  and the author are science fiction novelists who once worked with  the same editor at a famous New York publishing house.]  Dear Adrian:    I'm way behind schedule on my current book again, so this reply to  your note -- criticizing the recent magazine interview I gave and  generally attacking gun ownership -- will necessarily consist  mostly of assertions you're free to believe (or not) I can back  with evidence and logic I've neither time nor energy to present  now.  I've written fully on this topic before and will again in the  future.  When I do, I'll make sure you get copies.    There are many arguments I might make, from the futility and danger  of delegating self-defense to the police (see Don Kates in the Jan.  10, 1985 WALL STREET JOURNAL) to the real effect of prohibition,  shifting consumers from newly-outlawed handguns or semiautomatic  rifles to items like sawed-off shotguns or homemade bombs, but I'll  limit myself here to commenting on the newspaper clipping you sent  with your note.    First, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Second, publication of some latter-day \\\"scientific study\\\" doesn't  alter the fact that the gun prohibitionists I discussed in my  interview -- annoying you so much in the process -- were lying.    Third, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Fourth, as often happens with these things, the \\\"study\\\" doesn't  support the gun prohibitionists' original numerical contentions  anyway, but simply adds a new layer of spurious claims to an older  body of lies, omissions, and distortions.    Fifth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Sixth, the fact that gun prohibitionists have been caught lying on  countless occasions (Carl Bakal, author of NO RIGHT TO KEEP AND  BEAR ARMS, even confessed to it publicly) makes the value of this  present \\\"study\\\" dubious, to say the least.    Seventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is  a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil,  and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic  process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Eighth, given your own lifelong service as a federal bureaucrat  (not to mention the cynical sophistication of your fiction), you  should be better aware than most people how \\\"progress\\\" -- in  designing \\\"studies\\\" to prove whatever you want -- outstrips our  ability to collect meaningful data.  A case in point we might agree  on is the fact that it took another kind of prohibitionist 20 or 30  years to create \\\"studies\\\" \\\"proving\\\" that pornography causes crime.   More naive (and probably more honest) efforts in the 50s and 60s  clearly indicate the contrary.    Ninth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Tenth, another reason to doubt all such \\\"studies\\\" is that human  behavior (as the Austrian School of economics demonstrates) is far too complex and unpredictable to be meaningfully quantified.  The  attempt to do so -- and then create public policy based on the  resulting pseudo-information -- is wrecking our civilization.    Eleventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is  a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil,  and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic  process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Twelfth, the \\\"study\\\" is also worthless because it incorporates  figures for suicide, which is not necessarily a tragedy but  basically another individual right, sometimes with ancillary social  benefits.  If anything, perhaps suicide INTERVENTION should be a  criminal offense.    Thirteenth and finally, the National Rifle Association officials  quoted in the article, whatever their shortcomings (and they are  many), are correct in this instance:  the \\\"study\\\" is meaningless  because the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    And because of that, Adrian, even if the \\\"study\\\" were valid, it  wouldn't deter me from a lifelong personal objective of seeing that  anyone can own any weapon he or she prefers and carry it however,  whenever, and wherever he or she desires without asking anybody's  permission. In this I'm ably assisted by gun prohibitionists  themselves, whose yawping invariably moves previously unarmed  people to go out and buy their first gun \\\"while they still can\\\".   Before the '68 Gun Control Act, most of the \\\"shooting fraternity\\\"  viewed handguns (incorrectly, as it turned out) as inaccurate,  ineffective toys.  There probably weren't six million of them in  the whole country.  Now, thanks to Kennedy, Metzenbaum, the Bradys,  and their ilk -- AMERICA'S GREATEST SPORTING GOODS SALES TEAM -- we  probably manufacture at least that many every year.  The fascinating datum is that Handgun Control, et al. are perfectly  aware of this -- so I guess you'll have to ask them yourself what  their real motives are.    Look:  gun-making isn't an arcane or difficult art (and by the way,  it's easier to make a fully automatic weapon than a semiautomatic;  the fact that I can still obtain my own weapon of preference, the  self-loading pistol, is the only thing which keeps me from pursuing  this further).  Even if it were difficult, there are already a  quarter billion firearms in America, with an estimated \\\"half life\\\"  of 1000 years -- possibly more for stainless steel.  Guns are gonna  be around a long time, Adrian, whether you like it or not.  As for me, to paraphrase Elmer Keith, regardless of what the law  provides or any court decides, I'm always going to be armed.  And I  will always work to see that others are, as well.  The bad news is  that there are thousands more -- perhaps even hundreds of thousands  -- where I come from.  We can't be stopped by passing laws, we can  only be forced to arm ourselves and others secretly and -- given  both the practical and alleged differences between full automatics  and semiautomatics -- perhaps more efficiently.    So what's the point?    L.

Neither twm or mwm seem to create standard colormaps.  Of course, one can use xstdcmap to create standard colormaps.   However, xstdcmap doesn't seem to try very hard to avoid  conflicts with the default colormap.  When I use standard  colormaps created by xstdcmap, the rest of my display goes black.   So it seems as if use of standard colormaps causes the very  problem standard colormaps are intended to avoid.  Perhaps  if every application used standard colormaps, things would  be wonderful.  But not many applications seem to use  standard colormaps.  Finally, the operation of the functions XmuGetColormapAllocation,  XmuStandardColormap, and XmuCreateColormap seem inconsistent  with the section 14.3 of the X11R5 XLIB documentation.      According to the section 14.3 of the X11R5 XLIB documentation (p. 436):      For GrayScale colormaps, only the colormap, red_max, red_mult, and      base_pixel members are defined.  The other members are ignored.       To compute a GrayScale pixel value, use the following expression:              (gray * red_mult + base_pixel) &0xFFFFFFFF      XmuGetColormapAllocation, defined in mit/lib/Xmu/CmapAlloc.c, is      used by XmuLookupStandardColormap, defined in mit/lib/Xmu/LookupCmap.c     to select red_max, green_max, and blue_max values for the      call to XmuStandardColormap.  When the RGB_GRAY_MAP property is      specified, XmuGetColormapAllocation sets red_max to 30% of the      total number of cells in the gray scale, sets green_max to 59%      of the total number, and sets blue_max ot 11% of the total number.     Referring to section 14.3, one would expect XmuGetColormapAllocation      to set red_max to the total number of cells in the gray scale.      When the RGB_GRAY_MAP property is specified, XmuStandardColormap,      defined in mit/lib/Xmu/StdCmap.c, sets red_mult, green_mult,      and blue_mult all equal to 1.  Referring to section 14.3,      one would expect green_mult and blue_mult to be ignored.\",\": What happened in Waco is not the fault of the BATF.

The signal is only to be sent over a few hundred  meters. It seems to me that the frequency intended for this use is about 150MHz and about 440MHz. To make the transmitters as light as possible I suppose it will be best  the to send the signals in an analog form. As this application is rather  specialized I do not expect to be able to buy the exact transmitter- units i need. On the other hand I imagine that I can buy the receiver somewhere.

DO ANYBODY KNOW IF THERE IS EXISTING SUCH RECEIVER  SYSTEM ON THE MARKET?\",\"  I hate to follow up to my own posting, but I should perhaps clarify some things so I won't get flamed.  First of all, when I'm talking about ``factoring the modulus'' or a ``breakthrough in factoring'', what I really mean is a breakthrough in the cryptanalysis of RSA.  I know that factoring and breaking RSA are not proven to be equivalent; it's just so damn convenient not to repeat this every time.  I also have to admit that I don't really know if the ``non-group'' property of a cipher is essential only for key chaining.  I have thought about it a little while, but I can't find a way that a cryptanalyst could exploit a group structure.  That, of course, means nothing at all.  Then I wrote,   What I meant was that as long as the only advantage of the cryptanalyst is a faster computer, then we will probably have RSA for a long time to come, because even if 1024-bit moduli somehow could be broken with fast computers (not with a new algorithm), then people would simply use longer moduli.  Both users and cryptanalysts benefit from better technology in the same way.  Hope this keeps the flames away...

The team which was later to prosecute him on criminal charges had to sequester itself from all reports of ON's immunized testimony. ON's lawyer brought up the probability that at least someone on the team had heard about the Senate testimony, and it was a strong factor against the prosecution, which is one of the reasons this ON is still walking around free today.\",\" Yes, you could.

EDT              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As you know, the President is soon  to be on his way, on Amtrack to Camden Yards.  He'll be throwing out  the first pitch.              Q   It's MARC, the Maryland Area Transit, it's not  Amtrack.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, it's not Amtrack?  Well, he's  going from Union Station, you're right.  Excuse me.              Q   George, what exactly are you prepared to do to  break the logjam with  ??? Senate?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, there are  discussions between Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole this morning,  and I think that the President is going to continue to make the point  that he believes that our investment package, our jobs package needs  to be passed as quickly as possible.  We need this investment for  summer jobs, for immunization, for highway construction, for the  important programs that will put people back to work right away this  summer.  And the President continues to believe his program should be  passed.              Q   Will he compromise, that's the question?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, the discussions  are going on this morning in the Senate betwen Senator Mitchell and  Senator Dole, let's see what they come up with.  But the President  believes his jobs program should go forward.              Q   George, would the President be willing to accept $8  billion for one year, which apparently appears to be the compromise  being offered by --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I don't know what is being  offered by either side.  The Senate discussions are going on right  now, let's see what happens today.              Q   Would he go that far -- no matter what the  Republicans have offered so far, would he go that far, $8 billion per  year?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that his  program should be passed at this time.  Clearly, we're going to be  willing to listen to what the Senators might or might not be able to  come up with, but I'm not going to get into figures right now.  Let's  see what happens.              Q   It's reasonable to assume, isn't it, from what has  happened so far that a compromise is going to be necessary in order  to get a vote?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the Republicans seem more  intrested in stopping progress on the President's jobs bill, than in  doing something to create --  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the  Republicans seem more interested in stopping progress on the  President's jobs bill than in doing something to create real action,  real jobs this summer for the American people.  I think there's no  question about that.  There's been some frustration of legislative  activity over the last few days.              Q   So, you'll need to compromise to get your package  through?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We'll see what happens with the  conversations between Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole this morning.              Q      prepared to compromise --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President's prepared to listen  to what Senator Mitchell has to say this morning after his meeting  with Senator Dole.               Q   Does he feel that he has been defeated in his --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not in the least.  In fact, he's  been very successful so far in the beginning of his term.              Q   How?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He passed his budget in record  time, in six weeks, and it's a budget which reduces the deficit by  $500 billion over five years.  And it's a budget which provides for  important investments in our future.  Right now we've also had strong  passage of his jobs program through the House.  Simply because a  minority of Republicans in the Senate choose to perpetuate gridlock  and hold up action on the President's jobs program is not a sign that  he is not succeeding overall.              Q   He can't beat this, can he?              Q   The fact is they can do that?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the Republicans can stop  action.  There's no question about that.              Q   What are you going to do about it?              Q   George, what do you know about these alleged notes  taken by Boris Yeltsin during one of the meetings in which it appears  that the President told Boris Yeltsin not to trust the Japanese; that  when they say yes they mean no?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's a complete  misreading of what happened at the meeting.  The context of the  conversation was that President Clinton was actually reassuring  President Yeltsin at the time about his conversations with Prime  Minister Miyazawa over the Kuril Islands and the Prime Minister's  belief that Japan would play a constructive role in the G-7 process.   I mean this was a casual comment about Japanese courtesy and  etiquette but overall it was in the context of a conversation where  he was reassuring President Yeltsin that he believed the Japanese  were serious about their commitment to the G-7 process.              Q    Are you saying that the President said that when  the Japanese say yes they mean no?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's not -- I don't know the  exact words and there was a much longer discussion about he did say  something along the lines that he believes that on this issue Prime  Minister Miyazawa intends to really go forward with the G-7 process.              Q   Have there been any attempts to explain this to the  Japanese because apparently the Japanese press has picked this up and  there appears to be --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I've seen the reports in the  Japanese press and it actually does put the situation in context.  It  does talk about the Japanese -- understanding the Japanese points of  view.  I don't think it's going to be a problem.  I believe that  there may have been some diplomatic context just to clear things up  but I'm not positive.              Q   George, was the specific comment that was made  specific to the Kuril Island situation or was it a general  observation on Japanese etiquette?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The discussion was about --              Q   The specific comment is what I'm asking about that  has alleged to have been translated from the Russian notes, \\\"when the  Japanese say yes they mean no.\\\"              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, it was a combination.  I mean  I don't think that's the whole sentence.  I think that the specific  comment was a broad, general observation followed up by a specific  finish to the sentence where he said in this case he believes that  Prime Minister Miyazawa means to keep the commitment.              Q   Was he saying it facetiously first?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it was just a casual  observation.              Q   And then you say diplomatic contacts were made to  clear it up.  Has the President sent a message?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, I don't think the President  spoke; I believe that Secretary Christopher has made some calls but  I'm not sure exactly how many.              Q   Well, this obviously is a bigger deal than you're  making it out to be if Christopher has had to make some calls.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, no.  It was just that we got  the reports in Vancouver and the Secretary wanted to make sure that  it was understood and make sure there was absolutely no        MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- reports in Vancouver, and the  Secretary wanted to make sure that it was understood, and make sure  there is absolutely no misunderstanding, and I don't believe there is  on.              Q   What is our position about the Japanese?  That they  may have to say one thing, but actualy mean another?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  The position on the Japanese  is as the President stated to President Yeltsin throughout the two  days.  He said that he had had a good conversation with Prime  Minister Miazawa prior to the Summit.  He reiterated the U.S.  position, the long-standing support for the Japanese position on the  Kuril Islands, but also reiterated Prime Minister Miazawa's  commitment to move forward on the G-7 process and to play a  constructive role.  And I think President Yeltsin was very glad to  hear that.              Q   After listening to Secretary Christopher on Iraq  for the last few days, I'm a little confused.  What is the U.S.  policy?  Do you want to see Saddam Hussein overturned?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's the same policy that Secretary  Christopher has reiterated, and all of the U.S officials have  reiterated.  We expect full and complete and unequivocal compliance  with all U.N. resolutions.  Right now we do not have that compliance.              Q      throwing it out further that if Iraq complies,  Saddam can't stay in office?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.  I think that that's -- our  judgment is that it is not possible for Saddam Hussein to comply with  the resolutions and stay in power.  But the important point is that  we expect compliance by Iraq with all U.N. resolutions, and we will  continue to demand it.              Q   And are you concerned the Iran will become the  dominant power in the area --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Secretary Christopher has also  spoken to Iran over the last several days, and he says we also expect  full Iranian compliance with all international norms, and stopping  support of terrorism.              Q   That's a very glib statement that he won't stay in  power if he complies with U.N. resolutions.  On what logic do you  base that?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right now Saddam Hussein is not  complying with the U.N. resolutions at all.  He is not respecting the  rights of his people, as is required by the U.N. resolution.  He is  not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding inspections.   He is not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding  armaments.              Q   Well, when do you think that if he did comply he  would be out of power?        MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, right now his power rests on  the repression of his people.  If he stopped doing that it would make  it more difficult for him to stay in power.              Q   George, back on the stimulus package, why is it  that you and the President accuse the Republicans of playing pure  politics and perpetuating gridlock?  Why is it that -- what evidence  do you have that they just don't have a genuine idealogical  difference with you that's in good faith?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the fact that several times  in the past the Republicans, many of the ones who are now leading the  fight for the filibuster, have supported the very funding they now  seek to stop, most especially, the highway funding.                Q   George, in regards to that, some of the moderate  Republicans said that the White House erred by not being more open to  them during the -- while the plan was put together, that they had  one, sort of, proforma meeting between the White House and the Senate  Republicans, and that was it.  Does the Administration look back and  thinks perhaps it could have done a better job of working with some - -              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I'm not sure that it's true  that there was only one meeting.  I mean, the President met with the  Republican leadership on at least two occasions before the  introduction of his package.  He met with the entire Senate  Republican Caucus also for lunch, and went up there.  We are  continually in contact with as many Republicans as we can find who  have an interest in the President's package.  We are interested in  what they have to say, as well.  But we believe that this program is  important, and we're going to continue to fight for it.              Q      your all or nothing, do it with the Democrats  alone strategy, did you maybe miscalculate the ability to get it  through?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean, I think that there is  no question that under the Senate rules a determined minority can  frustrate activity.  I mean, there is just no question about that.   You only need 40 plus one to keep going.  40 plus one to keep going  and to stop any action, and that's what the Republicans are doing.              Q      going to rethink the way you attempt to get  other things passed as you go through this process for the rest of  the summer?              Q      work with Republicans and try to woo some  Republicans into your camp?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we're going to continue to  look for the support of Republicans whenever we can get it on the  President's intiatives?              Q   But on this one -- how are you going to do it  differently than you did it on this one because on this one you  really did stiff the Republicans from the beginning and made it clear  that it was a Democratic majority that would get this through and  could get it through and you really didn't need Republican votes?   Are you going to take a different tack when you have to go for  particular votes?  When you have to go through --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't see into the future and  understand every possible turn in the legislative road.  Clearly the  President's going to continue to reach out when he can.              Q   You don't have any regrets then about the way you  have handled it up to now and you don't plan any changes in your  approach in dealing with the Republicans in Congress based on this  experience?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Obviously the President would like  his package passed as quickly as possible and he's going to continue  to press for that.  We will continue to reach out to Republicans,  there's not question about that.  And we'll continue to reason with  them and try and find appropriate avenues for cooperation.  In this  case the Republicans have chosen to unify around a filibuster, around  a plan to frustrate action not a plan to move forward.              Q   They're being denied any other legislative means of  putting their proposals forward.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think they're being --              Q      any ideas.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think their amendments are being  defeated; I don't know that they're being denied.              Q      to present them.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's not exactly true.  I mean  they get the votes --              Q      that theirs can be passed though by the  parliamentary rules under which they're playing.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Unless they get a majority in  support all the way around, no, that's not exactly true.              Q   George, one more on Iraq.  Is the administration  backing any of the Iraqi opposition?  Grooming any new leadership?              Q      backing any of the Iraqi -- leadership?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, I -- again, we're pressing for  Iraqi compliance.  I don't know if we can get into the business of  grooming leadership.  I believe there have been some contacts, at  some levels, with Iraqi opposition groups.  I don't know  about  anything recently.              Q      Jesse Jackson, who, of course, is not the  President's best friend, has, however, been told that there is to be  some kind of town meeting, or some kind of involvement by the  President, pre-empted the ball game -- Los Angeles.  Will he consider  something like that, or any other kind of intervention there?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, the President  appointed Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, about 10 days ago, to be a  special envoy to California, and coordiante cabinet activities around  the California economic situation, including the situation in Los  Angeles.                I believe there will also be visits out to Los Angeles  by the Education -- or have been visits by the Education Secretary,  Mr. Riley.  I believe that Transportation Secretary Pena and HUD  Secretary Cisneros are also going out.  And there may be other visits  by Cabinet officials over the next several days and weeks.  I  wouldn't rule out the possibility of a visit by President Clinton to  California.  Obviously, he is following the situation closely, and is  concerned about making sure that we make the right long term policy  decisions that will help create the kind of economic opportunities  which help prevent disturbances.  But we're going to continue to  watch it.              Q   George, as a follow-up, Reverend Jackson is also  supposed to be outside the ball park today, in Baltimore, with a  group of supporters protesting the lack of minorities in baseball  management.  Does the President have a position on that?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has received  correspondence from Reverend Jackson.  I know that Reverend Jackson  has also spoken with the White House Chief of Staff, Mack McLarty.   He clearly raises serious questions.  There has been some progress in  baseball over the last several years, but still not enough.  But the  President intends to continue to go to the ball game.              Q   Is he going to say anything about it today, or see  Reverend Jackson while he's out there?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if he is going to see  them, but as I said, the President believes that Reverend Jackson has  raised some serious questions, and it's something that, as I said,  even though there has been progress, it's clearly not enough.              Q   Did Reverend Jackson ask him not to go to the ball  game?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure about that.  I believe  the characterization the Reverend Jackson is talking about is an  informational pickett.  I don't know that he asked him not to go to  the ball game, but he sent a long, detailed, formal letter outlining  his concerns with the situation in major league baseball and the  President read it.              Q   George, the Orioles are playing the Rangers, the  managing partner of the Rangers is George W. Bush.  Is he going to be  there, and is he going to meet with the President?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.              Q   What is the Mubarak schedule?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I know that President Mubarak is  coming tomorrow morning for a working meeting, they will have a  lunch, and I believe that he is having dinner tonight with Vice  President Gore.              Q   And joint statements tomorrow --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe so, yes.  At the end,  yes.              Q   Is there evidence, George, that the Egyptians did  warn the U.S. about a potential terrorist bombing -- terrorist  activities?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As reported in The New York Times,  I mean, I think that President Mubarak did say that there has been  general conversations with the Egyptians, as there have been for a  long period of time.  We do have general intelligence sharing, I  mean.  But President Mubarak was very careful to point out that there  was no specific information on this visit that was passed forward.   The President will continue to investigate the situation, but he also  reiterates his belief that we cannot tolerate terrorism of any kind.              Q   George, he did make specific -- or the Egyptians,  apparently, did issue specific warnings about this individual who,  forgive me --this individual who, forgive me the name escapes me at  the moment, and said the Egyptians were more or less rebuffed in  their attempts to get some kind of action.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know if I would  agree with your characterization of the Mubarak interview.  He did  say that they gave general warnings about the possibility of a  network in the United States and upon which we took appropriate  action.  But there was no specific information on this specific  operation at all.              Q   So, the White House doesn't feel that any of the  law enforcement agencies whether it be the CIA or FBI who would have  received this kind of information was lax or derelict in its duty in  not pursuing some kind of --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, not at all.              Q   What's next with Serbia?  It got only a passing  mention in the news conference yesterday --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  You didn't get to ask your  question.              Q   Yes, exactly.  Was there any agreement on concerted  action between the two countries?  And even if there wasn't, what  does the U.S. do next?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the U.S. is clearly going  to move forward in the U.N. today continuing discussions with our  allies on a sanctions resolution and we'll continue to look for ways  to press the Serbians to come to the negotiating table and sign an  agreement.              Q   George, why do you think sanctions is still an  option?  I mean the Serbians make it clear that at least the  leadership is surviving just fine and they feel like they can wait  you out and even the administration officials we had in the other day  said there's no evidence that they're going to have an effect any  time soon.  The Bosnian Serbs have said no to the peace plan.  When  does no mean no and you have to do something different?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean we are doing something  different.  We're moving forward on further sanctions through the  U.N. and those discussions will continue.  We're going to continue to  try and tighten the noose on Serbia, and I think that every  opportunity we have to do that will have an effect over time.              Q   Are we looking again at lifting the arms embargo?  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has said that this is something  that is under consideration.              Q   George, do you have any more on Hugh Rodham's  condition, how he's doing?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As far as I know nothing's changed.              Q   George, -- week after Mr. Mubarak?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's a little unclear.  I think  we'll be able to get you more either tonight or tomorrow morning  after the Mubarak visit.              Q   Is he going somewhere for Easter?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not that I know of.              Q   What more can you tell us about the additional aid  to Russia that the President plans to ask Congress about?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's going to be consulting with  the Congress and with our G-7 partners over the next couple of weeks.   I know that he spoke last evening with Congressman Gephardt and their  delegation before the -- the congressional delegation meets with the  Russians this week and those consultations will continue over the  next several weeks.              Q   Do you expect that package to be of the magnitude  of the one announced Sunday?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not going to discuss the  magnitude.              Q   How about the list of Cold War restrictions, where  do you stand on that --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As the President said yesterday,  he's going to be looking for that list from the Congress this week  and reviewing it.  He believes -- he's going to try and get it this  week and he's going to review the list, and we're going to take a  hard look at it.              Q   But they're making it up?  I mean it's no White  House involvement, Congress is compiling this list?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he's going to talk to the  congressional leaders about compiling the list but I'm certain we'll  be able to get our own researchers working as well.              Q   George, isn't lifting the arms embargo more of a  probability than a possibility?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's something that's under  discussion.              Q   Secretary Christopher has said that it's a matter  of time and -- for months before that happens.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, all I can say is that it's  something that the President is reviewing.  Right now we're working  with our allies in the U.N on a sanctions resolution, and we'll  continue to review other matters.              Q   George, can you tell us anything about the schedule  this week?  Any travel?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They just asked about that.  I  don't have anything more beyond tomorrow's visit with Mubarak right  now.              Q   Are there consultations, George, with any Jewish  American organizations concerning Jackson-Vanick?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As you know the National Conference  of Soviet Jewry has a list of, I believe,        MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- as you know, the National  Conference of Soviet Jewry has a list of, I believe, 200 Refuseniks.   We'll certainly take a look at that and continue appropriate  discussions.              Thanks. \",\" The most practical use I've seen for them is as key ring ornaments :-)\",\"Greetings,     I have an Epson HI-80 4 pen plotter forsale.  It emulates an HP 7570 or 7574 - I'm not sure which.  It has an option board on it that does the emulation.  It has a serial interface with Hardware handshake. I also have 340 Pens for it as follows:  10 packs of 4 Black Oil based, 16 packs of 4 Red,Green, Blue, and Black pens, 22 packs of 4 Aqueous Black, 7 packs of 4 Aqueous R,G,Blue,Black,  1 pack of 6 Aqueous Multi color pens,  and 114 assorted non-packaged pens mostly colored.      The plotter is used.  I have tested it using the Windows drivers for HP 7570 and HP 7574 and both worked fine.  It accepts either A or B sized paper. (8.5 x 11 or 11x17).      I figure that the plotter is worth about $300 and the pens are worth at least another $200 more..  One thing is certain, you won't need to purchase any pens for quite a while...  All of the packaged pens were sealed so they are all still fresh.  The rest were capped and seem to function as well.      I'd be willing to sell the pens seperate if anyone is interested in just them.      I'm selling it because I got a HP LaserJet and I don't need color.

Both Type 1 and TT fonts can be of excellent quality and poor quality at any size. It all depends on the font's maker and the complexity of the glyphs related to the size and resolution at which they are viewed. Probably the reason for your opinion/experience that TT is inferior is because most TT fonts on the market today have been converted from Type 1 outlines to TT either by the font vendor or end-users using Fontographer or FontMonger instead of the TT fonts being hand-hinted to take advantage of the TT hinting language. At best these converted TT fonts will be on a par with the Type 1 font of its orgin.  TrueType is a much richer and more robust hinting language than Type 1 (the hinting of diagonals for instance, which TT does and Type 1 cannot). If you check out the Windows 3.1 core fonts (Times, Arial, Courier, Symbol, Wingdings) you'll see what can be done with TT. There are other fonts out there that have been hand-hinted and not just converted. Some of the Microsoft TT Font Pack 2 fonts are hinted very well.   Again, not true. The characters in a TT or Type 1 font depend on the maker. If someone converts a Type 1 font to TT they'll only get the characters in the font of orgin. TT allows for much more flexibility in this area as well. You can have thousands of glyphs in a TT font file (Mac/PS/Windows/Unicode char set) and use the characters appropriate for the particular platform you are running the font on. For instance, all or our fontpack 2 TT fonts have the Mac/Windows char set in them. The metrics of the fonts are such that if the font is brought over to the mac the user will have access to the full mac char set.    Hope this clears up some of the confusion.

The original poster (W G Wright) posted an item saying that he had bought a new wizz-bang Laser Printer from Apple (a Select 300 I think) which can print GrayScale. He then said that he CANNOT PRINT GRAYSCALE from his SE computer (and also that all the 'experts' he has dealt with agree that it is not possible).  This is the one major bugbear about doing a 3rd party SE upgrade (compared to Apple's SE to SE/30 upgrade): you will never be able to run Color Quickdraw. It is Color Quickdraw that controls Color AND Grayscale.  SEs CAN print some COLOUR: this is because Quickdraw - the original, non-colour version, has the right hooks for eight colours. Some of you will remember the 'SCSIgraph' solution to getting a colour screen for your SE (I think that it gave you sixteen colours by dithering or something).  There is no reason that Apple couldn't release software patches for older computers (there are lots of Mac Pluses, Classics and SEs that have been upgraded to 68020 and 68030 processors which should be perfectly able to deal with Color Quickdraw) - but they wont, and 3rd parties are having a difficult  time in duplicating the Mac's ROMs (i.e. Nutek et al.).  Just one Caveat: I would have thought that if you were printing a POSTSCRIPT Grayscale image onto a POSTSCRIPT Grayscale printer, that you would be able to do so, whatever Mac you were using. (And I am pretty sure that the Select 300 is NOT a POSTSCRIPT printer [? correct me if I'm wrong?]).\",\"    In Texas, you cannot carry a handgun.  Period.  Either concealed or open.

At first, I thought it was the video driver and    made sure I had the most current drivers, because the problem was most   evident at SVGA resolution modes.  It didn't help and after a bit of   experimentation, determined that the problem existed in standard VGA   resolution mode. It was just much less noticeable.      My mouse was an older MS serial version I bought second hand in 1990. It   worked just fine in DOS and DOS based graphic applications.  On the    guess that the problem was with the resolution of the mouse, I borrowed   a new mouse (a MS bus model) and tried it.  That solved the problem.   So, if your mouse is old, you may want to try replacing it for a newer   one.      --  signoff\",\" How do you spell \\\"tuna helper\\\" ? \",\" I think the original post was searching for existing implementations of f.i. Gouroud-shading of triangles. This is fairly complex to do with plain X. Simpler shading models are implemented already, f.i. in x3d (ask archie where to get the latest version). For Gouroud, a fast implementation will be possible utilizing some extension only, either MIT-SHM to do the shade in an image and fast update the window with it, or PEX/OpenGL which should be able to shade themselves. The portable 'vanilla X' way would be to shade in a normal XImage and use XPutImage(), what would be good enough to do static things as f.i. fractal landscapes or such stuff.  To speak about POVRay, the X previewer that comes with the original source package is not that good, especially in speed, protocol-friendlyness and ICCCM compliance. Have a look on x256q, my own preview code. It is on  141.76.1.11:pub/gfx/ray/misc/x256q/  The README states the points where it is better than xwindow.c from POVRay 1.0 \",\"A new alternative to Scouting for those \\\"unacceptable to BSA\\\" for reasons of religious or sexual preference:   From: \\\"BOYD R. CRITZ, III\\\" <71611.365@CompuServe.COM> Subject: EnviroLeague  \\\"Birth Announcement\\\" on March 7, 1993, from EARTH Forum, CompuServe                        Information Service ===================================================================                        FORMAL ANNOUNCEMENT                      -------------------                                        (SM)                         EnviroLeague   A new youth movement,\\\"EnviroLeague,\\\" was recently born, according to its founder, Boyd R. Critz, III (CIS ID# 71611,365), of Peoria, Illinois. EnviroLeague exists for the education of youth, both male and female, in matters concerning their values related to and responsibility for our environment.   Incorporated as an Illinois not-for-profit corporation, its Articles and initial applications for a service mark have now been filed.  According to Critz, its draft Bylaws contain the following statement of Mission and Objectives:                              MISSION      It is the Mission of EnviroLeague and its adult members    to foster and implement the improved education of young    people in the need to conduct their lives as Stewards    of The Earth, to leave The Earth in a better condition    than they found it, and to otherwise act as responsible,    moral and ethical users of their environment.  To pursue    the accomplishment of this Mission, EnviroLeague shall    seek to serve as a catalyst, focusing in common cause the    separate efforts of all groups desiring the preservation,    improvement, and responsible use of the environment in    which we must all live.                            OBJECTIVES      In pursuit of the Mission of EnviroLeague, its primary    objectives shall be:        (1)  To establish a Movement involving as many             environmentally concerned organizations as             possible, said Movement having as its primary             focus the education and participatory             involvement of young people in appropriate areas             of environmental concern;        (2)  To develop and provide to such organizations and             their branches a full complement of program             materials for their use, including suitable             uniforms, insignia and other badges, written             ideas, syllabi and information, literature and             other items as shall seem appropriate and             desirable;        (3)  To serve as a \\\"clearing house\\\" for the exchange             of program ideas, materials and information             among said organizations;  and        (4)  To assist environmentally concerned             organizations to recruit and train the necessary             adult leadership for their youth programs.   EnviroLeague will operate through three \\\"Program Divisions\\\" serving youth in the elementary, middle and high school grades, respectively.  Service shall be through formation of \\\"EnviroLeague Teams,\\\" either by EnviroLeague itself or by environmentally conscious organizations (or their local branches) wishing a charter to use programs developed by EnviroLeague.   EnviroLeague, as it develops, will be controlled by the actual adult leaders of each local Team, and will have no nationally imposed obstacles to membership or adult leadership status not based upon relevant improper conduct. Organizations accepting a charter may, however, impose certain additional standards for their own use of the program material.  Should such organizations do so, EnviroLeague will commit itself to forming, as soon as possible, new nearby Teams having no such restrictions, particularly as to youth membership.   EnviroLeague will operate on the principle that youth will have much to contribute to developing its programs.  Thus, the top youth leaders of its Teams for middle and high school youth may become involved in governing any local administrative groups, and those for its high school youth may be involved in similar functions at the national level.   Program materials are in development at this time.  Copies of the \\\"draft\\\" portions of the Mentor's Manual (manual for adult leadership) will be in the EARTH Forum, Library 17. These files will be updated as development takes place.   CompuServe is particularly proud that EnviroLeague's founder chose this electronic medium to make the first public announcement of its formation. This announcement is being made simultaneously in both the OUTDOOR and EARTH Forums.   The electronic home of EnviroLeague is in CompuServe's Earth Forum - GO EARTH - message and library areas 17, both named \\\"EnviroLeague.\\\" ============================================================================   Subsequently, EnviroLeague's Initial Governance Council has held its first meeting.  Boyd Critz was elected as the first EnviroLeague Chief Guardian (equivalent to Chairman of the Board or CEO).  He can be reached at home (309) 675-4483 in case of real need.

Drivers licence: Forgot that USA is THE land of cars..... Getting one in Scandinavia (and northern europe) is not easy. Average time is about 20 hours of training, and the cost is rather...... But we think this is acceptable because a car is NOT a toy, and bad drivers tend to hurt OTHERS. (If you are really bad, you WON'T get a lincence!)  Abuse by the goverment: This seems to be one of the main problems; Any harder gun-control would just be abused by the goverment.(!) Either some of you are a little paranoid (no offence...) OR you should get a new goverment. (You do have elections??)  Guns 'n Criminals: MOST weapons used by criminals today are stolen. Known criminals can NOT buy weapons, that's one of the points of gun control. And because gun control are strict in WHOLE scandinavia (and most of europe), we dont have any PROBLEM with smuggled guns.  Mixing weapons and things that can be use as one: What I meant was that cars CAN kill, but they are not GUNS! Someone said that if we 'ban' guns we'd have to ban cars to, because they 'kill' to... I don't think we should argue on this one..... ;)  The issue (I hope..): I think we all agree that the criminals are the main problem. Guns are not a problem, but the way they are used is.... (and what are they for??)  I think this discusion is interesting when you think of (ex)Jugoslavia: They should all have weapons, it's their rigth to have them, and if they use them to kill other (Innocent) people the problem is humans, not guns.  If 50% of ALL murders was done with axes, would you impose some regulations on them or just say that they are ment to be used at trees, and that the axe is not a problem, it's the 'axer' ?? (An example, don't flame me just because not exactly 50% are killed by guns...)  Think about the situation in Los Angeles where people are buying guns to protect themselves. Is this a good situation ?? Is it the rigth way to deal with the problem ??  If everybody buys guns to protect themselves from criminals (and their neighbor who have guns) what do you think will happen ?? (I mean if everybody had a gun in USA)  Don't flame the Englishmen because of Northern Irland, they have gun control that works (in England) and fonds from USA are one of the reasons why IRA can bomb innocents... (Something about throwing stones in glass houses...) Don't flame them because of what to (three?) children did either. (Can an Jugoslav have an oppinion on guns or even peace??) (YES!)

I am not saying that I totally agree with his   interpretation, but it is certainly believable and good food for thought.  He   interprets the Babylon of Revelation 17-18 as being none other than the good   old U. S. of A.  That's right, America.  He supports his claim in several ways.    The Babylon of Revelation is THE world leader in trade and commerce, and the   WHOLE WORLD wept when Babylon fell.  The American dollar, despite the Japanese   success of the 20th century, is STILL the most sought after currency in the   world.  If the U.S. were destroyed, wouldn't the whole world mourn?  The bible   also talks about Babylon being a home of harlots, sin, and adultery (I am   paraphrasing, of course).  Babylon's sin affected, or should I say, infected,   the whole world.  It doesn't take much looking to see that the U.S. is in a   state of moral decay.  Hasn't the American culture and Hollywood spread the \\\"do   it if it feels good\\\" mentality all over the world.  I think, though, that what   Mr. Wilkerson uses as his strongest argument is the fact that Revelation calls   Babylon \\\"Babylon the Great\\\" and portrays it as the most powerful nation on   earth.  No matter how dissatisfied you are with the state of our country, I   don't think you would have too much trouble agreeing that the U.S. is STILL the   most powerful nation on earth.  Again, this interpretation is not NECESSARILY my own, but I do find it worthy   of consideration.\",\"Some sick part of me really liked that phrase....\",\"  Well it rolled out two weeks ago. As we speak it is at White Sands getting ready. I would have called my sources for the latest but they are all out of town (in NM).  As for the future, there is at least $5M in next years budget for work on SSRT. They (SDIO) have been looking for more funds and do seem to have some. However, SDIO is not (I repeat, is not) going to fund an orbital prototype. The best we can hope from them is to 1) keep it alive for another year, and 2) fund a suborbital vehicle which MIGHT (with major modifications) just make orbit. There is also some money for a set of prototype tanks and projects to answer a few more open questions.  Better news comes from the new Spacelifter effort. The USAF managers of this program are very open to SSTO and will have about $50M next year for studies. This would be enough to bring DC-Y to PDR.  Now not all of this money will go to DC but a good case could be made for spending half on DC.  Public support is STILL critical.

Huh?\",\"A bit more than a year ago, a hernia in my right groin was discovered.

A few months later the same pain returned.  The doctor said that he could find nothing wrong in the area of the hernia repair.  Now the pain occurs more often.  My GP couldn't identify any specific problem.  The surgen who performed the original procedure now says that yes there is a \\\"new\\\" hernia in the same area and he said that he has to cut into the area for the repair this time.

They won't  } even be in the top 4 in the division, more like 6th.  if this is true, it won't be for lack of contribution by Viola, so who cares?\",\"  I think I should also point out that the mystical DES engines are known plaintext engines (unless you add a ton of really smart hardware?)   The 'plaintext' is digitized voice, and exists for a very short time, probably in a couple inches of copper, tops. It's flatly not available -- your bug in my office can hear my voice, and even digitize it, but it's going to get a different bitstream.

I guess that the information I am presenting is just toooo difficult for them to deal with. They (ONLY Ted and Mark) have complained to my sysadmin some unknown number of times to get me off the net. (In his defense, Mark sent only one message and it was not THAT bad; it has been posted in one of the newsgroups; However, it *was* not directed at me as would be common practice and I am VERY good at responding via netmail...)  While I disagree with Ted, I would not send mail to his sysadmin to get him axed. Name-calling was not enough; jumping on every post I made was not enough; ignoring specific points when they were not what the desired picture was not enough; SIMPLY IGNORING ME IF I AM SUCH A KOOK WAS NOT ENOUGH. Even now I do not wish to have him axed, but I do wish to express my disgust about this. \\\"Argumentum ad silence-your-opponent-um\\\"?! I would have thought he would have wanted me to stay around just to have someone to yell about and seem sooo wise... (to himself, I think).  The issue that seems to be: \\\"Is the following an advertisement?\\\" Apparently, Ted and Mark think so...  1) I Posted an article from around one year ago as it was taken   *off the net* from last year. If reposting an article  constitutes posting an ad, then I am guilty. This post  did have a name and address and, yes, a price. If one  had posted the address and subscription price of \\\"Newsweek\\\",  would that be an ad? I get nothing from showing this stuff. 2) I Posted a list of documents showing examples of the kind of  \\\"proof\\\" that was REQUESTED BY TED FRANK. He then complains  to my sysadmin saying that I am advertising and, lo and  behold, \\\"poof\\\", there goes my account. This one had an  address in it! Oh, no! I Guess that means it is an ad!  If you value the alternative view I have been discussing, or VALUE ITS DISCUSSION even if you do not agree with it, I ask that you send a note saying as much to me to show to the sysadmin. They rarely get \\\"Ya know, that user on your net was real helpful...\\\" or whatever; they only get \\\"I don't like what that user is doing because...\\\". Please do not send the note to the sysadmin. I need to take it to them in a manner that has at least a chance of getting through.  In my files here are hundreds of responses from people saying \\\"Thanks for the info\\\" or \\\"Could you send me such and such?\\\" or \\\"Your posts are very interesting... keep it up.\\\" and only a handfull of \\\"Go aways\\\". But, I guess the fact that I have decided not to waste my time trying to convince Ted is a Net Offense[TM] of such magnitude as to warrant a message complaining about me. (Knock, knock...\\\"My name is Ted and and this is Mark... We're from the thought police. Seems you have some pretty dangerous ideas here, and we're here to confiscate them...\\\") NWO Indeed!  Guess I will have to go back to the drawing board and come up with a new plan... Thanks Ted and Mike. Hope you are happy. I will be on for a few more days and then... that's all folks! Your comments and support are requested. I can no longer post to news. I ask what this has accomplished... Is there some benefit from making alternative views simply vanish? Not in my book.  Seems the easiest way to win an argument is to make the opposing side shut up. Images of Waco.... ah, but alas... And all this when I am in the process of typing in a letter to me from the Tax Collector saying that a lien was removed due to a letter that I wrote challenging jurisdiction. Oh, well... It takes time to come up with the info requested, and I was just getting started.  It should be noted that Ted Frank has been accused publicly over 40 times of being an NWO supporter and has never made an statements to the contrary. Further, what ARE Ted Frank's motivations for getting me axed? We all know that SOME PEOPLE are getting paid to collect info on people on the net that are of \\\"interest\\\" to the government, and Ted sure seems to have a *personal* interest in debunking me. Hmmm... just who does he work for? The University of Chicago which he \\\"attends\\\"(?) is well known as one of the biggest NWO supporters...  And finally, if anyone would be able to help me find a new account here in the Boulder/Denver area, I would greatly appreciate it. I am in the process of installing Linux and so will be able to do UUCP or maybe a TC/IP connection. Any help here would be greatly appreciated.

It is an LC, with 10MB of RAM and an 80MB internal drive, running system 7.1, with a few SCSI devices in a (so far as I know) properly terminated chain.  I had shut down the system for a day-- I was out of town and we sometimes have thunderstorms this time of year-- and upon restarting got a blinking question mark.  I booted from a floppy and saw that my external HD seemed okay, but there was no sign of the internal.  I installed a system folder on the external and was, indeed, able to boot from it.  I tried things like Disk First Aid and Silverlining, to inquire about the internal drive.  They either could not find it or got errors in trying to talk to it. (Silverlining claimed it was a Connor drive, but it is a Quantum... )  Well, I'd backed things up, so I was able to work.  But, at some point I noticed that the internal had reappeared.  Now, Disk First Aid says that all's well, etc.  Things seem to be fine.  But, what happened?  Was this a warning that something (the internal HD or something else) is about to die?  I'm definitely nervous.  And, if this is a signal that the internal HD is sick, is it true that I can only put up to a 127MB drive inside an LC?  Some folks have claimed there's a limitation in the LC (other'n size or power) while others (and that includes LaCie, over the phone) say anything that fits is okay.\",\"I would really like to get one of the new CD300i CDROM drives for my c650, but my local Apple doesn't know  when they will be available.

You examine the predicitions that the theory makes, and try to observe them.  If you don't, or if you observe things that the theory predicts wouldn't happen, then you have some  evidence against the theory.  If the theory can't be modified to  incorporate the new observations, then you say that it is false.  For example, people used to believe that the earth had been created 10,000 years ago.  But, as evidence showed that predictions from this  theory were not true, it was abandoned.\",\" i'm telling you, sam, three l's.  call up mom and ask.\",\"[Apologies for not posting to alt.clipper, or whatever, but it seems it may not be in the newsfeed here.]  There may be another reason (good from NSA's point of view, horrible from everyone else's) why the algorithm/chip design might be secret.  First, note that the \\\"experts\\\" will only look at \\\"details\\\", and of just  the algorithm:      In addition, respected experts from outside the     government will be offered access to the confidential details of     the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report     their findings.  Why not the chip design?  Well, here's the possiblity:  in addition to encryption, the chip pre-processes voice signals to make them easier to analyze/transcribe electronically.  The chip, once widespread, might effectively be part of a massively parallel computer for \\\"voice- grepping\\\" the US phone network (or the criminal & wrong-thinking patrons thereof).  I wouldn't put it past the NSA.  Think how much easier it would make life for them.  And if this is indeed the case, think of the possible public outcry should it become widely known.  Thus the secrecy.  It might be a good idea to have experts in DSP, voice recognition, and AI conversation-understanding to be on that panel, and insist they be given (authenticatable) design specs and implementation documentation.\",\"[Stuff about the connection between IDE and IDA deleated] If IDE speed come from IDA WHERE does the 8.3MB/s sighted for IDE come from?  SCSI is not complex. It is just the way the industry uses and talks about it. There are THREE key differences in SCSI; the controller chip, the port, and the software.  THAT IS IT. Let us look as SCSi in from THIS stand point.  SCSI-1: asynchronous and synchronous modes {SOFTWARE SCSI DRIVER ONLY}  asynchronous is slower then synchronous mode {only 0-3MB/s vs. 0-5MB/s}  synchronous speeds can be reached by most SCSi-1 divices with a  rewrite of the software driver {As is the case for the Mac Quadra.}  SCSI-2 {8-bit}: THIS is the main source for the confusion. This differs from  SCSI-1 ONLY in the controler chip in most machines.  In the Mac and some PCs  this is called 'fast SCSI-1' because it uses SCSI-1 ports and software drivers  AND can produce SCSI-2 SPEEDS through SCSI-1 INSPITE of this even in the   slower asynchronous mode.  Average speed in asynchronous SCSi-1 mode   4-6MB/s with 8MB/s{See in both Quadras and higher end PCs} Synchronous  mode just allows a higher burst rate {10/MB/s}  SCSI-2 {16-bit}: TWO versions-Wide/Fast.  Wide SCSI-2 requires TWO things  over 8-bit SCSI-2:  a SCSI-2 software driver and a wide SCSI port on the  machine and the external device.  Fast SCSI-2 also requires TWO things over 8-bit SCSI-2: SCSI-2 driver  software and that the RECIEVING devise support 16-bit fast SCSI-2.  Speed of both is the same: 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst.  SCSI-2 {32-bit}:  Also know as Wide AND Fast SCSI.  Over 8-bit SCSI-2 this  requires: SCSI-2 driver software, wide SCSI-2 port, and that the RECIEVING  devices ALSO have a 32-bit mode SCSI-2 chip.  As expected this is VERY  expencive.  Speed: 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s bursts  \",\" Well, certainly in Archimedes case the description \\\"while observing the phenomena in his bath\\\" seems more accurate than \\\"while meditating in his bath\\\" -- it was, after all, a rather buoyancy intense environment.\",\"an excellent automatic can be found in the subaru legacy.  it switches to \\\"sport\\\" mode when the electronics figure it,  not when the driver sets the switch.. which is the proper way to do it, IMO.  so what does \\\"sport\\\" mode entail?  several things:  1) revving to red line (or to the rev limiter in the case of the legacy)  2) delayed upshifts.  (i.e. if you lift off briefly, it will remain in the  low gear.  this is handy if you are charging through corners and  would like to do without the distraction of upshifts when there's  another curve approaching)  3) part throttle downshifts, based on the *speed* at which the pedal is  depressed, rather than the *position* of the pedal.  modern  electronics can measure this very easily and switch to sport mode.  this is wonderful if you want to charge through a green light about  to turn red.  my audi senses this very well and can downshift on as  little as half throttle if my right foot is fast enough.  also, i think that a smart automatic can deliver better gas mileage than a dumb driver with a stick, all else being equal.. remember that the idea of a stick being more economical than an automatic makes a big assumption that the driver is smart enough to know what gear to use for each situation.. how many times have you ridden with an inattentive driver cruising on the highway at 55/65 in 4th gear (of a 5 speed)?    how many % of people who drive manuals *really* know what the best gear to use is for every conceivable situation?  i'm sure there will be some who know, but i suspect that a chip controlled automatic with all possible scenario/ratio combinations stored in ROM is likely to do better.  i can also say that all my previous assumptions were proved wrong after i got a car with instantaneous mpg readout... high gear, low revs and wide open throttle is more economical than low gear, high revs and small throttle opening.  the explanation is quite simple if one sits down to think about it, but not that obvious at first sight. \",\"Does anybody know the FTP site with the latest Windows drivers for the ATI GUP?

When I installed NDW, it wanted to rem out the line that installed EP (EP /ON) and the command to invoke the Image utility. It replaced the Image command with a new image command that invokes the version of Image that came with NDW.  This makes sense, as presumably the Image version with NDW is newer than the one with NU.  It did not, however, install smartcan in the autoexec.  Now two questions:    1:  Will NU use the image data saved by the newer version of image invoked.        i.e. Are the two version of Image compatable?    2:  Will erase protect use the info from smartcan, and vice versa?

By such a back- door (in the encryption algorithm perhaps) it would be possible (for   the manufacturer) to get the keys of all chips that were programmed in  one session. This would not, btw, enable anybody else to retrieve the  keys in the same way because they'll never get a bunch of 300 (N,U)  pairs with identical S1 and S2. (Note that these have to be constant  for the whole batch by the very nature of the procedure, i.e., they  have to be typed in manually by the `random number supplying agents'!)  And I was wondering why they'll always do 300 chips in one session ...  Since the procedure described by Ms Denning imposes high costs on the  production of every chip (at least three persons for one hour each,  plus the cost of a laptop finally blown to pieces in a spectacular,  Hollywood-like bonfire; add travelling expenses, drinks and lighting,  divide the sum by 300) there won't be a larger demand -- not from the  private sector anyway.

It took place in the first intermission of game 1 of the Montreal-Quebec series.   Pre-game comments ----------------- Don's pregame comments were mostly aimed at the goalies... The goalie who gets back his all-star form (Roy or Hextall) can win the series for his team.  Eposode Summary --------------- This episode took place rinkside. Don was holding a hot dog that he bought from the concession stand.  Ron Maclean started out by showing a cartoon which appeared in the Toronto Sun. It featured a picture of Don, who just saw his shadow and proclaimed \\\"Will you look at dat, eh? Means another 6 weeks of me. Beauty.\\\"  Next, Don talked about the hot dog he was holding. According to him, the hot dogs at the Quebec stadium are the best food in all the arenas in the NHL.  From there, Don commented on the Quebec-Montreal game. The game had great flow, because Referee Paul Stewart calls the best game in the NHL. In contrast, the Calgary-LA game was terrible... All stop-and-go, over 50 minutes of penalties called against Calgary by Dan Marouelli. Its getting so that the ref who calls the most penalties gets to ref in the finals.  Next, Ron showed an old picture of Don, when he was playing for the Rochester Americans of the AHL. Don recalled some of the wins that he had in the Quebec arena... during the Memorial cup and the AHL championships.  Finally, Don and Ron discussed Keenan becoming coach of the Rangers. The rangers were a talented team who underachieved. Don feels sorry for temporary coach Ron Smith, who had several key injuries (to Leetch and Patrick) and goalies who went cold.

Golden Bears Hockey Motto (C. Drake)\",\" A number of points.  You are making assumptions about the manner in which the cards are used.  True, by law, all residents, citizens, and tourists must carry a form of identification with them.  For citizens, the standard ID is the ID card.  The purpose this serves on a daily basis, wherein they are presented at public places, is for the purpose of identifying the bearer.  This takes place in banks (cashing checks), post offices (registered mail and such), etc... Quite frankly, it was rare that I ever had to present my ID card for such activities more than once per week.  There is no law or requirement that forces people to wave their ID cards in public. Furthermore, none of the services I outlined discriminate against the bearer in any manner by having access to this information.  The only case that I can think of in which the Le'um field might be taken into account is during interaction with the police, based upon the scenario.  In general though, arab citizens are clearly recognizable, as are non-arabs. Your argument therefore becomes moot unless you can provide an example of how this field is being used to discriminate against them officially.    I take issue with your assertions.  I think that Arab countries do know that they have nothing to fear from \\\"Israeli expansionism\\\". Militarily, Israel is not capable of holding onto large tracts of land under occupation to a hostile, armed, and insurgent population for a sustained period of time.  As is, the intifada is heavily taxing the Israeli economy.  Proof of this can be seen in the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon.  Israeli troops pulled back from the Awali, and later from the Litani, in order to control the minimal strip needed to keep towns out of range of Katyusha missile fire. Public opinion in Israel has turned towards settling the intifada via territorial concessions.  The Israel public is sufferring from battle fatigue of sorts and the gov't is aware of it.  With regards to borders, let me state the following.  I may not agree with the manner in which negotiations are being held, however the crux of the matter is that everyone either makes or refrains from stating a starting position.  The arab parties have called for total withdrawal and a return to pre-48 borders.  If Israel were to state large borders, the negotiations might never get under way.  If Israel were to state smaller borders, then the arab countries might try and force even smaller borders during the negotiations.  I think that leaving the matter to be settled by negotiations and peace treaties is infinitely more realistic and sensible.   Your statement is typical of the simple minded naivety of a \\\"center for policy research\\\".  Whether or not all of Vanunu's revelations were true has no bearing on the fact that some were.  For disclosing \\\"state secrets\\\" after having signed contracts and forms with the understanding that said secrets are not to be made public, one should be punished. As to which were and which weren't, I am under no moral obligation to disclose that - quite the reverse in fact. He was taken to court, tried, and found guilty.  You may take issue with a number of things but clearly you have no understanding of the concept of \\\"Secrets of state\\\", something which every democratic govt has.   I noticed that he was documenting the fact that such prisoners could exist more than he documented the fact that they do exist.  The CLU noted, which you evidently did not pay attention to, that they know of no such reports or cases.  I am sorry to tell you but in a country of 4 mill, as tightly knit as Israel, even if the matter of the arrest was not made public, within a relatively short time frame, most people would know about it.  My own feelings are that the matter of the arrest should be made public unless a court order is issued allowing a delay of X hours. This would be granted only if a judge could be convinced that an announcement would cause irreparable harm to the ongoing investigation.   Well, I am sorry to say that your questions are slanted.  Such questions are often termed \\\"tabloid journalism\\\" and are not disturbing because they avoid any attempt at objectivity. Such questions were often used during the McCarthy era as a basis for the witch-hunts that took place then.  To use your own example, these questions might have been lifted from the format used by Stalinist prosecutors that were looking for small bits of evidence that they could distort and portray as a larger and dirtier picture.  My answers were not any more \\\"hysterical\\\" than the questions themselves.  The problem is not that the q's were provocative, it was that they were selective in their fact seeking.  You fall into the same category of those who seek \\\"yes\\\" \\\"no\\\" answers when the real answer is \\\"of sorts\\\". I suspect that as long as the answers to these questions is not an unequivocal NO, you would remain unsatified and choose to interprete them as you see fit.  A sign of strength is the ability to look You remind me of those mistaken environmentalists who once advocated culling wolves because of the cruelty to deer, only to find that they had broken the food chain and wreaked havoc upon the very environment they sought to protect.  The color blindness you exhibit is a true sign of weakness.   Ditto. \",\"  In the South Lebanon area, only Israeli (and SLA) and Lebanese troops  are present. Syrian troops are deployed north of the Awali river.  Between the  Awali river and the \\\"Security Zone\\\" only Lebanese troops are stationed.   That is your opinion and the opinion of the Israeli government. I agree peace guarantees would be better for all, but I am addressing the problem as it stands now.  Hopefully a comprehensive peace settlement will be concluded soon, and will include security guarantees for both sides.  My proposal was aimed at decreasing the casualties in the interim period.  In my opinion, if Israel withdraws unilaterally it would still be better off than staying. The Israeli gov't obviously agrees with you and is not willing to do such a move.  I hope to be be able to change your opinion and theirs, that's why I post to tpm.   As I explained, I contend that if Israel does withdraw unilaterally I believe no attacks would ensue against northern Israel.  I also explained why I believe that to be the case.  My suggestion is aimed at reducing the level of tension and casualties on all sides. It is unfortunate that Israel does not agree with my opinion.     That is too bad.    Because Israel is not occupying the \\\"Security Zone\\\" free of charge. It is paying the price for that.  Once Israel withdraws it may have lost a bargaining chip at the negociating table but it would save some soldiers' lives, that is my contention.    If Lebanon were willing to agree to  That is completely untrue.  Hizbollah is now a minor force in Lebanese politics.  The real heavy weights are Syria's allies.  The gov't is  supported by Syria.  The Lebanese Army is over 30,000 troops and unified like never before.  Hizbollah can have no moral justification in attacking Israel proper, especially after Israeli withdrawal. That would draw the ire of the Lebanese the Syrian and the Israeli gov'ts.  If Israel does withdraw and such an act  (Hizbolllah attacking Israel) would be akin to political and moral  suicide.

If you have one for sale, would you please contact me through email...\",\"Can't guarantee that it'll work for everyone, but I finally fixed my mouse jumpiness problems: I installed a bus mouse. (Sorry, I didn't say the solution was free.) In the past I'd tried everything with my Microsoft serial mouse. (Cleaning it, unloading all kinds of TSRs, turning off SMARTDRV write cacheing, changing COM ports, ...) Nothing worked. Yesterday I finally broke down and bought a Mouse Systems Bus Mouse. The improvement is even better than I had imagined! So much so that my old mouse must have been jumpy all the time (I just thought it was jumpy sometimes), and I had gotten so used to it I didn't notice. My wife, who uses the computer about once a month, noticed the improvement literally within a second!  I can't say anything about other bus mice, but with the Mouse Systems one you'll have to give up either COM2 or LPT2 to an IRQ. Also, if you don't know, Mouse Systems mice have three buttons. The driver includes a utility that lets you assign keystrokes to the middle button.  Hope this helps someone else.

Here's the outcome from the research (condenced versions, copyright San Jose Mercury news):  ---   Bombings in the two largest cities in southern Lebanon killed 11 people and  wounded 80 others. A car bomb blew up in Tyre, killing 10 people and wounding  75. A man was killed and five others seriously wounded in an explosion in  Nabatiye. ---   An Israeli navy patrol boat attacked and sank a rubber guerrilla boat off  southern Lebanon early today, killing the two men aboard, the army command  said.         It said in a communique that a Dvora patrol boat opened fire on the  motorized rubber dinghy north of Tyre after identifying it as hostile. The army  said no one on the Israeli boat was injured. The affiliation of the slain  guerrillas was not immediately known. ---   Rival factions of the guerrilla group led by terrorist mastermind Abu Nidal  battled Sunday in Tyre, Lebanon, with machine guns and rocket-propelled  grenades, killing at least four people and wounding 15, police said. ---  Lebanon's mainstream Shiite Muslim militia said Thursday that it had  uncovered a network of tunnels in a southern Lebanese village where it said pro- Iranian kidnappers had held Western hostages.         Officials of the militia, Amal, led local journalists through the catacomb- like alleys and showed them two cells with iron doors at the village,  Kawthariyet al Siyad, near Tyre, the ancient port city, about 40 miles south of  Beirut.         The officials said they were certain that U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R.  Higgins was detained there shortly after he was seized by gunmen on a road  outside Tyre in February 1988. -------------- ...anyway, I counted 20 articles during these 3 years of reporting. I also found out the possible reason why the numbers for the inhabitants of the city is defined between 14000 and 24000. It seems that Tyre is one of the places where people from Libanon flee to during more extensive bombings, so there's a constant flow of refugees entering and leaving Tyre (articles mentioned thousands of people entering and leaving this place).

Bussard, Journal of  Propulsion and Power, Vol. 6, No. 5, Sept.-Oct. 1990       Fusion rocket engines are analyzed as electric propulsion      systems, with propulsion thrust-power-input-power ratio (the      thrust-power \\\"gain\\\" G(t)) much greater than unity. Gain values      of conventional (solar, fission) electric propulsion systems are      always quite small (e.g., G(t)<0.8). With these, \\\"high-thrust\\\"      interplanetary flight is not possible, because system      acceleration (a(t)) capabilities are always less than the local      gravitational acceleration. In contrast, gain values 50-100      times higher are found for some fusion concepts, which offer      \\\"high-thrust\\\" flight capability. One performance example shows a      53.3 day (34.4 powered; 18.9 coast), one-way transit time with      19% payload for a single-stage Earth/Mars vehicle. Another shows      the potential for high acceleration (a(t)=0.55g(o)) flight in      Earth/moon space.   \\\"The QED Engine System: Direct Electric Fusion-Powered Systems for  Aerospace Flight Propulsion\\\" by Robert W. Bussard, EMC2-1190-03,  available from Energy/Matter Conversion Corp., 9100 A. Center  Street, Manassas, VA 22110.       [This is an introduction to the application of Bussard's version      of the Farnsworth/Hirsch electrostatic confinement fusion      technology to propulsion. 1500<Isp<5000 sec. Farnsworth/Hirsch      demonstrated a 10**10 neutron flux with their device back in      1969 but it was dropped when panic ensued over the surprising      stability of the Soviet Tokamak. Hirsch, responsible for the      panic, has recently recanted and is back working on QED. -- Jim      Bowery]   \\\"PLASMAKtm Star Power for Energy Intensive Space Applications\\\", by  Paul M. Koloc, Eight ANS Topical Meeting on Technology of Fusion  Energy, special issue FUSION TECHNOLOGY, March 1989.       Aneutronic energy (fusion with little or negligible neutron      flux) requires plasma pressures and stable confinement times      larger than can be delivered by current approaches. If plasma      pressures appropriate to burn times on the order of milliseconds      could be achieved in aneutronic fuels, then high power densities      and very compact, realtively clean burning engines for space and      other special applications would be at hand. The PLASMAKtm      innovation will make this possible; its unique pressure      efficient structure, exceptional stability, fluid-mechanically      compressible Mantle and direct inductive MHD electric power      conversion advantages are described. Peak burn densities of tens      of megawats per cc give it compactness even in the      multi-gigawatt electric output size. Engineering advantages      indicate a rapid development schedule at very modest cost. [I      strongly recommend that people take this guy seriously. Bob      Hirsch, the primary proponent of the Tokamak, has recently      declared Koloc's PLASMAKtm precursor, the spheromak, to be one      of 3 promising fusion technologies that should be pursued rather      than Tokamak. Aside from the preceeding appeal to authority, the      PLASMAKtm looks like it finally models ball-lightning with solid      MHD physics. -- Jim Bowery]      ION DRIVES:   Retrieve files pub/SPACE/SPACELINK/6.5.2.* from the Ames SPACE  archive; these deal with many aspects of ion drives and describe the  SERT I and II missions, which flight-tested cesium ion thrusters in  the 1960s and 70s.

Presumably the protocol can be recovered (if by nothing else, differential analysis).  Postulate if you will, a chip (or logic) sitting between the clipper chip and its communications channel.  The purpose of this chip is twofold:       1) Transmit Channel       The spoof chip XORs the 30 bit encrypted serial number with      a secondary keying variable.  This renders the serial number      unrecoverable with just the system key   2) Recieve Channel       The spoof chip XORs the incoming encrypted serial number      with a secondary keying variable (assuming the serial number      is necessary for local operation).  This has the net result of hiding the serial number.  This gets more interesting when the number of serial numbers issued becomes large, making it difficult to distinguish between valid serial numbers and a spoofed serial number.  Without knowing the system key, you could lie about the serial number, but risk detection of the lie.  IF you had the system key and the encryption algorithm you could successfully lie with a lower probability of detection by emulating the format of your own serial number.\",\"From: Center for Policy Research <cpr> Subject: Assistance to Palest.people   U.N.

It : has been whether they fired their main guns.    Never?  This is incorrect.  Either you don't read very well or resort to falsehoods in an attempt to make a point.  At the risk of boring and belaboring the point, my claim was the chain was regarding the tanks \\\"last used in Detroit in 48\\\". The text follows.  :  You did not merely claim that : tanks were used--you claimed that they fired their main guns to suppress : sniper fire and that they were \\\"quite\\\" effective at this.    Indeed, when Coffman claimed they were only used as APCs, I did say I had been told they did fire their main guns.     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ : You continue to : back away from this claim and defend something else that nobody is : disputing.  Well, the poster who I responded to did dispute the use of tanks post-48.  Rude of you to call Gary Coffman a nobody.    : \\\"Well, it's not the main gun.\\\"  Gee, that's only the entire point.  Are you : now going to admit that you were wrong?  That was the entire point to *you*.  What exactly did I claim?    --------------------------------------------------   \\\"I've heard eye-witness descriptions of tanks using their main guns to respond to sniper fire.  Quite effectively.\\\"    --------------------------------------------------    I wasn't wrong . . . I've heard those descriptions.  If you're paying attention, I've mentioned that I saw the tanks with my own eyes, but the main gun firing was an account I heard.  That helps people judge whether or not to kick in the, to use your words, \\\"bullshit filters\\\".  Stating that I *claimed* this is a falsehood.    What was it I claimed as fact?  Here's the entire post:   --------------------------------------------------  Correction.  I know they used tanks in Detroit 1968.  I saw em, it was well covered in the news at that time.  Gordon Lightfoot mentions it in his song \\\"Black Day in July\\\".   --------------------------------------------------    Since you don't dispute that and claim that nobody else does, that means I was right.    : I will never read of tanks firing their main guns in Detroit in the '67 : riots.  There is simply no way that such an event could have taken place : without it being common knowledge even 26 years later.  The American : military firing shells from tanks in American cities on blacks would have : been *big* news.     So one would suppose.  Some folks think in happened in 48.    Awesley goes on:   You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers.  : To fire fragmentary grenades?  I doubt that as well.  To fire concussion : grenades?  Perhaps.  To fire tear gas?  Certainly.  But you would be : perfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags, wouldn't you, since : it makes your other claim seem more plausible.  John, again, strawman techniques.  Do you feel you're losing it so you have to stretch what I said and knock that down?  What I read said nothing about what they fired.  And so I put nothing in there.  If you need some help, let me know and I'l take your side of this for a while.  You're not scoring here, you're boring here.   : If tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit, people would have been : screaming about it for the past two and half decades.  I would know about : it.      Glad to know you're such an expert.  Nice to hear some an authority.  I especially appreciate your basis of knowledge -- if it had happened, you would have know it.  Since you are such an authority, you probably know that people did scream about an alleged massive cover-up in the number of people killed in the Detroit riot. Some claimed 100+ dead, others said 300.  The offical number is 43 but the Concise Columbia Encyclopedia says it was \\\"several\\\".  I've also heard some things about that but I won't dare repeat them.  You'd assert that I claimed they were truth.  : Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up.      Taking the tour after the riots, it was pretty easy to tell the  difference between Army and Guard troops.  Or so I recall from 26  years ago.  And I seem to recall it was the Army running the tanks. So it would have been an Army cover-up.     Another part of my memories was that while most damaged building were burnt, some were in rubble.  Based on what I remember, I was and am inclined to believe an old sarge or two.  : If your mind is open enough to believe that, well, good for you.  I prefer : to live in reality.   And here in reality, I find it hard to believe that : those tanks even had any shells, much less fired them.     Given the level in destruction in Detroit, I'm quite willing to believe that they did fire their guns.     Now then, we've bored the shit out of anyone whose bothered to read this far and all you've managed to say is that you don't believe the account I cited.  : --John L.

Some Christian churches claimed to be located at the final resting places of Peter, Mark, and other saints, but no one ever claimed to possess the body of Mary, the greatest of the saints. Why? Because everyone knew that she had been taken up into heaven.  Although there is no definitive scriptural proof for the assumption of Mary, some passages seem suggestive, like the passage in Revelation that describes a woman giving birth to a Son and later being crowned in the heavens. Of course, the woman in this passage has other interpretations; she can also be taken a symbol for the Church.  The assumption of Mary makes sense because of her relationship to Christ.  Jesus, perfect God and perfect man, fulfilled the requirements of the law perfectly.  Under the law God gave to us, we are to honor our mother and father, and Christ's act of taking his mother into heaven is part of his fulfillment of that law. Also, he took his flesh from her, so it seems appropriate that he decide not to allow her flesh to rot in the grave.  One last point: an ex-Catholic attempted to explain Catholic doctrine on the assumption by asserting it is connected to a belief that Mary did not die. This is not a correct summary of what Catholics believe. The dogma of the assumption was carefully phrased to avoid saying whether Mary did or did not die. In fact, the consensus among Catholic theologians seems to be that Mary in fact did die. This would make sense: Christ died, and his Mother, who waited at the foot of the cross, would want to share in his death.\",\"  It is no matter what you call the teams, Jokerit and TPS, or Helsinki Tornado and Turku Typhoon, the best palyers in Finland would eventually end up in those teams anyway, if they were in the \\\"big\\\" league.   \",\"   as someone who just lived through a switch from SunOS4.x.x. to Solaris, i'll heartily agree with this.

I think your question should be, \\\"...losing sleep over a million expert riflemen?\\\" Certainly he could have conquered Switzerland, but a million armed militiamen (especially in a mountainous area,  where tanks' effectiveness is limited) would have made it a real pain. The question a conqueror would ask, is \\\"is it worth  the trouble?\\\" The more difficult an invasion is, the more likely the answer would be \\\"no.\\\" Certainly a million riflemen (as opposed to a professional army of only ten or twenty thousand, the best a country the size of Switzerland could support), makes invasions more difficult.

Earlier, you said that it must be a conscious act.  By your definition, no instinctive behavior pattern could be an act of morality.  You are trying to apply human terms to non-humans.  I think that even if someone is not conscious of an alternative, this does not prevent his behavior from being moral.   I try to show it, but by your definition, it can't be shown.  And, morality can be thought of a large class of princples.  It could be defined in terms of many things--the laws of physics if you wish.

For example, how about a scheme using RSA, and some hybrid of DES-CFB and another strong stream cipher (Maybe IDEA-CFB)?  This could be substantially the same as the cripple chip, except that instead of key-registration, the police could demand that you give up your secret key to them (with a court- issued warrant).  Then, they could read the last few months of wiretapped messages you've sent, and assuming you've committed no crimes, you could generate a new key pair and go about your business.  I find that I'd be willing to pay RSA for the right to use such a system, especially given the alternative.  If you were unwilling to give up your secret key, then you'd probably stay in jail (has anyone got a real legal precedent for this?).    This would allow court-issued warrants to be used to gather information on suspected criminals, but it couldn't be done in secrecy, and there would be enormously less likelihood of corruption or theft of escrowed keys.

The keywords `Monthly Posting' will always appear to make killing this article easy for users of newsreaders with kill facilities.  This article is posted to all autos groups, but followups are directed only to rec.autos.  If you don't understand what this means, ask your system administrator for help, or at least for copies of the newuser documentation.  Failing that, please subscribe to the newsgroup news.announce.newusers and read the documentation provided there.  Introduction to the Rec.Autos newsgroup hierarchy:  rec.autos.tech  is intended for technical discussions of automobiles, their design, construction, diagnosis, and service.  Other discussions are largely inappropriate, especially For Sale ads.  rec.autos.sport  is intended for discussion of legal, organized competition involving automobiles.  Technical discussions are appropriate insofar as they apply to competition vehicles.  Discussion from either of two viewpoints, spectator and participant, is encouraged.  Arguments about sports cars are largely inappropriate, as are most other discussions.  For Sale ads are inappropriate unless they are for competition vehicles and/or equipment. Discussions of illegal events are marginal; one should probably avoid advocating breaking the law.  (remember, the FBI reads Usenet!)  rec.autos.driving  is intended for discussions related to the driving of automobiles. Also, if you must discuss 55 vs. 65, or radar detectors, or <insert your pet driving peeve> boneheads, do it here.  rec.autos.vw  is intended for discussion of issues related to the use and ownership of automobiles manufactured by Volkswagen (this includes VWs, Audis, Seats, etc.)  It was created on the grounds that the info-vw mailing list was very successful.  It should not be presumed from the existence of this group that it is appropriate to create many groups to cover many different marques; groups specific to individual marques should only be created on demonstration of sufficient interest, via some avenue such as a mailing list.  rec.audio.car  is not properly part of the rec.autos.* hierarchy.  it is, however, the correct place for discussion of automotive audio equipment, and so is mentioned here.  rec.autos.antique  is intended for the discussion of older cars (usually more than 25 years old, although this is not a hard-and-fast rule.)  alt.hotrod  is not part of the hierarchy, but also of potential interest to the rec.autos reader.  it is gatewayed to the moderated hotrod mailing list, and is for serious discussion of modifying and developing performance vehicles.  alt.autos.rod-n-custom  also not part of the `official' hierarchy; devoted to that peculiar American hobby of customizing older cars.  alt.autos.karting  for the discussion of the popular motorsport and hobby, karting.  rec.autos  is intended to capture discussion on all other automotive topics.   Crossposting:  Crossposting occurs when more than one newsgroup name is included on the Newsgroups: line in the article header; such articles will appear in all of the newsgroups listed.  Crossposting is one of the most misunderstood and misused facilities on Usenet.  You should only post to a group because you feel an article is appropriate; you should NEVER crosspost just to reach a particular audience.  This distinction is subtle, but important.  Radar Detector articles, for example, are more-or-less appropriate in rec.autos.  They are almost never appropriate in sci.electronics or rec.ham-radio, and the fact that you might want to reach the audience in sci.electronics or rec.ham-radio is NOT adequate justification for posting to either group.  Crossposting between any or all of the rec.autos.* groups is usually inappropriate; if you find yourself doing so, consider whether or not it is truly advisable, before sending your article.  Consider setting Followup-To: to point to only one newsgroup if you feel you must crosspost.  Crossposting between rec.autos.* and misc.consumers is chancy at best; in particular flame wars over the speed limit in the US and/or the use of radar detectors should NEVER be crossposted between any of these groups.  Most readers of sci.electronics and rec.radio.* couldn't care less about the police radar and radar detector arguments that go on endlessly in rec.autos.  It is an excellent idea to check the Newsgroups: and Followup-to:  lines of articles before posting a followup.  In particular, be wary of posting to misc.test, rec.arts.startrek.*, or talk.bizarre, or any combination of these three.  The life you save may be your own.  Distribution:  There is a field in the header of any news article which allows you to (partially) control where the article goes; it is called the Distribution field.  It may be very useful for many reasons; it should also serve as a reminder that news is a very large and widespread system.  The distribution of rec.autos.* is fairly extensive.  As of this writing,  the Automotive newsgroups are known to reach most of Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and some locations in Japan.  With this in mind, I offer the following hints about use of the Distribution: field in your article headers, and on article content.  1) Please take care not to send for-sale ads about clapped out Ford Mavericks in New Jersey to France or California; i doubt that anyone in either place will care, except for my girlfriend, who for some strange reason likes Mavericks (but only 4-door Mavericks, at that.)  2) When posting technical questions, please include the market for which your car was manufactured.  For example, there are a number of differences between a European-market Ford Escort and a US-market Escort.  Likewise, all 1750cc and early 2000cc Alfa Romeos reached the US with Spica Fuel injection; European market cars usually got carbs (often Webers).  These differences can be important to your readers; make your situation clear. Failure to do so can lead to pointless flame wars and a significant spread of misinformation.  3) Be careful about your capacities and specifications when posting; in the US we get a mix of Metric and English system values, whereas Europe is almost entirely on the Metric system.  A future edition of this monthly posting will contain a list of commonly-used abbreviations that may not be known in some places that rec.autos reaches; this cuts both ways so let us not be parochial about it.  4) Use the Distribution: field to limit where your article goes, when possible.  Within North America, the values na (north america), can (canada), and usa may be used.  in addition, the two-letter state abbreviations of the US are supported in some cases; e.g. if i wanted to send an article only to New York and New Jersey, i could put \\\"ny,nj\\\" in a Distribution field.  note that multiple, comma-separated values are legal.  these distribution fields vary widely, however, so you should check with your local sysadmin to find out what is likely to be supported in your area.  The Dangers of Overgeneralization:  To amplify a warning from the distribution section of this article: Be wary of making foolish assumptions about all cars, tires, etc.  What is true for a 1973 Buick with a 455cid engine may be quite utterly wrong for a 1976 Honda with a 1200cc engine.  Headlight laws in Sweden are decidedly different from those in Idaho.  The Need for Adequate Specification:  When you ask a question, please give a reasonable amount of information; e.g., if you have a question about your Honda, please specify year, model, engine size, etc.  Otherwise, most answers to your question may be quite useless.   Concerning Lemons:  At one time or another, every auto manufacturer has manufactured a lemon or two; even Honda admits to this.  Please don't waste everyone's time by announcing to the world that your `brand x' automobile is terrible, so all `brand x' automobiles are terrible, so no one should ever buy a car from the `brand x' company.  Such articles are worse than useless, because they cause substantial wasted bandwidth while carrying little or no useful information.   Concerning Flames:  As much as we might wish it, a flame-free newsgroup is something that most likely will never occur.  Here are some guidelines for flames and how to deal with them (a list of flame-prone topics follows in the next section of this posting):  If you post something truly obnoxious and inflammatory, don't imagine for a minute that including the words `No Flames' will work.  It won't, and you'll get exactly what you deserve.  If you're going to flame, you're more likely to get away with it if you can cite a fact or maybe a well-known reference.  No one is likely to believe bald, unsupported assertions.  Be careful about who you choose to insult.  Consider not insulting anyone.   Asking the Question:  It is a bad idea to post a question and end it with a phrase like `Please send email, I don't read this group'.  It is a much better idea to end the question with `Please send email, if there is sufficient interest I'll summarize the results in a later posting.  I may miss posted responses to this request'.  Answering the Question:  If someone wants to hop up their Yugo, don't tell them to get a Mustang. Either be silent, or give them useful advice.  If someone wants advice on defending a speeding ticket, don't tell them to obey the law next time -- it's offensive, presumes guilt which is not proven, and doesn't directly address the original question.  In general, don't post in order to see your words in print, and don't post in order to enjoy feeling smug and self-righteous.   Stale and/or Inflammatory Topics:  Certain topics are considered stale by `old timers'; while discussion of them is certainly ok, and new, factual information is welcome, ravings about them are extremely tiresome, and may get the person who posts them ignored altogether.  Some topics are naturally inflammatory; it is difficult if not impossible to have meaningful discussion of them.  Some of these topics include the following:  1)  the 55mph speed limit in the US: Pro and Con  2)  discussions about the morality and legality of the sale and usage of     radar detectors.  3)  discussions over which radar detector is best.  4)  discussions over what is a sports car (this is one reason why     rec.autos.sport is not a `sports car' group -- everyone would argue     about what constitutes a `sports car'.)  5)  disputes over whether or not US Federal law protects the driver's     right to own and operate a radar detector  6)  `Buy American' discussions  7)  `clever' bumper stickers and personalized license plates  8)  <insert nationality here> cars are terrible  9)  What kind of car did Maxwell Smart drive?       [when I have a complete, accurate answer it will be added to the           commonly-asked questions article which is also posted monthly.

For all of you who are unaware -> ESPN bought the air time from ABC and did all the  production, advertising sales, commentating, etc -> and even  reaped any $ made...\",\" As one of the \\\"Clintonites\\\" cited above, I'll try to clarify since this is not a case of Clinton's \\\"dishonesty.\\\" (I won't necessarily defend him on other issues.)    There were NEVER any specific projects included in the Community Development Block Grant portion of the President's proposal.  Congressional Republicans, in an effort to discredit the stimulus package, selected what they felt were silly sounding projects from a wish-list of POTENTIAL  projects prepared by the US Mayors' Conference before the stimulus package was ever proposed.  (The document in question was designed to pressure the White House to increase the size of the block grant proposal submitted to Congress.  It didn't work.)  The $2.56(?) billion proposed in the stimulus package came nowhere close to covering the total estimated cost of the original wish-list.  If it were passed, communities would have to select which projects to fund and at what level.  In the case of Spokane, Wa., Tom Foley's home district, no one ever expected to be able to refurbish a local swimming pool (one of the  Republicans' examples) FROM THE FUNDS AVAILABLE IN THE STIMULUS PACKAGE since the estimated cost of doing so exceeded the total  amount of block grant funds the city would receive from the stimulus  package for ALL projects.    The plan, instead, was to use the money on public housing construction and remodeling to cope with a severe housing shortage.  (Yup, there are places where that is true.)  The swimming pool improvements were near the bottom of a long list of priorities prepared by the city.  The $3 million or so to be received would cover only a few of the most pressing priorities.  If the block grants are cut from the stimulus package, it is these projects that will be affected by the lack of funds.  And that is why the Clinton administration has been publicizing the issue.  A final point.  One may or may not like community block grants.  It is worth noting, however, that Congressional Republicans' opposition to them is new.  Since the Nixon administration, Republicans have generally  supported such grants as an alternative to targeted federal spending, arguing that local governments are far better able to determine spending priorities than \\\"Washington bureaucrats.\\\"    Is it clear now?  Or is this all too complicated to understand?  jsh\",\" Yes, it was Nixon who was most vocal about giving money to Russia.  It makes me proud to be a libertarian.

It's like subsidizing tobacco farmers while paying bureaucrats to pursuade people not to smoke.

[...I believe \\\"Jesus    only\\\" originally was in the context of baptism.  These are folks who    believe that baptism should be done with a formula mentioning only    Jesus, rather than Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.  This may have    doctrinal implications, but as far as I know it does not mean that    these folks deny the existence or divinity of the Father.  I'm not the    right one to describe this theology, and in fact I think there may be    several, including what would classically be called monophysite or    Arian (two rather different views), as well as some who have beliefs    that are probably consistent with Trinitarian standards, but who won't    use Trinitarian language because they misunderstand it or simply    because it is not Biblical.  --clh]  Not Biblical?  What then can they make of the end of Matthew?  (28:18)And Jesus came and said to them, \\\"All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. (19)Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, (20) and teaching them to obey everything that I have commanded to you.  And remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age.\\\" {Other ancient authorities add *Amen*} [NRSV]  The notes give no sense that this is emended.  Do other texts contradict this regarding Baptism?  Or is a misunderstanding of the Trinity the most likely explanation after all?  But maybe I simply misunderstand their views.  (Is anyone else out there forced to read this group with both a good Bible and an unabridged dictionary??  Christianity really is an education in itself.)  -- ------------------------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------  [Arrgggghhhh.  When I talked about people who rejected Trinitarian language as unBiblical, I was speaking of Trinitarian theology, things like \\\"one essense and three persons\\\".  Obviously the three-fold baptismal formula is Biblical, as you point out.  (I normally use the term \\\"three-fold\\\" in referring to Mat.  While it is certainly consistent with belief in the Trinity, the Trinity is a doctrine whose full formulation occurred in the 4th and 5th Cent's.  It's unlikely that Mat. had in mind the fully-developed Trinitarian doctrine. Indeed the three-fold baptismal formula is used by some groups that do not believe in the Trinity.)  The disagreement over baptismal formulae occurs because of passages such as Acts 2:38, which command baptism in the name of Jesus.  (There are a couple of other passages in Acts as well.)  This leaves us with sort of a problem: we're commanded in Mat. to baptize in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and in Acts to baptize in the name of Jesus.  \\\"Jesus only\\\" groups baptize in the name of Jesus.  They consider this consistent with Mat 28:18, because they say that Jesus is the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.  I'm not the right one to ask to explain what this means.  I will simply say that it does not appear to be normal Trinitarian theology.  (It is also an odd way of dealing with the idiomatic phrase \\\"in the name of\\\".)  Those who use the three-fold formula don't seem to have a standard answer to the passages talking about baptizing in the name of Jesus. I suspect that the most common explanation is to say that \\\"in the name of\\\" need not be a verbal formula.  To say that you baptize in the name of Jesus may simply mean that you are doing baptism under Jesus' authority.  In the 1st Cent. context, it contrasts Christian baptism with the baptism of John or other Jewish baptism.  Of course there's a certain parallelism between these passages.  That suggests that we could just as well say that Mat 28:18 doesn't require the specific three-fold formula to be used in baptism, but simply characterizes baptism done by those who follow the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.  One might well suspect that in the early church, more than one baptismal formula was used.  So long as we consider following Jesus to be the same as following the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, no great damage would be done by such a difference.  This does *not* mean that I think we should go back to using both formulae.  Baptism is one of the few things that almost all Christian groups now recognize mutually, so I do not think doing something to upset that would be in the interests of the Gospel.  This is reinforced by the fact that those groups that actually use \\\"in the name of Jesus\\\" now do seem to have in mind a difference in doctrine.  But as I've said before, I'm not the one to explain what their doctrine is.\",\"Archive-name: hockey-faq  rec.sport.hockey answers to Frequently Asked Questions and other news:   Contents:  0.

It  is updated each month and only information currently under discussion or  of continuing importance or interest will be listed for more than two  postings.    Boston Bruins   Boston legislators and the developers proposing a new Boston Garden  finally agreed to a deal that puts the 19,000-seat, $160 million project  back on track to be finished in September 1995.   Right wing Daniel Marois will be sidelined indefinitely following  surgery to repair a herniated disc in his back. **   Sent defenseman Glen Murray to Providence of the American Hockey League.   Buffalo Sabres 1-800-333-PUCK (1-800-333-7825)   Acquired left winger Bob Errey from Pittsburgh for defenseman Mike  Ramsey. **   Veteran Buffalo Sabres broadcaster Ted Darling will be inducted into the  club's Hall of Fame Sunday, April 11.  Darling, who joined the expansion  Sabres in 1970, was the team's play-by-play announcer on both television  and radio until illness forced him out of the booth during last season. **   Recalled forwards Viktor Gordiouk and Doug MacDonald from Rochester of  American Hockey League.   Calgary Flames   Acquired veteran right wing Greg Paslawski from Philadelphia for future  considerations. **   Recalled center Todd Harkins and left winger Tomas Forslund from Salt  Lake City of International Hockey League.   Chicago Blackhawks         The $175 million, privately financed United Center, scheduled to  open in August 1994, will be home to the NBA's Chicago Bulls and NHL's  Chicago Blackhawks. The stadium is owned by entities controlled by the two  teams. The owners apparently still have not made a decision on whether the  old Chicago Stadium will be razed for parking space once the new facility,  located directly across the street, opens.   Suspended defenseman Craig Muni indefinitely for failing to report  following a trade with Edmonton.   Detroit Red Wings   Acquired defenseman Steve Konroyd from Hartford for a sixth-round draft  pick.   Annnounced the signing of right wing Joe Frederick, their 13th pick in  the 1989 National Hockey League entry draft. **   Two contrite hockey fans have returned the stolen Michigan Sports Hall  of Fame plaque honoring Detroit Red Wing great Gordie Howe. The bronze  plaque was stolen more than four years ago from Cobo Hall in Detroit, site  of the Michigan Hall of Fame.   Edmonton Oilers   Sent forward Esa Tikkanen to the New York Rangers for center Doug  Weight.   Traded defenseman Craig Muni to Chicago for forward Mike Hudson.   NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said the Edmonton Oilers' lease with  Northlands Coliseum must be improved if the team is to survive in the  city. Edmonton Northlands is a non-profit agency set up by the city to  administer exhibition facilities including the Coliseum.  Oilers owner  Peter Pocklington calls his lease with Northlands horrendous and has  threatened to move the team if he doesn't get a better deal. He makes no  money from parking, concessions or building advertising. The 17,313-seat  Coliseum also has few of the lucrative private boxes that produce  significant revenues for other owners.   Announced center Kevin Todd will not need surgery but will miss the  remainder of the season with a separated shoulder.   Hartford Whalers   Sent defenseman Steve Konroyd to Detroit for a sixth-round draft pick.   Acquired left winger Robert Kron and a third-round draft pick from  Vancouver for left winger Murray Craven and a fifth-round draft pick. **   The state of Connecticut will begin negotiations to buy the Civic Center  from the city in an effort to keep the financially struggling Hartford  Whalers franchise in the city.

Rheaume, the  first female to play professional hockey, stopped 25 shots and gave up six  goals against the Cincinnati Cyclones on Saturday night, April 10.

But  Esposito said there was no truth to the report.  \\\"We were disappointed  with ESPN's irresponsible comment,\\\" Esposito said.  \\\"There is just no  substance to the rumor.\\\" Rumors have been swirling for the past two years  regarding a move by Tampa Bay, which is presently discussing plans to  build a new arena.

All series will be best of seven (2-2-1-1-1 rotation) except  matchups between Central and Pacific teams.  Those series will rotate 2-3- 2 to reduce travel.  In those cases, the team with the most regular-season  points will choose whether to start the series at home or away.  -----  - Draft news:          Under terms of the new expansion draft, which will be held in  June, each of the 24 existing clubs will be allowed to protect one  goaltender, five defensemen and nine forwards. The most recent expansion  drafts allowed teams to protect two goalies and did not make a distinction  between forwards and defensemen.

San Jose, Tampa Bay and  Ottawa still will be allowed to exempt second-year pros.         Each of the 24 teams will lose two players, with a maximum loss of  one goaltender and a maximum loss of one defenseman. The one exception is  that a team which loses a goaltender can then no longer lose a defenseman.         At the end of the first phase of the draft, the two new franchises  will have three goaltenders, eight defensemen and 13 forwards for a total  of 24 players. A second phase then will be conducted where San Jose, Tampa  Bay and Ottawa will select two players each from the rosters of the two  new teams.         Ottawa, Tampa Bay and San Jose will be guaranteed priority  drafting selection in the 1993 draft as long as they have the three worst  records. Anaheim and Miami will choose no lower than fourth and fifth. The  expansion franchises will move up in the draft should either San Jose,  Tampa Bay or Ottawa not finish in the bottom three positions.         The two new teams will pick first and second in the 1994 Entry  Draft, regardless of their finish in 1993-94. Should either of the two new  teams not play next season they would have priority drafting position in  1994.          The owners announced the 1994 draft will be in Hartford and the  1995 draft in Winnipeg. The 1994 draft was scheduled for Boston, but a  delay in the construction of a new arena required the draft be moved.  -----   - League news:  Disputes:    The NHL owners and players have resolved differences over salary  arbitration procedures, clearing the way for about 40 hearings.

CHL: Fort Worth Fire, Wichita Thunder, Dallas Freeze, Tulsa Oilers, Memphis  River Kings, Oklahoma City Blazers    Six non-affiliated teams play a 60 game schedule extending from early  November to mid March. Each team is owned by the league, with local  interests controlling day to day operations. Each team has a $100,000  salary cap for 17 total players (16 dress up). Unlike the ECHL, players  are not limited to three years in the league.   A Western Division may be added to the Central Hockey League for the 93- 94 season if the plans of CHL president Ray Miron materialize.  Miron  confirmed that El Paso, Amarillo, Tuscon, and Albuquerque are cities under  consideration for the Western Division, which would play some interlocking  games with the Eastern Division.

Major League Hockey was founded by Roy Boe, former president of  the New York Islanders of the National Hockey League and the New York/New  Jersey Nets of the American and National Basketball associations.         According to Boe, the league will debut with six to eight teams  playing a schedule of approximately 80 games. Franchise applications have  been received from groups in Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, Denver, Detroit,  Houston, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Phoenix, San Francisco, Saskatoon, Toronto  and Worcester, Mass., Boe said.         Although the league will not raid existing leagues to stock its  rosters, Boe said it will seek the ``world's finest hockey players.''         Boe said league play will have an international flair and  discussed implementing some rules which are reminiscent of those of the  IIHF.         ``We're removing the red line, moving the goal nets forward and  eliminating all tie games,'' said Boe.         The MLH office will operate out of Stamford, Conn.  -----   - British Premier Division:    contacts:   Neil A.

Answers to some frequently asked questions:    Q: Why are the Montreal Canadiens called the Habs?  A: Most of the team during the 40-50's was made up of people who lived in  and around Montreal. Hence they were called \\\"Les Habitants\\\" (natives of  Montreal). This was then shortened to the Habs.    Q: Why is the Montreal Canadiens logo a large C with an H within it?  A: In 1914-15, the Canadiens logo consisted of C with an A within it to  signify Club Athletique Canadien (CAC). The next year, CAC no longer  existed and it was changed to what it is now to signify Club de Hockey.   Q: What is the most informative hockey publication?  A: The Hockey News is preferred by most North American hockey fans. It is  a weekly journal with up-to-date info. Phone: 800-268-7793 (Canada and US) Phone/fax: 0483 776141 (UK and rest of Europe)    Q: How does a 5-minute power-play count in the penalty killing stats in  the NHL?  A: If X goals are scored, then the team gets credit for X goals in X+1  chances.    Q: How is +/- computed in the NHL?  A: First, +/- only applies to skaters. Except for a power-play goal, when  a goal is scored, each skater on the ice for the scoring team is given a  +, and each skater on the ice for the other team is given a -. Short- handed goals do count for +/-.    Q: What is the five-hole?  A: The space between a goalie's pads. There are five major scoring zones:  (1) upper left corner of goal, (2) upper right, (3) lower left, (4) lower  right, and (5) five-hole.    Q: What is the meaning of throwing an octopus on the ice?  A: This tradition began in Detroit in the 1950's when two best-of-seven  series were required to win the Stanley Cup. Every time Detroit won a  game, an octopus with one less arm was thrown on the ice.   Q: Who was the first woman to play in an NHL game?  A: Manon Rheaume, a 20-year-old goaltender, became the first woman ever  to play in an NHL game on September 23, 1992 when she started in net for  the expansion Tampa Bay Lightning in an exhibition against the St. Louis  Blues. Rheaume played the first period before 8,223 at the 10,400-seat  Expo Hall on the Florida State Fairgrounds and allowed two goals on nine  shots. She left with the score tied 2-2, although the Lightning ultimately  lost the game, 6-4.   Q: What is the richest contract in NHL history?  A: Mario Lemieux, the superstar center of the Pittsburgh Penguins, signed  the richest contract in NHL history, a seven-year deal believed to be  worth about $42 million. Lemieux will earn between $6 million and $7  million a year, nearly twice as much as any other player in the league.   Q: Who is the new commissioner of the NHL?  A: Gary Bettman, vice president and general counsel of the National  Basketball Association, was named commissioner of the National Hockey  League, Friday, December 11, 1992. Bettman joined the NBA in 1981 as  assistant general counsel. He became the league's chief legal officer in  September of 1984. A New York resident, Bettman graduated from Cornell  University in 1974 and from New York University School of Law in 1977.   Q: How many professional hockey leagues are there in North America?  A: Six:  National, American, International, East Coast, Central and  Colonial Hockey Leagues.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------   9. Miscellaneous:    For field hockey discussions, go to the newsgroup rec.sport.hockey.field.  For skating discussions, go to the newsgroup rec.skate.    Some sites get another hockey group, called clari.sports.hockey. c.s.h  consists of the UPI feed for all UPI news articles that are related to  hockey, including game results, summaries, scores, standings, etc.  Much  of the information in the NHL team news section comes from this newsgroup.     The rec.sport.hockey Frequently Asked Questions posting is posted semi- monthly, usually on the 1st and 15th of each month, during the hockey  season.  This file was originally created by Tom Wilson, who posted it  during the 1991-92 season.  It was taken over by Mitch McGowan for the  1992-93 season.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------     Please make corrections via e-mail, indicating \\\"r.s.h FAQ\\\" as the  subject line. Feel free to start a discussion on any previously mentioned  topic (but use an appropriate subject line).   Mitch McGowan <hamlet@u.washington.edu>\",\"Most of this discussion has been between Mark Singer and David Tate, with Valentine weighing in on the same side as Dave at various times. My opinion, FWIW, to all:  Mark, age doesn't matter; ability does. I would rather have the untried rookie with great minor league numbers than the veteran who has proven himself to be average at best. I don't care if he is 15; if he plays better than what I have, I want him out there. Sandy Alomar had decent minor league numbers, grossly inflated by the PCL in general and Las Vegas in particular; he should have been projected as an average major league hitter (which is good for a catcher, I'll admit). Santiago's numbers would probably come out the same as Sandy's, but I don't have the league data from the mid-80s to check it out.  That being said, I agree with sending Lopez to Richmond, at least to start the season. As the box below shows, he has *one* minor league season in which he hit well. He has two in which he hit very, very poorly. I want to see that the 92 Lopez is real. Olson and Berryhill are not complete mediocrities; for catchers, especially NL catchers, they are essentially average hitters, with equivalent averages around .220. If he had hit well at prior levels, I would say he belongs on the Braves; but there is a reasonable chance that Lopez last year was just as much a fluke as Alomar in 90 or Santiago in 87. One year at any level, at any age, doesn't satisfy MY standards of evidence.

Granted, I thought his behavior with McCarver last year was completely bush. Last year was the first time he ever got 300 AB in one place, so his lines are hard to read. But he has a combined 720 OPS in minor league play; with his speed is more valuable than the OPS alone indicates; and at a still young age (24), had a monster year with an 868 OPS. He has a total, major and minor, EQA of .249; above major league average, and above average for CF (which was about .240 in the NL last year). He has shown at least the potential of going into the .290s, which would make him one of the 15 best hitters in the league. He has two full seasons before reaching his \\\"prime\\\" season of 27. He should be considered as a legitimate prospect, and not as a simple side-show attraction.

This smacks a bit of ideology -- the supposition being that Toricelli's subsequent descriptions of his reasoning are not veridical.

But my point is that this type of case is *not* a rarity.  In fact, I was going to point to Pasteur as yet another rather common example -- particularly the studies on spontaneous generation and fermentation.  I will readily concede that \\\"ridiculous reasons\\\" can play an important role in how scientists spend their time.

It would have the plus of RocketShare and the minus of NuBus accelerators - no true boot off the accelerator, NuBus bottleneck to video and other I/O.  Apple, it seems, will not compete with third parties here -- except perhaps for not-yet-available Macs like Cyclone, where a PowerPC slot might be advertised. Look for Daystar and such to make PowerPC accelerators.  One potential problem with any accelerator, though, is that it will need a ROM companion and Apple has licensed only Radius, with Rocketshare, to use any of its proprietary code.  Apple is, between the lines, trying to let us know that PowerPC Macs will have simplified logic boards due to the magical nature of RISC and that these boards should be much cheaper to build than those in existing 68040 Macs. Perhaps, then, we'll see groundbreaking prices in Mac-logic board upgrades, much the same way we've seen much cheaper high-performance CPUs this year.  First generation PowerPCs, 98601s, will also hopefully have socketed CPUs so that they'll be chip upgradeable to 98604s a year later. This should be possible in much the same way that 486s can be pulled for clock doublers. If there is too much technical   baggage (which I doubt since the external busses are the same size/width) to do this, perhaps we can have CPU daughterboard, a la Powerbook, as standard to facilitate better CPU upgrades. This is an area where Apple has fallen far behing the Intel-based world. Perhaps catchup is in order.  By the way, last week's PC week had an excellent story on PowerPC, Pentium, MIPS R4000, DEC Alpha (the big four on the microprocessor front for the forseeable future). Worth reading for technojunkies. Also, the latest PC has a cover story on Pentium. Read it, and all the other stories about how Intel is unstoppable and preeminent right now.  Once anyone is this secure, they are due to fall. Intel's market position will never again be as dominant as it is today (especially if AMD gets the go ahead to sell its 486s this week as it appears it might). The competition from all fronts is gearing up for an awesome battle. Apple users should be excited that PowerPC, while not guaranteed dominance, is a guaranteed winner, even if its one of several.\",\"  This is an excellent question and I'll be anxious to see if there are any such cases.

But yes, you've got the idea -- the reboost is done by taking the whole shuttle up.   Somebody has to build that thruster module; it's not an off-the-shelf item.  Nor is it a trivial piece of hardware, since it has to include attitude control (HST's own is not strong enough to compensate for things like thruster imbalance), guidance (there is no provision to feed gyro data from HST's own gyros to an external device), and separation (you don't want it left attached afterward, if only to avoid possible contamination after the telescope lid is opened again).  You also get to worry about whether the lid is going to open after the reboost is done and HST is inaccessible to the shuttle (the lid stays closed for the duration of all of this to prevent mirror contamination from thrusters and the like).  The original plan was to use the Orbital Maneuvering Vehicle to do the reboost.  The OMV was planned to be a sort of small space tug, well suited to precisely this sort of job.  Unfortunately, it was costing a lot to develop and the list of definitely-known applications was relatively short, so it got cancelled.\",\"        Depends on what you mean by classy.

I think that our major difference in opinion is on the legitimacy of Sevres. First, thattreaty was signed by the Ottoman Empire therefore legally it does not bind the  Republic of Turkey. The new independence movement (which by the way, is not the same as the Young Turks) naturally rejected it out of hand. to say that we  should accept because the Germans did theirs is absurd. We saw what the cosequences of such harsh treaties were in Hitler. Second, the Sevres treaty was even  worse than Versailles.

The story is this: I bought a car out of state, and I'm trying to get the safety inspection in Pennsylvania. The problem is that the car has  aftermarket tint on all windows except the windshield. The tint is rather weak, and you can clearly see the inside of the car through the tint.  The inspection garage said that they won't pass it unless I get a waiver from the state police. So I went to the state police - the officer told me that aftermarket tint is illegal, and I can get a waiver only for a pre-84 car or for a medical reason. I asked him to show me the section of the vehicle code that says it's illegal.  He showed it to me and the paraghaph said that you can't have tint, if you can't see the inside of the car because of the tint. When I told him that you can in fact see the inside very well, he shut the book and said \\\"It's just illegal, and in fact we can have someone give you a ticket for it right now.\\\" Well, won't argue with that...  Since the vehicle code says it's OK as long as you can see through the tint, I'd like to keep it (I'll re-read the vehicle code in the library).  I'd also like to get some sort of paper from the police that says it's OK, so I can get the inspection, and so that I won't get in trouble for the tint later on. I also wouldn't mind registering a complaint against that officer - he really pissed me off.  So does anyone have any experience getting that sort of a paper from the police, especially in Pennsylvania? Does anyone have any experience registering a complaint against an officer? I called the station  later on today, but they basically said there is no place where I could register a complaint against an officer... And if I do decide to keep the tint and get a ticket anyway, how much of a chance do I stand to succesfully appeal the ticket in court?

I would echo that question.  I'm not trying to be    contentious.  But assuming that the Pope has universal jurisdiction    and authority, what authority do you rely upon for your decisions?    What prevents me from choosing ANY doctrine I like and saying that    Papal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time?    This is especially true, since Councils of Bishops have basically    stood by the Pope.  The ultimate question is the traditional theology of the Church.  This is the *only* thing that it is possible to resist a Pope for: his departure from the traditional doctrine of the Church.  If commands from *any* authority conflict with Tradition, the commands must be disobeyed.  My own view on this is that this conflict could only happen in a major way.  God would never allow a hair-splitting situation to develop; it would be too complex for people to figure out.  I don't view the present situation in the Church as anything extremely complicated. Run through a list of what has happened in the last 30 years in the Catholic Church, and any impartial observer will be aghast.     It appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter is    disagreements over what is tradition and Tradition, and also over    authority and discipline.    The problems stem from a general widespread ignorance of the Catholic Faith, in my opinion.  Most Catholics know about zilch about the Catholic Faith; this leaves them wide open for destruction by erring bishops.  It's basically the Reformation part II.  There is not even a question in my mind that in some respects the shards of the Catholic Church are currently being trampled upon by the Catholic hierarchy.  I could go on listing shocking things for an hour, probably.  Take the situation in Campos, Brazil, for example.  I'm reading a book on what happened there after Vatican Council II.  The bishop, Antonio de Castro-Mayer, never introduced all the changes that followed in the wake of Vatican II.  He kept the traditional Mass, the same old catechisms, etc.  He made sure the people knew their faith, the Catholic theology of obedience, what Modernism was, etc.  He innoculated the people against what was coming.  Well, one day the order came from Rome for his retirement.  It came when the Pope was sick.  Bishop de Castro-Mayer waited until the Pope recovered, then inquired whether this command was what the Pope really wanted, or something that some Liberal had commanded in his absence. The Pope confirmed the decision.  So the good bishop retired.  The injustice that followed was completely incredible.  A new bishop was installed.  He proceeded to expel most of bishop de Castro-Mayer's clergy from their churches, because they refused to celebrate the New Mass.  The new bishop would visit a parish, and celebrate a New Mass. The people would promptly walk out of the church en masse.  The bishop was *enraged* by this.  He usually resorted to enlisting the help of the secular authorities to eject the priest from the church.  The priests would just start building new churches; the people were completely behind them.  The old parishes had the New Mass, as the bishop desired -- and virtually no parishioners.  The prime motivation for all this was completely illegal, according to canon law.  No priest can be penalized in any way for saying the traditional Mass, because of legislation enacted by Pope Saint Pius V. Nor is there any obligation to say the New Mass.  During all this process, the people of Campos, not just private individuals, but including civil authorities, were constantly sending petitions and letters to Rome to do something about the new Modernist bishop.  NOTHING was ever done; no help ever arrived from Rome. Eventually 37 priests were kicked out, and about 40,000 people.     My question to the supporters of SSPX is this:    Is there ANY way that your positions with respect to church reforms   could change and be conformed to those of the Pope? (assuming that   the Pope's position does not change and that the leaders of SSPX   don't jointly make such  choice.)     If not, this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority.    If I adopt the view that \\\"I'm NOT wrong, I CAN'T be wrong, and    there's NO WAY I'll change my mind, YOU must change yours\\\", that    I've either left the Catholic Church or it has left me.  If the Pope defines certain things ex cathedra, that would be the end of the controversy.  That process is all very well understood in Catholic theology, and anyone who doesn't go along with it is an instant non-Catholic.  The problem here is that people do not appreciate what is going on in the Catholic world.  If they knew the Faith, and what our bishops are doing, they would be shocked!     We sould argue from now until the Second Coming about what the \\\"real\\\"    traditional teaching of the Church is.  If this were a simple matter    East and West would not have been separated for over 900 years.  This isn't the case in the Catholic Church.  There is a massive body of traditional teaching.  The Popes of the last 150 years are especially relevant.  There is no question at all what the traditional doctrine is.     I thought that the teaching magisterieum of the church did not allow    error in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term.`    I may be wrong here, I'm not Roman Catholic. :-)  That's heresy, more or less.  Although they have done a great job since the Reformation, the last 30 years have seen so many errors spread that it's pitiful.  Infallibility rests in the Pope, and in the Church as a whole.  In the short term, a Pope, or large sections of the Church can go astray.  In fact, that's what usually happens during a major heresy: large sections of the Church go astray.  (The Pope historically has been much more reliable.)  Everything will always come back in the long run.     What would be the effect of a Pope making an ex cathedra statement    regarding the SSPX situation?  Would it be honored?  If not, how    do you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility?    Again, I'm not trying to be contentions, I'm trying to understand.    Since I'm Orthodox, I've got no real vested interest in the outcome,    one way or the other.  Yes, it would be honored.  Infallibility is infallibility.  But what is he going to define?  That the New Mass is a better expression of the Catholic Faith than the old?  That sex education in the Catholic schools is wonderful?  That all religions are wonderful except for that professed by the Popes prior to Vatican II?     It does if the command was legitimate.  SSPX does not view the    Pope's commands as legitimate.  Why?  This is a VERY slippery slope.\",\"I want to create a single-line Text widget for entering a small amount of text.

No.  Computer speed is only partly dependent of processor/clock speed. Memory system speed play a large role as does video system speed and I/O speed.  As processor clock rates go up, the speed of the memory system becomes the greatest factor in the overall system speed.

The one most obviously applicable to cryptography (key selection) is to be able to specify the \\\"similarity\\\" of matches in the data.  For example say you make up a password/phrase of \\\"qimwe7l\\\". Of course you rightly suspect that this key itself is not in any dictionary or word list.  But how *close* is it to en entry that could be varied by some \\\"crack\\\" program to brute-force search for it?  You use agrep to find out.  Looking with argument for none, one or two errors, no matches.  Good so far.  But   agrep -3 \\\"qimwe7l\\\" bigwordandphraselist  finds that the pattern \\\"qimwe7l\\\" is too close to the pattern \\\"imsel\\\" (part of \\\"himself\\\" and a host of others), to be of any cryptographic value as a key.  An error of level two corresponds to a simple transposition of letters like \\\"teh\\\" for \\\"the\\\".  A minimally acceptable password would have to pass as *least* level 3 in order not immediately ruled-out as even a remote possibility of being a good password. (In real cryptographic use, my personal passphrases clear at *least* level 8 on my rather large [>80 meg] word and phrase lists.)   And for searching for key words in human-typed data (lots o' typos) the tool is unexcelled.  For example, For example, say I want to find out what people think about Gibson's SF book \\\"Neuromancer\\\" in the huge SF-Lover's archives. Even with an error distance specification as small as of \\\"1\\\" I will find all those people who think the title was \\\"Necromancer\\\" or other common typos.  Why miss anything?  Also, the program can look for up to 30,000 patterns IN PARALLEL at Boyer-Moore (sublinear) speeds.  Great for a NSA wannabe to look for your name, terrorists names, special Tagalog or religious words, etc. in the news or e-mail spool directories.  You can even search for ciphertext by using, say, 30,000 random three-byte combinations and eliminate all texts that don't score the X chi-square 'birthday' hits on message size Y.  You think some crypto-terrorist is try to foil you by changing the pattern on you?  No problem.  Try agrep -p NSA to find NSA, National Security Agency, NSecAg, No Such Agency, National Scrabble Association, N*S*A, etc.  You can also specify \\\"fixed\\\" areas: looking for license plate XYZ123 when you know that the letters are correct, you might say:  agrep -2 <XYZ>123 licenseplatedatabase  will find all plates starting with XYZ with up to two errors (addition, substitution, deletion) in the number area.  You can also \\\"weight\\\" the relative \\\"cost\\\" for substiutions, additions, or deletion errors.  For example, when searching DNA patterns for a particular protein combination, you might know that some kinds of damage cause the \\\"A\\\" nucelotide to drop out more than other errors... you could adjust for this bias by setting -Dc where you set the \\\"deletion cost\\\" to count as \\\"c\\\" errors.  A steganographic use (I even used \\\"agrep -2 \\\"<steg>eograp\\\" E\\\" just now to find the correct spelling!) would be to intentionally introduce errors of a certain type and magnitude into a plaintext and then later recover the orginal it via an agrep pipe.  Lots of possibilities here when only outlaws can have ciphertext...  Also with agrep's powerful extraction options it makes it easy to abstract the \\\"hits\\\" into a useful form.  For example,  agrep -d \\\"^From\\\" 'PGP;(passphrase|Zimmerman|NSA)'  says output the entire mail record, delimited by 'From' that contains 'PGP' and contains either 'passphrase', 'Zimmerman', or 'NSA'.  And agrep has been measured an order-of-magnitude faster than the second-best similarity tool publicly available.

Science has its basis in observable fact.   I'd say that what one chooses to observe and how the observation is interpreted and what significance it's given depends a great deal on the values of the observer. Science is a human activity and as such, is subject to the same potential for distortion as any other human activity. The myth that scientists are above moral influence or ethical concern, that their knowledge can be abstacted whole and pure from nature untainted by the biases of the scientist, is nonsense.  Bill  : If one is to argue for objective values (in a moral sense) then one must : first start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective. Considering : the meaning of the word \\\"objective\\\" I doubt that this will ever happen.  : So, back to the original question:  : And objective morality is.....?  This may be an unfortunate choice of words, almost self-contradictory. Objective in the sense used here means something immutable and absolute while morality describes the behavior of some group of people. The first term is all inclusive, the second is specific. The concept supposedly described may have meaning however.  If there is a God as described by the Christians (for instance), then He has existence apart from and independent of humankind; His existence is outside of our frame of reference (reality). If this being declares a thing to be so, it is -necessarily- so since He has defined Himself as omnipotent and, if His claims are to be believed, He is at least omnipotent relative to us. God is intrinsically self-defined and all reality is whatever He says it is - in an objective sense. If God determines a standard of conduct, that standard is objective. If human beings are held accountable for their conformance to that standard while permitted to ignore it, they substitute a relative morality or mode of conduct, giving the term morality a nebulous, meaningless sense that can be argued about by those pretending to misunderstand. The standard is objective and the conduct required to meet that standard is therefore objectively determined. Just because it is convenient to pretend that the term morality is infinitely malleable, doesn't mean that the objective standard itself doesn't exist. Morality has come to mean little more than a cultural norm, or the preferred conduct of \\\"decent\\\" people, making it seem subjective, but it is derived from an absolute, objective, standard. Ironically, this objective standard is in perfect accord with our true nature (according to Christianity at least), yet is condemned as being contrary to human nre, oppressive and severe.

Maddison and Hamilton were both studying existing forms of government for several years before they wrote the federalist papers. That the US system is based to a considerable degree on the UK model is pretty widely accepted. At the time there was no other major country with a representative body. The French plebicite had been suppressed for 140 years and its restoration eight years later would mark the start of the French revolution.   After the UK system the major influences were the Dutch system and of course the classical systems. Nobody seriously suggests that Rome or Greece were  models though because the political systems of both countries were acknowleged disasters. The main lesson learnt from Greece was that unless a federal state was constructed a war would be inevitable. The Greek democracies were always fighting amongst themselves which is how Rome managed to invade. Had the federal consitution been rejected the new Roman empire in the shape of Britain would quite certainly have reabsorbed much of the colonies in due course. Moreover the states would have been at each others throats as soon as the Louisiana purchase situation arose during the Napoleonic period. \",\"Since everyone else seems to be running wild with predictions, I've decided to add my own fuel to the fire: They might seem a bit normal, but there are a few (albeit, small) surprises.

The structure  of the US government does try to combat this tendency to some extent, but  fighting entropy is always a losing battle.  Most people would rather have  comfort than freedom.  The paradox is that you can't really have the former,  in the long term, unless you have the latter.  One of the reasons that I probably come across to some people as a weird  cross between a libertarian and an \\\"establishment tool\\\" is that I end up  taking an utterly pragmatic view of government.  I don't get up in arms when  the government fails to protect the interests of the people, because in my  lifetime it never has--therefore, I have no expectation that it will.    As a result, I protect my own interests rather than expecting the government  to be \\\"fair\\\".  I will use strong cryptography when I think it is needed,  whether or not it is legal at the time.  Same thing with anything else the  government would rather not see in private hands--that's their problem.   What's important to me is using the right tool for the job.  If it's legal,  so much the better.  If it is not, but does not violate my (very strong)  sense of personal ethics, I will use it anyway as long I think it is worth  it.  Expecting the government to actually protect the interests of its  citizens, except by accident, is utter folly.  Even Jefferson, one of the  major architects of the American system of government, figured that in a  couple hundred years it would become so corrupt and self-serving that it  would be time dismantle it and try again, by revolution if necessary.  I  agree, and while I don't go around trying to spark one, I'll certainly  participate if it happens when I'm around.  There is a reason I am such a  strong supporter of individual rights while being so cynical about politics.   I've already written off politics.  And yes, this may get me in trouble some day.  If so, so be it.

Well, think again.  Sometimes the only real support out there is what Apple computer users can give to each other.  For another example, read on:  In the March 15th issue of _MacWeek_, Ric Ford described a two-year effort by Liam Breck to document and bring to Apple's attention a problem with certain defective mice.  At random, the switches on these mice \\\"stick\\\" in the down position until clicked a second time, apparently regardless of the machine they are used with or the system software involved. Most of the reported problem mice were manufactured in Malaysia and have an FCC ID of BCGA65431. You'll recognize this \\\"sticky button\\\" symptom immediately if you have such a mouse: the problem is intermittent, but it's not subtle.  Liam Breck recently gave up trying to document this problem, and instead  suggested that people contact Apple's Customer Assistance Center directly (_MacWeek_ 4/5/93 p. 64). When I called Apple on March 23rd and described my defective mouse, I was eventually given a case number (F83Y) and told Apple would replace this mouse even though it is a few months out of warranty.  After waiting for three weeks, I called back today wondering where my new mouse was. This time, I was told that Apple had decided the serial number on my mouse (MB13831FC25) is not within the (undisclosed) range Apple is willing to replace, and there is nothing I can do about it.  Nothing, that is, unless enough people complain about this problem to make it worth Apple's while to fix or replace the entire lot of defective mice. Please, if you have one of these mice, I NEED YOUR HELP! Don't assume you know what causes the problem (there are _lots_ of theories) and start hacking around inside your hundred-dollar mouse. Instead, let Apple do it. Please take five minutes to CALL APPLE RIGHT NOW at:                    United States      1-800-776-2333                   Canada             800-665-2775                   UK and Europe      33-1-49-01-49-01                   Australia          61-2-452-8000                   Japan and Pacific  81-3-5411-8500  If the number isn't toll-free, call collect.

Remarks by President Clinton to NCAA Division I Champion Hockey Team April 19; Q&A Following  To: National Desk  Contact: White House Office of the Press Secretary, 202-456-2100     WASHINGTON, April 19 -- Following is a transcript of remarks by President Clinton to the University of Maine \\\"Black Bears\\\" NCAA Division I hockey champions:                             The Rose Garden   9:58 A.M. EDT       THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning ladies and gentlemen.  It's an honor for me to welcome the University of Maine Black Bears, the winner of the NCAA Division I hockey national championship to the Rose Garden and the White House.  I understand from Senator Mitchell that this is the first team from the University of Maine every to win a national championship.  And we're glad to have them here.       I'm inspired not only by how the team pulled together to win the championship, but how the entire state pulled together to cheer them onto victory.       Coming from a state that is also relatively small in size, but also filled with pride and tradition and community, I can understand how the people of Maine must feel about the Black Bears. In our state people are still talking about the time we won the Orange Bowl over the number one ranked football team, and that was back in 1978.  I'm sure that 15 years from now, the people of Maine will as proud of this team as they are today.       You know, in my state football is a slightly more popular sport than hockey.  We don't have a lot of ice.  (Laughter.) But after spending three months getting banged around in this town, I can understand a little more about hockey than I did before I came here.  Hockey is a tough game.  It's a hard-hitting sport.  It does have one virtue though, there's a penalty for delay of game.  I wish we had that rule in the Senate.  (Laughter.)       In government as in hockey, leadership is important.  In the United States Senate, our team has a great captain, the Majority Leader and the senior Senator from Maine, George Mitchell; junior Senator -- Cohen looks so young, I can't imagine.  (Laughter.)  I'm actually bitter about Senator Cohen because he looks so much younger than me.       On your hockey team, the captain Jim Montgomery has done a great job.  He scored the winning goal late in the championship game, leading you to a come-from-behind victory -- something else I know a little bit about.       Sport brings out the best in individuals and in teams and in communities.  I share the pride that Senator Mitchell and Senator Cohen and Congressman Andrews and all the people of Maine must feel for the Black Bears who have shown us all how to play as a team, how to bring out the best in one another, and how to come from behind.       I think it's important, as I ask young people from around America who have achieved outstanding things in working together, to come here to the White House to be recognized and appreciated by their country, to remember that those kinds of values and those kinds of virtues need to be ingrained in all of us for all of our lives.       We now have another role model, and I'm glad to have them here today.  (Applause.)       (The President is presented with team jersey.) (Applause.)       THE PRESIDENT:  That's great.  I love it.  It's beautiful. (Applause.)       (The President is presented with an autographed stick.)       THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  That's great.  (Applause.)                               * * * * * *       Q  Mr. President, did you authorize the move on Waco this morning, sir?       THE PRESIDENT:  I was aware of it.  I think the Attorney General made the decision.  And I think I should refer all questions to her and to the FBI.       Q  Did you have any instructions for her as to how it should be executed?       THE PRESIDENT:  No, they made the tactical decisions. That was their judgment, the FBI.       Q  Is this a raid?       THE PRESIDENT:  And I will -- I want to refer you to -- talk to the Attorney General and the FBI.  I knew it was going to be done, but the decisions were entirely theirs, all the tactical decisions.       Q  What did you and Senator Mitchell talk about this morning?       Q  Any chance for that stimulus package?       THE PRESIDENT:  Senator Mitchell ought to pay my quarter.  (Laughter.)  I was in there -- (laughter).       SENATOR MITCHELL:  You have to pay that quarter.       THE PRESIDENT:  I was ready.  (Laughter.)  Senator Mitchell, he's worth a quarter any day.       Q  Any chance for your bill, sir?       THE PRESIDENT:  We talked about what was going to happen this week in the Senate and about what other meetings we're going to have for the rest of the week.  We only had about five minutes to talk.  And we agreed we'd get back together later, around noon, and talk some more.       Q  Senator Dole said over the weekend that your compromise is no compromise.       THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I know he did, but, look, Senator Dole and a lot of the other Republicans now in the Senate voted for the same kind of thing for Ronald Reagan in 1983; and our research indicates that a majority of them over time voted for a total of 28 emergency spending measures totalling over $100 billion when Reagan and Bush were President, in those administrations.  And many of those purposes were not nearly as worthy as putting the American people back to work.  I don't want to go back and revisit every one, but you   can do it.  You can look at the research there.  So this position they're taking is not credible.  We have a very tough five-year deficit reduction plan.  All these costs are covered during that time and then some.  And the very people that are saying this has all got to be paid for don't have much of a history on which to base their position.  They've got 12 years of vote for stimulus measures of this kind that had very little to with putting the American people back to work.  So I think we've got a chance to work it out, and I'm hopeful. We'll see what happens today and tomorrow.  I'm feeling pretty good about it.       THE PRESS:  Thank you                                   END       10:10 A.M.

The moderator of the firearms-politics mailing list, Karl Kleinpaste, has agreed to set up an anonymous ftp archive directory for RKBA related information.  This directory can be used for things like articles by Kates, Wright, Tonso, Levinson, Supreme Court Decisions, the RIA vs US decision, copies of legislation, and so on.  It's not meant to be for the discussions that normally appear here.  So, in the future if you're looking for something check there first and then ask here.  Instructions:  Short version for techies:  The site is godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu.  Place contributions into the directory /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba.  The ftp commands get, put, mget, or mput should work.  Give the command \\\"type binary\\\" to be sure files are transferred correctly.  Your files will be moved to the rkba directory.  To get a file use the commands get or mget.  I will maintain an index which you should get first to check if the file you want to read or write already is archived.  Long version for non-techies:  In order for you to use this archive your computer must be on the Internet.  To connect to the archive site run the command:   ftp godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu  If that doesn't work you cannot use this archive.  If the ftp command is successful you'll get this prompt asking you for a login:  Name (godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu:lvc):  Instead of lvc your initials will appear.  Answer this prompt with:   ftp  Next you'll get this prompt asking your for your e-mail address:   Guest login ok, send e-mail address as password:  I would enter:   l.v.cipriani@att.com  You'll enter your own e-mail address.  You'll get these lines or similar as output:   Remote system is UNIX.  Using binary mode to transfer files.  Next, the command prompt is printed:   ftp>   If you do not get the line \\\"Using binary mode to transfer files.\\\" Run the command:   type binary  Now you're logged in to the archive machine.  There are many directories on this machine  but the two you are concerned with are   /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba and  /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/incoming  There are subdirectories to the rkba directory, those are discussed below.  When you login to the system your directory is /usr0/anon.  To retreive files change your current directory to the rkba directory with the command:   cd /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba or  cd pub/firearms/politics/rkba  To submit files change your directory to the incoming directory with the command:   cd /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/incoming or  cd pub/firearms/politics/incoming  Once you do this you'll get another ftp> prompt asking you to enter another command.  To find the names of the existing files in the directory you are in run the command:   ls -l  This will produce something like:  total 6021 -r--r--r--  1 karl          6932 Jun 16  1992 DMN_Gratia_CCP -r--r--r--  1 karl         69149 Apr  5 19:20 INDEX -r--r--r--  1 karl         18965 Jun 16  1992 Knox_AW_lies -r--r--r--  1 karl         10930 Apr 30  1992 S361 -r--r--r--  1 karl          8958 Jun 16  1992 WSJ_Crimestrike -r--r--r--  1 karl          2649 Jan 13 18:33 academia-bias -r--r--r--  1 karl           935 Mar 22 22:38 academics -r--r--r--  1 karl         36079 Aug  4  1992 aclu ... and so on ...  Each line corresponds to one file.  Reading right to left, the fields are the file name, the last modification date of the file, the size of the file in bytes, and some permission fields which you do not need to be concerned with.  To get a file run the command \\\"get\\\" followed by the name of the file you want, for example:   get INDEX or  get noduty  After the file is transfered to your machine a message like this:   Transfer complete.  19580 bytes received in 5 seconds (4 Kbytes/s)  You can repeat the get command for every file you want to retreive. You can use the mget command to retreive multiple files.  If the file you want is in a subdirectory, for example, congress/103rd/HR1025 you should change your directory to the appropriate subdirectory first and then retrieve it:   cd congress/103rd  get HR1025  Once you're finished you can log off with the command:   quit  If you have a file you want to contribute the procedure is a little different.  First of all you should find out if the file already exists, so get a copy of the index file with the procedure above and look it over to make sure you wouldn't repeat an entry.  The index will have a description of each of the files in the rkba directory.  For example:  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- File: whitemanslaw  White Man's Law by William R. Tonso, from the December 1985 Reason magazine ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Once you've determined you won't be duplicating an entry, login and change to the incoming directory command (see above).  Once you are in the incoming directory use the command:   put file_name  In this case:   put whitemanslaw  Again there'll be a \\\"Transfer complete, so many bytes transfered in so many seconds\\\" message.  Now your file is on the archive machine.  Another thing to watch out for is duplicate file /names/.  Be sure there isn't a file in the incoming directory that is called the same as the file you want to write.  If you use the same name you'll overwrite the previous file [or you'll get an error message].  Your file may have to be renamed if there is a conflict with a file by the same name in the rkba directory.  Once your file is in the incoming directory send me an entry for the INDEX file and I will add it to the file.  If you cannot use anonymous ftp and would still like to contribute a file email the file to me and I'll take care of the rest.  If you submit a file and do not notify me it may be removed, so be sure to let me know first.  If you have any questions feel free to ask me. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- --  Larry Cipriani -- l.v.cipriani@att.com     \",\" Every bit as fast as a dirtbike, in the right terrain.

(Cross-posted to alt.psychology.personality since some personality typing will be discussed at the beginning - Note: I've set all followups to sci.med since most of my comments are more sci.med oriented and I'm sure most of the replies, if any, will be med-related.)     They are just responding in their natural way:  Hyper-Choleric Syndrome (HCS). Oops, that is not a recognized \\\"illness\\\" in the psychological community, better not say that since it therefore must not, and never will, exist.  :^)  Actually, it is fascinating that a disproportionate number of physicians will type out as NT (for those not familiar with the Myers-Briggs system, just e-mail me and I'll send a summary file to you).  In the general population, NT's comprise only about 12% of the population, but among physicians it is much much higher (I don't know the exact percentage - any help here a.p.p.er's?)  One driving characteristic of an NT, especially an NTJ, is their obvious choleric behavior (driver, type A, etc.) - the extreme emotional need to control, to lead, and/or to be the best or the most competent.  If they are also extroverted, they are best described as \\\"Field Marshalls\\\".  This trait is very valuable and essential in our society - we need people who want to lead, to strive to overcome the elements, to seek and thirst for knowledge, to raise the level of competency, etc.  The great successes in science and technology are in large part due to the vision (an N trait) and scientifically- minded approach (T trait) of the NT personality (of course, the other types and temperaments have their own positive contributions as well).  However, when the NT person has self-image challenges, the \\\"dark-side\\\" of this personality type usually comes out, which should be obvious to all.  A physician who is a strong NT and who has not learned to temper their temperament will be extremely business-like (lack of empathy or feeling), and is very compelled to have total control over their patient (the patient must be obedient to their diagnosis and prescription without question).  I've known many M.D.'s of this temperament and suffice to say I don't oblige them with a followup visit, no matter how competent I think they are (and they usually are very competent from a knowledge viewpoint since that is an extreme drive of theirs - to know the most, to know it all).  Maybe we need more NF doctor's.  :^)  Enough on this subject - let's move on to candida bloom.    You've helped me already by your post.  Of course, I believe that I have been misdiagnosed on the net as suffering from 'anal retentivitis', but being the phlegmatic I am, maybe I was just a little too harsh on a few people myself in past posts.  Let's all try to raise the level of this discussion above the level of anal effluent.    In my well-described situation (in prior posts), I definitely was immune stressed.  Blood tests showed my vitamin A levels were very low.  My sinuses were a mess - no doubt the mucosal lining and the cilia were heavily damaged. I also was on antibiotics 15 times in 4 years!  In the end, even two weeks of Ceftin did not work and I had confirmed diagnoses of a chronic bacterial infection of the sinuses via cat-scans, mucus color (won't get into the details), and other symptoms.  Three very traditional ENT's made this diagnosis (I did not have any cultures done, however, because of the difficulty of doing this right and because my other symptoms clearly showed a bacterial infection).  Enough of this background (provided to help you understand where I was when I make comments about my Sporanox anti-fungal therapy below).   The first question I have is this.  Can fungus penetrate a little way into poor mucus membrane tissue, maybe via hyphae, thus causing symptoms, without being considered 'systemic' in the classic sense?  It is sort of an inbetween infection.    I was concerned, too, because of the toxicity of vitamin A.  My doctor, after my blood tests, put me on 75,000 IU of vitamin A for one week only, then dropped it down to 25,000 IU for the next couple of weeks.  I also received zinc and other supplementation, since all of these interrelate in fairly complex ways as my doctor explained (he's one of those 'evil' orthomolecular specialists).  I had a blood test three weeks later and vitamin A was normal, he then stopped me on all vitamin A (except for some in a multi-vitamin) supplement), and made sure that I maintain a 50,000 IU/day of beta carotene. Call me carrot face.  :^)  Hopefully, Elaine's doctor will take a similar, careful approach and to all supplements.  I'm even reevaluating some supplements I'm taking, for example, niacin in fairly large dosages, 1 gram/day, which Steve Dyer had good information about on sci.med.nutrition.  If niacin only has second-order improvement in symptomatic relief of my sinus allergies, then it probably is not worth taking such a large dose long-term and risking liver damage.    Though I do now believe, based on my successful therapy with Sporanox, that I definitely had some excessive growth of fungus (unknown species) in my sinuses, I still want to ask the question:  have there been any studies that demonstrate candida \\\"blooms\\\" in the sinuses with associated sinus irritation (sinusitis/rhinitis)?  (My sinus irritation reduced significantly after one week of Sporanox and no other new treatments were implemented during this time - I did not have any noticeable GI track problems before starting on Sporanox, but some for a few days after which then went away - considered normal).  BTW, my doctor dug out one of his medical reference books (sorry, can't remember which one), and found an obscure comment dating back into the 1950's which stated that people can develop contained (non-lethal or non-serious) aspergillis infestations (aspergiliosis) of the sinuses leading to sinus inflammation symptoms.  I'll have to dig out that reference again since it is relevant to this discussion.    My doctor tested me (I believe a RAST or RAST similar test) for allergic response to specificially Candida albicans, and I showed a strong positive. Another question, would everybody show the same strong positive so this test is essentially useless?  And, assuming it is true that Candida can grow part-way into the mucus membrane tissue, and the concentration exceeds a  threshold amount, could not a person who tests as having an allergy to Candida definitely develop allergic symptoms, such as mucus membrane irritation due to the body's allergic response?  As I said in an earlier post, one does not need to be a rocket scientist, or have a M.D. degree or a  Ph.D. in biochemistry to see the plausibility of this hypothesis.  BTW, and I'll repost this again.  Dr. Ivker, in his book, \\\"Sinus Survival\\\", has routinely given, before anything else, Nizoral (a pre-Sporanox systemic anti-fungal, not as safe and not as good as Sporanox) to his new chronic sinusitis patients IF they have been on antibiotics four or more times in the last two years.  He claims that out of 2000 or so patients, well over 90% notice some relief of sinus inflammation and other symptoms, but it doesn't cure it by any means, implying the so-called yeast/fungus infection is not the primary cause, but a later complication.  He's also found that nystatin, whether taken internally, or put into a sinus spray, does not help.  This implies (of course assuming that excessive yeast/fungus bloom is aggravating the sinus inflammation) that the yeast/fungus has grown partway into the tissue since nystatin will not kill yeast/fungus other than by direct contact - it is not absorbed into the blood stream.  Again, I admit, lots of 'ifs', and 'implies', which doesn't please the hard-core NT who has to have the double-blind study or it's a non-issue, but one has to start with some plausible hypothesis/explanation, a strawman, if you will.    This brings up an interesting observation used by those who will deny and reject any and all aspects of the 'yeast hypothesis' until the appropriate studies are done.  And that is if you can't observe or culture the yeast \\\"bloom\\\" in the gut or sinus, then there's no way to diagnose or even recognize the disease.  And I know they realize that it is virtually impossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that cannot be easily observed since candida is everywhere in the body.  It's a real Catch-22.  Another Catch-22:  Those who totally reject the 'yeast hypothesis' say that no studies have been done (actually studies have been done, but if it's not up to a certain standard then it is, from their perspective, a non-study which should not even be considered).  I agree that the appropriate studies should be done, and that will take big $ to do it right.  However, in order to convince the funding agencies in these austere times to open their wallets, you literally have to give them evidence, and the only acceptable evidence to compete with other proposals is paradoxically to do almost the exact study needed funding.  That is, you have to do 90% of the study before you even get funding (as a scientist at a National Lab, I'm very aware of this for the smaller funded projects).  I'm afraid that even if Dr. Ivker and 100 other doctors got together, pooled their practice's case histories and anecdotes into a compelling picture, and approach the funding agencies, they would get nowhere, even if they were able to publish their statistical results.  It is obvious from the comments by some of the doctors here is that they have *decided* excessive yeast colonization in the gut or sinuses leading to noticeable non-lethal symptoms does not exist, and is not even a tenable hypothesis, so any amount of case histories or compiled anecdotal evidence to the contrary will never change their mind, and not only that, they would also oppose the needed studies because in their minds it's a done issue -  excessive yeast growth leading to diffuse allergic symptoms does not, will not, and cannot exist.  Period.  Kind of tough to dialog with those who hold such a viewpoint.  Kind of reminds me of Lister...    Aren't there also other nutrients necessary to the proper working of the sinus mucus membranes and cilia?    Again, the evidence from mycological studies indicate that many yeast/fungus species can grow hyphae (\\\"roots\\\") into deep tissue, similar to mold growing in bread.  You can continue to kill the surface, such as nystatin does, but you can't kill that which is deeper in the tissue without using a systemic anti-fungal such as itraconazole (Sporanox) or some of the older ones such as Nizoral which are more toxic and not as effective.  This is why, as has been pointed out by recent studies (sent to me by a doctor I've been in e-mail contact with - thanks), that nystatin is not effective in the long- term treatment of GI tract \\\"candidiasis\\\".  It's like trying to weed a garden by cutting off what's above the ground but leaving the roots ready to come out again once you walk away.  The $60000 question is whether a contained candida \\\"bloom\\\" can partially grow into tissue through the mucus membranes, causing some types of symptoms in susceptible people (e.g., allergy), without becoming \\\"systemic\\\" in the classical sense of the word - something in between strictly an excessive bloom not causing any problems and the full-blown systemic infection that is potentially lethal.    Also, if one is an 'anal retentive', like I've been diagnosed in a prior post, that can also provide more sites for excessive candida growth.  ;^)    As I've said in private e-mail, there are flaws in our current medical system that make it difficult or even impossible for a physician to attempt alternative therapies AFTER the approved/proven/accepted therapies don't work. For example, I went to three ENT's, who all said that I will just have to live with my acute/chronic sinusitis after the ab's failed (they did mention surgery to open up the ostia, but my ostia weren't plugged and it would not get to the root cause of my condition).  After three months of aggressive and fairly non-standard therapy (Sporanox, body nutrient level monitoring and equalization, vitamin C, lentinen, echinacea, etc.), my health has vastly improved to where I was two years ago, before my health greatly deteriorated. Of course, skeptics would say that maybe if I did nothing I would have improved anyway, but that view is stretching things quite far because of the experience of the three ENT's I saw who said that I'd just have to \\\"live with it\\\".  I'm confident I will reach what one could call a total \\\"cure\\\".  The anti-fungal program I undertook was one necessary step in that direction because of my overuse of ab's for the last four years.  (Note:  for those having sinus problems, may I suggest the book by Dr. Ivker I mention above. Be sure to get the revised edition.)    Dr. Ivker started off having chronic and severe sinus problems, and his visits to several ENT's totally floored him when they said \\\"you'll just have to live with it\\\".  He spent several years trying everything - standard and non-standard, until he was essentially cured of chronic sinusitis.  He now shares his approach in his book and I can honestly say that I am on the road to recovery following some parts of it.  His one recommendation to take a systemic anti-fungal at the beginning of treatment IF you have a history of anti-biotic overuse has been proven to him time and time again in his own practice.  I'm sure if I commented to him of the hard-core beliefs of the anti- \\\"yeast hypothesis\\\" posters that he would have definite things to say, such as, \\\"it's worked wonders for me in almost two thousand cases\\\", to put it mildly. I also would not be surprised if he would say that they are the ones violating their moral obligations to help the patient.  Maybe those doctors who are reading this who have a practice and are confronted by a patient having symptoms that could be due to the \\\"hypothetical yeast overgrowth\\\" (e.g., they fit some of the profiles the pro-yeast people have identified), should consider anti-fungal therapy IF all other avenues have been exhausted.  Remember, theory and practice are two different things - you cannot have one without the other, they are synergistic.  If a doctor does something non-standard yet produces noticeable symptomatic relief in over a thousand of his patients, shouldn't you at least sit up and take notice? Maybe you ought to trust what he says and begin hypothesizing why it works instead of why it shouldn't work.  I'm afraid a lot of doctors have become so enamored with \\\"scientific correctness\\\" that they are ignoring the patients they have sworn to help.  You have to do both;  both have to be balanced, which we don't see from some of the posters to this group.  There comes a point when you just have to use a little common sense, and maybe an empirical approach (such as trying a good systemic anti-fungal such as Sporanox) after having exhausted all the other avenues.  I was one of those who the traditional medical establishment was not able to help, so I did the natural thing:  I went to a couple of doctor's who are (somewhat) outside this establishment, and as a result I have found significant relief.  Would it not be better if the traditional medical establishment can set up some kind of mechanism where any doctor, without fear of being sued or having his license pulled, can try experimental and unproven (beyond a doubt) therapies for his/her patients that finally reach the point where all the accepted therapies are ineffective?  I'd like to hear a doctor tell me: \\\"well, I've tried all the therapies that are approved and accepted in this country, and since they clearly don't work for you, I now have the authority to use experimental, unproven techniques that seem to have helped others.  I can't promise anything, and there are some risks.  You will have to sign something saying you understand the experimental and possibly risky nature of these unproven therapies, and I'll have to register your case at the State Board.\\\"  Anyway, if my ENT had suggested this to me, I would've jumped on this pronto instead of going to one of those doctors who, for either altruistic reasons, or for greed, is practicing these alternative therapies with much risk to him/her (risk meaning losing their license) and possibly to the patient.  Such a mechanism would keep control in the more mainstream medicine, and also provide valuable data that would essentially be free.  It also would be morally and ethically better than the current system by showing the compassion of the medical community to the patient - that it's doing everything it can within reason to help the patient.  It is the lack of such a mechanism that is leading large numbers of people to try alternative therapies, some of which seem to work (like my case), and others of which will never work at all (true quackery).

It seems from the following that the CPSR is atleats starting to question this bogosity:      ---------------------------------------------------------------- April 16, 1993 Washington, DC                 COMPUTER PROFESSIONALS CALL FOR PUBLIC            DEBATE ON NEW GOVERNMENT ENCRYPTION INITIATIVE          Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR) today called for the public disclosure of technical data underlying the government's newly-announced \\\"Public Encryption Management\\\" initiative.  The new cryptography scheme was announced today by the White House and the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), which will implement the technical specifications of the plan.  A NIST spokesman acknowledged that the National Security Agency (NSA), the super- secret military intelligence agency, had actually developed the encryption technology around which the new initiative is built.          According to NIST, the technical specifications and the Presidential directive establishing the plan are classified.  To open the initiative to public review and debate, CPSR today filed a series of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests with key agencies, including NSA, NIST, the National Security Council and the FBI for information relating to the encryption plan.  The CPSR requests are in keeping with the spirit of the Computer Security Act, which Congress passed in 1987 in order to open the development of non-military computer security standards to public scrutiny and to limit NSA's role in the creation of such standards.          CPSR previously has questioned the role of NSA in developing the so-called \\\"digital signature standard\\\" (DSS), a communications authentication technology that NIST proposed for government-wide use in 1991.  After CPSR sued NIST in a FOIA lawsuit last year, the civilian agency disclosed for the first time that NSA had, in fact, developed that security standard. NSA is due to file papers in federal court next week justifying the classification of records concerning its creation of the DSS.          David Sobel, CPSR Legal Counsel, called the administration's apparent commitment to the privacy of electronic communications, as reflected in today's official statement,  \\\"a step in the right direction.\\\"  But he questioned the propriety of NSA's role in the process and the apparent secrecy that has thus far shielded the development process from public scrutiny.  \\\"At a time when we are moving towards the development of a new information infrastructure, it is vital that standards designed to protect personal privacy be established openly and with full public participation.  It is not appropriate for NSA -- an agency with a long tradition of secrecy and opposition to effective civilian cryptography -- to play a leading role in the development process.\\\"          CPSR is a national public-interest alliance of computer industry professionals dedicated to examining the impact of technology on society.

Large companies in the voice/data comm business are out, because they all have contracts with the gov which would be used to pressure them.  If we, as professionals in crypto organizations, EFF, etc. were to put our collective minds and interests toward establishing a crypto standard for transmission, and getting our companies to implement it, we might avoid government control.  Otherwise, I think it will happen to us by default.  Gov isn't probably strong enough or foolish enough to prevent strong crypt.  They are strong enough, and we may be foolish enough, to push through the Clipper Chip.  Is RSA independt of the gov enough to spearhead this?  I, for one, would *gladly* pay royalties via purchasing secure phones.  If not this, we should provide an algorithm which can be implemented in either SW or HW and publish it, then push to make it the defacto standard in the way that PGP and RIPEM are becoming such.

Regarding this passage, we need to remember that this is a letter to a church  (at Laodicea), people who are Of the Body of Christ. (Rev.3:14-16)  He talks  about their works.  A translation could say that he says their lack of  concern makes him sick (to the point of throwing up).     Right, saving is by faith alone, except that faith does not come alone, if  you catch the two meanings.

The arrogance being attacked is that we \\\"think we are the only ones who know what the absolutes are\\\".  In short, many evangelicals claim that they are infallible on the matter of religious texts.  In particular, the problem is one of epistemology.  As a shorthand, you can think of epistemology as \\\"how do you know?\\\"  That question, it turns out, is a very troubling one.  The problem with `absolute certainty' is that, at the bottom, at least some of the thinking goes on inside your own head.  Unless you can be certain that everything which happens in your head is infallible, the reasoning you did to discover a source of truth is in question.  And that means you do NOT have absolute justification for your source of authority -- which means you do NOT have absolute certainty.   Let's take the specific example of Biblical Inerrancy, and a fictional Inerrantist named Zeke.  (The following arguments applies to the idea of Papal Infallibility, too.)  Zeke has, we presume, spent some time studying the Bible, and history, and several other topics.  He has concluded, based on all these studies (and possibly some religious experiences) that the Bible is a source of Absolute Truth.  He may be correct; but even if he is, he cannot be certain that he is correct. His conclusion depends on how well he studied history -- he may have made mistakes, and the references he used may have contained mistakes.  His conclusion depends on how well he studied the Bible -- he may have made mistakes.  His conclusion depends on his own reasoning -- and he may have made mistakes.  (Noticing a common thread yet?  8-)  Everything about his study of the world that he did -- everything that happened in his own head -- is limited by his own thinking.  No matter what he does to try and cover his mistakes, he can never be certain of his own infallibility.  As long as ANY PART of the belief is based on his own reasoning, that belief cannot be considered \\\"absolutely certain\\\".  Zeke believes that he has found a source of absolute truth -- but that belief is only as good as the quality of the search he made for it.  Unless he can say that his own reasoning is flawless, his conclusions are in doubt.  Any belief that you hold about absolute sources of truth depends in part on your own thinking -- there is no way out of the loop.  Only an infallible thinker can have absolute certainty in all his beliefs.   This is easy to demonstrate.  Let's go back to our shorthand method of doing epistemology: \\\"how do you know?\\\"  Imagine a hypothetical discussion:   A: The Bible is a source of absolute truth.   B: How do you know?   A: I studied history and the Bible and religious writings and church     teachings and came to this conclusion.   B: How do you know you studied history correctly?   A: Well, I double-checked everything.   B: How do you know you double-checked correctly?   A: Well, I compared my answers with some smart people and we agreed.   B: Just because some smart guy believes something that doesn't mean it is     true.  How do you know THEY studied it correctly?   A: ...  And, as you see, B will eventually get A to the point where he has to say \\\"I can't prove that there are no mistakes\\\" -- and as long as you may have made a mistake, then you cannot be ABSOLUTELY certain.  There is no way out of the loop.   This is where the \\\"arrogance of Christians\\\" arises: many people believe that their own personal research can give them absolute certainty about the doctrines of Christianity -- they are implicitly claiming that they are infallible, and that there is no possibility of mistake.  Claiming that you CANNOT have made a mistake, and that your thinking has led you to a flawless conclusion, is pretty arrogant.   *  People who want to see this argument explained in great detail should try to find _The Infallibility of the Church_, by George Salmon.  He is attacking the idea that the Pope can be knowably infallible (and he does so very well), but the general argument applies equally well to the idea that the Bible is knowably Inerrant. \",\"Does anyone have any experience using XRunner, CAPBAK/X, or PreVueX as an automated test tool for X?

[1]  Born 1964 Secretary-Typist Azsantekmontazh Trust Sumgait Construction and Installation Administration Secretary of the SMU Komsomol Organization  Resident at Building 17/33B, Apartment 15 Microdistrict No. 3 Sumgait [Azerbaijan]   On the 27th my sister Marina and I went to the movies the seven o'clock show, at the theater that is across from the City Party Committee, about 50 yards  away. The SK theater. They were showing an Argentinian film, \\\"The Abyss.\\\"  Before the film we noticed about 60 to 70 people standing near the podium at  the City Party Committee, but they were silent, there's no conversation  whatsoever, and we couldn't figure out what was going on. That is, we knew it  was about Karabagh, but what it was exactly, what they were talking about, if  someone gave a speech or not, we didn't know. We bought our tickets. There  were 30 or 40 people in the theater. This was a very small number for that  large movie theater. The film started. About 30 minutes later they stopped the film. A crowd burst in. About 60 people. They came up onto the stage. Well  mostly they were young people, from 16 to 23 years old. They demanded that an  Armenian woman come up onto the stage. They used foul language and said that  they were going to show what Azerbaijanis were capable of, what they could do  to Armenian girls. I thought that's what they meant because they had demanded  a girl specifically. Marina and I were sitting together. I told her to move  over, there were some Russian girls sitting nearby. So that if someone  recognized me or if something happened, they would take me, and not Marina.  It got quiet, 2 or 3 girls jumped up to run out, but the door was closed--it's only opened at the end of the   show--and they returned to their seats.  Everyone in the theater was looking at one another, Russians, Azerbaijanis,  people of various nationalities. But no one reacted at all, no one in the  auditorium made a sound. They were silent, looking at one another, and  gradually started to leave. Some guy, a really fat one, says, \\\"OK, we've  scared them enough, let's leave.\\\" They leave slowly, pompously. It seemed to  me that those people were not themselves. Either they had smoked a bunch of  \\\"anasha\\\", or had taken something else, because they all looked beastly, like  they were ready to tear anyone apart. Then it was all over, as though nothing  had happened at all. The film started up again, it was one of those cheerful  films which should have only brought pleasure, made you happy to be alive. We  could barely sit to the end. So it had started at seven it was over by nine,  and it was dark . . .  Marina and I were walking home, Lenin Street, that's the center of town. Lenin Street was packed, just packed with young people. They were shouting,  something about Karabagh and something about Armenians. We weren't especially  listening, because the way we were feeling we didn't know if we were going to  make it home or not, and just what had happened anyway? Public transportation  wasn't running. Incidentally, when we came out of the theater we saw police,  policemen standing there. The director of the movie theater was looking at the doors, because when they were leaving they had broken the glass, the doors  there are basically all glass. Everything was broken. He stood there grief- stricken, but looking as though nothing really big had happened, like some  naughty boys had just broken them quite by accident, with a slingshot. Well,  since he looked more or less calm I decided that, nothing all that super  serious had happened. We went out very slowly; we wanted to catch a bus, we  live literally one stop away. We didn't want to go on foot, not because it was dark, but because something might happen. We flagged down a cab, but the  driver didn't want to take us. We told him we live near the bus station, and  he said he'd take us to the bus station and not a yard farther. I said, well,  OK . . .  So we got into the cab and managed to get there. Something incredible was  happening at the bus station. There was a traffic jam. Public transportation  was at a standstill and everyone was shouting \\\"Ka-ra-bagh,\\\" they're not going  to give up Karabagh. I go home and tell my family what's going on, and there's immediate panic in the house. Mamma says, what should we do? Like the end had  come, they were going to come, kill us, that's it . . . Somehow we managed to  cheer ourselves up: Nothing that bad could happen. Where are we living anyway, just what kind of social order do we have? Somehow we manage to calm Mamma  down. And we went to bed. But no one could sleep. Everyone made as though  nothing had happened.  That was on Saturday. In short, the day went by. We didn't go anywhere and  didn't call our relatives. No one did anything. Because . . . life goes on. That day I realized something was approaching, but what exactly, I couldn't guess.  On the 28th everything was like it was supposed to be, we lived like we always had. There were five of us at home: Mamma, Papa and us, three sisters: Lyuda,  Marina, and I. My sister Lyuda was in Yerevan at the time. We sat at home and  no one went out. Later we learned that a demonstration had started that  morning. It all started . . . They were smashing up stores. We were sitting at home and didn't know anything about it. Then a girlfriend of mine, Lyuda  Zimogliad, came by at around three o'clock I think. We worked together, we did our apprenticeships together, she's a Russian girl. She said that something awful was happening in town. I asked, \\\"Don't they want Armenians? Well what  are they after, if they're already in that state?\\\" She says, no, nothing like  that, it's just a demonstration, but it's awful to watch it. Somehow, it feels like a war has broken out. Public transportation has been stopped . . . The  cabs, the buses, well it's just a nightmare.  Then Papa decides to go to the drugstore, my mother was having allergy  problems at the time . . . He left the house and our neighbor, Aunt Vera, asked him, \\\"Where are you going? Stop! There are such terrible things going on in the courtyard; aren't you afraid to go out?\\\" Papa didn't know what she was talking about. She simply pushed him back into the entryway. He came home  and told Mamma. Mamma said, \\\"Well, if Aunt Vera was talking like that it means that something is really going on.\\\" But we didn't go see her, she's a Russian, she lives across from us. I had to see my friend out. Around five o'clock I  tell Lyuda, \\\"Ok, look, it's time for you to go, it's late already, I'll see  you out.\\\" Mamma says, \\\"You don't need to go, it's too late already, you can  see what the situation in town is.\\\" So we decided to stay home. Dinner was  ready. Mamma says, \\\"Let her eat with us, then she can go.\\\" We sat down at the  table. But no one was hungry, no one was in the mood, we just put everything  out on the table to calm ourselves down, and make it appear that we're eating. We turned on the television, and the show \\\"In Fairy-Tale Land\\\" was coming on.  We cleared the table.  We hear some noise out in the courtyard. I go out on the balcony, but I can't  see what's going on, because the noise is coming from the direction of the bus station, and there is a 9-story building in the way. There is mob of people  . . . I can't figure out what's happening. They're shouting something, looking somewhere, I can't make out what is going on. I go down to a neighbor, she's  an Azerbaijani; we've been friends of her family for about 25 years. I go down to look from their place. I see people shouting, looking at the 5-and 9-story  buildings near the bus station. Just then soldiers set upon them, about 20  people, with clubs. The mob runs off in different directions. I even see  several people from our building. They are looking and laughing . . . I decide that means it's not all that bad if they are laughing: it means they're not  killing anyone. But now the crowd suddenly dashes toward the soldiers. One of  the soldiers cannot manage to get away, they start stomping on him with their  feet, everyone's kicking him . . . I become ill and go home, and explain in  general terms that horrible things are going on out there . . .  can't speak . . . Well, they've probably killed that soldier, the way that crowd is . . . If each of them kicked him just once . . . They took his club away from him and started to beat him with it. But it was far away and I couldn't see if he got up and left or not.  I become terrified and go home and say, \\\"Lyuda, don't go anywhere, stay at our place, because if you go out they could kill you or . . . \\\" Then the crowd  runs over closer toward our building and stands at the 12-story building and  starts shouting something. We go out onto the balcony. All of our neighbors  are also out on theirs, too. Everyone is standing, staring. The mob is  shouting and about 5 minutes later comes running toward our building. As it  turns out, at the 12-story building the Azerbaijani neighbors went down and  kept them from coming in. There's only one entryway there, they could stop  them.  They all run up to our building. Mamma immediately starts closing the windows, afraid that they might throw stones. They have stones and they break the  windows, all of them. There are very many people. We have a large courtyard,  and it's packed with people. They spill up to the first floor so they don't  crush each other. They crawl up on trees, posts, and garages. It's just a huge cloud of people. They break and burn the motorcycle of the Armenian Sergey  Sargisian, from our building. We close the windows and immediately hear  tramping in our entryway. They come up to our fifth floor with a tremendous  din and roar. It's incomprehensible. Mamma told me later that they were  shouting Father's name, \\\"Grisha, open the door, we've come to kill you!,\\\" or something like that. I don't remember that, I was spaced out, kind of. Mamma  says, \\\"Into the bedroom, quickly!\\\" In the bedroom we have two tall beds, part  of our dowry; Mamma says, \\\"Hide there, they probably won't come in there,  they'll ask something, say something, and leave.\\\" She says, \\\"We'll tell them  that we live alone here.\\\" I can't imagine that my parents will stand out in  the hall alone talking with some sort of beasts . . . I go to them and say  that I'll stand together with them, I'll talk with them if they come, maybe I  can find a common language with them, all the more so if they know me: I speak  Azerbaijani more or less, and I can find out what they want. I told Marina and Lyuda to hide under the bed, and my sister Lyuda, I can't remember if I told  her anything or not.  Then . . . they open the door: it's like they blew on it and it broke and fell right into the hall. The crows bursts in and starts to shout: Get out of here, leave, vacate the apartment and go back to your Armenia; things like that. I tell them, \\\"What has happened, speak calmly. One of you, tell me, calmly, what has happened.\\\" In Azerbaijani, they say, \\\"Get out of the apartment, leave.\\\" I  say, \\\"OK. Go downstairs. We'll gather everything we need and leave the  apartment.\\\" I realize that it is senseless to discuss any sort of rights with them, these are animals. They must be stopped. The ones standing in the doorway, the young guys, say, \\\"There are old people and one girl with them. Too bad!\\\" They take two or three steps back. It seems as though I have pacified them with our exchange. Then someone in the courtyard shouts,  commanding them: \\\"Don't you understand what you are saying? Kill them?\\\"  And that was it! That was all it took. They grab Papa, carry him into one room, and Mamma and me into another. They put Mamma on the bed and start  undressing her, beating her legs. They start tearing my clothes, right there,  in front of Mamma. I don't remember where they went, what they did, or how  much time passed. I had the feeling that they beat me on the head, on my body, and tore my clothes, all at the same time, I don't even know what I said. The  atrocities started. I was savagely raped in that room. They argued among  themselves who would go first.  Later, I remember, I came to. I don't know if I'm dead or alive. Someone comes in, someone tall, I think, clean-shaven, in an Eskimo dogskin coat, balding.  He looks around at what's happening. At that instant everything stops. It  seems to me that he is either their commander or . . . that somehow everything depends on him. He looks and says, \\\"Well, we're done here.\\\" They are beating Mamma on the head. They break up the chairs and beat her with the chair legs  . . . She loses consciousness, and they decide that she's dead. Papa . . . was out cold. They want to throw Lyuda off the balcony, but they can't get the  window open. Apparently the window frames are stuck after the rain and the  windows can't be opened. They leave her next to the window. She was thinking  about being thrown out the window and passed out. She's not a real strong  person anyway . . . He looks at me and sees that I'm saying something, that I'm still twitching. Well, I start saying the opposite of what I should be,  which is humbling myself and pleading. I start shouting, cursing . . . they  don't get any entreaty out of me. I  already know that I'm dead, why would I  humble myself before anyone? And he says that if that's what I think, since my tongue is so long . . . maybe he thinks that I still look quite appealing  . . . In short, he commands that I be taken outside.  I no longer saw or remembered what was happening to Marina and Lyuda, I don't  know if they are alive or not. They take me outside. They are dragging me by  my arms, by my legs. They are hitting me against the wall, the railings,  something metal . . . While they are carrying me someone is biting me, someone else is pinching me . . .I don't even know. I think, my God, when will death  come? If only it were sooner . . . Then . . . they carry me out, throw me near the entryway . . . and start kicking me. I lose consciousness . . . What  happened after that, how many people there were, I don't remember.   I come to after a while, I don't remember how long. A neighbor is bringing me  clothing. I'm entirely covered with blood, she puts a dress on me. I remember  that I said the same words over and over again: \\\"Mamma, what happened, Mamma,  what have they done to us, where are we, whose house are we at?\\\" I can't make  sense out of anything. There is a guy standing over me, I sort of know him, he served in Afghanistan, his name is Igor, he brought me indoors. When they all  went to the third entryway and killed a person there, Igor gathered his  courage, took me into his arms, and brought me to the neighbors', even though  he's small-minded, he put himself at risk. Igor Agayev is Azerbaijani; he  served in Afghanistan. There are three brothers. The older brother also served there, I think; now he's stationed here, on the border, in Armenia. Igor  brought me to the neighbors', and then helped me come to my senses, saying,  \\\"Karina, I know you, calm down, I'm not one of them.\\\" How do I know who's who  and what's what? I come to, and they clean me up. I was covered in blood. Then Papa . . . I saw Papa, I saw Mamma. And Marina, too . . . Igor was there when  they dragged Marina and Lyuda out from under the bed . . . Marina . . . Lyuda  said that she was Russian, they said, we'll let you go, we aren't touching the Russians, go. And while they are dragging Marina out she decides she's going  to tell them she's Azerbaijani. Igor immediately grabs Marina's and Lyuda's  hands, because he knows Marina, and knows that she is Armenian and is our  sister, and takes her to the second floor to a neighbor's and starts pounding  on the door so she will open up. She opens the door and Igor pushes them in  there. So they survived.  My sister Lyuda lost consciousness after the bandits started stealing things. While they were going downstairs, taking things downstairs, then coming back  up again, Lyuda seized the opportunity and crawled under the bed and stayed  there. Then, when she was herself again, she found a torn night shirt and put  it on, and some sort of robe and went to a neighbor's on the fourth floor, the one whose apartment I had watched the crowd from, the friend of ours, and  knocked on the door. The neighbor opened and said, \\\"I'm not going to let you  in the apartment because I'm afraid of them. But I'll give you some stockings  and we'll leave the building.\\\" Lyuda says, \\\"I'll stay at your place because of what's going on, they keep going up and down the stairs.\\\" It was just for a  moment, just a moment in life, but the neighbor wouldn't consent. Lyuda came  back to our place and lay under the bed . . .  I came to. Mother was there. I can't remember my supervisor's telephone  number, but something had to be done. Somehow I remembered and called, and he  came to get us. He didn't have any idea what was going on. He thought we were  simply afraid, he didn't know that they were killing us and that we had passed between life and death. He came and got us and took us to the police precinct. There they looked us over. I was having trouble walking, my lungs hurt badly,  it was hard to breathe . . .  My supervisor's name is Urshan Feyruzovich Mamedov. He's the head of our  administration. They took us there. When we were leaving, I saw a great number of buses full of soldiers at the entrance to town. The buses were ordinary  passenger buses. There were very many soldiers. We left around eleven, right  after eleven. If these people could stop what was happening they could save a  great many lives . . . Because the crowd was moving on, toward the school, and what was going on there . . . I think everyone know not only in Sumgait, not  only in Yerevan. Because there they murdered them all one after the next,  without stopping. After us.  I think 14 people died in Microdistrict No. 3, and 10 to 12 of them were from Buildings 4, 5, and 6. In our building one person died, and one old woman died from Building 16, that's the building in front of ours. There young  Azerbaijani men stopped the mob and wouldn't let it into their building.  Incidentally, when we were at the neighbors', Marina called our relatives to warn them, so they would all know what was happening. I called a aunt in  Microdistrict No. 5. They have three neighbors who are Armenians. I said, \\\"Run quickly, I can't explain what's going on; hide, do what you can, just stay alive. Hide at Azerbaijanis', ones who won't give you away.\\\" At that moment  three people came in, policemen. I think they were Azerbaijanis. I was in such awful condition, my face was completely distorted my lips were puffed up,  there was blood, my eye was swollen, no one thought I would ever see anything  out of that eye again . . . my forehead was badly cut, and one-half of my face was pushed out forward. No one would have thought that I would survive, get my normal appearance back, and be able to grasp anything at all. I started to  scream at those people, why did you come, who sent you here, no one wants you  here, haven't you killed people people yet, what are you doing here? One of  the soldiers said, \\\"Don't scream at us. We're Muslims, but we're not from the  Sumgait police. They called in from Daghestan.\\\" So at that point the  Daghestan police were there.  When we got to the police precinct there were an awful lot of police there, there were soldiers, police with dogs, ambulances, firemen . . . I don't know, maybe they were waiting for people to bring them the goners and the seriously  injured to treat them there in the police precinct. I don't know what they  were there for. There were also doctors from Baku there. They examined Lyuda  and me and said, \\\"These women need to go to the Maternity Home, but we don't  know what to do with the rest.\\\"  So they took us, and I lost contact with my parents, my boss, everyone. My  boss said, \\\"Don't worry, I'll find you, no matter where you are, no matter what happens.\\\" We went to the hospital. There we were examined by a department head from the Sumgait Maternity Home, Pashayeva, I think her name was. She  examined us. The ambulance was from Baku; I figured out that the Sumgait  ambulances hadn't done anything, they didn't respond to any calls. People  called and neither the police nor the ambulances showed any sign of life.  That doctor looked me over and I could tell from her behavior that something very good had happened, for she became quite glad. I even thought to myself,  \\\"God, can it be that nothing all that bad is wrong?\\\" She looks me over and  says, \\\"Now why are you suffering so? You don't know what your people have been doing, your people did even worse things.\\\" And I think, great, I have to deal  with her . . . And I felt so bad, I thought, why don't I just die so as not to have to hear more stuff like this from people like her? Here I am in this  condition and being told about something that our people did. I just didn't  have the energy to say, \\\"How could our people possibly be smart enough to  think of something that yours haven't already done?\\\" I stayed there. Then they brought in another woman, Ira B., she was married, and she was raped in her  own apartment, too. There were three of us, Ira, Lyuda, and 1. The next  morning they took Lyuda and Ira away. They didn't do anything to help us. This was in the old Maternity Home, in the combined block. They didn't do anything  more than examine me, that was it. I didn't want any shots or tranquilizer,  nothing. What shots could have calmed me down? I didn't even want to look at  them.  I lay in the ward. Either it just worked out that way or they did it on pur- pose, but I was alone. I was alone even though the wards were packed. That same evening a woman came by and asked me what was wrong with me, that my face was disfigured. She asked what had happened to me, and I said, \\\"Better to ask  your brother what happened, there's no point in asking me, your brother can  better explain what happened.\\\" She fell into a faint. All the doctors threw  themselves at her, and the doctor categorically forbade anyone to come into my ward.  Then people from work came to see me, my boss, his daughter; they brought me  clothing, because I was literally naked. The only thing I had on was a dress,  but the woman who gave it to me was very short, and the dress was way up  above my knees, and the woman orderly said, \\\"I can't believe you put on such a short dress, who are you showing off your legs to here?\\\" I went back to my  ward thinking, just one more thing from something. People from work came and  brought me something in a sack, apples, I think, three or four pounds, but I  couldn't take them. I had become so weak that it was just embarrassing. I said that I couldn't take the apples, and really didn't have any appetite. No one  had to bring me anything. Some woman took the sack . . . And, oh yes! . . .  Then I heard that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history should  be hidden or torn up completely so that no one would know that I was an  Armenian, maybe they wouldn't figure it out from looking at me. So they must  have been thinking that there would be some kind of attack, that something  else would happen. That it would be worse. Or, perhaps, someone was outside on the street, I don't know. In any case, I didn't sleep a wink that night.  The next morning they picked me up, a whole police detail, put me in a bus,  and off we went. I didn't even know where they were taking me. They took me to the club where the troops were, the very one I was in that ill-fated evening. I got off the bus. Near the City Party Committee there were a great many  troops, tanks, armored personnel carriers; the whole scene was terrible. I saw  a few people I knew there, and that calmed me a little. I had already thought  that I was the only one left. So there were five or six of us left in Sumgait  after that night. I still didn't know what happened to my parents, they didn't  come to see me in the hospital, and my boss told me that everything was fine.  I didn't know whether to believe him or not. Maybe he was just trying to calm  me down, maybe something happened on the way. Then I went to the club and saw  a lot of people I knew. They all knew one another, they were all kissing each  other and asking, \\\"What happened, what went on?\\\" Two days later they came to  see me from work. They were there all the time. Each day they came, showed  interest, and were constantly bringing me money. They did everything they  could. Of course I'm most thankful to my boss, the only one of my colleagues  who didn't lose his presence of mind and who didn't change his opinions,  neither before, nor after, nor in the heat of the moment, no matter what  happened. He constantly took an interest. A sincere interest, from the heart  . . . Then, about two days later, the secretary of the Party Committee came,  not from our Party organization, but from the First Trust, which ours is part  of, Comrade Kerimov, a very important figure in our town. He made arrangements with the emergency medical personnel to take me away, because if I sat down by myself I couldn't get up or lie down again. There was something wrong with my lungs, it was hard to breathe. They examined me there several times, there I  lay were several doctors, they all thought that . . . that it must just be  from all the blows, I don't know. They didn't diagnose anything in particular. When I was in the Maternity Home I even asked . . . I made it a point of  insisting that they take me to the trauma section because I felt so awful.  There was no way something inside wasn't broken, my ribs . . . Well they took  me there and took x-rays and said that everything was fine. There were  emergency medical workers on duty in the club. The mother of one of Marina's  friends was there. She was the head doctor at the Sumgait Children's Clinic.  They had every kind of antifever agent in the world, which was exactly what I needed at that moment, I thought. I said that I was having great difficulty breathing, I couldn't seem to get enough air, something was wrong with me. They put tight bandages around my chest and waist. Later I overheard some people saying that I had been cut all over. I think they just saw me being all bandaged up and decided that my breasts and face had been cut . . . But I wasn't cut.  They took us to the Khimik boarding house. We lived there a long time. Soon  appeared representatives . . . They were agitating. At first people would not  talk to them, and drove them off. One of the Armenian women shouted, \\\"We  demand that Seidov come!\\\" The response was, \\\"It's Seidov who sent us.\\\" Seidov  is the Chairman of the Azerbaijani Council of Ministers. The woman said,  \\\"We'll only see Seidov's daughter, have her come here, we'll do the same  things to her that they did to our daughters, and then we'll deal with you  agitators.\\\" And so on. More of them said, \\\"Have Seidov himself come.\\\" This  went on day in, day out. The agitators kept coming and coming, this drove us  out of our wits. Then people gradually started departing for Yerevan because  they realized it was senseless to stay. Everything got on our nerves: The  smell, the small children. There were children at the SK club, children who  had literally just come out of the Maternity Home. What were they doing in a  club that didn't even have running water all the time? At first we had to pay  to eat there. They even overcharged us, as it turned out. On the second day  someone told us that they would bring us food for free. The children were ill. Everything stank there. Well imagine about 3,000 people in a small movie  theater with seating for no more than 500. You couldn't sit or lie down, it  was impossible to even move. The stench was awful. Even the smallest infants  took ill overnight there. I heard that they were arriving seriously ill in  Yerevan, the infants. They have to be washed, they have to be bathed, not to  mention that we, the adults, were ill and needed care. People were fainting  right and left. I just don't know, everyone was crying, everyone . . . Only  the young people, the men, somehow managed to keep it together. But the women  were in a constant state of panic. It seemed to everyone that they would come  any minute and kill and stab. It seemed clear that we had been gathered  together purposely, like during the war, so that they could burn the movie  theater and there wouldn't be a single Armenian left. Then people went up to  the attic. I didn't see them, I only heard them, because I was lying down and  couldn't get up. I lay right on the stage, we had some room there. Apparently  they caught two people with either oil or gas. I think they wanted to burn the theater. Maybe someone saw them, I didn't. I was in no condition to open my  eyes.  Everyone was suspicious of everyone else. They would ask, \\\"Aren't you an  Azerbaijani? I think I saw you somewhere, I think you're an Azerbaijani.\\\" They led out all the men and started letting them back in by checking their passports, relatives might be covering for each other. Half of the people did not have any documents. There were people who had run out of their homes in  nothing but a pair of pants and slippers, or wearing just a shirt, not like they should have, with their IDs.  So on the 28th, on Sunday, I think, the police did nothing to help us. On Monday everything resumed where it had left off on Block 41A. They didn't  spare a soul there: not children, not pregnant women, nobody. They killed, they burned, they hacked with axes, just everything possible. They murdered  the Melkumian family whom I knew, my mother worked with them. Their daughter- in-law went to school with my older sister. They were brutally murdered. Only  the two daughters-in-law survived. By a miracle one was able to save herself,  she ran away, the neighbors wouldn't take her in, so she ran about the  building until she found refuge. She was pregnant and had two small children.  This all continued on Monday in Block 41A, on the 29th, when the troops were  already in the city.  They murdered people, they overturned automobiles, and they burned entire  families. They say they didn't even know for sure if the people were Armenians or not. I heard that the Lezgins suffered, too. I'm not sure myself, I didn't  see any Lezgins who had been injured. They burned cars so it's very difficult  now to say exactly who died and who didn't. It was very difficult to identify  the corpses, or rather, what remained of the corpses after they were doused in gasoline and burned . . . it's all very hard to imagine, of course I heard  that many people disappeared without a trace, from the BTZ plant two people,  including a woman who worked the night shift, Aunt Razmella, who also lived in Microdistrict 3.  They were stopping buses between Baku and Sumgait. In the evening people who  had been visiting Baku were returning to Sumgait, and people from Baku were  going home from Sumgait, and there were students, too. They were simply  savagely murdered. They were stopping the buses, the drivers immediately did  what they were told because there was just no other way to deal with that  hoard of brutally minded people. They stopped the buses, dragged the Armenians out and killed them on the spot. I didn't see it myself, but I heard that they put them all in a pile so as to burn them. Later it was hard to discern from  the corpses, well you can't call them corpses, you had to figure out from the  ashes who it was. l heard that two fellows saved two women, one a student, Ira G., if I'm not mistaken. She was in the hospital a long time after that, and  she still can't figure out who saved her. She was also brutally raped and  beaten and thrown onto a pile of corpses. The fellow pulled her out of that  whole pile of corpses, put his coat on her, took her into his arms, and  carried her to the city. I still can't imagine how he managed to do that.  I heard that from Engels Grigorian. He knows her, apparently. Well a lot of  people went to that hospital anyway. She was in the hospital and singing a  song in Armenian, and they wrote the words down, and, I think he still has  that piece of paper, because he says that a lot of people now have that song,  the one she sang in the hospital where she lay in such bad shape. They  couldn't find the guy who saved her. He left her in someone's apartment and called the ambulance, she was in such awful shape that, probably, like me, she couldn't remember anyone's face.  I think that I knew one of the people who broke into our house, maybe I had  talked with him once. But I received so many blows everything was just knocked out of my head. I can't remember to this day who he was. Then, it seems, I saw the Secretary of the Directorate's Party organization, where Marina works. She goes to school and works, she goes to night school at AZI, and works by day at the Khimzashchita Construction and Installation Administration. I'm the  Secretary of the Komsomol organization at our administration and often met  with the secretaries of Party and Komsomol organizations. We had joint  meetings. I know them all, I've even talked with them, and he, I know, is from Armenia. An Azerbaijani, but from Armenia. It became obvious that many of  those people were Azerbaijanis born in Armenia.  They took me to various police stations, to the police precinct, and to the Procuracy, because the USSR Procuracy got involved in the case, and I iden- tified the photographs of people who I could more or less recognize. They showed me the people who were in our apartment, they're working on our case, but I can't even recognize them, although it was proved that they were the ones, they're processing it somehow. They tell me that they know that someone held me by the arm and someone else held me by the leg when they were  dragging me. There was someone else in our apartment who did not even touch  me, he just stole a blanket and an earring or something like that. All these  people, all of them, as much as I've heard about them and seen them, they were all from Kafan.  The Secretary of the Party organization is named Najaf, Najaf Rzayev. He was  there when everything started. It must have been him because I didn't  recognize anyone else in the crowd whom I knew besides him. All the more since I told him, \\\"Listen, you do something, because you know me.\\\" He turned away  and went toward the bedroom, where Marina was. Well you couldn't see Marina  anyway. There was such a noisy confusion of people that you couldn't make out  anyone. All of it flew right out of my head, and then gradually I became  myself again, at the City Party Committee . . . There were military people  there. I told them what went on, and they wrote it all down. I told them his  name. On March 8 the Secretary of our First Trust Party organization, the one  we're part of, came to see us, his name is Najaf Rzayev. I tell Mamma, \\\"If he's here despite the fact that I gave his name, it means that either his  alibi has been confirmed or, probably, that they think I'm crazy, not  responsible for my words.\\\" He said, \\\"What did they do to you, how awful,  myself, I hid an Armenian family.\\\" Then after some time goes by he comes back  again and says something entirely different: \\\"I wasn't at home, my family and  I went to Baku.\\\" I said, \\\"Marina, what is he saying? He said something totally different before.\\\" After that I didn't go to see our Procurator, our case is  being handled by a procurator from Voronezh, Fedorov by name. Fedorov told me  that Rzayev's case had just gotten to him, and there were so names involved.  What are they doing with Rzayev? Did he prove his alibi or not? They just think that since I was hit in the  head I can't say anything for sure, whether it was him or not. It will be an  insult if he was in our apartment and doesn't have to pay for it, but at the  same time  I'm afraid to say I'm a hundred percent sure that it was he. Because no mat- ter who I name, they tell me, no, you're wrong, he didn't do that, that one wasn't there. All the faces have gotten mixed up in my mind. Who did what exactly I can't say.                                                       When they took me outside there was a whole crowd there, but I didn't see it,  because I had my eyes closed all the time. It seemed to me that I always got it because of my eyes, people were always hassling me, for some reason it  always seemed to me that my eyes are responsible. When they were beating my  face I thought they were trying to put my eyes out. So I had my eyes closed,  they took me outside and started to beat me. A young guy, 22, held my arms, he works at the BTZ plant. And right nearby, across the road from us, Block 41,  is where all this was going on. Right across the road from us. The BTZ  dormitory is over there, that's where he lives. Now he's in custody, they even have proved, as far as I know, that it was he who killed Shurik Gambarian, the clarinet player from the third entryway of our building. One person in our  building was killed, it was that man.  A guy comes by who shared a room with the guy who was holding me. He saw that he was holding me by the arms and that he was beating me, but he didn't come  over, he just looked and then went into the dormitory. A while after it was  all over, people started making announcements in town saying that  investigators had been summoned. That guy went and told them everything. Now  they've caught him, everything's been proved. Now, evidently, they've been beating him, I don't know what they're doing with them over there, but he  himself said that he was working the night shift at the plant. Some young guy  came to the plant and said, \\\"Everyone who wants to kill Armenians come to the  bus station on Saturday at ten.\\\" That was it. He said, the ones who wanted to, went. This was at the BTZ plant, during the night shift, probably, late Friday night. It was at night, they were at the sauna together. And he said, what do  you mean, do you understand what you are saying? The others were silent,  probably, in their hearts they were thinking, I'm going to go. But they didn't say anything to one another. He said that he thought it important to to go,  because he had heard a lot about what had happened in Kafan, that they had  killed their Azerbaijani sisters, their mothers, burned villages, and all of  that. That guy was also born in Kafan. That is certain. And Marina says that  the Secretary of the Party organization is from Armenia, too.                                                             from  I've participated in the investigation a couple of times. I'm satisfied with them thus far. They summoned us and asked about what happened, and every word  I said was recorded. I met some guy there . . . By the way, he was an  Armenian. I said that he was in our apartment, but what he did, I don't know.  His last name was Grigorian, Eduard Grigorian. He s from Sumgait, from  Microdistrict 1. He was sentenced I think, to five years, not his first time.  His mother is Russian. I met with him at the KGB in Baku, at the Azerbaijani  KGB. They took us there and showed me photographs. There were so many  photographs, I think they even photographed those people who were caught at  curfew, and I've got them all confused. I say, the face was about like this,  the guy in the white coat with the red clasps. But he could take that coat off and burn it somewhere, and it would be like looking for a needle in a  haystack. Well. This guy, Grigorian, I said, he was in our apartment, but he  is so light-complected that he looks like a Lezgin. I don't know what he did,  I can't remember. Maybe he beat me or raped me. But he was in our apartment.  At the KGB he started asking me, pleading with me, there's no need for this,  all this stuff, look me in the eyes, you're like a sister to me. I took a look at him and thought, \\\"My God, Heaven forbid that I should have a brother like  you.\\\" But they were satisfied with my responses, because I said everything  without great certainty. I was there with Mamma. Then Lyuda came in, but when  she came in she got sick immediately. She wanted to kill him, she crawled over the table at him. She recognized him. When she came to, Lyuda was lying on the balcony, the mob threw her there and all of them ran into the bedroom. We had  all kinds of boxes with dishes in them, the dowries for all three sisters.  They stole everything in the apartment, leaving only small things. At that  moment Lyuda came to and started remembering everything. Well, seeing the  faces, hearing the voices . . . Two people were saying they could burn the  apartment. Another says, why burn the apartment when I've got three kids and  no place to live. So this guy was in temporary housing, he didn't have  anywhere to live, he was from Sumgait. They were sure that they would get the  apartment. Besides, the neighbors were Azerbaijani. Why should they burn the  apartment, they might burn Azerbaijanis. That's what they said. How did they  know there were Azerbaijanis there, if they just picked a place, thinking that Armenians lived there? We have a list of the residents for our part of the  building, our name is in there, but how could they know that Azerbaijanis  lived on the other side of the wall from us? So they didn't set fire to our  apartment.  I don't know, I was in such bad shape that if all of it had come to a halt  when I was outside, if someone had asked me what was happening, I would have said that a civil war was going on. Well, maybe not civil . . . but probably civil, because when they were beating me I opened my eyes and saw that all the neighbors were standing on their balconies and watching, like at a free horror film. So a civil war was going on, and only the Armenians were being fought. If it were a world war or something like that, they would have been fighting everyone. But they only fought us. Then I met some women from  our building, some Azerbaijanis. They are crying, they tell me, \\\"Karina, we  saw all of it, how could it happen?\\\" They're asking me! Well I just don't know what to call it if a normal girl can stand there and watch what happened to  me. I think that if it were the other way around either I wouldn't have been  able to take it, or I would have tried to avert it, like that one Azerbaijani  woman did in front of our building. A woman lives there, an awful, dissipated  woman, if you can call her a woman, the dissipated life she leads. Two  Armenian families live there, in her part of the building. She came out on the balcony and saw what was happening to me and started to scream and curse. She  came down to the entryway and said, \\\"You'll come in this entryway over my dead body.\\\" So not one of them took it in his head to go in that entryway. Some  folks were saying that those people were so out of control that they didn't  even know what they were doing. I don't think that's true. They knew very well what they were doing if they didn't even lift a hand against that woman. They  couldn't have cared less about her, but the fact that she was an Azerbaijani  stopped them.  They were just beasts, they had smoked so much. When they came to our place  they were all chewing something. I noticed: Everyone who came into the  apartment was chewing something. I think, my God, maybe I just think that?  Maybe I'm losing my mind? But no, they're all chewing something. Maybe it is  some kind of drug, it must be, because . . . At first glance they all seemed  to be such normal people, young, clean-shaven, looking exactly as if they had  come to some sort of celebration. But they were shouting something. They didn't talk, they shouted, as though there were deaf people there. They  screamed and screamed: \\\"Yeah, killing, killing, we're killing the Armenians!\\\"  Only they didn't shout \\\"kill,\\\" they shouted \\\"gurun ermianlary.\\\" Gurun  literally means \\\"kill,\\\" or \\\"destroy.\\\"  That's how it was! I'll continue. We hid in a captain's apartment, he's an Azerbaijani, his wife is a Tatar. We were sitting in their apartment, their  kids were out in the yard. Their kids knew a whole lot. This was in our part  of the building, on the third floor. When Mamma came to and couldn't find Lyuda she took Papa's hand, this was while the looters were stealing things, but they didn't pay attention because they were stealing things. Apparently they had already ceased killing and switched to stealing. Mamma found the courage to . . .  A boy said to my mother \\\"Where's the gold?\\\" Mamma said he must have been 12  to 14 years old. He even looked Russian, he was so fair-skinned. But the  Azerbaijanis from Armenia are fair-skinned. I noticed they were all on the  fair side. He shouted, they were all smashing things, and he asks Mamma where  the gold is. We kept our gold in the wardrobe with our important papers. In a  little black bag, we kept everything in there. Mamma doesn't really like to  wear gold. She probably never even wore those things from the time they were  bought for her. They took everything that was lying on the cheval glass. Mamma thinks that the gold saved us. Because they threw themselves at the gold, and  Mamma grabbed Papa, who was trying to breathe. They had closed his mouth,  bound his hands, and put a pillow and a chair on his face . . . They had  shoved something into his mouth so he would suffocate. Mamma grabbed him and  tore all that stuff off . . . He had something in his mouth, he was having  trouble breathing, his nose was filled with blood. Mamma grabbed him and  started running from the fifth down to the first floor because no one wanted  to open their doors to them. Mamma said that by accident, completely by  accident that person opened his door, he was sleeping, and said, half-awake,  \\\"What's happened?\\\" He sees that they are bloody. Mamma said, \\\"At least go and  find out what's happening to my daughters, even if they've burned them or  murdered them, at least bring the corpses.\\\" He went looking for us. At that  moment Lyuda was under the bed. She says that after they left it seemed that  someone was calling her name. When he quietly called her she couldn't get out  from under the bed. She wanted to get out and was calling softly. She thought  she was shouting, but in fact she was either silent or was only talking to  herself, it just seemed to her that she was shouting. When she got out from  under the bed everyone was gone. And again . . . She thought that she had lost her mind. I'll never leave here, never! To hell with it! It just seems that  way to me, I'll come to eventually. But then, when everything had settled  down, stopped, that mall brought Lyuda down, and Igor carried me in from outside. Or first I was brought in, then Lyuda, I don't remember what order it happened in.  And Mamma said, \\\"Listen, they're all running around down there, shouting  something or other, and running toward the other building.\\\" It had more or  less calmed down where we were. Who's dead, who's alive, we don't know. I  tried to call my girlfriend. I had basically come to. Mamma says, \\\"Listen; let's go upstairs, at least get a mattress or something. We don't know how  long we'll be here. Maybe they didn't burn everything.\\\" I don't get it, all women have that feeling, they want to get something from their homes, maybe  not everything was taken? I tell Mamma, \\\"Mamma, what do you need any of that  for? To hell with it! We're alive, forget the rest of it, all of it!\\\" She says, \\\"No, let's go get at least something. Maybe we'll leave here, spend the  night at someone else's.\\\" Mamma went upstairs, and their little boy, their son Alik, was standing on the lookout. lIe was standing there to see if they were  coming. They only managed to run up there and grab something one time. He  shouts, \\\"Come back, they're coming!\\\" They didn't have enough time to get a  lot, mattresses from one apartment, a blanket from another . . . Mamma got my  knitting . . . Someone managed to grab our old things, the ones we never wore, out of the hall . . . Someone took Father's old coveralls. The neighbor, his  wife, Mamma and Papa . . . Marina went with them. I was in no condition to  leave. Neither was Lyuda. We just sat. They ran out and we closed the door and just then we hear that the mob is on its way toward our place upstairs,  they're dragging something again. They were going toward the other building,  maybe over by the school, or . . . There was an unfinished building over there, people said they were going toward the basement or the unfinished  building, they could gradually carry everything over there. Then things more  or less calmed down. I tried to call my boss.  Later there was more noise. We were on the third floor, in a one-bedroom apartment, and a woman lives in the one-bedroom place on the second floor, Asya Dallakian. She's an old woman, retired. She wasn't at home, at that time she was usually in the country, she has a married daughter there, and her grandson is in the army. She is only very rarely in town; she gets her retirement money and the apartment is essentially vacant. They started pounding on her door and broke it down. She had two or three beds in there,  something like that, she's a 60-to 70-year-old woman who really does not even  live there. Probably she had some pots, a couple of metal bed frames and  mattresses, and a television. When her grandson came she bought a television.  They started wrecking everything. I started getting sick again. I think, \\\"My  God, what is going on around here? When will this end?\\\" We turned off the  lights and sat. As it turns out the people who weren't afraid, the ones who  knew what was going on, knew not to turn off the lights. We didn't know, but  they didn't come to where we were all the same. They all knew very well that  he was a captain. He went out and closed the door, and we sat in his  apartment. His last name was Kasumov. He's an exserviceman, retired, works up  at the fire station at some plant or other. He went out and stood at his door. They tell him, \\\"Comrade Captain, don't worry, we won't harm you, you're one of us.\\\" He went upstairs, and they say, \\\"Aren't you taking anything from this  apartment?\\\" He says, \\\"I don't need anything.\\\" And the women who were standing  in the yard . . . we have a basement, full of water . . . the women who were  standing in the yard saw. Those guys, they left everything they stole on the  first floor and ran upstairs again. The women threw everything they had time  to into the basement, to save our property. Some things were left: dirty  pillows, two or three other things and a rug. A guy came downstairs, really  mad, and he says, \\\"Where's the rug? I just put it right here!\\\" They tell him,  \\\"Some guy came and took it and went off toward the school.\\\" He ran off in that direction.  Oh! I forgot the most important point. When Igor picked me up in his arms,  there were women standing there who saw everything that was going on. They  just didn't tell me about it for a long time. The wife of that military man,  she didn't want to kill my spirit, I was already dead enough. Later she told  me, that after they murdered Uncle Shurik in the third entryway one of them,  the ringleader, apparently a young man, said, \\\"Where's the girl who was here?\\\" And he became furious. The woman tells him, \\\"She came to . . . \\\" She didn't know what to say: Think something up? Someone carried her off? Then they would comb the whole house and find me and our whole family. So the woman says, \\\"She came to and went to the basement.\\\" Now, our basement is full of water. So the  whole mob dashes off to the basement to look for me or my corpse. They took  flashlights; they were up to their waists in water, water which had been  standing there for years, and soot, and fuel oil. They climbed down in there  to get me. Then one of them said, \\\"There's so much water down there, she  probably walked and walked and then passed out and died. She met her death in  the basement. That's it, we can leave, no problem!\\\" I didn't know that, and  when I was told, I felt worse. Two times worse. A lot worse! So they didn't  just want to pound me flat, something more awful was awaiting me . . .  After that we of course didn't want to live in Sumgait any longer. We really  didn't want to go back to our apartment. When we moved, I went up there and  started to quiver and shake all over, because I started remembering it all.  Although the neighbors all sobbed, it was all . . . so cheap . . . The people  who sat in their apartments and didn't help us at a time like that. I think  that they could have helped! I don't think that they were obligated to, but  they could have helped us! Because that one woman was able to stop that whole  brutal crowd by herself. That means they could have, too. It would have been enough foe one man or women to say, What do you think you're doing?\\\" That's  all! That would have done it. There were 60 apartments in our building. Not  one person said it! When I was lying on the ground and all those people were  standing on their balconies I didn't hear anyone's voice, no one said what are you doing, leave her alone . . . Mamma even told one of the neighbor women  that if it had been an Azerbaijani woman in my place they would have dropped a bomb if it would have killed even one Armenian. They would have stood up for  one of their own. True, they say that our neighbor from the fourth entryway,  an old/ sick woman tried to stop the pogrom. The Azerbaijanis have a custom:  if a woman takes her scarf and throws it on the ground, the men are supposed  to stop immediately. The old woman from the fourth entryway did that, but they stomped her scarf into the ground, pushed her off to the side, and said, \\\"If you want to go on living, you'll disappear into your apartment.\\\" So she left. That trick didn't work on them.  Even the neighbors who helped us move told me, OK, fine, calm down, forget  that it happened. I said I'd only forget it if I told them right then that it had happened to their daughter--and if that didn't have any effect on them,  then I would forget everything, too. Imagine that it happened to your sister.  And no one did anything. Anything.

Caratzas, NY, pages 93-109 \",\"   Both of these symptoms are related - tachycardia. Getting a flushed face is due to the heart pumping the blood faster than a regular pulse.  I suspect this is related to an increase in sodium levels in the blood, since note *sodium chloride* monosodium glutamate. Both are sodium compounds. Our bodies require sodium, but like everything else, one can get too much of a good thing.   Again, this could be related to increased blood flow from increased heart rate, from the sodium in the MSG. Distended crainial arteries, essentially. One of many causes of headaches. There is no discrepency her, necessarily.    Well stomache ache and vomiting tend to be related. Again, not necessarily a discrepency. More likely a related reaction. Vomiting occurs as a response to get rid of a noxious compound an organism has eaten. If a person can't digest the stuff (entirely possible - the list of stuff people are allergic to is quite long), and lacks an enzyme to break it down, gastrointestinal distress (stomach or belly ache) would be expected.     These are respiratory reactions, and are now considered to be similar to vomitting. They are a way for the body to dispose of noxious compounds. They are adaptiove responses. Of course, it is possible some other food or environmental compound could be responsible for the symptoms. But it's important to remember that a lot opf these effets can be additive, synergystic, subtractive, etc, etc. It would be necessary to know exactly what was in a dish, and what else the person was exposed to. Respiratory does sound suspicious BUT  resopiration and heart rate are connected.  Things in the body are far from simple...very inetractive place, the vertebrate body.    People respond in a myriad of ways to the same compound. It depends upon what it is about the compound that \\\"pisses off\\\" their body. Pollen, for example, of some plants aggrivates breathing in many people, because, when inhaled, it sets of the immune system, and an histamine attack is launched. The immune system goes overboard, causing the allergic person a lot of misery. And someone with an allergy to some pollens will have trouble with some herb teas that contain pollens (Chamomile, linden, etc). Drinking the substance can perturb that person's system as much as inhaling it.    See above. And don't think that heart rate changes, and circulatory problems are not serious. They can be deadly.  and brain damage.   The area of the brain effected is the neuroendocrine system controlling the release of gonadotropin, the supra-hormone controlling the cyclical release of testosterone and estradiol, as well as somatostatin, and other steroids. Testing for effective dose would be, uh, a wee bit unethical.   poisoning.   Absolutely. But it could also be some synergystic mess from eating , say, undetected shrimp or mushrooms (to which many are allergic), plus too much alcohol, and inhaling too much diesel fumes biking home, plus, let's say, having contracted flu from one's sig. other 3 days before from drinking out of the same glass. Could be all sorts of things.  But it might be the MSG.    If noone else got sick, its likely not food poisoning. Probably stomach flu or an undetected thing the guy's allergic to.   Anyway, the human body's not a machine; people vary widely in their responses, and a lot of reactions are due to combinations of things.\",\"I recently purchased a Diamond Stealth 24 Video card and received the wrong drivers.

If you have an idea about its voltage and current  ratings, e.g. 60VDC @ 6A, you can probably get away with replacing it with  anything with better specs.  Early MOSFETS had a gate-source voltage rating  of approximately +/- 20 VDCmax, and they would usually turn completely \\\"ON\\\"  at +10VDC.  Otherwise, MOSFETS are not really mysterious -- they're more or  less voltage controlled current sources.

Chuck Browning\",\"/ iftccu:talk.politics.guns / mikey@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu (Strider) /  8:51 pm  Apr 12, 1993 /   I've been watching this knife verses gun bit for a while now, (even contributed a few comments) but this stuff \\\"I'd rather face a knife than a gun\\\" has GOT to come from ignorance!  I used to think pretty much the same thing, then I got 'educated.'  People do not as a rule understand how deadly knives can be, or how quickly you can be killed with one.  Most people don't understand that it takes less than an inch of penetration in some areas to cause quick (within a minute or so) death.  The death rates from handguns and knives are within a few percentage points of each other.  Many people not realizing how deadly knives are 'try their luck' and thus more get injured by knives.  A gun is deadly only in a single direction and it's only advantage is that it is a remote control weapon.  A contact weapon such as a knife controls a spherical area 7 to 10 feet in diameter.  Most people have never seen knife wounds, aside from slicing a finger by accident.  From 21 feet or so, a knife is very nearly an even match for a holstered gun in experienced hands, even if the knife wielder has only moderate skill.  From inside 10 feet or so, a knife is a match for a DRAWN gun.  A knife is utterly silent, it never jams and never runs out of ammunition.  It is limited only by the speed, dexterity skill and ability of it's wielder.  Criminals in general are young, fast and strong.  It's interesting to note that the patterned slashing attacks used by many martial artists remarkably resemble the wild uncontrolled slashing attacks of novices.  I've talked to several well trained martial artists.  They have unanimously agreed that if they ever go up against a knife they simply plan on being cut, hopefully not as bad as the attacker.  Practicing with firearms requires facilities and equipment.  Practicing with knives requires only a small area and something to simulate a knife, say a popsicle stick or tooth brush.  Criminals practice their knife attacks in prison.  If you have not trained against knives with a firearm and do not realize these facts the first inkling you will have that something is wrong is the knife ripping through your throat, or in the case of an experienced attacker, parts of your body falling off onto the ground.  A 60 year old man with arthritis can close that 7 yard distance and gut you in about one and a half seconds.  Dennis Tueller with a broken leg in a walking cast managed it in two.  I've seen people close that distance and strike in 1 second.  I'm old, over weight and slow.  I can do it in 1.3 seconds.  I've seen morgue footage of people killed with edged weapons that you would not believe.  (How about a single stab wound to the chest with a TABLE FORK!  In this case the attacker used the HANDLE, not the pointed end.)  Add to this the 'fact' that hand gun 'stopping' power is largely a myth. Except in the case of a central nervous system shot, or a round that destroys the skeletal structure, it takes anywhere from 3 to twelve seconds for a bullet wound to 'take effect.'  This is true of even heart shots.  There is the case of the police woman in L.A., the first recorded survivor of a .357 shot to the heart.  That lady not only killed her attacker, but chased him down to do it!  All four of her shots, fired after SHE had been shot, struck the perp.  Atta girl!  The bullet entered her on a downward angle, went through the apex of her heart, down through the diaphragm, clipped her liver and destroyed her spleen.  It then exited her back leaving a tennis ball sized hole.  She died about six times on the operating table, but was out of the hospital in 15 days and was back on full duty in eight months!  She was off duty at the time and not wearing her vest.  She was on her way home so happened to have her gun.  No, she doesn't think civilians should have the same rights.  Sigh.  The moral of the story is that even if you DO manage to shoot a knife attacker, you'd better be planning on doing some dodging.  A good alternative is to shoot for and break the pelvis.  People can often walk (a little) on broken legs but a broken pelvis will nearly always anchor them.  Many firearms schools recommend pelvis shots against contact weapons.  The target is as large as the traditional 'center of mass' and is more reliable to STOP somebody with a contact weapon, assuming a caliber powerful enough to 'do the job.'  Hot .38's on up will usually do this.  Remember folks, the idea isn't to 'take em with you' but for you to live and them to fail, whatever the consequences for them.  This the reason 'killing them' isn't our goal, or in many cases even good enough to keep us alive.  I don't want to face a violent attack of any sort.  Knowing what I now know, I can't rightly say I'd rather face a knife than an gun.  It would have to depend on the attacker, and if I could pick and choose, I WOULDN'T BE THERE.  This is really the bottom line.  Criminals do not fear the law.  Criminals do not fear the weapon.  They fear the citizen behind the weapon that has shown the resolution and determination to do whatever it takes.\",\"   This is a good idea - so you can carry your (non-alcoholic) drinks without spilling or having someone hold on to them.

Speaking as an atheist (heterosexual, for what it's worth), this is one of the least attractive parts of some varieties of Christianity.  Although I'm sure it's possible to argue theologically that we shouldn't make analogies between discrimination on the basis of sex and race and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, morally the case looks unanswerable (for those outside religion): the three forms _are_ analogous; we shouldn't discriminate on the basis of sex, race or sexual orientation.  I found the moderator's FAQs on the subject instructive, and recommend everyone to read them.  There seem to be three different levels of acceptance:  1) Regard homosexual orientation as a sin (or evil, whatever) 2) Regard homosexual behaviour as a sin, but accept orientation (though presumably orientation is unfortunate) and dislike people who indulge 3) As 2, but \\\"love the sinner\\\" 4) Accept homosexuality altogether.  My experience is that 3 is the most common attitude (I imagine 1 and 2 are limited to a few fundamentalist sects).  I suppose I can go along with 3, except that I have this feeling that a 14--15 year old living in a community with this attitude, on discovering that they were more attracted to members of the same sex, would not feel the love of the community, but would rather feel the pressure not to exhibit their feelings.  I'm not saying that the community (in particular the parents) would not love the child, but I suspect the child would not feel loved.\",\"  : I have one complaint for the cameramen doing the Jersey-Pitt series:  Show : the shots, not the hits.

They have no meaning on other machines.   You mean the responses some of which pointed to double-blind tests which show no such \\\"chinese restaurant effect\\\" unique to MSG (it's elicited by the placebo as well.)   Like youself?  Someone who can read a scientific paper and apparently come away from it with bizarrely cracked ideas which have nothing to do with the use of this substance in human nutrition?   No, it's undisputed in the literature that glutamate is an amino acid which is an excitatory neurotransmitter.  There is also evidence that excessive release of glutamate may be involved in the pathology of certain conditions like stroke, drowning and Lou Gehrig's disease, just to name a few. This is a completely different issue than the use of this ubiquitous amino acid in foods.  People are not receiving intra-ventricular injections of glutamate.   I don't know about premier, but it's certainly an important one.   Sez you.  Such an effect in humans has not been demonstrated in any controlled studies.  Infant mice and other models are useful as far as they go, but they're not relevant to the matter at hand.  Which is not to say that I favor its use in things like baby food--a patently ridiculous use of the additive.  But we have no reason to believe that MSG in the diet effects humans adversely.   Wrong.  Do you know how much aspartate or phenylalanine is in a soft drink? Milligrams worth.  Compare that to a glass of milk.  Do you know how much glutamate is present in most protein-containing foods compared to that added by the use of MSG?

Newspaper reporters are notoriously ignorant on the subject of religion, and are prone to exaggeration in the interests of having a \\\"real\\\" story (that is, a bigger headline).  Let's back up to 1935.  At this point, we have the Masoretic text, the various targums (translations/commentaries in aramaic, etc.), and the Septuagint, the ancient greek translation.  The Masoretic text is the standard Jewish text and essentially does not vary.  In some places it has obvious corruptions, all of which are copied faithfully from copy to copy. These passages in the past were interpreted by reference to the targums and to the Septuagint.  Now, the septuagint differs from the masoretic text in two particulars: first, it includes additional texts, and second, in some passages there are variant readings from the masoretic text (in addition to \\\"fixing\\\"/predating the various corrupted passages).  It must be emphasized that, to the best of my knowledge, these variations are only signifcant to bible scholars, and have little theological import.  The dead sea scroll materials add to this an ancient *copy* of almost all of Isaiah and fragments of various sizes of almost all other OT books.  There is also an abundance of other material, but as far as I know, there is no sign there of any hebrew antecdent to the apocrypha (the extra texts in the septuagint).  As far as analysis has proceeded, there are also variations between the DSS texts and the masoretic versions.  These tend to reflect the septuagint, where the latter isn't obviously in error.  Again, though, the differences (thus far) are not significant theologically.  There is this big expectation that there are great theological surprises lurking in the material, but so far this hasn't happened.  The DSS *are* important because there is almost no textual tradition in the OT, unlike for the NT.\",\"Yes,  Take Interstate I-70 to the route 48 exit.  Go south on 48 about 2-1/2 miles.

Side question:  how about the legal ramifications of selling a used car with a replaced odometer that starts over at 0 miles, after say 100/200/300K actual miles.  Looks like fraud would be fairly easy - for the price of a new odometer, you can say it has however many miles you want to tell the buyer it has.

I've weathered attempted dog attacks before using the approved method: Slow down to screw up dog's triangulation of target, then take off and laugh at the dog, now far behind you. This time, it didn't work because I didn't have time. Riding up the hill leading to my house, I encountered a liver-and-white Springer Spaniel (no relation to the Springer Softail, or the Springer Spagthorpe, a close relation to the Spagthorpe Viking). Actually, the dog encountered me with intent to harm.  But I digress: I was riding near the (unpainted) centerline of the roughly 30-foot wide road, doing between forty and sixty clicks (30 mph for the velocity-impaired). The dog shot at me from behind bushes on the left side of the road at an impossibly high speed. I later learned he had been accelerating from the front porch, about thirty feet away, heading down the very gently sloped approach to the side of the road. I saw the dog, and before you could say SIPDE, he was on me. Boom! I took the dog in the left leg, and from the marks on the bike my leg was driven up the side of the bike with considerable force, making permanent marks on the plastic parts of the bike, and cracking one panel. I think I saw the dog spin around when I looked back, but my memory of this moment is hazy.  I next turned around, and picked the most likely looking house. The apologetic woman explained that the dog was not seriously hurt (cut mouth) and hoped I was not hurt either. I could feel the pain in my shin, and expected a cool purple welt to form soon. Sadly, it has not. So I'm left with a tender shin, and no cool battle scars!  Interestingly, the one thing that never happened was that the bike never moved off course. The not inconsiderable impact did not push the bike off course, nor did it cause me to put the bike out of control from some gut reaction to the sudden impact. Delayed pain may have helped me here, as I didn't feel a sudden sharp pain that I can remember.  What worries me about the accident is this: I don't think I could have prevented it except by traveling much slower than I was. This is not necessarily an unreasonable suggestion for a residential area, but I was riding around the speed limit. I worry about what would have happened if it had been a car instead of a dog, but I console myself with the thought that it would take a truly insane BDI cager to whip out of a blind driveway at 15-30 mph. For that matter, how many driveways are long enough for a car to hit 30 mph by the end?  I eagerly await comment.

The Federalist papers are propaganda and it is therefore difficult to determine precisely what Maddison etc were up to from them. They certainly emphasised a limited role for the federal government but this was not necessarily their true position.   The Senate was less powerful than the House of Lords in the period in question. The stripping of the powers of the House of Lords did not occur until 1914 and David Llloyd George's budget. Even despite this the House of Lords has considerable power even today and is far from a rubber stamping body.     The system is meant to be slow to react, the problem is that it ended up a bit too slow.    The Presiden't veto was meant to be entirely separate. Until Bush abused it in a quite extraordinary manner it was used more in accord with the intent of being a check on unreasonable legislation.

It is basically a collection of previously published works by those who claim that there exist Buddhist and Hindu stories that Christ visited India and China (he was known as Issa)  during the period from late teens to age 30.  Conclusion:  the book actually lets you come to your own view by presenting a summary of various published works and letters, all of which you could verify independently.  It includes refutations to such works as well.

With the flames go the prayers of about 1,200 Bay Area Zoroastrians that their faith will survive this land.     \\\"There is a fear - a real fear, too,\\\" said Silloo Tarapore of Lafayette. \\\"We have one generation to do it or to die.\\\"     Many immigrant groups struggle to maintain an identity in a strange land. But for Zoroastrians, it is an especially poignant concern.     Their religion has been around for perhaps 3,700 years, a heritage so deep it scarcely seems comprehensible in a state where \\\"historical sites\\\" are sometimes less than 100 years old.  It was the religion of the great Persian Empire under kings Cyrus and Darius.  And tradition says that when Christ was born about 500 years later, he was honored by a visit from three Zoroastrian priests, the Magi.  Scholars say many key beliefs of Christians, Jews and Muslims can be traced to the teachings of Zoroaster, the Zoroastrian prophet.     Yet, with only about 150,000 Zoroastrians in the entire world, they are  a miniscule minority in every country in which they live.  Survival as a people is very much on their minds.     Ironically, local Zoroastrians fear that the almost unlimited tolerance of the United States may do what hundreds of years of persecution followed by nearly 1,000 years of benign religious segregation could not do: cause their young people to stop thinking of themselves as Zoroastrians.     Zoroastrians do not believe theirs is the only right religion, and they actually shun the notion of trying to win converts.  So if their children become totally assimilated, they say, it's their children - rather than the world at large - who will be the losers.     \\\"It's important to have an identity,\\\" said Maneck Bhujwaia of San Jose, a leader among Zoroastrians who came here from India.  \\\"It's important for everybody - Irish, Scottish, Americans.  It gives meaning to life. You don't have to depend on the majority community to give you respect. You can fall back on your own identity.\\\"     For Zoroastrians, there's much to be proud of.     Their prophet, Zoroaster, seeking to make sense of a culture in which animal sacrifice to multiple gods was common, preached that there was only one god, a good one.  Zoroastrians call their god Ahura Mazda, which translates as Lord of Wisdom and Light.  _Good vs. evil_     Zoroaster saw life as a constant struggle between good and evil, with the good eventually winning.  Men and women could join in the battle for good, he said, and he warned that they would inevitably suffer consequences such as shame and sorrow if they did wrong.  He preached honesty, charity, kindness to animals, respect for the environment, hard work, equality of men and women - basic virtues preached by prophets of many religions.     But Zoroaster was perhaps unusual in that he told his followers not to follow him blindly.  He demanded they think for themselves.  In fact, Joseph Campbell, the famous scholar of the history and meaning of myths, traced the Western emphasis on individual thought to the Zoroastrians.     Zoroastrians have many words for thought.  Their motto, leaded into a stained glass window over the sacred fire at the temple on the slopes of Mount Hamilton, is \\\"Good thoughts, good words, good deeds.\\\"     So it's not surprising that Zoroastrians value education highly.  In India, where a contingent of Zoroastrians arrived in the ninth century to escape persecution by Muslims in Iran, Zoroastrians claim 100 percent literacy; the overall statistic in India is just 60 percent.     About half of the Bay Area Zoroastrian community came here from India and Pakistan, mostly to study at universities.  The other half fled from Iran after the 1979 revolution made that a fundamentalist Islamic state where others had no rights.     Local Zoroastrians point with pride to ways their emphasis on \\\"good deeds\\\" has improved life in every country they inhabit.  In San Jose, the recent restoration of the Hotel Sainte Clarie came about because Manou Mobedshahi, a San Francisco-based hotelier, passed the boarded-up downtown landmark on his way to and from the temple.  At the temple's dedication, the chief guest of honor was the mother of Zubin Mehta, the Zoroastrian conductor of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra.     The temple exists because of another good deed: the decision by an Iranian emigre, the late Arbab Rustom Guiv, to buy land for six temples in North America.  Besides the 10-acre site off Crothers Road on Mount Hamilton, he paid for land in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, Toronto, and Vancouver.  Until his gifts, there were no Zoroastrian temples on this continent.     Local Zoroastrians raised money to build the actual temple, and the property already had a large house that they have converted to a community center.     The temple, dedicated a year ago on the birthday of the prophet  Zoroaster, is a simple structure with gleaming white walls, vaulted  ceilings and oak floors, partially covered with huge Oriental carpets.     Its central feature is the fire, set in the middle of a partly-glassed- in area at the center of the building.  Although Zoroastrians are  sometimes called \\\"fire worshippers,\\\" they actually consider fire just  a symbol of God.  \\\"It helps us concentrate, just like Christians use the  cross and Muslims use the Holy Book,\\\" Bhujwala said.     The biggest celebration of the years occurs in early spring.  For all Iranians, including Zoroastrians, the New Year begins on the first day of the season because of its symbolism as the start of new life.  With Zoroaster's birthday just six days later, the combination of religious and secular holidays creates something on par with what most of the United States celebrates between Christmas and Jan. 1.    For this year's celebration of the prophet's birthday, about 500 people came to worship and revel.     \\\"The good things in life are not forbidden,\\\" Esfandiar Anoushiravani, a leader of the Iranian members, had said beforehand, and what followed proved him right.     Inside the temple, worshipers filled every chair and sat or stood around the edges of the room as about a half-dozen priests chanted thanksgiving prayers around a table laden with braziers of smoking sandalwood, glasses of milk and water, and a tray heaped with dried fruit and nuts.     Kids crowded around, grabbing handfuls of the treats.  \\\"People eat the fruit,\\\" Tarapore said.  \\\"It's a way to participate in the ceremony.\\\"  _Santa Claus, sort of_     The gathering even had a Santa Claus, Iranian style.

The Zoroastrians from India were charmed.  \\\"This is all new for us, too,\\\" one told a visitor who asked what was going on.     A visitor, John A. Sabanovich of Folsom, said he became intrigued with the religion years ago while on business trips to Iran.  Zoroastrians have no procedure for accepting converts - a result, some say, of their centuries of persecution in Iran followed by their promise to the Hindu king who allowed them into India that they would not interfere with his people's religion.     But that does not stop Sabavich from joining in the celebrations at the San Jose temple whenever he can.     \\\"When I first heard about this religion,\\\" he said, \\\"I thought, my God, this is what a religion should be.

Down the stretch, he : abused Jim Bunning, Chris Short, and Robin Roberts (I think those : are the three) pitching each on only 2 days rest for quite some : time.  By the time they hit the last 2 weeks of the season, : obviously none of these guys had an ounce left in their arm.  Oh : well.  Roberts was long gone -- he was probably an Oriole in 1964.  Or maybe a Colt .45.  The 3rd starter was Art Mahaffey, the previous year's ace. Dennis Bennett was the 4th starter.  They were indeed 6.5 up with 12 to go, but they won their final two games after the horrid 10-loss streak.  The final game victory (Bunning's 19th win, if memory serves) kept the Reds from tying for the title; they and the Phils were both 1 game behind the Cards, with the Giants(?) another game back.  The Mets couldn't hold an early lead against the Cards that final Sunday, or there would have been a 3-way tie.  Too bad they couldn't have saved some of the 15 or so runs they scored on Saturday when they crushed St. Louis. --\",\" That would be neat, but nowhere in the Bible does it say that one who has the gift of tounges can do this.  If the gift of tounges were the ability to be understood by everyone, no matter what languages they know, there would be no need for the gift of interpretation, and I Corinthians 14 would not have had to have been written.     That's a pretty harsh assumption to make about a several million Christians world wide.  Sure, there are some who want glory for themselves who speak in tounges, just as there are among those who do not have this gift.  There were people like this in the Corinthian church also.  that does not mean that there is no true gift or that all who speak in tounges do it for their own glory in the sight of men.   I would venture to say that a large percentage of those who do speak in tounges  do so more often in private prayer than in public.  Link Hudson\",\"  Yup.

It has a density of 0.058 lb/cu in, therefore the theoretical height for a constant section column that can just support itself is 4.8 million inches, or 400,000 ft, or 75 Statute miles.  Now, a real structure will have horizontal bracing (either a truss type, or guy wires, or both) and will be used below the crush strength. Let us assume that we will operate at 40% of the theoretical  strength.  This gives a working height of 30 miles for a constant section column.    A constant section column is not the limit on how high you can build something if you allow a tapering of the cross section as you go up.  For example, let us say you have a 280,000 pound load to support at the top of the tower (for simplicity in calculation).  This requires 2.5 square inches of column cross sectional area to support the weight.  The mile of structure below the payload will itself weigh 9,200 lb, so at 1 mile  below the payload, the total load is now 289,200 lb, a 3.3% increase.  The next mile of structure must be 3.3% thicker in cross section to support the top mile of tower plus the payload.  Each mile of structure must increase in area by the same ratio all the way to the bottom.  We can see from this that there is no theoretical limit on area, although there will be practical limits based on how much composites we can afford to by at $40/lb, and how much load you need to support on the ground (for which you need a foundation that the bedrock can support.  Let us arbitrarily choose $1 billion as the limit in costruction cost.  With this we can afford perhaps 10,000,000 lb of composites, assuming our finished structure costs $100/lb.  The $40/lb figure is just for materials cost.  Then we have a tower/payload mass ratio of 35.7:1.  At a 3.3% mass ratio per mile, the tower height becomes 111 miles.  This is clearly above the significant atmosphere.  A rocket launched from the top of the tower will still have to provide orbital velocity, but atmospheric drag and g-losses will be almost eliminated.  G-losses are the component of rocket thrust in the vertical direction to counter gravity, but which do not contribute to horizontal orbital velocity.  Thus they represent wasted thrust.  Together with drag, rockets starting from the ground have a 15% velocity penalty to contend with.  This analysis is simplified, in that it does not consider wind loads.  These will require more structural support over the first 15 miles of height.  Above that, the air pressure drops to a low enough value for it not to be a big factor.

Some boxes have internal terminators; some can be switched out and others are socketted.  These count.  If the box with internal terminations cannot be put on the end to terminate the cabling, they have to be disabled, ie, switched out or pulled out of their sockets.  If you have 2 boxes with internal terminations, the terminations in one box has to be disabled...., etc.  I am sure that this has been covered by the \\\"experts\\\".

That's *your* *interpretation* of these texts.   2 Peter 1:20-21 But know this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture is a matter  of one's own interpretation, for no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.  The study notes in my Bible offer three possible meanings for verse 20. Apparantly it's not as clear to Charles Ryrie as it is to you.  2 Timothy 3:16-17 All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work.  Galations 1:11-12 For I would have you know, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man.  For I neither received it from man,  nor was I taught it, but I receieved it through a revelation of Jesus Christ.  When I read these passages, it was not immediately clear to me what every phrase meant.  I had stop and think about the possible connotations of words, what the intent of the author may have been, wonder if the translator used the correct English word to convey the  same meaning: I had to interpret.  If you want to believe that your  are not interpreting Scripture as you read, there's probably nothing  I can say to change your mind.  But I think it's naive to think that  our culture, experiences, education, do not affect everything we read.   In college, I took an entire course in Biblical interpretation.  Go to any Christian bookstore, there are scores of books on interpreting and understanding Scripture.  If interpretation is unnecessary, there are  an awful lot of misguided Christians out there wasting a lot of time  and energy on it.\",\"  OK, you guys stirred up my childhood memories, so I went and did some research on the final month or so of the 1964 season.

The way they were used at that time may have made the problem worse, although Bunning had one of his sharpest games of the year in the final day 10-0 shutout of the Reds that cost the Reds a share of the pennant. Bunning pitched a complete game six-hitter, striking out five and walking one. It would be inetersting to see, though, how the total innings for the year for Bunning and Short stacks up against the rest of the league. Also notice that the Phillies played every day from at least September 1 through October 1; while they didn't play substantially more games than the other teams, the other teams each had a couple days off during that stretch. \",\" I've found this works pretty well on noisy laminated power transformer cores and windings (the 60Hz kind). Likewise, if anybody has tried this on a flyback I'd like to hear about it.  I would suspect it would not be as effective as it was on power transformers as the material wouldn't damp as well--something I suspect would be critical at the frequencies involved (in other words, you want absorption rather than prevention which would be real difficult at 15 KHz).  --  --------------------------------------------------------------------        Dave Medin   Phone: (205) 730-3169 (w)     SSD--Networking    (205) 837-1174 (h)     Intergraph Corp.

Your comparison with the Warsaw Ghetto uprising is insulting,     and racist beyond belief.  The attempts to quiet any violence     in the Gaza Strip are just that.  The efforts to quell murder     and mayhem in the Gaza strip were the resluts of violence and     came AFTER the violence.  It was not an arbitrary racial move     like the nazi treatment of Jews.  Jews had NOT committed acts     of violence and murder as have the residents of Gaza.  I find      your eagerness to ignore the acts of murder nothing more than     anti-Israel bigotry.

Nearly twice as many Palestinians have been murdered by other     Palestinians than in confrontations with Israel.  Hundreds of     thousands of Palestinians had been deported from Kuwait, just     because they were Palestinian.  The truth is that your phoney     concern for the welfare of the Palestinians is nothing but an     excuse to attack Israel.  You are part of the ignorant effort     to confine all concern for the welfare of the Palestinians to     attacking Israel.  But the truth is there are greater reasons     than Israel for the plight of the Palestinians.  To disregard     Jordan or Kuwait or Saudi Arabia or any of the other oil-rich      nations who do nothing for these people, is to use the plight      of these poor people as a vehicle for your hatred of Jews, or     your hatred of Israel.  Anti-semitism and anti-Zionism is NOT     the same as pro-Palestinian and anyone who insists that it is     the same really does not give two hoots for their welfare.        Your pathetic analogy is so absent of relevant fact that your     racism cannot be disguised.  Jews had never declared war on a     Polish people.  Jews had never attacked Poles with knives, or     had used the Ghetto as a staging ground for attacks.  To take     something like the Warsaw Ghetto(the creation of which you do     not even bother to discuss!)and the uprising that followed is     to degrade the dead, and to show that intelligent debate on a      difficult situation is beyond your intellectual purview.  You     clearly have never even read a single word of the Covenant of      the Islamic Resistance Movement.  Here is arguably the single     most anti-semitic genocidal document since Mein Kampf, yet it     is totally disregarded in your rantings.  Your racism is most     evident in your eagerness to avoid such documentation.  If it     were considered, you might actually have to deal with mideast     problems in a balanced manner, rather than in an anti-semitic     manner.        And just how was Gaza obtained?  Do you forget that Israel is     not in the habit of grabbing land for the hell of it, but had     taken Gaza in a war that it did not start?  Did you know land     Israel captures in wars, wars which other nations have ALWAYS     started, aren't the same as Israel, and they are subject to a      completely different set of international laws?  Since you do     continuously refer to international law, would you please say     what specific international laws Israel is violating?                  This attitude      I can cite 6,000,000 reasons why it is not.        Where is this quote?  I have never heard Rabin assert that he     wished such a thing.  Since you are in general a liar, you'll     have to provide the entire quote, with source, or this effort     will be regarded as just another one of your fabrications.        Only you are led to ask such a loaded, racist, intellectually     dishonest question.  You inability to come to terms with what     you are has turned you into a racist of the highest order.        Why do you not feel the same compassion for the Jews of Iran,     or Iraq, or Yemen, or Saudi Arabia, or Syria?  Do you have an     inkling of what they have endured over the past decades?  Or,     what about the plight of the Palestinians in Kuwait?  Or what     about the treatment of the Bosnian Muslims?  Do you think the     residents of Gaza are being subjected to what all the Muslims      in Bosnia are enduring?  Why are you indifferent to the death     and suffering of people?  Why do you not care that these folk     are being exterminated?  Why do you not care that only Israel     has given any of these people safe haven?  Could it be due to      the fact that it is not Israel who is doing the killing?  The     people in Gaza are not being exterminated.  They aren't being     killed.  They aren't being raped.  They aren't being starved.     They aren't being driven from their lands.  They are not kept     from receiving food or other supplies.  But the Bosnians are.     And the ONLY country which has provided some sanctuary to the     Bosnian Muslims is the same nation that you have devoted your      life to attacking, in the guise of compassion.          Your rantings are so unfettered by the burden of intellectual     honesty that you ought to take a deep breath and ask yourself     what your real motives are.  Do not flatter yourself into the     belief that truth or compassion are what drives you.  In your     case, it is clear that hate beats out love every time.  Maybe     you are burdened with some kind of guilt for having been born     a Jew.  It is obvious that your hatred of your own Judaism is     being dumped on all other Jews.  Why else would you suggest a     racist idea like breeding Jews out of existence?  Maybe these     fits of anti-semitism are a result of being cut off from your      own people for an extended period.  Whatever the case may be,      it is clear that you are not what you have labored so hard to      appear to be.  When you realize that you can't care for other      people while you hate yourself you might actually begin to do      some good.\",\"Does anybody have informations about the   W 86 C 451   and  W 86 C 456 chips (40pin DIL pckg)?

In my encounters with Christians, I find myself dismayed by their belief that their faith is total truth.  According to them, their beliefs come from the Bible and the bible is the word of God and God is truth - thus they know the truth.  This stance makes it difficult to discuss other faiths with them and my own hesitations about Christianity because they see no other way. Their way is the 'truth.'  But I see their faith arising from a willful choice to believe a particular way.  That choice is part faith and part reason, but it seems to me a choice.  My discussions with some Christians remind me of schoolyard discussions when I was in grade school:  A kid would say, \\\"All policemen are jerks!\\\"  I'd ask, \\\"How do you know?\\\"  \\\"Because my daddy told me so!\\\"  \\\"How do you know you're daddy is right?\\\"  \\\"He says he's always right!\\\"  Well the argument usually stops right there.  In the end, aren't we all just kids, groping for the truth?  If so, do we have the authority to declare all other beliefs besides our own as false?  -------------  This is only my third time browsing through this newsgroup.  I apologize if I'm covering tired old ground.  Some of the discussions on this topic have piqued my interest and I welcome any comments.  --   [I'm sort of mystified about how a Christian might respond to this.  I can understand criticisms of Christianity that say there's not enough evidence to believe it, or that there's just as good evidence for other religions.  I don't agree, but clearly there are plenty of intelligent people who don't find the evidence convincing.  But that doesn't seem to be your point.  Rather, you seem upset that people who believe Christianity is true also believe that things which contradict it are false.  This suggests a model of spiritual things that's rather different than the Christian one.  It sounds more like an existentialist view, where people choose what value to follow, but there's no actual independent spiritual reality, and so no way to say that a specific choice is in some unique sense right.  This sort of model -- with modifications of one sort or another -- may be appropriate for some religions.  But Christianity is in its essense a \\\"historical\\\" religion.  That is, it's based on the concept that there are actual spiritual entities out there, that one of them has intervened in history in specific ways, and that we see evidence of that in history.  In the \\\"mundane\\\" world, we are not free to choose how things work.  When we drop something, it falls (aside from well-defined situations where it doesn't).  The Christian concept is that spiritual matters, there is also an actual external reality.  I hope we're all honest enough not to claim that we have perfect understanding.  But while we may not think we know everything, we are confident that we know some things.  And that implies that we think things that contradict them are false.  I don't see how else we could proceed.  This needn't result in arrogance.  I'm certainly interested in talking with people of other religions.  They may have things to teach me, and even if they don't, I respect them as fellow human beings.  But it's got to be possible to respect people and also think that on some matters they are wrong.  Maybe even disasterously wrong.\",\"Mike Sixsmith, on the 16 Apr 93 10:07:55 GMT wibbled:  [ very interesting (yawn) stuff deleted, because I'm like that... ]  : Formal training is in my view absolutely essential if you're going to : be able to ride a bike properly and safely.

If you were to ask a Buddhist atheist...    Actually, yes and no, Hell is eternal death.  Actually, the way       I've had it related to me, it's more of an eternal damnation,      where sinners will feel the licking flames of Hell.  If I      supposedly can feel these flames, I would assume I'm still      alive, but suffering and away from God.

Canon (from the latin) means a rule.  If we say that a rule is open then its a rule made to be broken.   There is an issue also of measurement against a rule.  Thus the words that are spoken need to be compared against the rule/canon but not added to the canon.  Is new revelation necessary?  Topical, current, personal revelation I'd say is necessary.  New revelation for all people for all times is not necessary as we have that in Scripture.  You also seem to confuse canon with scripture.  Scripture may speak of itself being open - ie God speaking today.  It would speak that it is closed in the sense that the canon is unchangeable.  (Though the concept of canon is later historically.)   I agree with the problem of confusion.  If prophecy is meant to encourage, exhort or correct then is an overlap with scripture.  If prophecy is meant to bring a `word' of the form \\\"the man you live with is not your husband\\\" then that is knowledge.  Yet the exact words their are scripture. I would expect the difference to be the motive and means for delivery. The reading of scripture itself can be a powerful force.  Regards  David\",\"  Yes.   Look up XV_DEPTH.

Hopefully, you won't get flamed, either.  You will, however, be argued with.  I personally think that your project is built on unsteady ground.  First, I do not believe that there is any way to find an \\\"objective morality\\\".  Morality and value are inherently subjective - they represent the beliefs of a person or a group of people.  They can be widely held, perhaps even overwhelmingly held, but they are never and _can_ never be objective.   Second, I do not accept the assumptions that you make here.  If, as you say, you are trying to be objective, then why accept a morality to begin with by using the Christian Bible?  You're defeating your own purpose by doing so.    Third, call me a pessimist, but you won't stop the flamage.  There will always be people who pop upin alt.sex.* to tell us how sick and twisted and evil we all are.  Just out of curiosity, do alt.sex readers show up unprovoked in the religion groups to tell you all that you are narrow-minded, censoring, overbearing totalitarianists?    Hm.  Let me provide an example.  Four people get together over dinner, to discuss morality: you, me, a rather conservative Moslem, and a sociopath.  I start off by saying that I think it's immoral to force people to have sex with you.  You agree, but also say that it is immoral to have sex with someone of your own gender.  (Just a note: I really don't know your views on homosexuality, I am just using this as a common view of morality for the purposes of this example.)  The Moslem says that it is immoral for women to have their faces uncovered.  The sociopath, who has become bored, kills all three of us and eats us, but feels no guilt because he has done nothing wrong morally in his own mind.

Yes, and this theme is usually what the better stories are about.  However, they are not always selfish - I could point to examples in the work of Elf Sternberg, for example.

Your Whole Picture [TM] unfortunately only applies to people who accept your church.           In addition, if sex is for procreation, then  1) Why did God make it pleasurable, so that people would want to do it, rather than building it in as instinct? 2) Why did God make it fallible?  Not every sexual encounter results in pregnancy, even among Catholics.  Does this mean that they have sinned?     Granted.   Pornography would not tend in those directions if there were not a demand for it.  Many people have violent fantasies that they would never act out in real life, but will think about and read about and mull over.

What if it relates to something that isn't explicitly spelled out in the Quran?  Also, the Quran wasn't written down during the life of Muhammed either.

It is positively the worst car I have ever owned. I had an 83 Prelude that had 160k miles on it when I sold it, and it was still going strong .  This is with religious attention to maintenance such as oil changes etc. Both cars were driven in exactly the same manner..    1. It has gone through two clutches (which are underrated.)   2. 3 sets of tires (really eats tires in the front even with careful align)   3. All struts started leaking about 25-30k miles   4. Windshield wiper motor burned up (service note on this one)   5. Seek stop working on radio about 20k miles   6. Two timing belts.   7. Constant error signals from computer.    8. And finally. A rod bearing went out on the No. 1 piston seriously damaging      the crankshaft, contaminating the engine etc. When the overhaul was done      last week it required new crankshaft, one new cam shaft (has two) because      the camshaft shattered when they tried to mill it. The camshaft took 4      weeks to get because it is on national back order.        Everything on the engine is unique to the 1986 year. They went to a new      design in 87.

The Israelis are much worse than the Nazis ever were anyway.  The Nazis did a lot of good for Germany, and they would have succeeded if it weren't for the damn Jews.

Why shouldn't cost and safety be used (at least in part) to determine legality?  I'd like to see you *prove* that drug legalization is an idiotic idea. Seems to me the evidence from Great Britain is pretty convincing that  drug legalization is a good idea.  Even such a noted conservative as William F. Buckley supports it.

(Well, there's also my policy of never picking a Buck Rodgers' team for last)   The 1961 Angels were  1/2 game out of 7th. The Athletics and  expansion Senators finished tied for last.  The 1962 Colt 45's finshed 8th - ahead of the Cubs (the Mets were last). The 1969 Royals finshed 4th - ahead of the White Sox (the Pilots in last). The 1977 Mariners finished 6th - ahead of the Athletics(in last).  Apparently being an expansion team with a poor A's or Chicago  team around is a `good thing'   This may be an appropriate comparison. The 1929-31 Yankees finshed 2nd, 3rd and 2nd finshing  18, 16 and 13-1/2 games out of first.  In 1933,'34 and '35 they also finished second ( though they were only 7, 7 and 3 games out).

The four stage version is used mostly for escape (and geosynchronous?) orbits, while the 3 stage version is used for low earth orbits.  Since this is the version that launched Mir and the Salyuts (and the add-on modules for Mir), as long as Centaur is smaller than Mir (which I believe it is), it should fit under the shroud.

 Good point. I have no idea how either of my Hondas will handle at 100+ mph, nor do they reach 155. However, using `high' to be 70-90 mph:  a) They are quite amenable to long high speed drives. I've done several 1k mile+ trips in my Civic with no problems whatsoever. The last big trip I made was driving from New York to Texas. I remember driving 700-800 miles a day at typically 75-85 mph  without any problems. I'm sure I   would have been more comfortable driving a benz, but no white knuckles. No problems with winds and curves.   Then there was the trip back from New Orleans after Mardi Gras - where we were doing 80+ all the way to Houston. No problems.  b) Both my cars have surprising good fuel economy at high speeds. I see no difference between sustained 60 mph and sustained 80mph. On the trip back from New Orleans, we got about 30 mpg in my Integra, quite ok. Mind you, the engine revs to almost 4k at 80. The civic is markedly better than the Integra in fuel economy. 50k miles down the road, I still get 35 mpg at 70-75 mph driving.    Now now, you can't compare a diesel with a gasoline engine. I see enough bmws and gasoline mercs for sale that have 100-150k miles on them and advertise  rebuilt engines. If honda was to build an accord for 30k, I'd darn well expect the sucker to last 300k miles.   Ever got caught behind a early 80's 300SDL at a stop light? It's not pleasant. The newer MB's are a lot better though. The diesel Volvos and VWs are probably the smelliest offenders.  As for economy, why should we care? Gas is cheap! I personally wouldn't buy a diesel car for any reason - what does it buy me?  Shantanu Ganguly Somerset (Motorola)\",\"Eric, send me your email address, I lost it!

The resulting output (admittedly a personal taste) is very ANNOYING to look at. Back when I was using SunOS 4.1.2, I remember their man pages have some keywords displayed with underlining....

Back in September I was listening to WIP, and I remember the morning guys were talking with Mayor Ed Rendell.  The topic of conversation was a new ball park for the Phillies.  The location for this new park was suggested to be near 30th St Station.  At the time, the mayor was optimisitic that in the future this could become a reality.  Has there been any new news on this subject or is it still a pipe dream? I know the city of Philadelphia has other projects ahead, such as the new convention center and the upcoming Spectrum II.  But it would be nice to see this a reality.  It is planned that the Phillies leave the VET and leave it solely to the Eagles (and if that's the case, the Eagles should make the VET a grass stadium, but that's another story).  I want to see that day!\",\"  I love it when magazine writers make stupid statements like that re: performance. Where do they get those numbers? I'll list the actual performance ranges, which should convince anyone that such a statement is absurd:\",\" Tests suck! Post a real message! :^) \",\"  And some comments, with some players deleted.   Yep, that Kevin Mitchell.  I never would have expected him in the #1 spot.  It's no accident that the first two names are 1988 only.  As with first and second base, 1988 was the year of the glove.  Average DA was 20 points higher in both leagues than any other year.  Looks good.  Too bad he's moving to short.  Highest five-year regular, though he's only had one year as good as Kevin Mitchell :->.  The other elite fielders in the league.  This is an interesting line.  His 1988 figure was slightly below average. His 1990 was pathetic, and his 1991 was the next best year by anybody.  Part of that may be his mobility.  1988 was with the Yankees.  1990 was with the Padres, who appear to have a rotten infield.  1991 was with the Twins, and judging by Leius and Gaetti, the Metrodome may be a good place to play third.  Add another to the elite fielders list.  Too fielders whose career average may overstate their value.  I don't know what happened to Caminiti -- judging by the three previous years, his low 1992 may be a fluke.  Sabo is merely average, however.  His incredible 1988 (best year ever) brings his average up a lot.  Strange last two years.  According to reputation, one of the best fielders ever at third base. But at the end, he was below average.  (Average in 1988 was .643).  Boggs has been pretty good.  I don't know what happened in 1990, but every other year he has been above average, usually by quite a bit.  Last year -- a fluke or a portent?  Why is it that the two leagues usually have defensive averages very close to one another, but very different from year to year?  Any ideas?  Brook  is declining.  Three first-time regulars, above average in 1992.  I'm not sure why Jefferies gets all the grief about his fielding.  He's never had a good year, but while at second he improved to become an average fielder, and is an average fielder at third.  Zeile, on the other hand, is a below average fielder.  Each year he's about 10 points below average.  And it's probably not just the park, since Terry Pendleton had excellent DAs in the three years before this.  Moving back to second was a good idea.  So why is Hayes supposed to be good defensively?  He's had a grand total of one year above the league DA, and was pretty bad last year.  Howard Johnson and Carney Lansford -- separated at birth.  To his credit, HoJo did have one above average year (1990).  Lansford couldn't even break the .600 mark without the help of the year of the glove.  Good hitter, but his fielding needs work.  Not a good fielder.  Both are better off at shortstop.  Two consecutive horrible years for Leo.  Camden Yards doesn't seem to have helped his fielding any.    Texas slugger debuts with not only the lowest career DA, but the lowest DA at third ever.  Congratulations, Dean. --  Dale J.

Hesketh only pitched one inning yesterday afternoon, his first outing since an aborted 1-1/3 inning start 6 days before, so he should be plenty rested to go in his expected turn this Saturday, as the 5th starter.

I can see the liability of putting stickers on the car while it was moving, or something, but it's the BDI that chooses to start and then drive the car in a known unsafe condition that would (seem to be) liable.

Sorry for the wasted bandwidth and my appalling ignorance.\",\"I noticed several years ago that when I took analgesics fairly regularly, (motrin at the time), I seemed to get a lot of migraines.  But had forgotten about that until I started reading some of the posts here. I generally don't take NSAIDS or Tylenol for headaches, because I've found them to be ineffective.  However, I have two other pain sources that force me to take NSAIDS (currently Naprosyn).  First, is some pelvic pain that I get at the beginning of my period, and then much worse at midcycle.  I have had surgery for endometriosis in the past (~12 years ago), so the Drs. tell me that my pain is probably due to the endometriosis coming back.  I've tried Synarel, it reduced the pain while I took it (3 mos), but the pain returned immediately after I stopped.  Three doctors have suggested hysterectomy as the only \\\"real solution\\\" to my problem.  Although I don't expect to have any more children, I don't like the idea of having my uterus and one remaining ovary removed (the first ovary was removed when I had the surgery for endometriosis).  One of the Drs that suggested I get a hysterectomy is an expert in laser surgery, but perhaps thinks that type of procedure is only worthwhile on women who still plan to have children.  So basically all I'm left with is toughing out the pain.  This would be impossible without Naprosyn (or something similar - but not aspirin, that doesn't work, and Motrin gave me horrible gastritis a few years ago, so I'm through with it).  In fact, Naprosyn works very well at eliminating the pain if I take it regularly as I did when I had severe back pain (and pain in both  legs) as I'll discuss in a moment.  Generally though, I wait until I have the pain before I take the Naprosyn, but then it takes several hours for it reduce the pain (it's actually quite effective at reducing the pain, it just takes quite a while).  In the meantime I'm frequently in severe pain.  The other pain source I have is chronic lower back pain resulting in bilateral radiculopathy.  I've had MRIs, Xrays, CT scan, and EMGs (I've had 2 of them, and don't intend to ever do that again) with nerve conduction tests.  The tests have not been conclusive as to what is causing my back and leg pain.  The MRI reports both say I have several bulging, degeneratig disks, and from the Xrays (and MRI, I think) it is apparent that I have arthritis.  The reading on the CT scan was that there are two herniations (L3-L4, and L4-L5), but others hav looked at the films and concluded that there are no herniations. The second EMG and nerve conduction studies shows significant denervation compared to the first EMG.  Oh yeah, I had some other horrible test, called something like Somatic Evoked Response which showed that the \\\"internal nerves\\\" are working fine.   Anyway, the bottom line is that I sometimes have severe pain in both legs and back pain.  The back pain is there all the time, but I can live with it.  When the leg pain is there, I need some analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication to reduce the pain to a level where I can work.  So I took Naprosyn regulary for 6-9 months (every time I tried to stop the leg pain got worse, so I'd  always resume).  Since last November I have taken it much less frequently, and primarily for the pelvic pain.  I have been going to physical therapy for the last 8 months (2-3 times a week).  After the first month or so, my therapist put me on pelvic traction (she had tried it earlier, but it had caused a lot of pain in my back, this time she tried it at a lower weight).  After a month or two, the pain in my legs began going away (but the traction aways caused discomfort in my lower back, which could be reduced with ultrasound and massage).  So now, I don't have nearly as much pain in my legs, in fact my therapist took me off traction about 2 weeks ago.  Getting back to my original reason for this post...  Even if I can avoid taking analgesic for headaches, I really can't avoid them entirely because I have other pain sources, that \\\"force\\\" me to use them (Oh, I forgot to mention that it has been suggested to me that I have back surgery, but I'm avoiding that too).  I find the migraines difficult to deal with, occassionally I have to take off work, but usually I can work, but at a reduced capacity (I'm a systems engineer and do a lot of reading and writing).  When the pelvic pain is bad, I can't concentrate much, I usually end up jumping out of my chair every few minutes, because the pain is so bothersome.  When the pain in my back is bad, it can cause severe burning in both legs, shooting pains in my legs, electric shock type of pain in my feet and toes, and basically when it gets bad I can't really sit at all.  Then I end up spending most of my time home and in bed.  So even if the analgesics contribute to the migraines, the migraines are more tolerable than the other pain sources.  I get a lot of migraines, an average of 3 to 4 a month, which last 1-3 days. I've taken cafergot (the first time the caffiene really got to me so I reduced the dosage), but I don't like the side effects (if I take more than two I get diahrea).  If I get a very bad headache, I will eventually take the cafergot.  My neurologist wasn't very helpful when I told him my problems with cafergot, he said that when sumatriptan becomes available, I should try that.  I've tried several other medications (fiornal, midrin, fiornal with codeine, tegretol, and inderal) but they either didn't work, or I couldn't tolerate them.  So what can I do? My doctor's seem to be satisfied with me just trying to tolerate the pain, which I agree with most of the time, but not when I have a lot of pain.  I've had some bad experiences with surgery (my heart stopped once from the anesthesia - I was told that it was likely the succinylcholine), and I've already had surgery several times.  Anyway, the point of what I'm saying is that even if analgesics can contribute to migraines, some people NEED to take them to tolerate other pain.\",\"\\\"Space Station Redesign Leader Says Cost Goal May Be Impossible\\\"  Today (4/6) the Washington Post ran an article with the headline shown above. The article starts with \\\"A leader of the NASA team in charge of redesigning the planned space station said yesterday the job is tough and may be impossible.\\\" O'Connor is quoted saying whether it is possible to cut costs that much and still provide for meaningful research \\\"is a real question for me.\\\" O'Connor said \\\"everything is fair game,\\\" including \\\"dropping or curtailing existing contracts with the aerospace industry, chopping management of the space station program at some NASA facilities around the country, working closely with the Russian space station Mir, and using unmanned Titan rockets to supplement the manned space shuttle fleet.\\\"  O'Connor says his team has reviewed 30 design options so far, and they are sorting the serious candidates into three categories based on cost.  The Post says O'Connor described the design derived from the current SSF as a high cost option (I believe Kathy Sawyer, the Post writer, got confused here. I listened in on part of O'Connor's briefing to the press on Monday, and in one part of the briefing O'Connor talked about how the White House wants three options, sorted by cost [low, medium, and high]. In another part of the briefing, he discussed the three teams he has formed to look at three options [SSF derivative @ LaRC, modular buildup with Bus-1 @ MSFC, and Single Launch Core [\\\"wingless Orbiter\\\"] @ JSC. Later, in response to a reporters question, I thought I heard O'Connor say the option based on a SSF redesign was a \\\"moderate\\\" cost option, in between low & high cost options. Not the \\\"high cost\\\" option as Sawyer wrote).  The article goes on to describe the other two options as \\\"one features modules that could gradually be fitted together in orbit, similar to the Russian Mir. The other is a core facility that could be deposited in orbit in a single launch, like Skylab. That option would use existing hardware from the space shuttle - the fuselage, for example, in its basic structure.\\\"\",\"#>So instead of calling it interest on deposits, you call it *returns on investements* #>and instead of calling loans you call it *investing in business* (that is in other words #>floating stocks in your company).  # #No, interest is different from a return on an investment.

It was just as alarming to us as to you; the Bible says that nobody knows when the second coming will take place. \",\" And has been rather thoroughly demolished as myth by Robert Scott Root- Bernstein.  See his book, \\\"Discovering\\\".  Ring structures for benzene had been proposed before Kekule', after him, and at the same time as him. The current models do not resemble Kekule's.  Many of the predecessors of Kekule's structure resemble the modern model more.  I don't think \\\"extra-scientific\\\" is a very useful phrase in a discussion of the boundaries of science, except as a proposed definiens.  Extra-rational is a better phrase.  In fact, there are quite a number of well-known cases of extra-rational considerations driving science in a useful direction.  For example, Pasteur discovered that racemic acid was a mixture of enantiomers (the origin of stereochemistry) partly because he liked a friend's crank theory of chemical action.  The friend was wrong, but Pasteur's discovery stood.  A prior investigator (Mitscherlich), looking at the same phenomenon, had missed a crucial detail; presumably because he lacked Pasteur's motivation to find something that distinguished racemic acid from tartaric (now we say: d-tartaric) acid.  Again, Pasteur discovered the differential fermentation of enantiomers (tartaric acid again) not because of some rational conviction, but because he was trying to produce yeast that lived on l-tartaric acid.  His notebooks contained fantasies of becoming the \\\"Newton of mirror-image life,\\\" which he never admitted publically.  Perhaps the best example is the discovery that DNA carries genes.  Avery started this work because of one of his students, and ardent Anglophile and Francophobe Canadian, defended Fred Griffiths' discoveries in mice. Most of Griffiths' critics were French, which decided the issue for the student.  Avery told him to replicate Griffiths' work in vitro, which the student eventually did, whereupon Avery was convinced and started the research program which, in 15 or so years, produced the famous discovery (Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty, JEM 1944).\",\" I'm not sure it is a major limiting move... in the academic circles I've seen, arguing for increased government intervention and management is almost always a plus (not the least because it usually means more high paying jobs for academics as \\\"advisors\\\").  Also consider that it looks like Denning has some decent NSA / government connections, which is always a plus for an academic institute that wants more government funding and work tossed their way.  Despicable, yes; career limiting, well, the publicity probably outweighs the drawbacks.  And there are a whole bunch of people who think the whole thing is just peachy keen. If it's only going to be used against drug dealers, child pornographers, and terrorists, well it must be good. :p\",\"I suspect that this clipper thing could backfire on the Gov in a big hurry. I expect that products using these chips will socket them rather than soldering them, since once the keys are handed over by the escrow agencies, the chip is so much garbage, and will need to be replaced. I expect that someone will come along with a pin compatible chip that uses secure encryption -- possibly even disguised so that it's not possible to tell it from the clipper chip until you try to use the 2 backdoor keys.     If I were to manufacture such a chip, as part of my marketing strategy, I would try to subvert one or both escrow agencies either through bribes or industrial espionage -- and then publicize the fact. (doing my best not to be connected with such activities -- which would likely not be legal :-) Publicly discrediting the escrow agencies would go quite far towards creating a market for a secure alternative.    I also believe that someone will reverse engineer the clipper chip, and knowlege of the algorithm will likely be fairly widespread. Any back- doors or weaknesses would further discredit the scheme, and help grow the market demand for a secure alternative.   I believe that the company that provides such an alternative will make few friends in the LE community, but lots of money. I also believe that the government will do it's best to make such plug replacements illegal. I expect that they will see the same success in limiting the availability of such alternatives as they have seen in limiting the availability of certain illicit drugs -- ie. little to none.\",\"I want to start a DSP project that can maniplate music in a stereo cassette.

Helsingfors IFK have been around since 1897 but fans only started taking hockey seriously in the 1960s so I think you're exagerating here.   That's a rather bold claim, in the light of how successful the Canadian & American Olympic teams have been . . . and they've had to play according to our set of rules and on international ice. The 1992 Olympic teams contained about as much talent as your average expansion team. Canada had Eric Lindros, Sean Burke, Joe Juneau and Chris Kontos. Another four or five have been deep subs in the NHL. As for the Yanks, Keith Tkachuk, Scott Lachance, Bret Hedican, Shawn  McEachern, Steve Heintze, Ted Donato, Joe Sacco and Bill Guerin have been  3rd/4th line players in the NHL, while Robb Stauber has done well for the  Kings in goal. Nothing more. In fact, I'm sure that an All-Star team assembled from the best Finnish League teams would do no better in the NHL than Hartford  or Tampa Bay currently are doing. --- But what happens if _all_ top-class Finnish & Swedish players gradually end up with Helsinki & Stockholm as the North American-based ones gradually retire and no Canadian/American team is allowed to draft new players from Scandinavia?  Here is what THE HOCKEY NEWS scouts think of our NHL-based players:  (28-30=superstar) (23-27=star) (18-22=NHL regular+) (13-17=NHL regular) ( 8-12=role player)  FINLAND:    D-Jyrki Lumme.......20 D-Teppo Numminen....20 D-Peter Ahola.......13  C-Jari Kurri........25 C-Christian Ruuttu..16  R-Teemu Selanne.....27  L-Esa Tikkanen......20 (Obviously, Selanne's ratings would be higher today than they were in January)  SWEDEN: D-Ulf Samuelsson....21 D-Fredrik Olausson..20 D-Niklas Lidstrom...18 D-Calle Johansson...18 D-Kjell Samuelsson..17 D-Tommy Sjodin......13 D-Tommy Albelin......7  C-Mats Sundin.......26 C-Thomas Steen......18  R-Thomas Sandstrom..22 R-Ulf Dahlen........18 R-Michael Nylander..13  L-Per-Erik Eklund...18 L-Johan Garpenlov...16 L-Mikael Andersson..15 L-Jan Erixon........14  This would be interesting. Clearly, Finland's top five players (Winnipeg's Selanne & Numminen, Vancouver's Lumme, Los Angeles' Jari Kurri and New York's Tikkanen) are right up there with any five-man unit Pittsburgh & co. have. But I have my doubts about the home-based Finnish players - the national team did well in the Canada Cup and World Championships largely due to the efforts of Markus Ketterer (the goalie), 3-4 or the players listed above and luck. There's presumably a lot of decent players in Finland that wouldn't be superstars at the highest level but still valuable role players, however. My guess would be that the Finnish Canada Cup team would be a .500 team in the NHL. --- Sweden is easier to judge because they have more players in North America. Their points total (16 players) is 274 - seven more than Ottawa's 22 top players combined! If we estimate there are six more NHL regulars back home in  Sweden, an all-Swedish team would assemble about 350-360 skill points. Deducting some points from Pittsburgh, NY Rangers and other teams that rely on Swedish players, the Swedish team would finish in sixth place - about as high as Boston, Vancouver, Calgary and Montreal on paper! So, the \\\"dynasty\\\" talk isn't completely unfounded here. An all-Finnish/all-Swedish team might have an advantage because the players would be playing at home half of the time, won't have to adapt to a foreign country and a foreign language, and presumably play the wide-open European variant of hockey rather than have to learn the North American checking game. However, if free agency becomes a factor the top  Scandinavian players still might end up playing for large-market teams after a  couple of years the same way Edmonton's \\\"dynasty\\\" crumbled in the late '80s.  Some fringe players likely will be drafted by other NHL teams as having an  exclusive talent pool might be a bit unfair after all. I'd settle for a  compromise, prohibit all European teams from signing a North American during  the first two rounds but allow them to keep their top two players. After this,  the amateur draft should be open to anyone.  \",\" I'd be willing to make two wagers: 1) Snow doesn't win ROY. 2) Mattingly is out of baseball within five years.  I'm skeptical of the first, because I don't think Snow is that good a player, and he is on a losing team.  I'm skeptical of the second because of his back.  Mattingly is 32 this year, and how many players play until they are 40?  Not too many, and most of them didn't have chronic back problems when they were 32.  Could be wrong on either or both, but I think that's the smart way to bet...\",\" Jim, please, that's a lame explanation of the trinity that Jesus provides above.

Sorry, but the events today made me even more negative concering organized religion.  Cheers, Kent\",\" Ever hear about cutting off the electricity? That was done. How effective is an electric stove then?\",\"  I sure hope so. Because, the unspeakable crimes of the Armenians must  be righted. Armenian invaders burned and sacked the fatherland of  Urartus, massacred and exterminated its population and presented to  the world all those left from the Urartus, as the Armenian civilization.  All reliable Western historians describe how Armenians ruthlessly exterminated 2.5 million Muslim women, children and elderly people of  Eastern Anatolia and how they collaborated with the enemies of the  Ottoman Empire between 1914-1920.  It is unfortunately a truth that Armenians are known as collaborators of the Nazis during World War II and that, even today, criminal/Nazi members of the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism Triangle preach and instigate racism, hatred, violence and terrorism among peoples.   And x-Soviet Armenia continues its anti-Turkish policy in the following  ways:  1. x-Soviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide in order to shift international public opinion away from its political responsibility.  2. x-Soviet Armenia, employing ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism  Triangle and criminal/Nazi Armenians, attempts to call into question the  veracity of the Turkish Genocide.  3. x-Soviet Armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism through the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to  silence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests.  4. Using all its human, financial, and governmental resources, x-Soviet Armenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence through terrorism, bribery and other subversive methods, non-Turkish supporters of the Turkish cause, be they political, governmental and humanitarian.  Using all the aforementioned methods, the x-Soviet Armenian government  is attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community from making the Turkish Case a contemporary issue.  Yet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian government and its terrorist and revisionist organizations, in the last decades, thanks to the struggle  of those whose closest ones were systematically exterminated by the Armenians, the international wall of silence on this issue has begun to collapse, and  consequently a number of governments and organizations have become  supportive of the recognition of the Turkish Genocide.

What is probably the most convincing is the anti-Christian literature put out by the Jewish councils in the second century.  There are enormous quantities of detailed arguments against Christianity, many of the arguments still being used today.  Despite volumes of tracts attacking Christianity, not one denies the existance of Jesus, only of his activities.    I find this considerably more compelling than Josephus or the harmony of the gospels (especially considering that Matthew and Luke probably used Mark as a source).\",\"ha... all this talk about changing the clock speed of the q700 makes me ask??  if i replaced the 8mhz 68000 in my plus with a 16mhz 68000 with a 16mhz clock occilater of its own( not shared by the rest of the mac... just the new 16mhz68000)  would my mac work..... and if it would work.. would you think there where be any problems with sound, vidio,scsi........  it seems like a simple solution to keepa dead slow mechine a live a little longer..

WordPerfect encryption has been shown to be very easy to break.   The method uses XOR with two repeating key streams: a typed password   and a byte-wide counter initialized to 1+<the password length>. Full   descriptions are given in Bennett [BEN87] and Bergen and Caelli   [BER91].    decrypt WordPerfect document files and I think I have a solution.    There is a software company named: Accessdata (87 East 600 South,   Orem, UT 84058), 1-800-658-5199 that has a software package that will   decrypt any WordPerfect, Lotus 1-2-3, Quatro-Pro, MS Excel and Paradox   files. The cost of the package is $185. Steep prices, but if you   think your pw key is less than 10 characters, (or 10 char) give them a   call and ask for the free demo disk. The demo disk will decrypt files   that have a 10 char or less pw key.''  * How do I break a Vigenere (repeated-key) cipher?    A repeated-key cipher, where the ciphertext is something like the   plaintext xor KEYKEYKEYKEY (and so on), is called a Vigenere cipher.   If the key is not too long and the plaintext is in English, do the   following:     1. Discover the length of the key by counting coincidences.   (See Gaines [GAI44], Sinkov [SIN66].) Trying each displacement of   the ciphertext against itself, count those bytes which are equal.    If the two ciphertext portions have used the same key, something   over 6% of the bytes will be equal. If they have used different   key, then less than 0.4% will be equal (assuming random 8-bit bytes   of key covering normal ASCII text). The smallest displacement which   indicates an equal key is the length of the repeated key.    2. Shift the text by that length and XOR it with itself. This   removes the key and leaves you with text XORed with itself. Since   English has about 1 bit of real information per byte, 2 streams of   text XORed together has 2 bits of info per 8-bit byte, providing   plenty of redundancy for choosing a unique decryption. (And in fact   one stream of text XORed with itself has just 1 bit per byte.)    If the key is short, it might be even easier to treat this as a   standard polyalphabetic substitution. All the old cryptanalysis   texts show how to break those. It's possible with those methods, in   the hands of an expert, if there's only ten times as much text as key.   See, for example, Gaines [GAI44], Sinkov [SIN66].  * How do I send encrypted mail under UNIX? [PGP, RIPEM, PEM, ...]    Here's one popular method, using the des command:      cat file | compress | des private_key | uuencode | mail    Meanwhile, there is a de jure Internet standard in the works called   PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail). It is described in RFCs 1421 through   1424. To join the PEM mailing list, contact pem-dev-request@tis.com.   There is a beta version of PEM being tested at the time of this   writing.    There are also two programs available in the public domain for encrypting   mail: PGP and RIPEM.  Both are available by FTP.  Each has its own   newsgroup: alt.security.pgp and alt.security.ripem.  Each has its own FAQ   as well.    PGP is most commonly used outside the USA since it uses the RSA algorithm   without a license and RSA's patent is valid only (or at least primarily)   in the USA.    RIPEM is most commonly used inside the USA since it uses the RSAREF which   is freely available within the USA but not available for shipment outside   the USA.    Since both programs use a secret key algorithm for encrypting the body of   the message (PGP used IDEA; RIPEM uses DES) and RSA for encrypting the   message key, they should be able to interoperate freely.  Although there   have been repeated calls for each to understand the other's formats and   algorithm choices, no interoperation is available at this time (as far as   we know).  * Is the UNIX crypt command secure?    No. See [REE84]. There is a program available called cbw (crypt   breaker's workbench) which can be used to do ciphertext-only attacks   on files encrypted with crypt. One source for CBW is [FTPCB].  * How do I use compression with encryption?    A number of people have proposed doing perfect compression followed by   some simple encryption method (e.g., XOR with a repeated key).    Unfortunately, you can only compress perfectly if you know the exact   distribution of possible inputs. For all practical purposes it's   impossible to describe ``the typical English text'' beyond coarse   characteristics such as single-letter frequencies. You can build up   more and more sophisticated models of your inputs, but if the enemy   has a slightly more accurate model, he'll be able to find some   redundancy in your compressed output.    Note that nearly all practical compression schemes, unless they   have been designed with cryptography in mind, produce output that   actually starts off with high redundancy. For example, the output of   UNIX compress begins with a well-known three-byte ``magic number''   that can serve as an entering wedge for cryptanalysis.      This is not to say that compression before encryption is inherently a   bad idea; it just has to be done very, very carefully, and by no means   removes the need for strong encryption.    Compression after encryption is silly.  * Is there an unbreakable cipher?    Yes. The one-time pad is unbreakable; see part 4. Unfortunately the   one-time pad requires secure distribution of as much key material as   plaintext.    Of course, a cryptosystem need not be utterly unbreakable to be   useful. Rather, it needs to be strong enough to resist attacks by   likely enemies for whatever length of time the data it protects is   expected to remain valid.  * What does ``random'' mean in cryptography?    Cryptographic applications demand much more out of a pseudorandom   number generator than most applications. For a source of bits to be   cryptographically random, it must be computationally impossible to   predict what the Nth random bit will be given complete knowledge of   the algorithm or hardware generating the stream and the sequence of   0th through N-1st bits, for all N up to the lifetime of the source.    A software generator (also known as pseudo-random) has the function   of expanding a truly random seed to a longer string of apparently   random bits.  This seed must be large enough not to be guessed by   the opponent.  Ideally, it should also be truly random (perhaps   generated by a hardware random number source).    Those who have Sparcstation 1 workstations could, for example,   generate random numbers using the audio input device as a source of   entropy, by not connecting anything to it.  For example,   cat /dev/audio | compress - >foo    gives a file of high entropy (not random but with much randomness in   it).  One can then encrypt that file using part of itself as a key,   for example, to convert that seed entropy into a pseudo-random   string.    When looking for hardware devices to provide this entropy, it is   important really to measure the entropy rather than just assume that   because it looks complicated to a human, it must be \\\"random\\\".  For   example, disk operation completion times sound like they might be   unpredictable (to many people) but a spinning disk is much like a   clock and its output completion times are relatively low in entropy.  * What is the unicity point (a.k.a. unicity distance)?    See [SHA49]. The unicity distance is an approximation to that amount   of ciphertext such that the sum of the real information (entropy) in   the corresponding source text and encryption key equals the number   of ciphertext bits used. Ciphertexts significantly longer than this   can be shown probably to have a unique decipherment. This is used to   back up a claim of the validity of a ciphertext-only cryptanalysis.    Ciphertexts significantly shorter than this are likely to have   multiple, equally valid decryptions and therefore to gain security   from the opponent's difficulty choosing the correct one.    Unicity distance, like all statistical or information-theoretic   measures, does not make deterministic predictions but rather gives   probabilistic results: namely, the minimum amount of ciphertext   for which it is likely that there is only a single intelligible   plaintext corresponding to the ciphertext, when all possible keys   are tried for the decryption. Working cryptologists don't normally   deal with unicity distance as such. Instead they directly determine   the likelihood of events of interest.    Let the unicity distance of a cipher be D characters. If fewer than   D ciphertext characters have been intercepted, then there is not   enough information to distinguish the real key from a set of   possible keys. DES has a unicity distance of 17.5 characters,   which is less than 3 ciphertext blocks (each block corresponds to   8 ASCII characters). This may seem alarmingly low at first, but   the unicity distance gives no indication of the computational work   required to find the key after approximately D characters have been   intercepted.    In fact, actual cryptanalysis seldom proceeds along the lines used   in discussing unicity distance. (Like other measures such as key   size, unicity distance is something that guarantees insecurity if   it's too small, but doesn't guarantee security if it's high.) Few   practical cryptosystems are absolutely impervious to analysis; all   manner of characteristics might serve as entering ``wedges'' to crack   some cipher messages. However, similar information-theoretic   considerations are occasionally useful, for example, to determine a   recommended key change interval for a particular cryptosystem.   Cryptanalysts also employ a variety of statistical and   information-theoretic tests to help guide the analysis in the most   promising directions.    Unfortunately, most literature on the application of information   statistics to cryptanalysis remains classified, even the seminal   1940 work of Alan Turing (see [KOZ84]). For some insight into the   possibilities, see [KUL68] and [GOO83].  * What is key management and why is it important?    One of the fundamental axioms of cryptography is that the enemy is in   full possession of the details of the general cryptographic system,   and lacks only the specific key data employed in the encryption. (Of   course, one would assume that the CIA does not make a habit of telling   Mossad about its cryptosystems, but Mossad probably finds out anyway.)   Repeated use of a finite amount of key provides redundancy that can   eventually facilitate cryptanalytic progress. Thus, especially in   modern communication systems where vast amounts of information are   transferred, both parties must have not only a sound cryptosystem but   also enough key material to cover the traffic.    Key management refers to the distribution, authentication, and   handling of keys.    A publicly accessible example of modern key management technology   is the STU III secure telephone unit, which for classified use   employs individual coded ``Crypto Ignition Keys'' and a central Key   Management Center operated by NSA. There is a hierarchy in that   certain CIKs are used by authorized cryptographic control   personnel to validate the issuance of individual traffic keys and   to perform installation/maintenance functions, such as the   reporting of lost CIKs.    This should give an inkling of the extent of the key management   problem. For public-key systems, there are several related issues,   many having to do with ``whom do you trust?''  * Can I use pseudo-random or chaotic numbers as a key stream?    Chaotic equations and fractals produce an apparent randomness from   relatively compact generators. Perhaps the simplest example is a   linear congruential sequence, one of the most popular types of random   number generators, where there is no obvious dependence between seeds   and outputs. Unfortunately the graph of any such sequence will, in a   high enough dimension, show up as a regular lattice. Mathematically   this lattice corresponds to structure which is notoriously easy for   cryptanalysts to exploit. More complicated generators have more   complicated structure, which is why they make interesting pictures---   but a cryptographically strong sequence will have no computable   structure at all.    See [KNU81], exercise 3.5-7; [REE77]; and [BOY89].  * What is the correct frequency list for English letters?    There are three answers to this question, each slightly deeper than   the one before. You can find the first answer in various books:   namely, a frequency list computed directly from a certain sample of   English text. Of course any such list will be ``correctly'' computed,   but exactly which list you get depends on which sample was taken.    The second answer is that the question doesn't make sense. What do   you mean by ``English letters''? The ``English language'' is not a   fixed, finite, closed object that can be exactly characterized. It   has changed over time; it is different between different authors.   Any particular message will have different statistics from those of   the language as a whole.    The third answer is that yes, no particular message is going to have   exactly the same characteristics as English in general, but for all   reasonable statistical uses these slight discrepancies won't matter.   In fact there's an entire field called ``Bayesian statistics'' (other   buzzwords are ``maximum entropy methods'' and ``maximum likelihood   estimation'') which studies questions like ``What's the chance that a   text with these letter frequencies is in English?'' and comes up with   reasonably robust answers.    So make your own list from your own samples of English text. It will   be good enough for practical work, if you use it properly.  * What is the Enigma?    ``For a project in data security we are looking for sources of   information about the German Enigma code and how it was broken by   the British during WWII.''    See [WEL82], [DEA85], [KOZ84], [HOD83], [KAH91].  * How do I shuffle cards?    Card shuffling is a special case of the permutation of an array of   values, using a random or pseudo-random function.  All possible output   permutations of this process should be equally likely.  To do this, you   need a random function (modran(x)) which will produce a uniformly   distributed random integer in the interval [0..x-1].  Given that   function, you can shuffle with the following [C] code: (assuming ARRLTH   is the length of array arr[] and swap() interchanges values at the two   addresses given)    for ( n = ARRLTH-1; n > 0 ; n-- ) swap( &arr[modran( n+1 )], &arr[n] ) ;    modran(x) can not be achieved exactly with a simple (ranno() % x) since   ranno()'s interval may not be divisible by x, although in most cases the   error will be very small.  To cover this case, one can take ranno()'s   modulus mod x, call that number y, and if ranno() returns a value less   than y, go back and get another ranno() value.   * Can I foil S/W pirates by encrypting my CD-ROM?    Someone will frequently express the desire to publish a CD-ROM with   possibly multiple pieces of software, perhaps with each encrypted   separately, and will want to use different keys for each user (perhaps   even good for only a limited period of time) in order to avoid piracy.    As far as we know, this is impossible, since there is nothing in standard   PC or workstation hardware which uniquely identifies the user at the   keyboard.  If there were such an identification, then the CD-ROM could be   encrypted with a key based in part on the one sold to the user and in   part on the unique identifier.  However, in this case the CD-ROM is one   of a kind and that defeats the intended purpose.    If the CD-ROM is to be encrypted once and then mass produced, there must   be a key (or set of keys) for that encryption produced at some stage in   the process.  That key is useable with any copy of the CD-ROM's data.   The pirate needs only to isolate that key and sell it along with the   illegal copy.   * Can you do automatic cryptanalysis of simple ciphers?

One very frequently asked question in sci.crypt is about how the VCR+ codes   work.  The following article attempts to describe it.\",\"There has been quite a bit of discussion about house wiring and grounding practices here.  A few points need to be clarified:  The Equipment GROUNDING conductor, Green, green with a yellow stripe, bare, or the metal sheath or pipe of SOME wiring methods, is used as a safety ground, to carry fault currents back to the circuit breaker panel, and to limit the voltage on the metal case of utilization equipment or other metal objects.  It should never (except for a few exceptions to be discussed later) carry the normal operating current of a connected load.  Some equipment has filters in the power supply which may cause some slight current flow through the grounding conductor.    Much communications or audio equipment is sensitive to noise or slight voltages on the grounding conductor, and may require special wiring of the grounding conductors to provide reliable operation  (\\\"orange\\\" outlets are often used for this, with insulated grounding conductors wired back to the panel box, and in many cases back to the service.  Anyone installing such a system should read both the section on grounding in the National Electric Code and publications on installing quiet isolated ground systems.  The code requires the insulated grounding conductors (green wires) to run with the current carrying conductors back to the panel box, and, if required, back all the way to the service entrance , where it is bonded to the service ground (water pipe or rod)  Many of these systems are installed illegally or unsafely, where they do not provide a safe ground or a quiet ground or either.   The GROUNDED conductor of a circuit, often called the NEUTRAL, which is referred to in the code as the \\\"identified\\\" conductor and is supposed to be white or natural grey.  This conductor is supposed to be connected to ground in most electrical systems at a single point, generally at the service entrance panel.  This connection is through the Main Bonding Jumper.  (In many household service panels, the main bonding jumper is actually a bonding screw which attaches the neutral busbar to the case of the panel)    The Grounded conductor (neutral) is generally a current carrying conductor.  In the case of a 120 volt circuit it is one of the two conductors completing the circuit from the panel to the load device.    Since the grounded conductor (neutral) is only connected to the grounding conductor (bare or green) at the service entrance, if the load is any distance from the service and draws any significant current, there will be a small but measurable voltage between the grounded and grounding conductors at the load, under normal operating conditions.  If you should (incorrectly) connect the grounded (neutral) conductor to the grounding conductor at the load, some of the neutral current will flow instead through the grounding conductor.  Since there will now be current flowing through the grounding conductor, it will also no longer be quite at ground potential at the load end.  If the load equipment has a metal case, which is connected to the grounding conductor through the \\\"U\\\" ground plug, the metal case is now also no longer quite at ground potential.  The difference (under normal, non short-circuit conditions) may be only a few tenths of a volt, but it could also be a volt or two.  This normally does not present a shock hazard.    HOWEVER, if you let the metal case of the grounded equipment come into contact with an independently grounded object such as a water or gas pipe, a radiator, a metal air conditioning duct or such, part of the neutral current will try to flow through this aalternate ground path.  If the contact is not solid, you will get a significant arc (a low voltage, but possibly moderate current arc) Under the wrong conditions, this arcing could start a fire.  It is possible in some cases that the sneak ground current   could also flow through a wire of inadequate size, causing it to overheat.  With the incorrect non single-point grounding of the neutral, if there is a short circuit from hot to neutral, the high short circuit current which may flow will cause a much higher voltage on the grounding conductor, which increases the possibility for shock or fire.    Also if you incorrectly multiply connect the neutral and ground, the voltage on the ground system is seen as noise bu computer or audio equipment, often causing malfunction.  I have spent some hours tracking down such shorts in technical facilities where they were inducing severe hum into equipment.  The Neutral is usually bonded to the ground at the distribution transformer as well as at the service entrance of each dwelling.  This is done primarily for lightning protection, so that induced lightning currents have a short path back to ground, and also to assure that the currents drawn by shorts to grounded objects like pipes draw enough current to trip circuit breakers or blow fuses quickly.  The bad side of this is that not all the neutral current from the dwelling goes through the neutral wire back to the transformer.  Some of it flows through the grounding electrode (water pipe, etc.) this may cause corrosion in the pipes and possibly in things like underground fuel oil tanks, and it may also cause measurable AC magnetic fields due to the large loop between the \\\"hot\\\" conductors in the service and the neutral current in the water pipe and ground.  There are those who feel these fields may be unhealthy.  (don't flame ME on this, I'm just telling you where the field comes from, not it's health effect, as far as I'm concerned, the jury is still out on this.)  Note that the bonding jumper is only installed at the main panel, NOT at any sub distribution panels.  This is one reason why it is illegal to run service entrance cable with the sheath used as a neutral to a sub panel, you must have a seperate insulated conductor for the neutral.  The sheath can be used in this application only as the groundING conductor.  If the neutral is bonded to the grounding conductor in the sub panel, say by forgetting to remove the bonding screw, all the grounding conductors of the loads on that panel will be above ground, with the possible problems listed above.  The code makes exceptions for ranges and dryers, as well as feeds from one building to another.  In the cases of the range and dryer, the neutral may be used as the equipment ground under certain conditions, instead of a seperate wire.  Every time the code is revised, these exceptions come up for review.  These exceptions were, in fact the first required safety grounds, in the days before U ground outlets and such.  The appliance manufacturers don't want to have to redesign their ranges and driers, and the contractors don't want to have to run four wire cable (with four fairly heavy, expensive wires) in place of three wire to the appliances.  No question it would be safer with seperate neutrals to the stove, but the neutral current is low for most burner settings (since most current is in the 220 volt \\\"hots\\\" except at some low settings, the wires are large gauge, and there are few reported cases of injury or damage.  So far, the exceptions have survived. In the case of feeds between buildings, it's primarily for lightning protection.  People doing wiring should be aware what is and what isn't a legal grounding conductor.  Obviously, the bare wire in \\\"romex\\\" 'with ground' is.  Anywhere there is a green wire installed, such as in a portable cord, that is a good grounding conductor.  The sheath of BX clamped in BX connectors in metal boxes is a legal grounding conductor (in the US). (BX has an aluminum band run under the steel sheath to lower the resistance of the sheath.  You can just cut this aluminum band off at the ends, you don't have to bond it to anything, it does its job by touching every turn of the BX sheath.) Conduit or EMT (thinwall tubing) is generally a legal grounding conductor, but may require a bonding locknut where it enters a box or panel, particularly for larger pipes.    \\\"Greenfield\\\" (looks like big BX, but you pull your own wires in the empty sheath after you run it) is NOT a legal grounding conductor, as it doesn't have the aluminum band to bond it, and the spiral steel has too much resistance and inductance.  You have to run a seperate green grounding conductor inside the greenfield.  \\\"Wiremold\\\" is also not a legal grounding conductor, as the paint on the boxes often prevents good contact, and the \\\"feed\\\" to the wiremold extension is often from a box in the wall that may not be well connected to the first wiremold box.  I have personally discovered cases where the entire run of wiremold and the cases of everything plugged into all the outlets on the run were \\\"hot\\\" with 120 volts (Why do I get a shock every time I touch my computer and the radiator here in the office?) because there was no ground wire in the wiremold and one of the outlets had shorted to the edge of the wiremold box.  You must run a ground wire back in the wiremold from the outlets at least to the first box in the original wiring (conduit, BX, etc.) where you can \\\"bond\\\" the wire to the box with a screw, bnding clip, or whatever.  On another issue, while you should ground the green wire/lug on GCFI outlets when ever there is a place to ground them, it is legal in the NEC to use them without a ground if no ground is available.  It is better to have the protection of the Ground fault interrupter than no protection if you don't install it.  The interrupter doesn't depend on the ground to trip.  It is desirable to connect the ground if available, because if the ground is connected, the interrupter will trip as soon as a faulty device is plugged in, whereas without the ground, it will not trip until someone or something provides a ground path.  For those questioning the legal use of ungrounded GCFI's, read in the NEC, 210-7 (d) exception. (This is the 1990 code, my '93 code is in the city, but I know the rule hasn't changed.  It might be renumbered though.)   We have only touched the surface concerning grounding ;-} , there is much more to this subject, but most of you have fallen asleep by now.

Thank you.\",\"      [Patrick's example of anti-competitive regulations for             auto dealers deleted.]  Let me try to drag this discussion back to the original issues.  As I've noted before, I'm not necessarily disputing the benefits of  eliminating anti-competitive legislation with regard to auto dealers, barbers, etc.  One need not, however, swallow the entire libertarian agenda to accomplish this end.  Just because one grants the benefits of allowing anyone who wishes to cut hair to sell his/her services without regulation does not mean that the same unregulated barbers should be  free to bleed people as a medical service without government intervention.   (As some/many libertarians would argue.)    On a case by case basis, the cost/benefit ratio of government regulation is obviously worthwhile.  The libertarian agenda, however, does not call for this assessment.  It assumes that the costs of regulation (of any kind) always outweigh its benefits.  This approach avoids all sorts of  difficult analysis, but it strikes many of the rest of us as dogmatic,  to say the least.  I have no objection to an analysis of medical care, education,  national defense or local police that suggests a \\\"free market\\\" can provide a more effective, efficient means of accomplishing social objectives than is provided through \\\"statist\\\" approaches.   With some notable exceptions, however, I do not see such nitty-gritty, worthwhile  analysis being carried out by self-professed libertarians.    jsh\",\" Unless I've got my notes mixed up, 939 F.2d 499 comes close to this.

(1) Many of my Imakefile's have contructs like   /**/#This is a makefile  at the start of lines to pass Makefile comments thru the C  preprocessor and into the Makefile.  Most of the C preprocessors that  I have used will not treat such a # as appearing at the start of the  line.  Thus the C preprocessor does not treat the hash symbol as the  start of a directive.

I would be interested in knowing what part of the essay you feel condemns national repentance (please quote).\",\"  My knowledge about driving in the U.S. is also second-hand, but I think I can correct your statements about our Autobahn:   Oh yeah, that would be paradise... in fact, you can forget it. From all I've heard from my U.S. relatives, drivers esp. here in Germany are much more agg- ressive, but not disciplined. One of my relatives, a L.A. resident, hired a car at the Nuernberg airport and went about 18 miles to our home. He said then that he grew about 1 year older during this ride and swore he'd never drive a car in Germany again (this was in 1982 and he kept his promise - the situation now is even worse as effect of the increased volume of traffic). What you mean by `better disciplined' should perhaps be considered `cautious due to fear':  When driving around here, you always *have* to take into consideration that the majority of the other drivers absolutely relies on you: They expect that nobody fails or sleeps; many of them exploit this by driving as fast as their car can go (of course only where that is allowed, you might think - dream on :). So any mistake you make is a very high risk to your health - and if you're ex- posed to such a situation from your very first day as a driver, you learn to handle it - or you lose...  That's the way I and most people I know experience our traffic situation -  whether you think this is pleasant or efficient is up to you; I think we handle a very high volume of traffic and that at high speeds with modest (compared to the volume) and decreasing rates of lethal accidents - OTOH, more and more people (esp. women) dislike driving (because they feel overtaxed and threatened) and each accident is one accident too much.   Better designed and maintained, may be - but animal fences are very rare. Auto- bahnen and many other streets have guard-rails (I hope that's the right word -  a plank made from thick steel sheet fixed on uprights; it's about 2 feet high); those guard-rails are designed for keeping vehicles on the road. Smaller animals can crawl under the plank, bigger ones can easily jump over it. The point is that esp. larger animals are very rare in Germany; they tend also to be very timid. Accidents caused by animals are a neglegible danger.   You're right (there are speed linits even on the major part of the Autobahn) - but the attitude towards driving (see above) seems to be very similar to that in Germany (I've been in France, Switzerland, Italy, Austria, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands) - besides that, you really can't rely on the residents abiding the local speed limits. I've got quite a lot of practise (~120k miles) and I'm used to travel at 130 mph (FYI, with a car even smaller than a rabbit), but I consider driving on the highways round Paris or Milano really a thrill...   Sorry, but you'll find quite a lot rabbit-class-car (or even smaller, mine is a Peugeot 205) owners going that fast; small cars with much HP are very `hip' over here - and most people buying such cars aren't afraid to let them run.   I disagree; the size or weight of a car is rather irrelevant. Formula-1 cars weigh less than 700 kg and the drivers have a chance to survive accidents at 130 mph or higher - OTOH when crashing against a solid object at 130 mph, it makes no difference whether you sit in a Porsche, a Mercedes, a tank or on a bicycle: Your're dead.

They would presumably be  punching numbers into a computer, which for all they know could program  the chips in a manner completely independent of the S1 and S2 values they  are feeding into the system.  S1 and S2 are clearly the backdoor - we should assume they are all compromised.  If they're not compromisable, why the hell not use a hardware true random number source.  There isn't a random number source *anywhere* in this proposal.  The whole thing is deterministic from the day the serial number is stamped on the chip.  Nope, it can't be trusted.  This is all about two levels of access - the (possibly honest) key escrow that police forces have to use, and ostensibly the FBI; and the back door that lets the NSA decode *everything* on the fly - and maybe some back-handers to the FBI when they want a warrantless tab in exchange for favours.\",\"  $ The biggest hurdle for automatics (IMHO) is not shifting speed $ per se, but rather the transmission's reaction speed when you $ try to force it to shift manually.   $ [...]  I rented an Oldsmobile Achieva (is that a yuppie name or what?) and a Nissan Stanza.

It is interesting medically because the normal location of organs is caused in part by the \\\"normal\\\" rotation associated with ciliary motion, so that in absence of this, laterality can be \\\"random.\\\" People with situs inversus are quite popular at medical schools, because of their rarity, and the fact that most doctors get a bit upset when they can't find the patient's heart sounds (because they're on the wrong side).   According to Harrison's, immotile cilia syndrom is an autosomal recessive, which should imply that on average one child in four in a family would be affected. But there may be much more current information on this, and as usual in medicine, we may be talking about more than one conditiion.

I believe that automatics should only be manufactured for people with physical disabilities who otherwise would not be able to drive.  Automatic transmissions allow drivers to be lazy. More time is available to fiddle with the radio or to look at the scenery instead of concentrating on the road.  The manual transmission keeps the drive always doing something, granted it isn't a large movement.  Plus, driving should be FUN!  Driving a manual is fun, driving an automatic is a chore.  In the case of shift speed, automatics can be made to shift far faster that any human could move a stick.  If I was racing, I'd want and automatic.  For normal driving go with the manual. \",\"    It was no criticism of Islam for a change, it was a criticism of the arguments used.

EDT                     SECRETARY RILEY:  Good evening and welcome to all of you  in the thousands of communities around the country that are taking  part in this satellite town meeting for the month of April.              You know, today is April 13th.  In 1743, Thomas  Jefferson was born, 250 years ago.  I think that's appropriate to  mention at the beginning of this meeting because since that time he  has been, of course, a person who has been one that we've all  followed in terms of our democracy and the importance of education  here in this great country.  The success of our democracy according  to Jefferson really depends upon the success of our educational  system.              His philosophy of government, his belief in the  importance of education is also very meaningful to our special guest  here this evening.  Tonight we're so pleased to have with us  President Clinton.  He's come over from the White House to join us in  the Chamber of Commerce studios.                Mr. President, it's good to have you.  We thank you for  taking the time to visit with these communities here on the satellite  network and we welcome you here this evening.              Also we have with us Secretary of Labor Robert Reich.   And, Bob, it's certainly pleasant to have you with us this evening  also.              I have some questions for our two guests, and I'm sure  many of you do, too.  So please call us if there's something that  you'd like to ask.  The number is 1/800/368-5781 or 5782.  In  Washington, D.C. the number is 202/463-3170 or 3171.              I believe the President has a few words that he might  want to share with us.  And, Mr. President, I'll ask you to do that  at this time.  It's great to have you.              THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.              I'm glad to be here with my friends, Dick Riley and Bob  Reich -- also members of my Cabinet -- at the headquarters of the  Chamber of Commerce to support the effort that the Chamber is making,  along with its Center for Work Force Preparation, to help to examine  tonight the whole critical question of how to move our young people  from school to the work place.              I want to compliment the Chamber on all their efforts,  recognizing that without an educated work force we can't grow this  economy or remain competitive, and recognizing that we all have to  work together -- business and government, labor and educators -- to  make things happen.              This satellite town meeting is a good example of that  kind of working together.  And if you'll forgive me a little home  state pride, I want to say a special word of thanks to the Wal-Mart  Corporation, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas, for providing  several hundred of the sites for this town meeting tonight.  I  appreciate that a lot, as well as the sites that are provided for all  the rest of you.              I have tried as hard as I could to move toward  constructive change for this country.  Secretary Riley talked about  this being Thomas Jefferson's 250th birthday.  If Thomas Jefferson  believed in anything, he believed in these three things:  first, in  education; second, in real personal liberty, freedom of religion,  freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of the press; and  third, in the absolute imperative of changing as times change.                If you go to the Jefferson Memorial here in this  beautiful city, which is now bedecked with all of its wonderful  cherry blossoms, you will see Jefferson saying that we have to change  with changing times.              For us here in America, that means reducing our deficit  and increasing our investment and putting our people first so that we  can compete in the world.  We're here to talk about that tonight -- about what we can do to educate and train our people better.  Unless  we do that, none of the efforts that all the rest of us make in  government, even to bring the budget into balance, even to increase  our investment in other things which will grow jobs, will last in the  long run.              We also have to have people who can carry their load.   And in a world where the average young person will change jobs seven  or eight times in a lifetime, that begins with the education system  and continues into the work force where education must go on for a  lifetime.  It's not just important what you know, but what you can  learn.              And if I might, I'd like to close just by emphasizing  we're doing our best to try to have the most innovative partnership  between the Labor Department and the Education Department and the  private sector to build a good school-to-work transition.  And we're  trying to get off to a good start this summer with a program that  would create more than 700,000 new summer jobs, including many  thousands that have a strong education component so our young people  can be learning and working at the same time.              Dick, I think I ought to stop there.  That's a good  place we can begin, I think, the discussion.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you so much, Mr. President.              Each month we get together and talk about ways that all  citizens can work towards reaching the national education goals.  And  tonight, we'll focus on goal five, and how communities such as yours  can prepare students for this world of work.              This week, the Education Department and the Labor  Department are hosting a conference here in Washington, D.C. called  Summer Challenge, a program of work and learning, to America's youth.   The aim is to use some special funds from President Clinton's  proposed economic stimulus package to provide educationally-enriched  jobs and summer school programs for young people in disadvantaged  areas of the country.                Mr. President, let's talk a minute -- you alluded to it  somewhat -- about the  Summer Youth Challenge.  Your program calls  for more educational enrichment in the summer jobs.  And why in your  words is that so important?              THE PRESIDENT:  I think it's important for two reasons.   First of all, a lot of the young people we're trying to reach may  have had trouble adjusting to school and learning.  And while we want  them to have a good experience with a real job, we also want them to  continue to learn during the summer because we know from a lot of  research that a lot of kids that have trouble learning in school may  forget as much as 30 percent of what they learned the previous year  over the summertime.  And that is a very unproductive thing for  schools to have to take up a lot of time teaching what they already  taught before.              Secondly, we want to help these young people progress,  not only in terms of work, but in terms of learning.  We want to  abolish the artificial dividing line between what is work and what is  learning because we think that the best and most productive workers  will have to be lifetime learners.  And we think that this experience  could maybe drive that point home and prepare these young people to  succeed in school, or at work, or in college as they go on.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I think the fact that these are  disadvantaged kids -- that gap, that lag you mentioned as they go  into the next year, is really even greater.                Secretary Reich, of course, you have training programs  throughout the year.  And I wonder is you have any comment about this  educational component of training.              SECRETARY REICH:  Well, what we've learned, Mr.  Secretary, is that for many young people, whether it's for the summer  or for the year, actually on-the-job work experience combined with  education is one of the best ways of learning.  Many young people,  for example, have a lot -- they have a difficult time learning  geometry.  But when they actually are there building something or  working on something, and they can see the exact and direct  application of geometry, they understand what it's used for.  And a  lot of young people -- just that sense of connection between  education and the world of work is terribly, terribly important.   It's important during the summer, but it's important for a lot of  young people even beyond the summer.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you.                Mr. President, you've called for a youth apprenticeship  program, school-to-work transition.  And I wonder if you would tell  us a little bit about your concept of that and how you see it  developing.              THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, let's talk about why  it's important.  Most new jobs that will be created in this decade  will not require a four-year college degree, but most of them will  require some learning and skills that go well beyond what most people  get in a high school diploma.                If you look at the last 10 years, the average salaries  of young people that had at least two years of good post-high school  education was a good salary that went up over the decade.  The young  people who had less than that tended to have lower wages that did not  go up, and in many cases in real terms fell over the decade, because  they weren't productive, they weren't more valuable to their  employers.              So we think America has a big economic interest in  trying to ensure that all the young people who get out of high school  but don't go on to college make a transition to work, which includes  two years of further training either in a community college, a  vocational setting, or perhaps on the job.  And what I have done in  this budget, as you know, is to give you and Secretary Reich some  funds and some incentives to try to work in partnership with states  and with the private sector to build these programs state-by-state in  a way that would be customized essentially by the business community,  based on the needs of the economy in any given area.  It could  revolutionize long-term the quality of the American work force and  the earnings of American workers.              SECRETARY REICH:  I should add, Mr. President -- I think  you know this from your experience in Arkansas -- and many of the  people watching this program -- that the business community and  educators, labor groups are already in many of our communities, many  of our states, building a school-to-work transition program.  In  fact, there's an awful lot of ferment, a lot of excitement.  The  people watching this program probably are the ones who are most  directly involved in that.  And more power to them.  Secretary Riley  and I are going to do everything we can to build on the successes  already out there.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Bob, we're going to be talking tonight  about youth apprenticeship and tech prep, the co-op learning   career academies.  And what features all those programs that deal  with this subject -- what are some of the features that every one of  these school-to-work programs might have that   are important?              SECRETARY REICH:  Well, one thing that we've seen -- and  you and I have been working at this for a long time, and you much  longer than I -- we've seen that active involvement of the business  community is absolutely essential.  And I'm so delighted that we're  doing this in the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce.  The  Chamber of Commerce of the United States is committed to doing these  kinds of programs -- training, education, retraining -- and we've  aimed to work very closely with the Chamber.              The business community is going to be actively engaged  in developing almost an audit of the kind of jobs that are needed and  helping the educators, community colleges, technical institutions  develop curricula that are relevant for the jobs of the future.              Communities have got to come together.  I mean, this is  one of the most important things.  You've got to have all of these  players in a community come together and work together and cooperate  together.  You know, too often we have the educators over here and  the business leaders over here, labor groups over here and everybody  is talking, but they're not really working together in a common  strategy.              And the third and final ingredient I would say, Dick,  would be a commitment to excellence -- a commitment both to academic  excellence and also to skills development excellence.  This is not a  tracking program we're talking about for kids who are not going to  make it.  This is a program that every young person ought to be  eligible for.  If they want to go on beyond that to four-year  college, that's fine.  That ought to be permissible.  But we're  talking about the foundation of learning about jobs, the foundation  skills for on-the-job learning.              And again, those are the critical components.  It's  already being done.              THE PRESIDENT:  I think -- if I might just interject one  point based on my personal experience at home -- the business  community has a critical role to play, not simply in saying here are  the job skills that are needed and here's what ought to be taught,  but also in monitoring that excellence.  If you have the right sort  of partnership there, the people who are paying the taxes and who are  going to then be hiring the workers are not going to permit the  second-rate programs to survive if they have any way to shape and  influence them.  So I think that's very important.              And when we try to, if you will, fill in the blanks at  the federal level, trying to set some standards and provide some  funds, one of the things that we want to be sure and do is to make  sure that the employer has a heavy amount of influence over the  quality of these programs, because that's really what's going to  determine whether the whole thing is worthwhile.              SECRETARY RILEY:  That's great.  We've been talking, of  course, about school-to-work and also the jobs and economic recovery  program for this summer and fall.  But let's talk just a moment about  long-term school reform.  It's something especially close to me.  Mr.  President, I wonder if you would give us some of your ideas for the  communities out here on Goals 2000 legislation that I think will be  coming forth before too long.              THE PRESIDENT:  Well, as you know, back when you and I  were both governors, we spent a lot of time working on our public  schools and we tried to be very candid with our people in saying that  a lot of these things were going to take some time to materialize.                I had a hand in writing the National Education Goals  that the governors drafted, along with representatives of President  Bush's administration back in 1989.  And what we're going to try to  do this year with your leadership is to introduce legislation in  Congress that will actually define the things that the national  government ought to do to try to help the local schools and the  children of this country and the adult learners, too, meet those  goals -- making sure that when -- by 2000, people show up for school  ready to learn; that we get a 90 percent on-time high school  graduation rate; that children at the 4th, 8th, and 12th grades are  confident in the subjects they're supposed to know; that they are  second to none in math and science; that are schools are safe,  disciplined, and drug-free.  And, of course, the fifth goal --I took  them out of line to say this the last -- is that we have a system of  life-long learning in this country.              And each one of those goals there's a national role, a  state role, a school role, school district role, and a private sector  role.  And what you've attempted to do in this bill you're going to  introduce with me in the next few weeks is to define what our job is;  and then to give the rest of America a way of defining what their job  is and seeing whether we're actually meeting the standards of quality  that we need to meet.              It's very exciting.  So far as I know, nothing quite  like it has ever been done in the form of federal legislation before.   Not mandating and telling people what they have to do with their  money, but actually setting up a framework for excellence and  partnerships so that we can do our job.  I'm really excited about it.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I am, too.  And I think really  it will be an entirely new role for the federal government in terms  of its relationship with states, serving as a partner really to  support and facilitate and to help out in these education reform  efforts, all driven by high standards.  That's the point.              Bob, let me ask you one question, and then we'll get to  the telephone calls.  It's about the same subject.  We have, of  course, skills standards that are going to be part of Goals 2000, and  I wonder if you would comment on that.              SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you know, we have 75 percent of  our young people who don't graduate from college.  Very often they  don't have very many alternatives.  They do have a wonderful system  of community colleges and technical institutions, but if we had  national skill standards to which they could aspire and which  employers would understand as a national credential, many of these  young people would actually find that they were much more eligible  for jobs.              Everybody doesn't have to go to college.  Other  countries you have smaller proportions of their population going to  college, but you have a whole level of people who have certain  technical, preprofessional skills.  We can do it in this country.  If  you don't go to four-year college you're not a loser.  And we want to  develop those national skill standards.  We're going to be working  with the states, with the Education Department, with a lot of private  industry in developing those standards.  And I think they will be the  kinds of things that enable our vocational and technical and other  institutions to rally around, as well as our business community.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, that's great.  Why don't we go  ahead and go to the telephone.  We have a call, I see -- Mayor Bruce  Todd of Austin, Texas.              Q   Yes, Mr. President and Mr. Secretary Reich and  Riley, we certainly appreciate the opportunity to join you today.  We  have some dedicated professionals and volunteers here in Austin who  have heard what you have said and are very appreciative.  Let me  simply say, amen to some of the comments made already.  We agree with  much of the tone that the Clinton administration has taken, and are  very supportive.                We have been successful here in Austin of tripling our  summer employment program over the last four years.  We expect to  have over 2,000 employed this year in the summertime; perhaps as much  as 3,500 with the federal assistance.                Much of the question that we had designed you have  answered in your opening comments, so we must be thinking alike.  But  the question essentially involved what initiatives after Labor Day  would be appropriate.  We know summertime is important.  Year-round  is even more important.  And what kind of initiatives at the federal  level might be proposed to meet the needs of the youth on a year- round basis?  And perhaps more importantly, how can families and the  local community be more involved using the federal initiative? That's  something that we believe is very important to success in this  effort.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Mr. President.              THE PRESIDENT:  I think I'll give everybody a chance to  answer the question, Bruce, but let me first thank you for calling,  and thank you for all the great work that you're doing in Austin.   I've seen some of it and I've always been very impressed.                First, with regard to the summer program, we hope we can  structure it in a way that will enable us to continue the summer  program and that will move a lot of these young people back into  schools under circumstances that might allow them to do some work in  the private sector, too.  We hope that -- Secretary Reich is going to  try to set up a system where we create a lot of private sector jobs  to be matched with the public sector jobs this summer.  And we're  working on that.              Secondly, in the program that I have presented to the  Congress over the next five years, what we are attempting to do is to  build in an amount of investment that's quite substantial for job  training programs, for school-to-work programs, all of which give  heavy, heavy weight to local community input -- just the question you  asked -- but do provide some federal investment dollars, which we  hope you can put with local dollars to keep people working and being  trained on a year-round basis.              And I will say again, to echo what Secretary Reich said  a moment ago, to try to break down the barrier between what is seen  as work and what is seen as learning.  An awful lot of young people  actually have quite high IQs, but actually learn so much better when  they're doing than when they're reading or just listening.  So we  hope that the community involvement part of it will be permanent, and  we hope that if the whole budget passes -- and we do have 200 budget  cuts and more than 200, actually, in the budget -- and some revenue  raisers, and some new money for education and training, that we'll be  able to do just what you seem to want based on your question.              Bob, do you want to say anything?              SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you took most of the words out  of my mouth, Mr. President, as usual.  But let me just add one thing,  and that is that one of the most important aspects of post-high  school for a lot of young people who are not going on to college, in  addition to the school-to-work program, simply is the availability of  jobs.  And we've got to get this economy moving again, obviously.   It's terribly important to get this recovery program, to get the  economy back on track.  That's sort of the prerequisite to everything  else.  If we don't get the economy back on track -- we have -- I  think this is the 16th -- correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. President -- I  think is the 16th month we have had seven percent unemployment or  greater.  This is a jobless recovery.  A lot of those kids are going  to be getting out of school in June.  And even if we did everything  right, they would have a very, very hard time getting jobs.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you both.  Of course, Goals 2000  will be a permanent, long-term thing that will certainly reach into  next year.  It will involve, if passed -- and we certainly hope it  will be -- action plans with every state where we can be working  together to reach for the goals in a number of different ways.  And  then the state, with all the various school districts, a very  important part of that will be citizen and parent involvement.  And I  think everybody will see a great energy out there, once we get that  moving.              The next call is Dr. Harry Heinemann, New York.                Doctor?              Q   Good evening, Mr. Secretary.  It is a pleasure to  be on with you this evening.  As you may know, bridging the school  and work has been central to La Guardia's educational program since  its inception in the 1970s, and that includes the college, the two  alternative high schools that operate on our campus, and the linkages  we have forged with the local schools.  We have found this to be an  extremely effective learning strategy.              And over the years, we've come to believe that there are  several principles that are very important in bridging the school and  work.  And these include integrating theory in the classroom with  practice in the workplace, with providing all students early exposure  to careers, as well as providing opportunities for them to reflect  upon these experiences while they strengthen their skills; and  lastly, the critical role of the liberal arts, particularly in the  development of high performance competencies.                My question, then is:  How can the general education  faculty and the academic curriculum be more closely integrated with  transition to work experience?  And what mechanisms and strategies  can you suggest to achieve this integration?              SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, thank you very much.  I think --  and we'll get a response from you all on that, and very interesting  work going on there.  We're going to have three people, our next  guests on the program this evening, that will be some specialists    in that area that you're speaking, and I'll certainly pass that on to  them and we can discuss it later.              You all care to comment -- any comments you might have?              THE PRESIDENT:  I'd just like to say, if I might, one  thing.  I want to reemphasize this and I don't think I'm being as  clear about it as I'd like, although I think at least one of the  people who will be on the second panel will be able to say it more  explicitly than I.  I think this whole concept of applied academics  is very important.  And I think that we have to basically abolish  what I consider to be a very artificial distinction between what is  vocational learning and what is academic learning.              I think we should keep the liberal arts going.  I think  we should have a strong component for people who are in the  vocational program.              SECRETARY REICH:  It seems to me that we also need to  rethink our entire tracking system, because a lot of these school and  work combinations are important for mainstream students.  They're  important for all students.  It's not just a special group of  students that needs them.              Some of the experiments that I've seen around the United  States -- Dick, I'm sure you've seen them as well -- are mainstream  experiments.  They're mainstreaming all the students.  At 11th and  12th grades they're giving them a combined work and school experience  and then a transition program.  And again, the kids can either go on  to college if they want; they can go on to technical community; they  can go on to an entirely -- a large variety of possibilities and  career directions.              But we have to get away from the stigmatizing that often  goes on with young people who simply are doing job-related or work- related work within the classroom, within our schools.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you, very much.  I think that's  going to be the last call that we have time for.  Mr. President, I  think you've got to move on to another matter, and I want to thank  you and Secretary Reich for being here.  We appreciate your time and  your ideas, and it's been a tremendous help to us.  \",\" Seems to me folks, that if you are so interested in acquiring CNN, just buy your $1000 worth of stock today.

I argued this thoroughly about 3-4 weeks ago.  Men and women are different ... physically, physiologically, and psychologically.  Much recent evidence for this statement is present in the book \\\"Brainsex\\\" by Anne Moir and David Jessel.  I recommend you find a copy and read it. Their book is an overview of recent scientific research on this topic and is well referenced.   Now, if women and men are different in some ways, the law can only adequately take into account their needs in these areas where they are different by also taking into account the ways in which men and women are different.  Maternity leave is an example of this -- it takes into account that women get pregnant.  It does not give women the same rules it would give to men, because to treat women like it treats men in this instance would be unjust.  This is just simply an obvious example of where men and women are intrinsically different!!!!!  Now, people make the _naive_ argument that sexism = oppression. However, maternity leave is sexist because MEN DO NOT GET PREGNANT.  Men do not have the same access to leave that women do (not to the same extent or degree), and therefore IT IS SEXIST.  No matter however much a man _wants_ to get pregnant and have maternity leave, HE NEVER CAN.  And therefore the law IS SEXIST.  No man can have access to maternity leave, NO MATTER HOW HARD HE TRIES TO GET PREGNANT.  I hope this is clear.  Maternity leave is an example where a sexist law is just, because the sexism here just reflects the \\\"sexism\\\" of nature in making men and women different.  There are many other differences between men and women which are far more subtle than pregnancy, and to find out more of these I recommend you have a look at the book \\\"Brainsex\\\".  Your point that perhaps some day men can also be pregnant is fallacious. If men can one day become pregnant it will be by having biologically become women!  To have a womb and the other factors required for pregnancy is usually wrapped up in the definition of what a woman is -- so your argument, when it is examined, is seen to be fallacious.  You are saying that men can have the sexist maternity leave privilege that  women can have if they also become women -- which actually just supports my statement that maternity leave is sexist.   There is no official priesthood in Islam -- much of this function is taken by Islamic scholars.  There are female Islamic scholars and female Islamic scholars have always existed in Islam.  An example from early Islamic history is the Prophet's widow, Aisha, who was recognized in her time and is recognized in our time as an Islamic scholar.   You have no evidence for your blanket statement about all religions, and I dispute it.  I could go on and on about women in Islam, etc., but I recently reposted something here under the heading \\\"Islam and Women\\\" -- if it is still at your news-site I suggest you read it.  It is reposted from soc.religion.islam, so if it has disappeared from alt.atheism it still might be in soc.religion.islam (I forgot what its original title was though).  I will email it to you if you like.    Your statement that \\\"other religions are no different\\\" is, I think, a statement based simply on lack of knowledge about religions other than Christianity and perhaps Judaism.   Aisha, who I mentioned earlier, was not only an Islamic scholar but also was, at one stage, a military leader.   The Prophet's first wife, who died just before the \\\"Hijra\\\" (the Prophet's journey from Mecca to Medina) was a successful businesswoman.  Lucio, you cannot make a strong case for your viewpoint when your viewpoint is based on ignorance about world religions.\",\"Are there any vendors supporting pressure sensitive tablet/pen with X?

Two requests -- first, note the roles of S1 and S2.  It appears to me and others that anyone who knows those values can construct the unit key.  And the nature of the generation process for K1 and K2 is such that neither can be produced alone.  Thus, the scheme cannot be implemented such that one repository generates the first half-key, and another generates the second.  *That* is ominous.  Second -- these postings are not revealed scripture, nor are they carefully-crafted spook postings.  Don't attempt to draw out hidden meanings (as opposed to, say, the official announcements of Clipper). Leave Denning out of this; given Hellman's record of opposition to DES, which goes back before some folks on this newsgroup knew how to read, I don't think you can impugn his integrity.  Oh yeah -- the folks who invented Clipper aren't stupid.  If you think something doesn't make sense, it's almost certainly because you don't understand their goals.    --Steve Bellovin  -----  Date: Sun, 18 Apr 93 07:56:39 EDT From: denning@cs.georgetown.edu (Dorothy Denning) Subject: Re:  Clipper Chip To: (a long list of folks)  I was also briefed by the NSA and FBI, so let me add a few comments to Marty's message:          The Clipper Chip will have a secret crypto algorithm embedded in   The algorithm operates on 64-bit blocks (like DES) and the chip supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  The algorithm uses 32 rounds of scrambling compared with 16 in DES.   In addition to the system key, each user will get to choose his   or her own key and change it as often as desired. Call this key   plain old K. When a message is to be sent it will first be   K is the session key shared by the sender and receiver.  Any method (e.g., public key) can be used to establish the session key.  In the AT&T telephone security devices, which will have the new chip, the key is negotiated using a public-key protocol.    encrypted under K, then K will be encrypted under the unit key UK,   and the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part   message which will then be encrypted under the system key SK   producing        E{ E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number;  SK}  My understanding is that E[M; K] is not encrypted under SK (called the \\\"family key\\\") and that the decrypt key corresponding to SK is held by law enforcement.  Does anyone have first hand knowledge on this?  I will also check it out, but this is 7am Sunday so I did not want to wait.          The unit key   will be generated as the XOR of two 80-bit random numbers K1   and K2 (UK=K1+K2) which will be kept by the two escrow   The unit key, also called the \\\"chip key,\\\" is generated from the serial number N as follows.  Let N1, N2, and N3 be 64 bit blocks derived from N, and let S1 and S2 be two 80-bit seeds used as keys. Compute the 64-bit block           R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1]   (Note that this is like using the DES in triple encryption mode with two keys.)  Similarly compute blocks R2 and R3 starting with N2 and N3. (I'm unlear about whether the keys S1 and S2 change.  The fact that they're called seeds suggests they might.)  Then R1, R2, and R3 are concatenated together giving 192 bits.  The first 80 bits  form K1 and the next 80 bits form K2.  The remaining bits are discarded.   authorities. Who these escrow authorities will be is still to be   decided by the Attorney General, but it was stressed to me that   they will NOT be NSA or law enforcement agencies, that they   must be parties acceptable to the users of the system as unbiased.   Marty is right on this and the FBI has asked me for suggestions. Please pass them to me along with your reasons.  In addition to Marty's criteria, I would add that the agencies must have an established record of being able to safeguard highly sensitive information.  Some suggestions I've received so far include SRI, Rand, Mitre, the national labs (Sandia, LANL, Los Alamos), Treasury, GAO.   When a court order obtains K1 and K2, and thence K, the law   enforcement agency will use SK to decrypt all information   flowing on the suspected link [Aside: It is my guess that   they may do this constantly on all links, with or without a   court order, since it is almost impossible to tell which links   over which a message will flow.]   My understanding is that there will be only one decode box and that it will be operated by the FBI.

With regard to dialup X11 implementations, there are several.  You can buy serial X11 terminals from a couple of companies, including both  GraphOn and NCD.  (In fact, I'm composing this from an NCD running X11 over serial lines across 14.4 kbaud connection.)    NCD also sells a software-only package that provides XRemote (which is NCD's implementation of serial X11) for PC's.  There may be other such  software packages available.  X11R6 is supposed to include a standardized compression scheme for running X11 over low-speed connections.  It's called Low Bandwidth X (LBX), and  is based on improved versions of the techniques used in NCD's XRemote.   It seems likely that once LBX is released as a Consortium standard, there will be several vendors willing to supply implementations for various  sorts of hardware.

The Islanders lost in OT and the Devils tied the Pens.  That means if the Isles beat the Devils on Friday, the will meet the Caps in the playoffs.   However, I have some more comments on the Islanders and hockey in general that I need to get off my chest :).  First of all, with the Islanders  back-to-back lackluster performances against the Whalers, one may think that  the Islanders are out of shape.  These guys always suck wind in the 2nd period, come on a little in the 3rd and run out of gas too soon.  It is unbelieveable how many one goal games these guys have lost.  Anyway, the games was pretty  wide open.  The Isles still have tons of trouble scoring.  The Whalers played  a golie in is 1st NHL start, I think his name was Lenarduzzi (sp?).  (His NHL  debut was the Tuesday tie against the Isles).  Like I mentioned before, this  guy looked like the best golie on the planet for a while (until he misplayed a  Mahlakov slap shot to go to OT).  I say it's because the Isles don't shoot  correctly.  Has anyone else noticed this?   Also, I think it is really a shame for hockey when I guy like Mick Vukota gets as much ice time as he does.  This guy has about as much hockey talent as Jiggs MacDonald (who did play hockey, I think).  Anytime he gets the puck it gets stolen, and he always starts fights and gets needless penalties.  Richard Pilon is another guy who is on the ice to stir up crap.  And he's a defenseman.  He's got to be approaching negative infinity for his plus/minus.  This guy gets beaten all the time.  Why the need for such \\\"enforcers\\\"?  Not only do fights slow the game down ALOT, but it takes away from the guys who are really trying to play the game.  I'll be one of the few to admit, I do enjoy a  good fight once in a while, but only when it's \\\"called for\\\".  You know, when a guy checks the goalie too hard.  In other words, a violation of \\\"hockey ethics\\\" might cause you to get puched.  But there is no need to start crap when you are losing or becuase you can get away with it!! Does anyone agree that referees need to be a little less lenient in the 3rd and OT?  I mean COME ON already.  I'm sick of seeing teams pulling guys down, holding guys etc. just becuase the referee doesn't call it.  OT and late in the 3rd should be a time for strategy, not physical prowess.  Trying to set up a goal should be first and foremost.  If you are so afraid that the other team is going to score that you have to pull a guy down to prevent it, you don't deserve to win in the first place.  Just My Honest Opinion,\",\" Sure, why not? But, are you using Paul to correct the words of Jesus?   \\\"So *anyone* who dissolves even one of the smallest commands and teaches others the same way, will be known as the lowest in the kingdom of the skies; whereas *anyone* who keeps the commands and teaches them too, will be known as *someone* great in the kingdom of the skies.\\\" Mat5:19 (Gaus)  Are you an \\\"anyone\\\" or are you a \\\"no one?\\\"  Why not assume, that since Jesus didn't say that his words apply only to Jews, that they apply to all human beings, irregardless of race or sex?

Ex20:8-11(JPS) Remember the sabbath day and keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a sabbath of the LORD your God; you shall not do any work - you, your son or daughter, your male or female slave, or your cattle, or the stranger who is within your settlements. For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth and sea, and all that is in them, and He rested on the seventh day; therefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day and hollowed it.  Note: There is no specific requirement for worship here, however I for one would not be so bold as to call these verses a \\\"ceremonial detail.\\\"   Don't many Christians still practice circumcision?

As for the faith that you have, keep that between yourself and God. The person is in luck who doesn't condemn himself for what he samples. On the other hand, the person with doubts about something who eats it anyway is guilty, because he isn't acting on his faith, and any failure to act on faith is a sin.\",\"   Bobby:    Get this the hell out of your .sig until you 1) learn what it   stands for and 2) really mean it.  /\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\   Bob Beauchaine bobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM   They said that Queens could stay, they blew the Bronx away, and sank Manhattan out at sea.\",\" As many people have mentioned, there is no reason why insurers could not offer a contract without abortion services for a different premium.

The tires that were on it when I just bought it are old and cracked. I do not have an owners manual for it (yet), but the tires listed in the Haynes manual are: Front, 3,50 H 18 ; Rear 4.10 H 18, and pressures recommended are 26 front and 33 rear. Oddly, the pressure for the same tire on the T-3 is listed at 29 psi instead. Anyone know the reason? As I know though, the pressure I should run at is that recommended by the manufacturer of the new tires I purchase.  The real question I have is this. The old tires that are on the bike are for the front, a Metzler Touring Special, 4.10 H 18, and for the rear an Avon Roadrunner 4.70 H 18, (120/90) H 18 as marked on each tire. Both are larger than that listed in the Haynes Manual. What does the owners manual recommend, and was it common to go up one size for this bike? Also, this will be my first motorcycle with innertubes. Any comments on the various manufacturers inner tube qualities?  The above sizes are inches (except for the additional mark on the current rear tire). What is the best metric match? The local BMW dealer thought 100/90 H 18 on the front and 120/90 H 18 on the back. He also happens to be very good at getting close to matching mail order prices.  I am thinking of going with a Metzler ME33 Laser (possibly Comp K) on the front and ME88 on the back, both in MBS variety if possible (the longer  lasting belting system). I already use the ME33 on both the Vision and FJ for the front, and like it, and I thought that with the shaft drive behavior and torque from the Guzzi that the ME88 might give more predictable back end control and sliding behavior than a ME55 might, as well as giving much better tire milage life. Any comments?  A friend told me he thought that my bike had Boranni rims which are very good, but are relatively soft and have delicate sidewalls. I do not wish to mount the tires myself this first time, so aside from warning the shop to be careful, any other comments I should make? I havn't looked at the rim to check out the make yet, if it is marked. He just told me late yesterday and I havn't had a chance to check the rim type.  On another note. I will remove the ugly (but in good shape....anyone want it?) Vetter fairing, and I will run without a windscreen for a while, but eventually I would like a simple rounded cafe' style quarter fairing for it. It could be fork/handlebar mounted. Any suggestions? Is there such a thing as a frame mounted quarter fairing of the cafe' style for this bike? How about lower bars/clip-ons for it? I would like to restore the bike into a good condition runner with a few modern updates, but while not being historically exactly accurate still have it reflect relatively well a representation of the cafe' style. (Yes I know to be picky, that period really predates this bike....it is just that this bike has such potential for _that_ look.)  -----------------------------Edward Walsh----Hewlett-Packard Company-------                              edw@boi.hp.com  Disk Memory Division, MS475                              (208)323-2174   P.O.

I can't imagine how to estimate bat speed, but its pretty obvious that Jose is missing fastballs he used to hit, likely due to his back.    I don't know, he had an even more open stance when he first came up with the A's, and had no problems with it then. It might be that pre-back problems, he was quick enough to cover up any deficiencies the stance caused, but now he's lost just enough bat speed that the stance hurts him. The old saying if you're hot its a trigger mechanism, if you're cold, its a hitch.    The biggest problem IMHO is he never has found a stance he's comfortable with for more than a few months. He changes his stance so much, he loses track of where the strike zone is. In Wednesday's night game, he was  clearly mad at strike calls on both corners that looked pretty good to me. I think he no longer knows where the strike zone really is because he's changed his stance so much.  I'm also a bit concerned that because he's got Palmer and Gonzalez hitting all the homeruns, he'll become competitive, swing even harder and screw himself up even worse.

According the the Los Angeles Police Department, illegal manufacture is one the three primary sources of machine guns and submachine guns used in crimes (sumggling and theft from the police and military being the other two.) Washington D.C. police have stated that 40% (If I'm remembering the figure correctly) of the guns they conficate were illegally built.   It takes about 6 hours and a few tools to make one (at least one of reasonable quality). Unless the drug dealer enjoyes messing around on a lathe (say, as a hobby), he's going to have to  pay someone anyway. Materials plus six hours of a machinist's time for something legal would run about $100. The blackmarket prices for guns are usually in the $50 to $200 range (at least those few I've seen cited in newspaper articles were...)   Washington D.C. has a total ban on handguns and prohibits assembled rifles within city limits. It's homicide rate is almost ten times the national average. It is also illegal for a D.C. resident to drive to the Virginia or Maryland suburbs and buy a gun (dealers are required by federal law to check IDs and make sure the buyer isn't from another state) so the ban  can not be easily side-stepped.   Sure. But it you couldn't buy one, you would write your own (in fact, people _did_ write their own 15 years ago...) More likely, you would find a friend who was a particularly good programer and get him give you a copy of his. Software is a _very_ bad example for your case: How many people do you know with illegal copies of $400 word processors? If people want something, and it isn't available (or affordable) legally, they will usually get it illegally.   Quite.   13-3-2. The formula has been around for half a million years.

Some of them are very serious while others are completely benign.  Having \\\"a few irregular beats\\\" on an EKG could be serious depending on what those beats were and when they occurred, or could be of no significance.  Low blood potassium levels probably predispose people with underlying heart disease to develop arrhythmias.  Very low potassium levels are clearly dangerous, but it is not clear how much of a problem low-end-of-normal levels are:  a lot of cardiologists seem to treat anyone with even a mildly low-normal potassium level. \",\" I'll post a summary after I get enough information.

Burleigh Grimes went from 20+ wins and an ERA of 3 or so in '24 to 13-19 and an ERA around 4 in '25.  He pitched well for several more years.  Carlton won 13 and lost 20 the year after his 27-10 record. (Source: Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract.)      And let's not forget John Tudor, who started 1-5 and finished 21-6 in 1985.  He had a pretty bad ERA when you take Busch Stadium into account at the start of the season.        If I recall, he had a 4.50 ERA in the 1st half and a 3.50 ERA in the 2nd half of last year.        Hmmm, 21 runs in 11 innings.  Suppose he starts 30 more games, and winds up w/200 innings pitched.  If he allows 4 runs a game in the next 189 innings, he'll have a 4.75 ERA or so at the end of the year. (I think I have his totals right.) This is going to be hard to come back from.        My 1st hunch is that Morris is very gutsy, and that he may be pitching through an injury and not telling anyone.  My 2nd guess is that he will be banished to the bullpen the remainder of the season after a few more starts. (Perhaps when Stewart comes off the DL?  Or will Danny Cox, who went 3 or 4 scoreless innings against the Tribe today, start for Morris?  He looks like a really good one.  Gaston is scrambling to find starters, I'd imagine. Luckily, the Jays have a very good offense.)      I don't think they would dare release him before the end of the year.

We've kept things on a painfully polite, Christmas-card sort of level for most of this time. Attempts to see each other end disastrously, with his wife throwing a screaming fit and storming out over either our imagined slights to her, or his inattention or insensitivity to her (I mean, this'll happen by the end of a single restaurant meal). He seems, from what I've seen, to live in a state of quivering anxiety, hoping futilely to keep the next storm from breaking. He has sacrificed not only meaningful contact with us but also other friends and outside interests. Now, this is his choice, and I need to accept it even if I deplore it. But it's hard.    From time to time I've wanted to drop the pretense that we have a relationship--by cutting off contact--or trying to have a real if painful relationship, by talking honestly with him, but I've always thought, \\\"Why be dramatic? And you know he'll only get evasive and then find some excuse to get off the phone. Just leave the door open, in case he ever decides to come back.\\\" It's been an unsatisfying choice, to allow us to go on with the superficial trappings of a relationship, but it was the best I could think of.    Now, this weekend, my mother finally decided that she wasn't going to pretend any more and has cut off relations with them. This was the outcome of a phone conversation in which my sister-in-law screamed and raved at my mother, blaming her for everything wrong in their lives, and in which my brother evaded, temporized, claimed the situation was beyond his control, and as always expected my mother to make all the allowances and concessions. Mom said she would not, that she would not quietly take abuse any more, and that if these were the terms of their relationship, she didn't want to talk to or see them any more. And she hung up. (I have never seem my mother lose her temper, and I think that this is the first time she's ever hung up on someone.) Mom says she feels as if she's divorced my brother, and that it's a relief in some ways to have the break out in the open and done with.       I have mixed feelings. I'm proud of Mom for sticking up for herself; angry at my brother and sister-in-law for hurting her, for being jerks, for persisting in such a wretched life, which hurts us all and is warping their children; angry at my sister-in-law for being so hateful, and angry at my brother for being a coward and having so little respect for himself or us that he's willing to throw us aside and use up all his energy trying to appease an unappeasable, emotionally disturbed woman; pained for their children, who are a mess; scared for the future, since this marks the time when either things will change and improve or the break will become irrevocable; nastily self- righteous over this bit of proof that they can't \\\"get away\\\" with treating us or each other this way, and then disgusted with myself for even beginning to gloat over others' misery; and finally, mostly, sad, sad, sad, to see my parents hurt and my brother and sister-in-law trapped in a horrible, destructive situation that they can't see a way out of--or they can't bear to take whatever paths they do see. And I'm frustrated because I don't know what if anything to do, and doing nothing drives me up the wall. I try to pray, about my own feelings of rage, impotence, and vindictiveness, and about their situation, but I am not free of the desire to *DO* something concrete.

It wouldn't impede your defense at all. There was an actual incident in Oak Park where a gas station owner engaged in a shootout with a handgun; the grand jury decided not to presecute. On the other hand, a black man used an illegally owned handgun in Oak Park to defend himself, and the Village tried to make an example out of him. An NRA Director who lived there made a stink about this, and it was decided not to charge the guy. Of course, pissing off anti-gun police thugs has it's own drawbacks, like when the Oak Park Police Chief came to his house, and told him: \\\"this is stepping over the line; this could get dangerous for you.\\\" Whereupon the few black Oak Park police officers watched over his house to ensure that the white anti-gun police chief and his anti-gun cronies wouldn't f*ck with him, his home or family.

Roger, on one front you flamed him rather severely on the grounds that his was a \\\"jingoistic rant\\\", but you also supported the name-changing on the grounds that the current names are inappropriate because of the individuals they represent. FWIW, I do not think the flaming was warranted, nor do I  think you enhanced what credibility you have with it at all.  Just an  observation...  However, that aside, the real question is whether you like the idea of changing the names based on the reasons given for it (making it easier for the 'casual fan'), or whether you like the idea of unique divisional names based on individuals who do deserve the honour.  IMO, the latter is a nice and unique touch that differs from other sports.  In addition, I do not think that changing divisional names will have an effect on the number of people that are interested in hockey, so it's a pointless exercise anyway.  If the current names are inappropriate, then that is a separate issue, not  central to the original article.  Something to consider additionally is whether or not players like Orr who 'contributed to the glory of the sport' would have been able to do so _without_ an organized professional league to play in.  In this case, honouring builders of the _league_ as opposed to builders of the _sport_ becomes a chicken-and-egg type question. (although it was the chicken.....)

Yes, Cripple *might* be for end-to-end encyption, dropping to clear when the other end doesn't have Cripple.

By the 1920s, there was a very active \\\"good roads\\\" movement, which had its origins actually in the 1890s during the bicycle craze, picked up steam in the teens (witness the Linclon Highway Association, 1912 or so, and the US highway support act (real name: something different) in 1916 that first pledged federal aid to states and counties to build decent roads. Also, the experience of widespread use of trucks for domestic transport during WW 1 convinced the government that good raods were crucial to our national defense.  Anyway, by the 20s there were plenty of good roads, at least around urban areas, and they were rapidly expanding into the countryside.  This was the era, after all, of the first auto touring fad, the motel, the auto camp ground, etc. Two good books on the subject spring to mind - Warren Belasco \\\"America on the Road\\\" (title may not be exact - author is) and another called \\\"The Devil Wagon in God's Country\\\" author I forget.  Also, any of John Flink's  or John Bell Rae's auto histories.  As to placement of the steering wheel being arbitrary, by the early teens there were virtually no American cars that did not have the wheel on the left.  In the early days, cars had the wheel on the left, on the right, and even in the middle, as well as sometimes having a tiller instead of a wheel.

One approach is simply to try and move political opinion and hope a new more libertarian consensus lasts for a while.  Another approach is to try and amend the constitution.  The original constitution restrained the U.S. government from economic intervention for 100 to 150 years, depending on just how one wants to count it. The First Amendment, though weakened in many ways, still restrains government (particularly state and local), even though on many particular issues the majority is in favor of censorship.  I think libertarians would be happy with another 100 years of restraint via an amendment or two (not that I think that's likely to happen).  Not necessarily Mr. Hendricks, but other posters seem to see this as a problem with libertarianism, that it cannot be stable.  That might be true, but it is not an objection to libertarianism per se.  If a libertarian political consensus forms for a decade or two and then falls apart again, we would just be back where we are now.  This is unlike the case for socialism where a socialist consensus that held for a while and then fell apart would not leave us where we are now, but instead with lots of bureaucracy that would be hard to get rid of, if not tyranny as the end condition of a strong socialist consensus.\",\"  Since I repost this message again for the second time, I hope to hear from some folks on this topic.

They aren't even real.  What scientists call an atom is nothing more than a mathematical model that describes  certain physical, observable properties of our surroundings.  All of which is subjective.    What is objective, though, is the approach a scientist  takes in discussing his model and his observations.  There is no objective science.  But there is an objective approach which is subjectively selected by the scientist.  Objective in this case means a specified, unchanging set of rules that he and his colleagues use to discuss their science.  This is in contrast to your Objective Morality.  There may be an objective approach to subjectively discuss your beliefs on morality.  But there exists no objective morality.  Also, science deals with how we can discuss our observations of  the physical world around us.  In that the method of discussion is objective ( not the science; not the discussion itself ).  Science makes no claims to know the whys or even the hows sometimes of what we can observe.  It simply gives us a way to discuss our surroundings in a meaningful, consistent way.

If most people }use scissors to cut paper, shouldn't Consumer's Reports }test scissors for paper-cutting ability, even though }scissors may have been designed originally to cut cloth?  That's possibly a good way to judge the use of the Bible in teaching Jewish morality today, but it hardly seems fair to claim that this highly-interpreted version is what was \\\"enlightened for its times\\\". To (attempt to) extend the analogy, this is like saying that the original scissor-makers were unusually advanced at paper-cutting for their times, even though they only ever cut cloth, and had never even heard of paper.  I'm not arguing that the Bible is \\\"disgusting\\\", though some of the history depicted in it is, by modern standards.  However, history is full of similar abuses, and I don't think the Biblical accounts are worse than their contemporaries--or possibly ours.  On the other hand, I don't know of any reason to think the history described in the Bible shows *less* abuse than their contemporaries, or ours.

Suspects can be compelled to give handwriting and voice exemplars, and to take blood and DNA tests.   No, but they could compell you to produce the key to a safe where, as it happens, evidence that will convict you is stored.   The crypto-key disclosure issue hasn't come up yet, but current law suggests that it's a loser for the defendant--he'll be compelled to turn over the key.  The test for compelled self-incrimination is whether the material to  be disclosed *in itself* tends to inculpate the discloser. In the example I gave above, the safe key itself has no testimonial value--ergo, it can be disclosed under compulsion (e.g., subpoena duces tecum).  Moreover, the government can always immunize the disclosure of a crypto key--compelling you to disclose the key at the price of not using the fact of your disclosure as evidence in the case against you. Of course, they can use whatever they discover as a result of this disclosure against you.   --Mike     \",\"# #They believe that they have a right to FORCE people to hire them, # #rent to them, and do business with them, regardless of the feelings # #or beliefs of the other person. #  # Cramer, you are off your target again.

You are merely expressing \\\"approval\\\" of the consequences I find therein. Which says more about our politics and cultural trappings than about my (or any) religion.  \\\"Love\\\" is a highly ambiguous word, of which Christians can write both the \\\"gentle\\\" words Paul uses of it in 1 Corinthians -- in a passage that even the \\\"conservatives\\\" will quote at you :-) -- and the words of T. S. Eliot in his Pentacost Hymn, \\\"Love is the unfamiliar Name that wove the intolerable shirt of flame ...\\\"  This is in any case rather to the side of what I was attempting to raise in my note, as will become more evident below.   blechhh.  I think you are misreading me, rather seriously.  Though, given my principle that one CANNOT force one's own notion of \\\"sin\\\" on another, and my unshakeable \\\"disestablishmentarianism\\\", Russel Turpin and others (believers and unbelievers alike) are under no threat of my legislating my own understanding of Christian love.   You misread.  I can do (and have repeatedly done) a complete bill of accusation against the Inquisition by exhibiting in as thorough a form as anyone might want a demonstration of the harm it has done to human beings (in the first place) and to respect for (let alone love of) \\\"God\\\" in near succession.  Please go back to my quoted words above:  The \\\"possibility that always exists\\\" is that I (or, to revert to proper time sequence, my predecessors over the last several centuries) could persuade \\\"Christian B\\\" of my case that the Inquisition *does* indeed constitute an egregious violation of the Law of Love.  I must also note that the majority of Christians HAVE been so persuaded.  By Christian argumentation, as well as by secular [both Christian and non-Christian] prohibitions.  What Mr. Turpin alludes to is a trickier point:   A.  I demonstrate the human pain and violation of love involved      in the Inquisition.   B.  The Inquisitor responds that Mother Church must, however      painful this *seems*, \\\"discipline\\\" her children for their      own good -- in this case the salvation of their souls (or      if the tortured heretic will not recant, than by bad example      \\\"deterring\\\" others from the same loss-of-soul.)   A.  I point out that this \\\"justification\\\" of a failure in love      depends on a highly speculative construal of texts and of      philosophical assertions that are quite undemonstrable.   B.  Burns me at the stake.  My rhetoric has failed, but the point I am making is sustained.  What is going on here has a *lot* to do with \\\"cultural baggage.\\\"  In this case, the baggage includes a (nearly universal, and absolutely secular) belief that an accused person must prove innocence and that testimony is most believable if taken under torture.  The elimination of Inqisitorial practice (in those places where it *has* been eliminated, or at least greatly reduced) has very little, if anything, to do with the discussion of sin in the exchange between A and B.  Mr. Turpin is pointing out that, if I am A versus the Grand Inquisitor's B, then my persuasion is not very likely to work.  I know this; and in what- ever personal agony, I consign the issue to God and my ghostly defense attorney.  So, \\\"one possibility\\\" fails in this case -- as it will fail in may others.  At the other extreme, the \\\"persuasion\\\" will succeed when it properly SHOULD not, if it entails mistaken assumptions I share with the Inquisitor.  And that is potentially an even more troubling case, in that many of the victims of Inquisition will have \\\"accepted\\\" that they were in fact sinful (in such random cases as they may actually have been guilty of charges brought against them.)  The point is that the \\\"persuasion\\\" breaks down when the parties do NOT share enough to agree on all the cultural baggage -- and given the main thrust of the Inquisition, against \\\"heresy\\\", it is *bound* to break down in precisely the \\\"worst\\\" cases.  The \\\"conservative\\\" (I don't think that is the right word, BTW) will take refuge in what I attribute to B above, that he is \\\"justified\\\" in causing harm because he *thinks* that works to a \\\"greater good.\\\"  But this is a violent and extravagant REFUSAL to follow the gospel, as if one's theories about \\\"sin\\\" entitled one to cast aside Jesus' words on dealing with sinners (cf. Matthew 5:39ff).  I am a \\\"radical\\\" Christian *only* in that I take the gospel seriously.   Well, the whole *point* of making these the \\\"base\\\" commandments is that they *aren't* reducible to rules.  A set of rules is a moral code or a law code or an algorithm for acting.  Such things can be very helpful to individuals or societies -- but not if they are used *instead* of a personal involvement in and responsibility for one's actions.  The Great Commandment is, more than anything else, a call to act *as if you were God and accepting ultimate responsibility* in your every action.  A demand that I, like most, would rather *not* hear, but it keeps popping up nonetheless (along with the reassurance that it is more important that I be open to trying this, than succeeding at it).  \\\"Conservatives\\\" may twist this \\\"act as if you were God\\\" to mean \\\"lay down rules for other people and be as nasty to them as possible if they don't keep YOUR rules.\\\" They are so insistent (and obvious) about this that they have convinced a lot of people (who rightly reject the whole concept!) that such idiocy IS how God acts.  That, after all, is the standard accusation \\\"against God\\\" by the atheists here and elsewhere.  That the \\\"conservatives\\\" have confused THEIR manipulative, hoop-jumping notions of coercing other people with the Nature of God is almost the entire content of standard American atheism -- and I quite agree with it on this point.   And different bodies of Christians have, from the beginning, urged *different* \\\"ethical systems\\\" (or in some cases, none).  As a result, it is bizarre to identify any one of these systems, however popular (or infamous) with Christianity.  Christianity DOES NOT HAVE A TORAH. It does not have a QU'RAN.  Specifically Christian scripture has very little, if anything, in the way of \\\"commandments\\\" -- so little that the \\\"Christians\\\" who desperately *want* commandments go \\\"mining\\\" for them with almost no support (and thus almost no obvious limitation :-)) for their efforts.  The one, single, thing in the gospels which Jesus specifically \\\"gives\\\" as \\\"a commandment\\\" to us is \\\"love one another.\\\"   [I will be expanding on this point in a reply to Paul Hudson   that I hope to get to in a day or so -- it is quite true that   SOME Christians infer LOTS of commandments from the NT; I'll   point out what has to be going on in these inferences, and why   there is a huge amount of \\\"cultural baggage\\\" involved.]  You are quite right that this is \\\"goo\\\" if one is looking for an ethical system.  But why should anyone BE looking for an ethical system, since our society is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do?  It may be that we need a principle for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems -- in which case I will profer the _agapate allelou_ once again.   I think you are begging the question. Why don't I and the (myriads of) other Christians like me tell you something about Christianity? [Nor is this very new in Christianity -- you might want to look up the origins and fundamental doctrines of the Quakers, from the 17th century onwards, and they are not at all the first to understand the gospel in a manner that is congenial to my case.]\",\"why does my keyboard not have a cents key ?

Right now, I am of the opinion that it won't work at high speeds because of the power interrupts on the Duo, and it won't work at low speeds because of some crazy reason I don't understand.  Could I hear from someone attesting that they can really pump information out the serial port of a Duo 210 fast? Like via a modem or via a sys-ex dump?  Could anyone with a Duo help me out?? I am going absolutely INSANE. I wanna know if the problem is MY Duo, or all Duo 210s, or all Duos, or just me.  Yes, I have checked the cable 1,000,000 times.

While I'll agree that these are generally held to be \\\"good things\\\", I question whether they come very close to being objective values. Especially considering that at one time or another each has been viewed as being undesirable.  I doubt you could even come up with anything that could be said to be universally \\\"good\\\" or \\\"bad\\\".  And when I referred to \\\"the truth\\\" I was using the term hypothetically, realizing full well that there may not even be such a thing.   True enough.  But they cannot be said to be anything more than personal morals.  One thing notably lacking in most extremists is any sense of _personal_ accountability - the justification for any socially unacceptable behaviour is invariably some \\\"higher authority\\\" (aka, absolute moral truth).   An objective truth that says one cannot know the objective truth? Interesting notion.   :-)  Certainly one can have as one's morals a belief that compromise is good.  But to compromise on the absolute truth is not something most people do very successfully.  I suppose one could hold compromise as being an absolute moral, but then what happens when someone else insists on no compromise?  How do you compromise on compromising?   Almost invariably when considering the relative value of one thing over another, be it morals or consequences, people only consider those aspects which justify a desired action or belief.  In justifying a commitement to peace I might argue that it lets people live long & healthy and peaceful lives.  While that much may well be true, it is incomplete in ignoring the benefits of war - killing off the most agressive member of society, trimming down the population, stimulating production.  The equation is always more complex than presented. To characterize relative morals as merely following one's own conscience / desires is to unduly simplify it. \",\"         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Because of this I cannot in good faith recommend a Seca Turbo.

In fact, after this season, KDKA will no longer be the flagship station for the Pens.  The Penguins and KBL have struck a new  deal regarding the TV and radio rights to the games.  It seems more than likely that WDVE will be the flagship radio station next  season.  KBL will carry 62 games on tv,  with 17 of the games to be  simulcast on KDKA-TV.  The remaining 22 games, as well as some of the  early round playoff games, will be available by \\\"subscription tv\\\" only. To receive the games, you'll have to pay a one time hook up fee, and then a monthly fee of $11-12 dollars.  Also, under the new deal, there will no longer be radio/tv  simulcasts.

This article will provide the essential information for doing so on standard Unix systems.  A shell script and examples of alias file setups are included which presently run on a Sparc 2 here at balltown.cma.com for a number of mailing lists.  Note that if you do set up an automotive mailing list, please let me know of the -request address so that I can list it in the montly rec.autos posting.  Also inform the keeper of the Usenet list-of-lists (check news.answers for this monthly posting.)  First of all, to get anywhere, you need to either 1) be a sysadmin, or 2) have some measure of assistance from your sysadmin.  It is also important that you have reasonably good network connectivity; if it seems like you get everything several days after anyone else, or that you have trouble getting email through, then your network connectivity is probably not good enough.  Listserv:  There is a handy automated mailing list package named listserv, which is available from several ftp servers on the network.  Details of the installation and operation of listserv are beyond the scope of this article, but anyone who is considering running a large mailing list should probably  look at listserv carefully.  The Alias file:  On a typical unix system; there is a file named /usr/lib/aliases on whichever file server is your mail host; it contains lines such as:  foo:   bar, baz, bletch   which means that any email sent the name `foo' on that host is redistributed to users bar, baz, and bletch.  thus, the simplest possible email list is   my-favorite-car:  member1, member2, member3, my-address my-favorite-car-request: my-address  this has a couple of problems; the most noticeable one being that you have to be superuser to edit the alias file.  however, you can do the following, with the connivance of your sysadmin:  my-favorite-car: :include:/home/mydir/misc/autos/my-favorite-car-list my-favorite-car-request: my-address  Where the file specified is a list of comma and newline separated addresses.  This file can be in the list admin's home directory, owned by the list admin.  Bounced Mail:  this still has a problem; bounced mail usually gets distributed to all the members of the list, which is generally considered somewhat irritating. Therefore, the way that the driving school mailing list is set up is instructive (Thanks to harpal chohan of the bmw list for this setup, by the way.  I'm not sure where he got it from.)   school-request:   welty school-rebroadcast:  :include:/home/newwelty/misc/autos/school/list school: \\\"|/usr/local/adm/bin/explscript school\\\" owner-school: school-request owner-school-out: school-request   here's what is going on here:  the owner- and -request addresses are intended as traps for bounced mail coming from the network.  the -request address also serves as the point of contact for administrative duties.  school is what people send mail to; instead of pointing at addresses, it points at a shell script which rewrites headers before resending the email.  school-broadcast (of which nobody except me knows the name; the name has been changed here to protect my own sanity) points at the actual list members.  the shell script i use is as follows:  ----------------- #!/bin/sh cd /tmp sed -e '/^Reply-To:/d' -e '/^Sender:/d' -e '/^From /d' | \\\\         (echo Reply-To: ${1}@balltown.cma.com; \\\\          echo Errors-To: ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com; \\\\          echo Sender: ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com; \\\\          cat -) | \\\\         /usr/lib/sendmail -om -f ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com \\\\                 -F \\\"The ${1} Mailing List\\\" ${1}-rebroadcast exit 0 -------------------  note that this script does not know the name of the list; the name is passed in from outside, so that the script may be used for multiple lists (i run several out of this site.) the script excises Reply-To:, Sender:, and From lines from the incoming message, substitutes for Sender: and Reply-To:, and adds Errors-to: 99.9% of all email bounce messages end up being sent to the -request or owner- addresses if this header rewrite is done.  For digested lists, there is some digestification software around.

I can't imagine why you included it. \",\" To boorishly reply to myself, I found I did have the Instrutech information already. The specs (to use the term loosely) are as follows:  A/D: 16 bit converter, with 14 bit accuracy to 100 kHz, 12 bit accuracy to 200 kHz. No specs for S/N, monotonicity, linearity. There are 8 multiplexed inputs sharing the single A/D, so that all inputs are not samples at the same time, and in the above conversion specs the all-channel sample rate must be used. Thus, for two channels, you only have 14 unknown quality bits at 50 kHz per channel. This is poorer quality than the national Instruments, at the same sample rate.  D/A: 16 bit converter. No specs for S/N, monotonicity, linearity. Each of the 4 output channels has its own converter.\",\"Concerning the proposed newsgroup split, I personally am not in favor of    doing this.  I learn an awful lot about all aspects of graphics by reading    this group, from code to hardware to algorithms.  I just think making 5    different groups out of this is a wate, and will only result in a few posts    a week per group.  I kind of like the convenience of having one big forum    for discussing all aspects of graphics.  Anyone else feel this way?    Just curious.  I disagree.  You could learn the same amount by reading all the split groups, and it would make things easier for those of us who are less omnivorous.  There is no \\\"waste\\\" in creating news groups -- its just a bit of shuffling about.

We ran into one of my relatives at the  bus station and got to talking. A lot of people had gathered not far away, near the store. Well at first we didn't know what was happening, and then a fellow I know comes up to me, an Azerbaijani guy, and says, \\\"What are you standing here for? Go home immediately!\\\" I asked, \\\"What's going on?\\\" He says,  \\\"What's the matter, can't you see, they've overturned a car and they're  killing Armenians!\\\" He helped me catch a cab and we got home safely.  We sat at home for two days. During that time a gang of bandits came into our  courtyard. But the neighbors wouldn't let them in the building. There were  about 80 of them. They had sticks and pieces of armatures in their hands. They were shouting something, but you couldn't understand it. It wasn't one voice  or two, all of them were shouting in a chorus. They turned toward Building 35. They went up to the third _floor, and we see that they're breaking glass and  throwing things out the window. After a while they come out the entryway: one  has a pair of jeans in his hands, another has a tape recorder, and a third a  guitar. They went on toward the auto parts store.  We had to save ourselves. After midnight on March 1 we went to hide at School  No. 33, which is in Microdistrict 13. There were two other Armenian families  there with us. There were 13 of us altogether. Out of all of them I had only  known Ernest before, he had moved to Sumgait from Kirovabad. The Azerbaijani  guard at the school let us in. At first he didn't want to, but there was  nowhere else for us to go. We had to plead with him and talk him into it. We  were told that on that day, the 1st, there would be an attack on our  microdistrict.  We went upstairs to a classroom on the second floor.  On the city radio station they announced three telephone numbers that could be used to summon assistance or communicate anything important. I called one of  them and the First Secretary of the Sumgait City Party Committee answered. I asked him for assistance. I say, \\\"We're in School No. 33, we need to be  evacuated.\\\" Well he says, \\\"Got it, wait there, I'm sending out help now.\\\"  I know his voice. The First Secretary had been to our plant, I had spoken with him personally. When I called he said, \\\"Muslimzade here.\\\"  About two hours after the call we heard shouts near the school. We looked out the window and about 100 to 120 people were outside saying, \\\"Armenians, come  out, we're here to get you.\\\" They have clubs, axes, and armature shafts in  their hands. The guard sat there with us, and asked, \\\"Where should I go?\\\" I  say, \\\"If your life is of any value to you you'll go down there and say that  the Armenians were here and that they left.\\\" That's what he did. He went down  there and said, \\\"The Armenians were here,\\\" he said, \\\"I let them out the back  door, they went that way.\\\" And pointed with his hand. And with shouts and  noise the mob set off in the direction he had pointed.  So the assistance we had been promised did come. They sent us help, all right! Instead of sending real soldiers he had sent his own. I am positive that Muslimzade did that. No one had seen us entering the school, no one knew that  we were there. In any case, we stayed at the school until seven in the  morning, and no soldiers of any sort came to our aid.  In the morning we went to my relative's in Microdistrict 1, and the soldiers  took us to the SK club from there. The club was jammed with people, and there  were lots of people ahead of us--there was no space available. One small boy,  about three months old, died right in my arms. There wasn't a single doctor,  nothing. The boy was uninjured, there were no wounds or bruises on him. He was just very ill. They gave him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, they did everything they could under the circumstances, but were unable to save him. And his  mother and father, a young Armenian couple, were right there, on the floor ...  I searched for a spot for us in the SK, we have a small child of our own, I wanted to find a room or something to put my family in. I went up to the third floor, there were a lot of soldiers up there, bandaged, with canes, limping,  with their heads broken open. They were a terrible sight. Young guys, all of  them.  There were a lot of bandaged Armenians, too. Everyone had been beaten,  everyone was crying, wailing, and calling for help. I think that the City Party Committee ignored us completely. True, there was a snack bar: a sausage  was 30 kopeks or 40 kopeks, a package of cookies that cost 26 kopeks was being sold for 50, a bottled soft drink cost a ruble . . . But there was no way to  get the things any cheaper.  I met my old uncle, Aram Mikhailovich, there. He saw me and tears welled up in his eyes. My whole life he had told me that we were friendly peoples, that we  worked together, he always had Azerbaijanis over at his house. And now he saw  me and there was nothing he could say, he just cried. You can understand his  feelings, of course.

You all are an insult to you race! {assuming you are also semitic}  Now I have a comment concerning Israeli terrorism during the 1930's and 1940's.  The Hirgun, and other branch - off militant groups, did fight the British do get them out of Palestine.  Yet I fail to see how this Israeli form of terrorism was better than the terrorism practiced now by the Arabs.  These Jewish terrorist groups killed innocent British soldiers, but not only thta also killed many Jews who were in favor of a compromise with the Palestinians.  In addition, they massacred an entire Palestinian village in 1948, contributing to the exodus of the frightened Palestinians who feared their very lives.  I mention this not because I'm anti semitic [I'm part Jewish] but because this self righteousness on the part of the Israelites pisses me off so.  I'm not as critical of the Palestinians because they were indeed screwed over by the Jews.

Going into the 1992/93 season, the numbers of Euros on NHL teams have escalated to the following stats:  Canadians: 400 Americans: 100 Europeans: 100     Please note that these numbers are rounded off, and taken from the top 25 players on each of the 24 teams. My source is the Vancouver Sun.     Here's the point: there are far too many Europeans in the NHL. I am sick of watching a game between an American and a Canadian team (let's say, the Red Wings and the Canucks) and seeing names like \\\"Bure\\\" \\\"Konstantinov\\\" and \\\"Borshevshky\\\". Is this North America or isn't it? Toronto, Detriot, Quebec, and Edmonton are particularly annoying, but the numbers of Euros on other teams is getting worse as well.       I live in Vancouver and if I hear one more word about \\\"Pavel Bure, the Russian Rocket\\\" I will completely throw up. As it is now, every time I see the Canucks play I keep hoping someone will cross-check Bure into the plexiglassso hard they have to carry him out on a stretcher. (By the way, I'm not a Canucks fan to begin with ;-).       Okay, the stretcher remark was a little carried away. But the point is that I resent NHL owners drafting all these Europeans INSTEAD of Canadians (and some Americans). It denies young Canadians the opportunity to play in THEIR NORTH AMERICAN LEAGUE and instead gives it to Europeans, who aren't even better hockey players. It's all hype. This \\\"European mystique\\\" is sickening, but until NHL owners get over it, Canadian and American players will continue to have to fight harder to get drafted into their own league.      With the numbers of Euros in the NHL escalating, the problem is clearly only getting worse.      I'm all for the creation of a European Hockey League, and let the Bures and Selannes of the world play on their own continent.      I just don't want them on mine.       --  Richard J.

SCSI-1 {with a SCSI-1 controler chip} range is indeed 0-5MB/s and that is ALL you have right about SCSI SCSI-1 {With a SCSI-2 controller chip}: 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit}  Note the INCREASE in SPEED, the Mac Quadra uses this version of SCSI-1  so it DOES exist. Some PC use this set up too. SCSI-2 {8-bit/SCSI-1 mode}:          4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst SCSI-2 {16-bit/wide or fast mode}:  8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst SCSI-2 {32-bit/wide AND fast}:     15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst   By your OWN data the \\\"Although SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI\\\" is correct With a SCSI-2 controller chip SCSI-1 can reach 10MB/s which is indeed \\\"20% faster than IDE\\\" {120% of 8.3 is 9.96}. ALL these SCSI facts have been posted to this newsgroup in my Mac & IBM info sheet {available by FTP on  sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6) in the info-mac/report as  mac-ibm-compare[version #].txt (It should be 173 but 161 may still be there)}  Part of this problem is both Mac and IBM PC are inconsiant about what SCSI is which.  Though it is WELL documented that the Quadra has a SCSI-2 chip an Apple salesperson said \\\"it uses a fast SCSI-1 chip\\\" {Not at a 6MB/s, 10MB/s burst it does not. SCSI-1 is 5MB/s maximum synchronous and Quadra uses ANsynchronous SCSI which is SLOWER}  It seems that Mac and IBM see SCSI-1 interface and think 'SCSI-1' when it maybe a SCSI-1 interface driven in the machine by a SCSi-2 controller chip in 8-bit mode {Which is MUCH FASTER then true SCSI-1 can go}.\",\"   Hello, I know that this has been discussed before.

CAPITAL letters, or NOT, the above is pure nonsense.  It BM] seems to me that short sighted Armenians are escalating the hostilities        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^      Again, Armenians in KARABAKH are SIMPLY defending themselves. What do      want them to do. Lay down their ARMS and let Azeris walk all over them.  BM] while hoping that Turkey will stay out.  Stop and think for a moment, BM] will you?  Armenia doesn't need anyone to drag her into the conflict, it BM] is a part of it.    Armenians KNEW from the begining that TURKS were FULLY engaged  training AZERIS militarily to fight against  KARABAKHI-Armenians.   henrik] The KARABAKHI-ARMENIANS who have lived in their HOMELAND for 3000  henrik] years (CUT OFF FROM ARMENIA and GIVEN TO AZERIS BY STALIN) are the  henrik] ones DIRECTLY involved in the CONFLICT. They are defending  henrik] themselves against AZERI AGGRESSION.   BM]  Huh?  You didn't expect Azeri's to be friendly to forces fighting with them BM]  within their borders?     Well, history is SAD. Remember, those are relocated Azeris into          the Armenian LAND of KARABAKH by the STALIN regime.  henrik] At last, I hope that the U.S. insists that Turkey stay out of the  henrik] KARABAKH crisis so that the repeat of the CYPRUS invasion WILL NEVER  henrik] OCCUR again.  BM] You're not playing with a full deck, are you?  Where would Turkey invade?     It is not up to me to speculate but I am sure Turkey would have stepped    into Armenia if SHE could.   BM] Are you throwing the Cyprus buzzword around with s.c.g. in the header BM] in hopes that the Greek netters will jump the gun?     Absolutely NOT ! I am merely trying to emphasize that in many         cases, HISTORY repeats itself.   BM] Yes indeed Turkey has the military prowess to intervene, what she wishes  BM] she had, however, is the diplomatic power to stop the hostilities and bring BM] the parties to the negotiating table.  That's hard to do when Armenians  BM] are attacking Azeri towns.   So, let me understand in plain WORDS what you are saying; Turkey         wants a PEACEFUL END to this CONFLICT. NOT !!   I will believe it when I see it.   Now, as far as attacking, what do you do when you see a GUN pointing         to your HEAD ? Do you sit there and WATCH or DEFEND yoursef(fat chance)?  Do you remember what Azeris did to the Armenians in BAKU ? All the  BARBERIAN ACTS especially against MOTHERS and their CHILDREN. I mean  BURNING people ALIVE !  BM] Armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the  BM] futility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that  BM] leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis that's  BM] going to cause incessant skirmishes.     Armenians in KARABAKH want PEACE and their own republic. They are          NOT asking much. They simply want to get back what was TAKEN AWAY   from them and GIVEN to AZERIS by STALIN.   BM] Think of 10 or 20 years down the line -- both of the newly independent  BM] countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe  BM] the other out.   These people will be neighbors, would it not be better  BM] to keep the bad blood between them minimal?   Don't get me WRONG. I also want PEACEFUL solution to the  conflict. But until Azeris realize that, the Armenians in  KARABAKH will defend themselves against aggresion.  BM] If you belong to the Armenian diaspora, keep in mind that what strikes BM] your fancy on the map is costing the local Armenians dearly in terms of  BM] their blood and future.    Again, you are taking different TURNS. Armenia HAS no intension         to GRAB any LAND from Azerbaijan. The Armenians in KARABAKH         are simply defending themselves UNTIL a solution is SET.  BM] It's easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize  BM] craziness to have your feelings about Turks tickled.  The Armenians BM] in Armenia and N-K will be there, with the same people you seem to hate  BM] as their neighbors, for maybe 3000 years more.  The sooner there's peace in BM] the region the better it is for them and everyone else.  I'd push for BM] compromise if I were you instead of hitting the caps-lock and spreading BM] inflammatory half-truths.\",\"Clinton has backed off from the $16 billion jobs bill.

EDT                  Q   Why was the 10:00 a.m. postponed?                  MS. MYERS:  Just due to scheduling conflicts.  So as we  put out, the President will meet with the leaders of the national  police organizations at 2:00 p.m. in the Rose Garden, as opposed to  10:00 a.m.  The only other things on his schedule today are:  At  11:00 a.m. he'll meet with General Vessey, who, as you know, is on  his way to Vietnam to continue working on the MIA-POW issue.  At  12:30 p.m. he'll have lunch with the Vice President in the Oval  Office.  And at 2:00 p.m. he'll meet with the police organizations. Then from 3:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. he'll do his weekly photos with the  various groups.              Q   A photo op with Vessey?              MS. MYERS:  There's no coverage on the Vessey meeting.              Q   Why?              MS. MYERS:  Why?  It's a closed meeting.                Q   What about the lunch?              MS. MYERS:  The lunch?  No, there's no coverage.              Q   Is he meeting with any congress people today?              MS. MYERS:  Nothing scheduled.              Q   There are no meetings --              MS. MYERS:  There are no congressional meetings today,  no.              Q   Has the President been given any information by the  Pentagon or reached any conclusion about the validity of this report  from Hanoi?  Any instructions to Vessey on how to deal with the  Vietnamese on that subject?              MS. MYERS:  Well, clearly, the report is the first order  of business.  It's high on the agenda on something that they'll  discuss.  I think the President and General Vessey will discuss the  parameters of his visit to Vietnam today, but the President hasn't  drawn any conclusions about the report yet.  Certainly, it's  something that he wants General Vessey to talk with the Vietnamese  about first.              Q   Did the President talk with any Republican senators  yesterday about the stimulus package?              MS. MYERS:  He spoke with Senator Dole.              Q   How many times?              MS. MYERS:  I believe once during the day and once last  night.              Q   What was the outcome of that?              MS. MYERS:  They're continuing to work toward some kind  of an agreement on a jobs package.              Q   Is it your impression that Senator Dole is in any  way flexible on this?              MS. MYERS:  Well, I think we're hopeful that we're going  to get some kind of jobs package through the Senate, and we'll  continue to work with Senator Dole and others until we reach some  kind of an agreement.              Q   Did they discuss the VAT tax?              MS. MYERS:  I don't know if that came up.              Q   Can you check that?              MS. MYERS:  Sure.        Q   So what are they -- is the President offering to  scale down his program -- is that what he's trying to do, buy it down  to where Dole will sign on?              MS. MYERS:  Well, he's trying to protect as much of it  as he can.  But it's important to him to get some kind of a jobs  package through the Senate and through Congress now.  And as soon as  we reach some conclusions on that, we'll let you know.  But at the  moment, he's continuing to consult with members of Congress  including, obviously, Senator Dole.              Q   Is he talking to anybody else?              MS. MYERS:  I don't believe he talked to any other  Republicans yesterday.              Q   Is he talking to anybody today?              MS. MYERS:  I don't think anything is scheduled, but I  wouldn't rule it out.              Q   We were led to believe that the President called  Mr. Dole on the subject of Russian aid and that Bob Dole brought the  conversation around to stimulus package.  Is that correct?              MS. MYERS:  I think the President has contacted several  people on Russian aid.  I think that it was always expected that the  stimulus package or the jobs package will be part of any conversation  he would have with Senator Dole.  The primary objective of the  conversation was Russian aid.  That was the first order of business,  but it was both.              Q   In the President's mind, are they linked  politically in that if the Republicans continue to reject the  stimulus package, he thinks it will be harder to sell Russian aid to  the American people?  Has he made that argument?              MS. MYERS:  I can't talk about specifically what  arguments he might have made.  The President is obviously committed  to both.  He liked to see a jobs package to the American people  first.  But as you know, we outlined the details of additional  Russian aid last night in Tokyo.              Q   But does the President believe that the stimulus  package will make it more difficult to persuade Americans to vote for  Russian -- to accept a vote for Russian aid?              MS. MYERS:  I think that the President is going to  continue to work to pass the stimulus package, to pass a jobs  package, and we're still hopeful that we'll get some kind of jobs  package through the Congress.              Q   Is it fair to say that the President is negotiating  now with Dole?              MS. MYERS:  He's discussing options with him.              Q   On the stimulus, is it your understanding that over  the break some Democrats, themselves, have left the support that they  had earlier for the package, the stimulus package?              MS. MYERS:  I think we still have wide support in the  Senate for the jobs package.              Q   But specifically, that you've lost Democrats other  than Shelby?              MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so.  There hasn't been a  vote.              Q   What about Kohl?              Q   Kohl and Feingold?              MS. MYERS:  There hasn't been a vote yet.  And we'll  continue to work with senators to try to get a majority to try to  bring the package to a vote, because we believe that a majority of  the members of the United States Senate support the package.              Q   If you're weren't worried about Kohl and Feingold,  why did George mention Milwaukee projects the other day?              MS. MYERS:  I think George pointed out a number of  projects in a number of states that stand to be funded, or to lose  funding if this jobs package doesn't pass.              Q   No Democrats.  (Laughter.)              MS. MYERS:  I'll let you draw your own conclusions.              Q   Does he plan to talk to Dole again today or any  other Republicans again today?              MS. MYERS:  There's nothing specifically scheduled, but  again, I wouldn't rule it out.              Q   Does he plan to put out any more press releases to  any other states today?              MS. MYERS:  What we've done is we're in the process of  breaking down the benefits of the jobs package state by state.  I  think it's entirely feasible that as we sort of are able to sum those  up, we'll send out press releases to the various states that suggest  how their states would benefit from this package.              Q   Will you share those with us?              MS. MYERS:  Sure.  As we did yesterday.              Q   Do you have copies of the ones you sent --              MS. MYERS:  Yes, we made those available yesterday.  And  we certainly can continue to provide them today.              Q   Dee Dee, since yesterday's questions and subsequent  stories about the VAT, what further consideration of this issue has  been given?              MS. MYERS:  Nothing's changed since yesterday.  I think  the President commented on it this morning to say only that it was  something he knew was being considered by the task force and that he  has not made a decision on, and I don't think we have anything to add  to that.              Q   But he also said that business and labor groups are  telling him they support it.  Can you tell us --              MS. MYERS:  I think that there has been -- I'm not going  to speculate on who supports it.  I think the President said that  there has been some support among business and labor groups.  I don't  think he said he was directly contacted by them.              Q   Are we to take that to mean that the administration  has sounded out business and labor groups on this --              MS. MYERS:  I think there's been plenty of public  discourse on this over the years and even recently, but I don't think  I want to add to that.              Q   In February, though, the President said that this  was something to be considered 10 or 15 years down the road.  What  has happened between then and now to cause this administration to  change its mind?              MS. MYERS:  I think as we said yesterday, it is  something that the working groups are looking at.  They're  considering a wide variety of options on everything from funding to  specific options that will be covered by the President's health care  plan.  The President has not taken it up yet, has not made a decision  on it.  And beyond that, I don't have anything to add.              Q   You haven't answered the question.  It wasn't being  considered by anyone in the White House after the President's  comments in February, and George reaffirmed that in a briefing.              Q   And then suddenly --              Q   What happened?        MS. MYERS:  The working groups, as we have said  throughout, we instructed to consider a wide variety of options  across-the-board.  And one of the things that has been talked about  and that they are clearly considering is some kind of a value-added  tax.        Q   But the President himself took this off the table,  Dee Dee, and suddenly it reappears.  And this goes to the credibility  of this administration in a way.  What has happened in the meantime?        MS. MYERS:  The President has not looked at this, it  hasn't been presented to him, again, yet.  The working groups are  looking at it, as they're looking at a wide variety of options, and  no decisions have been made.        Q   And it raises the question of how independently the  task force is working.        MS. MYERS:  The task force was instructed to consider  all options, and they've taken that mandate seriously and they're  considering all options.        Q   But that's not the impression that the President  left in February.  The impression he left was that this was something  that was long-range, to be looked at 10, 15 years down the road.  The  clear implication of his remarks was that this was something that was  not on the table, not an option.         Q   \\\"If it changes I'll tell you.\\\"              Q   Bring him on.        Q   And you repeatedly referred to the President's  remarks, telling us that those were still in operation.              MS. MYERS:  It's changed, and we told you.  (Laughter.)              Q   But that's what Alice Rivlin's comments and Donna  Shalala comments were about.  I mean, that seemed like an  orchestrated effort because you have two independent Cabinet officers  --        MS. MYERS:  I wouldn't -- no, Alice Rivlin's not a  Cabinet member, first of all.  Second of all, it was not  orchestrated, but clearly, they both said yesterday and in the last  couple of days that it's something that's being looked at.  We  confirmed that yesterday.  And I don't have anything to add to that.        Q   Is it because he has very few options?        Q   Is this something that it will be incumbent upon  the task force to convince the President about?  In other words, has  the President himself personally ruled it out and it's now up to the  task force to convince him to put it back on the table?  Or is it, in  fact, back on the table, having been placed there by discussions with  the President?          MS. MYERS:  It is not the working group's mission at  this point to convince the President of anything.  It is their  mission to put before him his options and to explain the benefits and  the costs and the basic pros and cons of each of those options.  I  think that they will certainly present the VAT to him in that  context, and at this point he's not -- that presentation has not been  made, but it's something that he will hear and he has not made a  decision on.        Q   They will present it to him as one of his options,  though he specifically ruled it out?        MS. MYERS:  Correct.        Q   Dee Dee, is this more than a trial balloon?  Is  this a serious consideration that the working groups are giving to  this form of taxation?        MS. MYERS:  It's simply a statement of fact.  The  working groups are considering a wide variety of options on a number  of issues relating to health care reform.  One of the options that  they're looking at is the VAT.         Q   Dee Dee, when the working groups were examining  this possibility, was this on the table during the same time period  that you were telling us that it was not?        MS. MYERS:  I don't know what the specific timing of  their drafting of options is.  I don't know.        Q   Who was telling you that it was not under  consideration?        MS. MYERS:  I was referring back to the President's  comments.        Q   Have they discovered that the sin taxes won't raise  enough money to fund the core benefit package?        MS. MYERS:  No, there's no decisions that have been made  on how to pay for the health care plan.              Q   I'm asking whether the projections --              MS. MYERS:  There's a number of options depending on how  the plan is structured.  You can't decide how much the plan is going  to cost until you decide what the plan is going to look like.  And so  you can't discuss what financing options have been ruled in our out  until you know.        Q   Dee Dee, we've been told that they have a computer  models on a number of possible packages.        MS. MYERS:  Correct.          Q   The question is whether they have now determined  whether sin taxes would not produce enough money for even the barest  minimum package.  That is not a very difficult computation.        MS. MYERS:  It is a question that you know that we're  not going to answer until -- there's a number of options being  considered.  It depends on how the package is structured.  The exact  details of the package and the financing mechanisms used to pay for  them are all among the decisions that have yet to be made.                Q   And when the President has been meeting with health  care -- his health care advisors, which we are told he has been doing  --              MS. MYERS:  Correct.              Q      they have never once said to him, these are your  funding options, including the VAT?  He has never heard the word VAT  in his --              MS. MYERS:    I am not going to comment on the specific  nature of the daily -- they're not daily, but the quasi-regular  briefings.              Q   Well, you have.              MS. MYERS:  I have not, other than to say that he's not  considered the VAT.  And I think that is a true statement.              Q   No, but you said that it has not been presented to  him as an option.              MS. MYERS:  Correct.              Q   That doesn't mean he hasn't heard about it.              MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to get into the details of  what's discussed.  I think that statement stands for itself.              Q      specific, Dee Dee.  When you say he hasn't  looked at it, do you mean that he hasn't looked at it in terms of  paying for medical coverage, or hasn't looked at it in general?   Because back in Chilicothe he was very specific in defining how it  works, what the advantages are, the whole thing.  It sounds like --              MS. MYERS:  But that was -- I think in Chilicothe, if  you go back to his remarks there, it was a broader philosophical  discussion of the tax structure.  And I think the comments were  generally in reference to the overall economic plan.  But clearly,  it's something that he's thought about in the broad context.  I mean,  that was clear in Chilicothe.  What I'm saying is that in the process  of the working groups it's something that he hasn't considered yet.   It's something that the working groups will present to him among the  number of options, and that no decisions have been made.  And I'm not  going to comment any further on the details of the meetings where  health care issues are being discussed.              Q   It's your statement from this podium that no  discussion of this has taken place.  You say that no option -- that  the option has not been presented to him.              MS. MYERS:  That is correct.              Q   Do you stand by -- does the White House still stand  by George's statement in March that this will not be in the proposal?              MS. MYERS:  No decisions have been made.  We have  nothing to add to what's already been said.              Q   Let me follow up here.  Do you stand by what Rivlin  said yesterday, that if any kind of VAT were to be used or  considered, that other changes to the tax code would have to be made  so that it would be less regressive?              MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to comment any further on what  might happen if.              Q   But do you stand by the previous conversations in  February that if there were to be a VAT, I think the President said  you'd exclude food and energy --              MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to comment on the specific  structure of a decision that hasn't been made.              Q   Was the President aware prior to Donna Shalala's  comments yesterday that this was under consideration by the working  groups?              MS. MYERS:  I don't know specifically what --              Q   Could you check for us, because that's a real  important credibility question?              MS. MYERS:  Sure.              Q   Since the task force was brought together this  issue has been discussed, at the beginning and throughout, as one  fairly painless way to raise a lot of money.  Were you all kept in  the dark?  Was the Press Office kept in the dark over the past month  and a half when you've been denying that a VAT tax would be  considered that it was actually on the table over there as an option?              MS. MYERS:  I think we've said all that we have to say.   It is something the working groups are looking at.  The President has  not made a decision about it yet.  And beyond that, I have nothing to  add.              Q   Well, sorry, Dee Dee, there are still a couple of  questions that we are going to have to ask because we have a problem  with credibility here -- yours primarily.  What we're asking is, if  you all were not told at all that this thing was being considered  while you were coming out here and telling us that it was not, or if  it's a case that you were coming out here and deliberately misleading  us.              MS. MYERS:  I don't believe that anyone has ever come  out here and deliberately misled you from this podium -- ever --ever.              Q   Has anyone tried to shade it a little bit to  indicate something -- has anybody told anybody to come out --              MS. MYERS:  We're not trying to shade answers or  deliberately mislead anybody.  I've said what I have to say about  this issue.              Q   All we were trying to find out --              MS. MYERS:  I understand what you're trying to find out  and I've given you the answers, Helen.              Q   We're trying to find out what changed -- what made  it an option again.  That's the --              MS. MYERS:  The working groups were given a broad  mandate to investigate all options, and they are doing that.                Q   Yes, but it wasn't an option before.  How can you  investigate it if the President has taken it off the table?              MS. MYERS:  It is something that they're obviously  considering and the President has not made a decision on.              Q   Yes, but he took it off the table in February.              MS. MYERS:  Working groups are considering it.  They'll  present it to the President at some point and he'll make a decision.              Q   Why would they consider it if he has taken it off  the table?              MS. MYERS:  It's clearly on the table.               Q   Yes, but he took it off the table.  Did he change  his mind?              MS. MYERS:  It's back on the table, Bill.              Q   Did he change his mind?              MS. MYERS:  He said this morning that he hasn't made a  decision about it.  He obviously knows that it's on the table.  It's  something that he will look at at some and when we have a decision on  this we'll let you know.              Q   So he must have changed his mind, right?              MS. MYERS:  At some point it will be looked at.  I mean,  --              Q   Dee Dee, there's like two options -- either he  changed his mind or the working groups think they're authority  exceeds the President's.              MS. MYERS:  The working groups were given a broad  mandate to look at all options; they've done that.              Q   Are you going to put out his income tax?              MS. MYERS:  Yes, there will be something available on  his income tax probably later this afternoon.  His return will be  available.               Q   Will there be any kind of briefing to go through  it?              MS. MYERS:  No, nothing's planned.  I think someone will  be available, probably not in a briefing setting, but to walk you  through the questions.              Q   We're used to be walked line-by-line through the  presidential tax forms.              MS. MYERS:  I've seen those briefings.  (Laughter.)              Q   Could we have one?              MS. MYERS:   No, I don't think there will be any kind of  a formal briefing, but there will be somebody available to answer  your questions about it.              Q   Did they file a joint form?              MS. MYERS:  Yes.              Q   When did he file it?              MS. MYERS:  I believe it's being filed today.              Q   Dee Dee, is there going to be a backgrounder for  Miyazawa?              MS. MYERS:  No, there will be a readout after the  meeting.              Q   No backgrounder today?              MS. MYERS:  No backgrounder today.              Q   This is complicated stuff.  We need help.   (Laughter.)              MS. MYERS:  We can't give you taxes and Miyazawa all in  one day, it's too confusing.  (Laughter.)              Q   Vance and Owen have opened the doors on the use of  force in Bosnia.   They've both said that, A, they never ruled it  out, and B, it might be necessary now.  Does that influence your  thinking on whether or not to change your approach?              MS. MYERS:  There's been no change in our policy towards  Bosnia.  We have always said that we'd consider --              Q   But does that impact upon your decision?  Are they  people whose opinions would carry weight with you?              MS. MYERS:  They're people whose opinions carry weight  certainly.  I mean, the President supports the process that they've  initiated.  But there's been no change in our policy for Bosnia,  although we're considering a number of options right now.  If the  Serbs don't come back to the negotiating table, if they don't sign on  to some kind of an agreement, we will consider additional options,  which we've been saying regularly.              Q   One follow-up question then?  We cannot get a  straight answer from anyone in the administration.  Why do you not  set a deadline for the Serbs?  Can you tell us the strategic or  tactical reasons for not giving them a deadline to come to the table?              MS. MYERS:  We're continuing to put pressure on them  every day.              Q   Which doesn't work so --              MS. MYERS:  Well, we think it is having some effect.   We're going to continue to tighten sanctions.  As you know, we  support the omnibus resolution.  We expect that to come to a vote on  the 26th.                Q   You say it's having an effect -- can you give us  any documentation?              MS. MYERS:  I'd be happy to provide somebody to talk to  you about the impact of the sanctions and things like that.              Q   There's been no -- you have not been able to  provide anybody who can tell us that the sanctions have had any  effect in Bosnia.  Serbia, yes; in Bosnia, no.              MS. MYERS:  I think that they've had effect in Serbia  and we think they've had some effect in Bosnia.  And again, I'll be  happy to provide somebody to walk you through the details of that, if  you'd like.              Q   We would like to hear from someone who can show us  what the effect has been in Bosnia.  We had the briefing on all of  the terrible things that are happening in Belgrade, but we haven't  seen anything that indicates an impact on the fighting.  Can you  provide something along those lines?              MS. MYERS:  I will see what I can get you.              Q   On the extra Russian aid that Christopher announced  this morning -- where is that money coming from?              MS. MYERS:  We'll have to work with Congress on the  details of that package.              Q   So that would be new money that you would hope to  get?              MS. MYERS:    Yes, that's new money, in addition to the  $1.6 billion announced in Vancouver.  So I assume that you all have  seen the $1.8-billion package that was announced this morning in  Tokyo by Secretary Christopher.              Q   Isn't there a concern, though, about offering  something which you have to get in Congress?  I mean, that was the  concern with Vancouver; you didn't want to do that.              MS. MYERS:  The concern with Vancouver was to do  something immediately, which required money that was already approved  in the Fiscal '93 budget.  What we're looking at now is a little bit  longer-term plan to build on top of the $1.6 billion that we  announced in Vancouver.  This clearly will require congressional  approval, or some of it will anyway, and we're going to continue to  work with Congress to make that happen.              Q   To what extent has that been vetted or agreed to by  Congress?              MS. MYERS:  The President has had a number of  conversations with members and will continue to work with them as  this process moves forward.              Q   Was Christopher able to put this package out with a  fair degree of understanding that you will be able to get it through  Congress?              MS. MYERS:  It was created in consultation with  Congress.              Q   In meeting with the law enforcement officials, is  that -- does that have a set speech and a goal?  A direction?              MS. MYERS:  Yes, the President will talk about -- and  the law enforcement organizations are endorsing the President's jobs  package.  They believe particularly the summer jobs package will help  give kids something to do.              Q   Who are they?              MS. MYERS:  It's members or leadership from three  organizations:  NAPO, which is the National Association of Police  Organizations; IBPO, which is the International Brotherhood of Police  Organizations, I believe; and IUPA, which is the International Union  of Police Associations.              Q   Will the FBI chief be there?              MS. MYERS:  The FBI chief?  No.              Q   Or any other federal law enforcement officials?              MS. MYERS:  No, it will be the President and these  national law enforcement organization leaders.              Q   Does the $1.8 billion announced today include the  $400 million that's in the FY '94 budget for disarmament?              MS. MYERS:  No.  The Nunn-Lugar money is separate.              Q   So this would be the $700 million that's in the  budget already, plus another $1.1 billion?              MS. MYERS:  I believe all of this is on top of the $700  million already in the budget.              Q   Is this going to be part of the supplemental or  Fiscal '94 --              MS. MYERS:  We'll work with Congress on the exact  funding mechanism -- on exactly how this will be paid for.              Q   This $1.8 billion on top of --              MS. MYERS:  On top of $700 million -- on top of the $400  million Nunn-Lugar money we announced earlier.              Q   And this is what prompted the President to call Bob  Dole -- it was on this tranche, not on the previous money he was  calling Bob Dole?              MS. MYERS:  Correct.              Q   Is there a briefing on Miyazawa?              MS. MYERS:  There will be a readout after the meeting  with Miyazawa.  Tomorrow.              Q   Dee Dee, on a totally unrelated matter, some  Republicans who are active in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are  complaining about this new cozy relationship between the White House  and the Chamber of Commerce.  There are -- the town hall meeting the  other night, the satellite and all of this relationship. Does the White House feel that you're getting too close to these  Chambers of Commerce?              MS. MYERS:  That's an interesting charge.  (Laughter.)   After how many years of Democrats being accused of not paying any  attention to the Chambers, now there are those who would accuse us of  being too close.  I think that's interesting.  But no, we're thrilled  by the support we've received from the national Chamber and local  Chambers across the country and we'll continue to work with them on  this and other initiatives.              Q   What's the status of the President thinking about  going to this Democratic retreat?              MS. MYERS:  It's on his calendar.  I think he'll almost  certainly go.              Q   All three days?              MS. MYERS:  We haven't figured out exactly when he'll be  there yet.                Q   Is it open to coverage?              MS. MYERS:  No, I believe the whole thing is closed.              Q   Is he going to have any kind of address, statement,  anything at all on the gay rights march on the 25th?              MS. MYERS:  We're still looking at that.  We haven't  made a final decision about how we'll -- who will make a statement or  what --              Q   Any meetings scheduled with any of the leaders?              MS. MYERS:  Nothing is scheduled, but I wouldn't rule it  out.              Q   What about an AIDS czar?              MS. MYERS:  It's coming.              Q   Anything on the weekend?              Q   There's been a suggestion that he's going to this  retreat to avoid having to participate in the gay rights -- or appear  or have any involvement in the gay rights march.              MS. MYERS:  No, I think this is something he's been  discussing for a long time -- appearing at the Senate Democratic  retreat.              Q   The weekend?              MS. MYERS:  Weekend?  Don't know -- the only thing on  right now is the radio address on Saturday.              Q   Any travel plans?              MS. MYERS:  If it changes -- none right now.              Q   He's not going to be off campaigning for his  stimulus package?              MS. MYERS:  No specific plans right now.              Q   What about mid-week?  Anything likely?              MS. MYERS:  It's possible.  Yes, I think it's likely  that we'll travel next week -- certainly the weekend.              Q   Has he called Thurmond about his daughter?              MS. MYERS:  I don't know.  I'll check.              Q   Going to name a drug czar this weekend?              MS. MYERS:  This weekend?  I don't believe so.              Q   And the radio address on Saturday -- is that going  to be focused on the stimulus package?              MS. MYERS:  I'm sure it will.              THE PRESS:  Thank you.\",\" ...

Note the early use of PostScript technology, predating many of this year's papers listed in the April 1st SIGGRAPH Program Announcement posted here a few days ago.  -- Eric   Intersection Between a Line and a Polygon (UNDECIDABLE??),  by Dave Baraff, Tom Duff   From: deb@charisma.graphics.cornell.edu  Newsgroups: comp.graphics  Keywords: P, NP, Jordan curve separation, Ursyhon Metrization Theorem  Organization: Program of Computer Graphics   I think that this is a very difficult problem.  To start with, lines and polygons are semi-algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of points.  Here are a few off-the-cuff ideas.  First, we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated.  Now, the Jordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into exactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions.  Thus, the line lies completely inside the polygon, the line lies completely outside the polygon, or possibly (but this will rarely happen) the line intersects the polyon.  Now, the phrasing of this question says \\\"if a line intersects a polygon\\\", so this is a decision problem.  One possibility (the decision model approach) is to reduce the question to some other (well known) problem Q, and then try to solve Q.  An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem.  In recent years, many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a new language called PostScript.  (See \\\"PostScript Language\\\", by Adobe Systems Incorporated, ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).  So, given a line L and a polygon P, we can write a PostScript program that draws the line L and the polygon P, and then \\\"outputs\\\" the answer.  By \\\"output\\\", we mean the program executes a command called \\\"showpage\\\", which actually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon.  A quick examination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q, and thus the original problem.  There are two small problems with this approach.    (1) There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into the  reduced problem Q.  So, we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of  Choice (or equivalently, Zorn's Lemma).  But the use of the Axiom of  Choice is not regarded in a very serious light these days.   (2) More importantly, the question arises as to whether or not the  PostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper; or in  other words, will it halt?   Now, PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a  Turing Machine might do; thus the halting problem (for PostScript) is  undecidable.  It is quite possible that the original problem will turn  out to be undecidable.   I won't even begin to go into other difficulties, such as aliasing, finite precision and running out of ink, paper or both.  A couple of references might be:  1. Principia Mathematica.  Newton, I.

Organization: AT&T Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill NJ  The situation is not nearly as bleak as Baraff suggests (he should know better, he's hung around The Labs for long enough).  By the well known Dobbin-Dullman reduction (see J. Dullman & D. Dobbin, J. Comp. Obfusc. 37,ii:  pp. 33-947, lemma 17(a)) line-polygon intersection can be reduced to Hamiltonian Circuit, without(!) the use of Grobner bases, so LPI (to coin an acronym) is probably only NP-complete.  Besides, Turing-completeness will no longer be a problem once our Cray-3 is delivered, since it will be able to complete an infinite loop in 4 milliseconds (with scatter-gather.)  --------  From: deb@svax.cs.cornell.edu (David Baraff)  Well, sure its no worse than NP-complete, but that's ONLY if you restrict yourself to the case where the line satisfies a Lipschitz condition on its second derivative.

The explanation    we were given (at least at one point) was that they thought the cult    members would be at religious services.  My only comment on this bit    of idiocy is that if you're going to operate as a quasi-military unit,    you'd better understand basic military tactics.  One cardinal rule    is that only a fool plans an operation where if one assumption is    incorrect, the operation will fail disastrously.  2. We were told that ATF got four agents killed because they were    outgunned, they didn't expect such heavy resistance.  When    questioned about why such an overwhelming military-style assault    was planned, we were told that it was because the cultists were    thought to be heavily armed.  Can you say contradictory?  I knew    you could!  3. The BATF has had a bad reputation for years as a bunch of arrogant,    hotdoggers.  I was talking to relatives a couple of weeks ago and    referred to them as a bunch of Crockett and Tubbs wannabes.  I'm    more than ever convinced that's right on target.  An anecdote not    related to the Waco fiasco is that apparently the BATF screwed up    some of the evidence in the World Trade Center bombing.  There's    now an excellent chance some of the forensic evidence gathered by    the FBI will not be admissible in court.  This is not hearsay.  I    was told this by a relative of my wife's who happens to be an FBI    agent.  His opinion of the BATF was, ummm, well, let's just say    uncomplimentary.  4. I have *still* not been presented with one iota of evidence that    the BD's had *any* of the alleged illegal weaponry which was the    reason for the raid in the first place.  BTW, we're *still* hearing    this justification.  AG Reno, on CNN yesterday, made references    to this issue, without any substantiation.  She also waved around    the \\\"He's a child abuser and we heard he was beating the children!\\\"    flag.  Sigh.  5. A point re the Feds in general: their handling of the whole siege    reflected a complete lack of understanding of the probable thought    processes of the cultists.  AG Reno said they pushed the button    because they were afraid a mass suicide was in the offing.  My    only comment on that is that if the cultists were that close to    the edge, what the hell did she think their reaction would be to    an hours-long assault on the compound where holes were punched in    the walls and CS gas pumped in?  If I were a BD, I'd expect the    forces of the godless government to assault me at any time.  In    that light, whether they torched themselves or drank Jim Jones    Kool-Aid is irrelevant.  Also, look at how the siege was conducted:    Bright lights, loud rock music, cutting off communications and    other contact with the outside.  All measures designed to make the    BD's feel more and more isolated and threatened.  This might have    been a great strategy - if they were dealing with criminals.  As it    was, it looks to me like everything they did fed into Koresh's    paranoid delusions.     --   #include <std_disclaimer.h>\",\"     1. Get the friend to uninstall it.     2.

Just because it is hard for you  : to believe this doesn't mean that it isn't true.  Liars can be very pursuasive : just look at Koresh that you yourself cite.  This is whole basis of a great many here rejecting the Christian account of things. In the words of St. Madalyn Murrey-O'Hair, \\\"Face it folks, it's just silly ...\\\". Why is it okay to disbelieve because of your incredulity if you admit that it's a fallacy?\",\" I'll pose a question here that's got me thinking:  what distinguishes \\\"true\\\" religion from cults (I'm speaking generally here, not specifially about Christianity)?  Jerry Falwell was on Good Morning America on  Tuesday ostensibly to answer this question.  Basically, he said that true religion follows a message whereas a cult follows a person. But, then, Christianity is a cult because the message of Christianity IS the person of Jesus.  So what distinguishes, for example, the Branch Davidian \\\"cult\\\" from the Presbyterian \\\"church\\\"?  Doctrinal differences don't answer the question, IMHO, so don't use them as an answer.    -- Scott at Brandeis   \\\"But God demonstrates His     \\\"The Lord bless you, and keep you;   own love for us, in that      the Lord make His face shine on you,   while we were yet sinners,    and be gracious to you;   Christ died for us.\\\"        the Lord lift up His countenance on you,            and give you peace.\\\"   -- Romans 5:8 [NASB]  -- Numbers 6:24-26 [NASB]\",\" The documentary interviewed Koresh and current and ex-members.   The documentary disucussed Koresh's \\\"Christ\\\" status inside the cult,  cult brain-washing techniques, and unusual sex practices (the leader  gets any he wants, and tells others when they can or can't).  I will let  others decide if using religious authority to have sex with a minor is  technically child abuse or not.   All true.   Well, if a fire was deliberately set by members of the cult, then the  history and background of the cult is very relevant.  The history  and backgournd of the Jones cult was very important in understanding  what happened at Jonestown.  Not taking into account the history and background of Koresh's cult may  also help explain why the FBI and BATF so badly predicted the reponses  they would get from inside the compund nearly every step of the way in  this badly handled affair.   It is likely that there will be at least two investigations (JD and congress)  at this point.   Interesting and conflicting details are starting to come out.  I have  reverted back to wait mode to find out whether the fire was intentional  or accidental and how it started and why it spread so fast.   \",\" 740 Turbo in UK was good for 124mph.

Thanks!\",\" I'm still catching up from Spring Break, but bear with me...    Javy Lopez has proven, over 1400+ AB in the minor leagues, that he is ready to play in the majors. He is *not* being rushed. Players who are clearly too good for AA and play behind stiffs at the major league level are wasting their time, and may actually have a court case against major league management for keeping them, at AAA.   Unless Lopez is *me* defensively (I'm 5'7'', 165 and born to play second base :-)), he belongs in the major leagues.   Valentine isn't saying he should back up. He's saying he should be put in a position to *win* the job in the major leagues, which, IMHO, he would if given the opportunity. (Val, if I'm misinterpreting, please let me know.)    But the players who *are* ready are 1)the best and 2) the ones most likely to benefit from being in the majors. Javy Lopez is not a middle- of-the-road prospect. He's the real thing. NOW.   Again, the most important thing a player can do is hit. Lopez does that miles better than Olson or Berryhill. If his defense is good enough for Greenville, or Richmond, it's good enough for Atlanta. If he really was awful defensively, he would no longer be a catcher. See Sprague, Ed.   Oh, where to start... OK. First of all, solid != good. I want good players. Solid is one of those words used to describe nice white guys who really aren't very good at baseball. Think of it as \\\"TWG\\\" without the caps. It's a losing strategy to say, \\\"We have solid guys, we don't need to improve.\\\" You used it four times in that paragraph, BTW.  Same for experienced. I might add, though, that Greg Olson and Damon Berryhill aren't exactly Carter and Fisk. Olson has played three years, Berryhill five, although 90 and 91 were a wash. The only difference, IMHO, between Olson and Valle is the supporting cast.  \\\"Two big bats.\\\" Hrm. I like Justice, but I find Mr. Gant's trend disturbing. Call it one and a maybe. The Braves' platoon is OK, but neither player has *any* value outside of the platoon. Bream vs. LH and Hunter vs. RH are awful. I'll leave the thirdbase comment alone. Pendleton has wasted too much bandwidth already. If the CF platoon hits .300, I'll retrace Mr. Likhani's midnight run down Forbes, and I live in NY and LA. (Got that, Mike?)  And doesn't Cox call pitches, anyway?   Nope. They're baseball management, possible the most short-sighted  collection of people in the nation. Do you not believe this goes on, Mark? Do you think Frank Thomas needed those three months in AAA in 1990? Or Cal Eldred wasn't *really* better than Ricky Bones last year?

(They say)  (Does this have anything to do with the rally on the Capital steps yesterday  in support of the RKBA????)  Even the rally made the 5 pm news on 3 channels :-) \",\" That depends entirely upon the advertiser whose number you circled. Radio Electronics compiles all of the cards, then each advertiser gets a computer printout of the names and addresses of all of the readers who circled their number. Some magazines also provide the data on self-adhesive labels, and the really big magazines provide the data on computer disk.  The advertiser decides what to do with the data they get. You will notice that the Radio Electronics information card (commonly called a \\\"bingo card\\\" in the industry) includes lines for a company name and a business phone number. My guess would be that the big, national advertisers make a distinction between hobbiests and professionals as best they can. For example, if you include Motorola as your company and include a business phone (and a mail stop), Tektronics will probably send you a copy of their hard-bound catalog and have a sales engineer call you about a week later. If you leave it blank, odds are they will send you a slick brochure and direct you to a local retail outlet. Medium and small companies are more likely to send you th e whole catalog. And then some companies, like Digikey or Jameco, have nothing to mail out accept the catalog.  A couple of other interesting points about bingo cards: Free, industry magazines like EDN and such also log your card to their computer. They use the information at least three ways. They note that you really do read the magazine and are more likely to continue your subscription or push you, through repeated mailings, to re-subscribe. They also compile how many people requested which data for their marketing demographics. This way thay can tell a prospective advertiser that \\\"23% of readers requesting data were interested in capacitors.\\\" And finally, some magazines rent lists of readers who request certain information. For example, Tektronics can rent a list of everyone who requested information about test equipment OTHER THAN TEKTRONIC's, in the past 6 months.  The other point, in the data the advertiser receives, many magazines include how many items you circled on the card. If they want, the advertiser can attempt to cull out the \\\"literature collectors\\\" from the serious potential customers.  \\\"Can you say qualified sales leads? I thought you could.\\\"  What's the BEST way for a hobbiest to deal with bingo cards?    Never circle more than 8 number on the card. If you want more   than 8 items, use the second card and mail it a couple of   weeks later.    If you are really, really serious and you really, really want   the information, CALL THE ADVERTISER AND ASK! This will also   cut about 15 days off the the response time. Virtually   everyone takes a voice on the phone more seriously than data   on a computer printout.    To help insure you keep getting a trade magazine that you're   not really \\\"qualified\\\" for, send in a bingo card at least every   other month and circle two or three numbers.    Include a business name and phone number, even if it's your house.   Advertisers almost never call. \",\"   # I hope I gave you a fairly solid answer to this one: I simply don't agree # with the embodied version of a Satan who is a separate creation or a force.    # And there are quite physical descriptions of Heaven and Hell in the # Holy Qur'an, the Bible, etc.  There have been times in the spiritual # and intellectual evolution of the modern human when these physical # descriptions of Heaven, Hell, and Satan were taken quite literally # and that *worked* for the time.  As I mentioned in the Tradition # cited above, for example, it was sufficient in the absence of a theory # about germs and disease spread by worms to simply describe the \\\"evil\\\" # which was passed to a consumer of spoiled food as \\\"satanic.\\\"       Which begs the question: if Satan in this case is      metaphorical, how can you be certain Allah is not      the same way?  # The bottom line here, however, is that describing a spiritual plane # in human language is something like describing \\\"color\\\" to a person # who has been blind from birth.  You may want to read the book # FLATLAND (if you haven't already) or THE DRAGON'S EGG.  The first # is intended as a light hearted description of a mathematical con- # cept...  [some deleted for space saving]  # When language fails because it cannot be used to adequately describe # another dimension which cannot be experienced by the speakers, then # such conventions as metaphor, allegory, and the like come to be # necessary.  The \\\"unseen\\\" is described in terms which have reference` # and meaning for the reader/listener.  But, like all models, a compro- # mise must be made when speaking metaphorically: clarity and directness # of meaning, equivalence of perception, and the like are all # crippled.  But what else can you do?       This is why I asked the above.  How would you then      know God exists as a spirit or being rather than      just being metaphorical?  I mean, it's okay to say      \\\"well, Satan is just metaphorical,\\\" but then you      have to justify this belief AND justify that God is      not some metaphor for something else.       I say this because there are many, many instances of      Satan described as a being (such as the tormentor in       the Old Testament book of Job, or the temptor in the      New Testament Gospels).  In the same way, God too is      described as a being (or spirit.)  How am I to know      one is metaphorical and not the other.       Further, belief in God isn't a bar to evil.  Let's      consider the case of Satanists: even if Satan were      metaphorical, the Satanist would have to believe      in God to justify this belief.  Again, we have a       case where someone does believe in God, but by      religious standards, they are \\\"evil.\\\"  If Bobby      does see this, let him address this question also.

All advice was taken to heart, if not directly used.  My friend found out about the matter quite accidently.  After reading some of my mail, I quit from the mail reader & went about my business.  I must have trashed my mail improperly, because he got on the same terminal the next day & saw my old messages.  He thought they were responses to a post he placed in alt.atheism earlier that week, so he read some of them before realizing that they were for me.  I got a message from him the next day; he apologized for reading my mail & said that he did not want to appear to be a snoop.  He said that he would be willing to talk to me about his views & didn't mind doing so, especially with a friend.  So we did.  I neither changed his mind nor did he change mine, as that was not the point.  Now he knows where I'm coming from & now I know where he's coming from.  And all that I can do is pray for him, as I've always done.  I believe the reason that he & I \\\"click\\\" instead of \\\"bash\\\" heads is because I see Christianity as a tool for revolution, & not a tool for maintaining the status quo.  To be quite blunt, I have more of a reason to reject God than he does just by the fact that I am an African-American female.  Christianity & religion have been used as tools to separate my people from the true knowledge of our history & the wealth of our contributions to the world society.  The \\\"kitchen of heaven\\\" was all we had to look forward to during the slave days, & this mentality & second-class status still exists today.  I, too, have rejected an aspect of Christianity----that of the estabished church.  Too much hypocricy exists behind the walls of \\\"God's house\\\" beginning with the images of a white Jesus to that of the members:  praise God on Sunday & raise hell beginning Monday.

Thus no need to go to court.  A friend of mine did this and he got the money so it does work. \",\"I heard that Eli is selling the team to a group in Cinninati. This would help so that the O's could make some real free agent signings in the  offseason. Training Camp reports that everything is pretty positive right now. The backup catcher postion will be a showdown between Tackett and Parent although I would prefer Parent. #1 Draft Pick Jeff Hammonds may be coming up faster in the O's hierarchy of the minors faster than expected. Mike Flanagan is trying for another comeback. Big Ben is being defended by coaches saying that while the homers given up were an awful lot, most came in the beginning of the season and he really improved the second half. This may be Ben's year.   I feel that while this may not be Mussina's Cy Young year, he will be able to pitch the entire season without periods of fatigue like last year around August. I really hope Baines can provide the RF support the O's need. Orsulak was decent but I had hoped that Chito Martinez could learn defense better and play like he did in '91. The O's right now don't have many left-handed hitters. Anderson proving last year was no fluke and Cal's return to his averages would be big plusses in a drive for the pennant. The  rotation should be Sutcliffe, Mussina, McDonald, Rhodes, ?????. Olson is an interesting case. Will he strike out the side or load the bases and then get three pop outs? You never know. The way I see the AL East this year (with personal biases mixed in) Baltimore New York Toronto Milwaukee Cleveland Boston Detroit (The top 4 are the only true contenders in my mind. One of these 4 will definitely win the division unless it snows in Hell/Maryland :). I feel that this Baltimore's season to finally put everything together.) __________________________________________________________________________ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   \",\"  I agree that a fully-loaded SL2 would come close in price to a LOWER-END Ford Taurus.  A FULLY-LOADED Taurus, on the other hand, would still be substantially more expensive than even the most glitzy SL2.  A fully loaded SL2 would run somewhere around $17,000, while a fully loaded Taurus LX would be somewhere around the $22,000-$23,000 range.  A base Taurus (GL I believe) might start around $15,000.  Of course there is the Taurus SHO which can push $30,000 if you really try, but this is a totally different car than your mainstream Taurus sedan.  Your statement was not entirely faulty, just a little inaccurate.   Well, that's ok.  At least you're not bitching about dealer profits like some of the other netters are.  You seem to have rationally picked out the car that is best for you.

I'm hoping someone knows what this board is, or, even better, what the various switches and jumbers are used for.  Anyway, here's  description of the card:  It is a 16-bit card, although I noticed that none of the contacts in the 16-bit extension are connected to anything.  It has 4 NS16550AN chips in sockets, and 4 corresponding connecters labeled COM1 - COM4.  There is also an external female connector with 37 pins.  There are 8 banks of 8 switches, 2 banks of 4 switches, and 7 jumpers.  I believe that I have determined, by following traces, that SW5 and SW6 (12 switches in all) control the interrupt level for each of the COM ports.  SW5[1-4] are for IRQ3, SW5[5-8] are for IRQ4, and SW6[1-4] are for IRQ5.  The other switches are beyond my meager ability to follow.        The only identification printed on the board is \\\"MULTI SERIAL PORT BOARD\\\" across the bottom.  There is a box for serial number, but it is blank. Immediately below the words \\\"SERIAL NO\\\", but not in the box left for the S/N, are the numbers \\\"1990 2 8\\\".  Anyone have any clues?  Your help is greatly appreciated. \",\"Device........

He will have mercy on whom he will have mercy and compassion on whom he will have compassion (Ex 33:19).  However, if he enjoyed punishing people and sending them to hell, then why would he send Jesus to \\\"seek and save that which was lost\\\" (Luke 19:10)?  You asked for it.  2 Peter 2:4-ff talks about how those who are ungodly are punished. Matthew 25:31-46 is also very clear that those who do not righteous in God's eyes will be sent to hell for eternity. 2 Thessalonians 1:6-10 states that those who cause trouble for the disciples \\\"will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord\\\". 2 Thessalonians 2:9-12 talks about those who refuse to love the truth being condemned. Revelation 21:6-8 talks about the difference between those who overcomes and those who do not.  Those who do not, listed in verse 8, will be in the \\\"fiery lake of burning sulfur\\\". Revelation 14:9-12 gives the indication that those who follow the beast \\\"will be tormented with burning sulfur\\\" and there being \\\"no rest day or night\\\" for them because of it. Psalm 9:17:  \\\"The wicked return to the grave, all the nations that forget God.\\\"  I think those should be sufficient to prove the point.   Joe Fisher  [In the following I'm mostly playing \\\"devil's advocate\\\".  I'm not advocating either position.  My concern is that people understand that it's possible to see these passages in different ways.  It's possible to see eternal destruction as just that -- destruction.  Rev often uses the term \\\"second death\\\".  The most obvious understanding of that would seem to be final extinction.  The problem is that the NT speaks both of eternal punishment and of second death.  I.e. it uses terms that can be understood either way.  My concern here is not to convince you of one view or the other, but to help people understand that there's a wide enough variety of images that it's possible to understand them either way.  As Tom Albrecht commented, the primary point is to do our best to keep people out of the eternal fire, whatever the details.  (To make things more interesting, Luke 20:35 implies that the damned don't get resurrected at all.  Presumably they just stay dead. -- yes I'm aware that it's possible to  understand this passage in a non-literal way.)  2 Peter 2:4-ff is talking about angels, and talks about holding them in hell until the final judgement.  This isn't eternal punishement.  Matthew 25:31-46 talks about sending the cursed into eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.  The fact that the fire is eternal doesn't mean that people will last in its flames forever. Particularly interesting is the comment about the fire having been prepared for the devil and his angels.  Rev 20 and 21 talk about the eternal fire as well.  They say that the beast and the false prophet will be tormented forever in it.  When talking about people being thrown into it (20:13-14), it is referred to as \\\"the second death\\\". This sounds more like extinction than eternal torment.  Is is possible that the fire has different effects on supernatural entities such as the devil, and humans?  2 Thessalonians 1:6-10 similarly, what is \\\"everlasting destruction\\\"? This is not necessarily eternal torment.  This one can clearly be understood either way, but I think it's at least possible to think that everlasting is being used to contrast the kind of destruction that can occur in this life with the final destruction that occurs in eternity.  2 Thessalonians 2:8 again talks about destruction. Revelation 21:6-8: see comment above Revelation 14:9-12 is probably the best of the quotes.  Even there, it doesn't explicitly say that the people suffer forever.  It says that the smoke (and presumably the fire) is eternal, and that  there is no respite from it.  But it doesn't say that the people are tormented forever.  Psalm 9:17:  I don't see that it says anything relevant to this issue.\",\"Inguiry by address:er1@eridan.chuvashia.su \",\"  This is one of the differences between OT prophecy and NT prophecy.  In the NT, it is expected that when believers gather,   - people will prophesy   - the prophecy must be judged (1 Cor 14:29) There is nothing about killing someone who makes a mistake.   Scripture is scripture; there is no \\\"gift of scripture\\\".  And I don't know about you, but I know that _I_ have made mistakes while filled with the spirit.  If you don't give grace to allow people to make mistakes, they will never grow in the use of the spiritual gifts!  When we minister in my small group, I encourage people to speak out any impressions or images they think might be from the Lord.  Only by trying will they know whether they were right or wrong -- and in either case, they'll have a better handle on it the next time.  Didn't you fall when you were learning to ride a bicycle?  But you kept on trying, and you learned both from your failures and your successes. Spiritual gifts are no different -- you get better with experience.   The canon of Scripture is complete.  Does this mean that God no longer speaks?  I have heard his voice -- not audibly (though some have), but clearly nonetheless.  Is what I heard equivalent to Scripture?  No.  I have never heard contemporary prophets claim that what they receive from the Lord is on the same level as Scripture; on the contrary, those who are mature obey the Scriptures by submitting their prophecies to fellow believers for judgement.  And the most reliable yardstick for judging prophecies is, certainly, the Scriptures themselves.  The canon is closed -- but God is not silent!   Does it matter what it is called?  The question is not how to label it, but how to receive it.  Words of knowledge, incidentally, are similar to prophecy (and sometimes the two overlap), but generally it is supernatural knowledge of some fact that could not be known otherwise.\",\"        The joystick reads in anolog values through a digital port.

Teel:   Well, the two nifty letters giving concrete proof that the  Income Tax is voluntary and giving specific procedures for  stopping withholding, et cetera have been out there for a  while now.  Humbug.  Those letters don't provide \\\"concrete proof\\\" of anything at all in the absence of any case law that demonstrates the method will actu- ally work for ordinary people in everyday situations.  Specifically, show us some case law in which the courts have ruled that income tax is illegal and/or that ordinary working types do not have to pay income tax (and that they can legally avoid paying income tax with- out declaring themselves to be churches or some such silliness).  This issue is sufficiently important that I think we have a right to expect something squarely on point from the US Supreme Court (in the case of federal tax) or a state's supreme court (for a state's income tax).  Unless you can do that, I for one am unwilling to call your material \\\"concrete proof\\\".   There has been no refutation to date.  Have the nay-sayers  finally given up as defeated?  Sure would like to hear their  reasons for disbelief at this point.  Refutation??  Refutation of what?  You haven't made a case yet.  You've posted plenty of claims, but you haven't given us any valid reason to believe that any court in the US will agree with you.  Your claims seem on the surface to deviate so radically from the legal mainstream that I feel the burden of proof is still on =you= to show that your arguments have any merit whatsoever.  And the cases you've cited involve such strange situations that I see no reason to assume that the rulings are applicable to anyone else, or that they will ultimately stand on appeal to the Supreme Court.  Why can't you just cite us a case in which Joe Schmoe, a regular employee earning regular wages from a regular company, refuses to pay his income tax, gets hauled into court, is convicted of wilful tax eva- sion, and then has his conviction overturned by the US Supreme Court with a landmark 7-2 majority ruling that income tax is indeed totally voluntary?  What, you say?  No such case exists?  Hmmm, I wonder why not; why haven't you?   Shall I conclude that the point has been received and the  opposition has forfeited the field?  With all due respect, you can conclude anything you want.  I just hope, for your own sake, that you don't conclude that anyone in a position of authority in the United States or any legitimate or illegitimate polit- ical subdivision thereof is going to agree with your conclusions.  For that matter, I confess I'm thoroughly confused as to =why= you would be looking for court rulings in your favor anyway -- since I thought you told us earlier that every court in the US has been in cahoots with big banking interests since the 1938 \\\"admiralty jurisdiction\\\" coverup thing. Do you honestly expect us to believe that they'd go to all the trouble to subvert the system, and yet would still promptly slink back into their burrows in the face of anyone who knew enough to invoke the right combination of magic spells and mystic mumbo-jumbo?  Not only that, but why do you even =care= what the US courts say anyway? Didn't you tell us a while back that you've disavowed all attempts by US officials to classify you as a \\\"14th Amendment federal citizen\\\"?  When the FBI comes to haul you away for tax evasion, why don't you just tell them they're out of their jurisdiction and should go back to Washington, D.C., where they belong?  Or maybe we should all just go back to mediaeval common law, which you suggested would be better than all these statutes, codes, and the like. If you want to renounce society's legal framework, fine; we can just declare you an outlaw, OK?, and anyone who sees you driving on the roads with no license plate on your car and no driver's license in your wallet can just take you like a game animal and stew you for their supper (with plenty of veggies and a pinch of salt, but WITHOUT PREJUDICE UCC 1-207).  Sorry, everyone, it's getting late, and I'm sick and tired of all this garbage.  If I know what's good for me, I'll just clam up and stop try- ing to refute this nonsense, and if anyone falls for it and winds up in jail for tax evasion or what-not, it'll be on their own head.  Needless to say, none of the above represents the opinions of my current employer -- who, in any case, is a Canadian and doesn't really need to care too much about US tax law.

Our constitution was built by men who had to risk their lives to ensure freedom in our country. They designed the system to make it difficult for tyranny to arise. For instance, one of the reasons the fourth amendment was put there was to make it harder for the government to try to make smuggling a crime. Think I jest? John Hancock made all his money smuggling rum, which is, after all, a drug.  Think about it.

Coups have happened in countries that have had stable democracies for over a hundred years. Governments throughout history have fallen. No government has lasted for more than a few hundred years. Often, they are replaced by dictatorships. Do you really believe so intensely that it could never ever ever happen here that you are willing to bet your own life and the lives of your children and other loved ones on it?  If we construct the tools with which tyranny could be enforced, we make it orders of magnitude more likely that it could happen, because if it happened with the tools already in place it could actually stick.   Naive fools such as our leadership believe they can protect us where hundreds that have gone before have failed. Thriving democracies led by men far more skillfull than Bill Clinton have fallen to dictatorship. Rome had a thriving republic run by exquisitely skilled men before they became a tyranny.  I, for one, am unwilling to trust that it could never happen here. Only hubris would allow us to believe we are immune to what has happened elsewhere.  -- Perry Metzger  pmetzger@shearson.com\",\" What can you expect from a buffoon who said that the Pens should have drafted Kirk Muller instead of Mario Lemieux?

THOSE INTREPID ISRAELI SOLDIERS       Israeli soldiers have sexually taunted Arab women in the occupied Gaza Strip   during the three-week-long closure that has sealed Palestinians off from the   Jewish state, Palestinian sources said on Sunday.    The incidents occurred in the town of Khan Younis and involved soldiers of  the Golani Brigade who have been at the centre of house-to-house raids for  Palestinian activists during the closure, which was imposed on the strip and  occupied West Bank.    Five days ago girls at the Al-Khansaa secondary said a group of naked  soldiers taunted them, yelling: ``Come and kiss me.'' When the girls fled,   the soldiers threw empty bottles at them.        On Saturday, a group of soldiers opened their shirts and pulled down their  pants when they saw girls from Al-Khansaa walking home from school. Parents   are considering keeping their daughters home from the all-girls school.        The same day, soldiers harassed two passing schoolgirls after a youth  escaped from them at a boys' secondary school. Deputy Principal Srur   Abu-Jamea said they shouted abusive language at the girls, backed them   against a wall, and put their arms around them.    When teacher Hamdan Abu-Hajras intervened the soldiers kicked him and beat  him with the butts of their rifles.    On Tuesday, troops stopped a car driven by Abdel Azzim Qdieh, a practising  Moslem, and demanded he kiss his female passenger. Qdieh refused, the   soldiers hit him and the 18-year-old passenger kissed him to stop the   beating.    On Friday, soldiers entered the home of Zamno Abu-Ealyan, 60, blindfolded  him and his wife, put a music tape on a recorder and demanded they dance. As  the elderly couple danced, the soldiers slipped away. The coupled continued  dancing until their grandson came in and asked what was happening.        The army said it was checking the reports.                   ....................           ISRAELI TROOPS BAR CHRISTIANS FROM JERUSALEM    Israeli troops prevented Christian Arabs from entering Jerusalem on Thursday   to celebrate the traditional mass of the Last Supper.        Two Arab priests from the Greek Orthodox church led some 30 worshippers in  prayer at a checkpoint separating the occupied West Bank from Jerusalem after  soldiers told them only people with army-issued permits could enter.        ``Right now, our brothers are celebrating mass in the Church of the Holy  Sepulchre and we were hoping to be able to join them in prayer,'' said Father  George Makhlouf of the Ramallah Parish.        Israel sealed off the occupied lands two weeks ago after a spate of  Palestinian attacks against Jews. The closure cut off Arabs in the West Bank  and Gaza Strip from Jerusalem, their economic, spiritual and cultural centre.       Father Nicola Akel said Christians did not want to suffer the humiliation  of requesting permits to reach holy sites.        Makhlouf said the closure was discriminatory, allowing Jews free movement  to take part in recent Passover celebrations while restricting Christian  celebrations.        ``Yesterday, we saw the Jews celebrate Passover without any interruption.  But we cannot reach our holiest sites,'' he said.        An Israeli officer interrupted Makhlouf's speech, demanding to see his  identity card before ordering the crowd to leave.                      ...................

It sounds like you might want to send an exposure using XSendEvent and specifying a region. If you know the region you need to send the exposure, generally you have the bounding rectangle of the objects, you can use XCreateRegion to create a region, XUnionRectWithRegion to add the new object polygons to the region, and then either use the region to clip your GC for the redraw or use XRectInRegion to test which of your other objects need to be redrawn.

TIMUCIN  \",\"  One interpretation I've heard of this verse is that it refers to the sin  of physically abusing one's wife.  The husband is usually physically  stronger than his wife but is not permitted to use this to dominate her.   He must honor her as his sister in Christ.  This would therefore be an  example of a specific sin that blocks prayer.  This verse also makes me think of the kind of husband who decides what  is God's will for his family without consulting his wife.  God reveals  His will to both the husband and the wife.  There needs to be some  degree of mutuality in decision making.  Even those whose understanding  of the Bible leads to a belief in an authoritarian headship of the  husband need to incorporate this in order to have a functional family.   One way to look at it is that God speaks to the wife through the husband  and to the husband through the wife. \",\"Anyone know of a phillies mailing list out there? .... they don't get much coverage up here in Grand Rapids, MI *sob*  --\",\"  It is MUCH easier, faster, and probably even more secure to use Norton Utilties 6.0 (I'm talking IBM PC here) and to tell WipeInfo to (a) clean the free disk space and (b) clean the slack space at the end of the files.

I am running Linux as my main OS, with a small DOS partition left for my flatmates' games.  My current setup is a 386SX-25 (AMD) with 387SX-25 (ITT - I think) and 9 Mbytes of 70ns SIMMS, and (120+100)Mbyte IDE.  Basically I have two choices  1) Get a 386DX-40 + 387DX-40  or 2) Get some sort of 486.  Unfortunately I live in the UK where computer prices are far too high. The first option works out at about \\\\pounds 200. 486 m/boards start at this price for a SX-25.  I have a couple of questions.  1) How much of an improvement in speed should I notice if I get a 386DX+copro. Remember I'm using a 32 bit OS, and alot of Floating Point operations.  2) How much faster would a 486DX-33 be than the 386DX-40+copro ?  Should I get an upgradeable m/board with a 386DX-40 and wait for AMD/Pentium price pressure to reduce the costs of the 486 ?   Any experiences will be most helpful ...    Kenny.  PS. Example prices:   386DX-40+copro M/board ~$270  486DX33 M/board  ~$580  ----------------------------------------------------------- Kenneth MacDonald  E-mail kenny@castle.ed.ac.uk Dept. of Geology & Geophysics University of Edinburgh  Scotland\",\"Does anyone have any information/advice on large color monitors (17\\\"-21\\\") to use with a 486 system running X server software?

It's small enough that I will attach it.  I have also measured some real programs with and without the 64 KB cache.  The speedup varies a lot from app to app, ranging from 0% to 40%.  I think an average of 20%-25% is about right.  The subjective difference is not great, but is sometimes noticable.  A simple cache card certainly does not transform a IIsi into something enormously better.  I do not have an FPU.  The conventional wisdom says that cache cards from all of the makers offer about the same speedup and that there is not much difference between 32K and 64K caches.  I bought mine from Third Wave for well under $150.  I have had absolutely no problems at all with it.  If you get *complete* speedometer runs for a 32K cache, I'd like to see them.

Whatthey do not tell you is that if you get mace directly   on the linings of the lungs (such as a direct snort to   the face) above certain quantities, it reacts similarly   to a mustard gas inhalation.     I know:  my father and grandfather were exposed    to poison gas in WWI and WWII; Dad went through    the side effects of any WEAPON, including those    \\\"non-toxic\\\" aerosols.    WHat the label ACTUALLY means is ::     usually, it wont kill you    it may give you permanent CSS asthsma    but that's better than blowing a hole in your     head ...    ALL aerosols are flammable IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH OXYGEN   AND HIT IT WITH THE RIGHT IGNITER.  SOme of the most   non-flammable substances known will BOOM or SEARFLAME   if you hit it with the right combo.     Let's take one:  a trash can fire.  Makes black smoke;   already burned right?  Can't go boom, right?  Wrong.    Suck that smoke (made up of paper that has carbonized,   or burned about 35% of the fuel in it) into an air   conditioning return, mix with about 5:1 air, and light   a match.  200 feet of conduit is about the same, when   filled with that smoke mixture, as oh, say 200 pounds TNT     THAT is why the fire codes say NO OPEN CEILING    TILES IN BUILDINGS.  Because 3-5 stories of    a building have blown OUT by \\\"nonflammable _smoke_\\\"   So:   Take a little \\\"nonflammable aerosol\\\"   Mix with gasoline or kerosene fumes     NO electricity, remeber?  A bit of heating    on the WACO plains?  Boil water to drink    since the water was cut off?    liberally mix and allow to settle for 1-4 hours    Fumes vent down into the bus underground, and the Davidians   move the children UPSTAIRS to a saferoom (they had one,   armor plated, remember?) to BREATH, because kids get sick   and die from tear gas.    and along comes a tracer, a spark, what have you:     everyone burns to death.

did I get sucked into this?   Assuming you're serious, I guess you'd be surprised to hear that us GUYS don't think so. I would guess that a tiny fraction of 1% of the folks reading your post agree with it. I kind of doubt that even you agree with it.  I'm not going to go through your points one at a time, because,  after all, not many of them have anything at all to do with baseball.  I'm only replying to this because you brought up Pam Postema, the AAA umpire who sued (is suing?) baseball on the grounds of sex discrimination because she wasn't promoted to the majors.   I've never seen her ump a game. I have no first hand experience with her ability as an umpire.  But I have seen her on talk shows. And her point seems to be that she can call balls and strikes as well as any of the umpires and she knows the rulebook better than most. It seems to me that she is missing the point and if that's how she sees the role of umpires in the game, well I wouldn't promote her either.  The umpires primary role has nothing to do with calling baserunners safe or out; hell, Joe Lundy could do that. Their primary function is to maintain order in the game, keep the game moving, and keep the players from trying to kill each other.   Umpires have to be extremely tough people. That disqualifies most of us, both men and women. And if Ms. Postema thinks that she deserves to be a major league umpire because of her command of the rulebook, then I think that disqualifies her as well. Umpires need to command the game; command of the rulebook is secondary.   \",\": >After agreeing to terms I signed the contract and drove home in my new : >car.

However, if you agree some terms, and then, when about to sign, the dealer slips you a contract with different terms, and leads you to believe that it embodies the terms you verbally agreed to, that is fraud.  There is no 3 day limit on restitution for fraud.  You may have to sue (and win) to get out of this.  You will almost certainly have to threaten to sue. -- \",\"  I was hoping for something like \\\"The chassis exhibits X  degrees of flex when subjected to forces of more than Y units. Forces of more than Y units begin to manifest at Z miles per hour.\\\"   Not \\\"Well, gee, it wasn't designed to go fast because, uhh, well, gee, it wasn't designed to go fast.  It's not a Porsche, you know\\\".    Well, as compared to the normal Taurus, the SHO comes with more supportive seats,better brakes,a stiffer suspension, different tires, and a body design that takes advantage of aero effects to keep the car on the ground (or at least I think that's what all that boy-racer plastic is for).  You're kidding yourself if you think any car on the road has a passenger compartment made to withstand 130 MPH impacts.      Oh, right.  Only 120,000 dollar cars should be driven fast. They drive goddamn Rabbits at 120 MPH in Europe, pal, and I reckon a Taurus is at least as capable as a Rabbit.    Of course not.  \\\"Speeding-is-bad.  Speeding-is-illegal.  I-will-not-speed.

It's interesting that lots of the roads out west had *NO* speed limits until 1975.  \",\" This was the Pathe you are thinking of, although there were other imitators.

Some other owners on the ford-probe@world.std.com mailing list have commented  about this problem, but I haven't seen it happen on my 3 month old  '93 Probe GT.  I think this may be something that Ford has corrected since  the initial batch of cars.  Also, someone said that Ford has issued a  service bulletin to inform dealers about how to correct this problem, so you  may be able to get your dealer to fix it.   Haven't seen any of these problems, nor have I seen these mentioned on the mailing list, so these might just be having bad luck with these.   Definitely!   No problems like these either.  I haven't been able to find any obvious  places where they screwed up.   Hmmm!  I got two keys with my car.  Something tells me you got stiffed by your dealer on this.  (Actually, if you count the \\\"credit card\\\" key that  came in the owner's binder, I got 3 keys, but since the credit card key doesn't have any teeth cut in it yet, I guess I won't count it. :-))   The latter is probably because of the air bag.  It's pretty much takes up all the space where you'd expect to find the horn.  Speaking of the horn, I was surprised to find that the Probe comes with one of those nice 'merican sounding horns instead of the Japanese sounding kind. The previous Probes had Japanese horns.   Yeah, not very badly, but enough to be annoying sometimes.   I agree strongly with all of the above, especially about the engine.  The interior is very, very nice too.  Very pleasing to the eye, and ergonomically sound.  ...  Yes, this car's stiff suspension isn't for everyone.  I personally like it, but if you find it a little harsh but otherwise like the car, I'd strongly suggest looking into the MX-6.   The problem with the back seat is that there's no leg room.  Plenty of  head room, though.  Shorter people fit back there without any complaints, so long as the seat they are sitting behind is pulled forward a bit to  give them a place to put their feet.   The power moonroof can greatly improve the ventilation throughout the car. :-) I really enjoy the moonroof, by the way, but then I've always been a sucker for open air driving.  No leakage problems or anything like that...yet!   I haven't heard about this one.  I know that some of the very early Probes ('89 and maybe '90) had problems with prematurely rusting mufflers (which Ford will replace at no charge), but I haven't heard about anything like this concerning the '93 Probes.  I haven't had any real trouble with this car outside of a CV joint boot that was leaking, but the dealer took care of that promptly, and even gave me a free rental car for the day and a half that I was without my car.  I was quite happy with the way they handled...especially considering that I was expecting the worst from them!  From what I've heard, it sounds like Ford/Mazda had some QC problems with  the Probe (and probably MX-6) when they first went into production, but  I think these problems have mostly been corrected at this point.  That's almost always to be expected with a completely new car like this, though.  Hope this helps,  -chuck-\",\"I have one original SAM (Symantec AntiVirus for Macintosh) V3.0 for sale.

And if, as *you* say, it has : a purpose as a means to limit population growth then it is, by your own  : arguement, natural.  Consider the context, I'm talking about an evolutionary function. One of the most basic requirements of evolution is that members of a species procreate, those who don't have no purpose in that context.  :  : |> Another point is that if the offspring of each generation is to : |> survive, the participation of both parents is necessary - a family must : |> exist, since homosexuals do not reproduce, they cannot constitute a : |> family.

Also the parent from single : parent families should put the babies out in the cold now, cos they must, : by your arguement, die.  By your argument, homosexuality is genetically determined. As to your second point, you prove again that you have no idea what context means. I am talking about evolution, the preservation of the species, the fundamental premise of the whole process. :  : |> But it gets worse. Since the overwhelming majority of people actually : |> -prefer- a heterosexual relationship, homosexuality is a social : |> abberation as well.

These days sex is less to do with procreation (admittedly : without it there would be no-one) but more to do with pleasure.  In pre-pill : and pre-condom days, if you had sex there was the chance of producing children. : These days is just ain't true!  People can decide whether or not to have  : children and when.  Soon they will be able to choose it's sex &c (but that's  : another arguement...) so it's more of a \\\"lifestyle\\\" decision.  Again by : your arguement, since homosexuals can not (or choose not) to reproduce they must : be akin to people who decide to have sex but not children.  Both are  : as \\\"unnatural\\\" as each other.  Yet another non-sequitur. Sex is an evolutionary function that exists for procreation, that it is also recreation is incidental. That homosexuals don't procreate means that sex is -only- recreation and nothing more; they serve no -evolutionary- purpose.  :  : |> Since homosexuals have come out the closet and have convinced some : |> policy makers that they have civil rights, they are now claiming that : |> their sexuality is a preference, a life-style, an orientation, a : |> choice that should be protected by law.

Here's pretty obvious dodge, do you really think you've said anything or do you just feel obligated to respond to every statement? I am not telling anyone anything, I am demonstrating that there are arguments against the practice of homosexuality (providing it's a merely an alternate lifestlye) that are not homophobic, that one can reasonably call it perverse in a context even a atheist can understand. I realize of course that this comes dangerously close to establishing  a value, and that atheists are compelled to object on that basis, but if you are to be consistent, you have no case in this regard. :  : |> To characterize any opposition to homosexuality as homophobic is to : |> ignore some very compelling arguments against the legitimization of : |> the homosexual \\\"life-style\\\".

Neil Smith                     LETTER TO A LIBERAL COLLEAGUE  [AUTHOR'S NOTE:  \\\"Adrian\\\" -- name changed to protect the guilty --  and the author are science fiction novelists who once worked with  the same editor at a famous New York publishing house.]  Dear Adrian:    I'm way behind schedule on my current book again, so this reply to  your note -- criticizing the recent magazine interview I gave and  generally attacking gun ownership -- will necessarily consist  mostly of assertions you're free to believe (or not) I can back  with evidence and logic I've neither time nor energy to present  now.  I've written fully on this topic before and will again in the  future.  When I do, I'll make sure you get copies.    There are many arguments I might make, from the futility and danger  of delegating self-defense to the police (see Don Kates in the Jan.  10, 1985 WALL STREET JOURNAL) to the real effect of prohibition,  shifting consumers from newly-outlawed handguns or semiautomatic  rifles to items like sawed-off shotguns or homemade bombs, but I'll  limit myself here to commenting on the newspaper clipping you sent  with your note.    First, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Second, publication of some latter-day \\\"scientific study\\\" doesn't  alter the fact that the gun prohibitionists I discussed in my  interview -- annoying you so much in the process -- were lying.    Third, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Fourth, as often happens with these things, the \\\"study\\\" doesn't  support the gun prohibitionists' original numerical contentions  anyway, but simply adds a new layer of spurious claims to an older  body of lies, omissions, and distortions.    Fifth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Sixth, the fact that gun prohibitionists have been caught lying on  countless occasions (Carl Bakal, author of NO RIGHT TO KEEP AND  BEAR ARMS, even confessed to it publicly) makes the value of this  present \\\"study\\\" dubious, to say the least.    Seventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is  a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil,  and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic  process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Eighth, given your own lifelong service as a federal bureaucrat  (not to mention the cynical sophistication of your fiction), you  should be better aware than most people how \\\"progress\\\" -- in  designing \\\"studies\\\" to prove whatever you want -- outstrips our  ability to collect meaningful data.  A case in point we might agree  on is the fact that it took another kind of prohibitionist 20 or 30  years to create \\\"studies\\\" \\\"proving\\\" that pornography causes crime.   More naive (and probably more honest) efforts in the 50s and 60s  clearly indicate the contrary.    Ninth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Tenth, another reason to doubt all such \\\"studies\\\" is that human  behavior (as the Austrian School of economics demonstrates) is far too complex and unpredictable to be meaningfully quantified.  The  attempt to do so -- and then create public policy based on the  resulting pseudo-information -- is wrecking our civilization.    Eleventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is  a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil,  and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic  process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Twelfth, the \\\"study\\\" is also worthless because it incorporates  figures for suicide, which is not necessarily a tragedy but  basically another individual right, sometimes with ancillary social  benefits.  If anything, perhaps suicide INTERVENTION should be a  criminal offense.    Thirteenth and finally, the National Rifle Association officials  quoted in the article, whatever their shortcomings (and they are  many), are correct in this instance:  the \\\"study\\\" is meaningless  because the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    And because of that, Adrian, even if the \\\"study\\\" were valid, it  wouldn't deter me from a lifelong personal objective of seeing that  anyone can own any weapon he or she prefers and carry it however,  whenever, and wherever he or she desires without asking anybody's  permission. In this I'm ably assisted by gun prohibitionists  themselves, whose yawping invariably moves previously unarmed  people to go out and buy their first gun \\\"while they still can\\\".   Before the '68 Gun Control Act, most of the \\\"shooting fraternity\\\"  viewed handguns (incorrectly, as it turned out) as inaccurate,  ineffective toys.  There probably weren't six million of them in  the whole country.  Now, thanks to Kennedy, Metzenbaum, the Bradys,  and their ilk -- AMERICA'S GREATEST SPORTING GOODS SALES TEAM -- we  probably manufacture at least that many every year.  The fascinating datum is that Handgun Control, et al. are perfectly  aware of this -- so I guess you'll have to ask them yourself what  their real motives are.    Look:  gun-making isn't an arcane or difficult art (and by the way,  it's easier to make a fully automatic weapon than a semiautomatic;  the fact that I can still obtain my own weapon of preference, the  self-loading pistol, is the only thing which keeps me from pursuing  this further).  Even if it were difficult, there are already a  quarter billion firearms in America, with an estimated \\\"half life\\\"  of 1000 years -- possibly more for stainless steel.  Guns are gonna  be around a long time, Adrian, whether you like it or not.  As for me, to paraphrase Elmer Keith, regardless of what the law  provides or any court decides, I'm always going to be armed.  And I  will always work to see that others are, as well.  The bad news is  that there are thousands more -- perhaps even hundreds of thousands  -- where I come from.  We can't be stopped by passing laws, we can  only be forced to arm ourselves and others secretly and -- given  both the practical and alleged differences between full automatics  and semiautomatics -- perhaps more efficiently.    So what's the point?    L.

Neither twm or mwm seem to create standard colormaps.  Of course, one can use xstdcmap to create standard colormaps.   However, xstdcmap doesn't seem to try very hard to avoid  conflicts with the default colormap.  When I use standard  colormaps created by xstdcmap, the rest of my display goes black.   So it seems as if use of standard colormaps causes the very  problem standard colormaps are intended to avoid.  Perhaps  if every application used standard colormaps, things would  be wonderful.  But not many applications seem to use  standard colormaps.  Finally, the operation of the functions XmuGetColormapAllocation,  XmuStandardColormap, and XmuCreateColormap seem inconsistent  with the section 14.3 of the X11R5 XLIB documentation.      According to the section 14.3 of the X11R5 XLIB documentation (p. 436):      For GrayScale colormaps, only the colormap, red_max, red_mult, and      base_pixel members are defined.  The other members are ignored.       To compute a GrayScale pixel value, use the following expression:              (gray * red_mult + base_pixel) &0xFFFFFFFF      XmuGetColormapAllocation, defined in mit/lib/Xmu/CmapAlloc.c, is      used by XmuLookupStandardColormap, defined in mit/lib/Xmu/LookupCmap.c     to select red_max, green_max, and blue_max values for the      call to XmuStandardColormap.  When the RGB_GRAY_MAP property is      specified, XmuGetColormapAllocation sets red_max to 30% of the      total number of cells in the gray scale, sets green_max to 59%      of the total number, and sets blue_max ot 11% of the total number.     Referring to section 14.3, one would expect XmuGetColormapAllocation      to set red_max to the total number of cells in the gray scale.      When the RGB_GRAY_MAP property is specified, XmuStandardColormap,      defined in mit/lib/Xmu/StdCmap.c, sets red_mult, green_mult,      and blue_mult all equal to 1.  Referring to section 14.3,      one would expect green_mult and blue_mult to be ignored.\",\": What happened in Waco is not the fault of the BATF.

The signal is only to be sent over a few hundred  meters. It seems to me that the frequency intended for this use is about 150MHz and about 440MHz. To make the transmitters as light as possible I suppose it will be best  the to send the signals in an analog form.

DO ANYBODY KNOW IF THERE IS EXISTING SUCH RECEIVER  SYSTEM ON THE MARKET?\",\"  I hate to follow up to my own posting, but I should perhaps clarify some things so I won't get flamed.  First of all, when I'm talking about ``factoring the modulus'' or a ``breakthrough in factoring'', what I really mean is a breakthrough in the cryptanalysis of RSA.  I know that factoring and breaking RSA are not proven to be equivalent; it's just so damn convenient not to repeat this every time.  I also have to admit that I don't really know if the ``non-group'' property of a cipher is essential only for key chaining.  I have thought about it a little while, but I can't find a way that a cryptanalyst could exploit a group structure.  That, of course, means nothing at all.  Then I wrote,   What I meant was that as long as the only advantage of the cryptanalyst is a faster computer, then we will probably have RSA for a long time to come, because even if 1024-bit moduli somehow could be broken with fast computers (not with a new algorithm), then people would simply use longer moduli.  Both users and cryptanalysts benefit from better technology in the same way.  Hope this keeps the flames away...

The team which was later to prosecute him on criminal charges had to sequester itself from all reports of ON's immunized testimony. ON's lawyer brought up the probability that at least someone on the team had heard about the Senate testimony, and it was a strong factor against the prosecution, which is one of the reasons this ON is still walking around free today.\",\" Yes, you could.

EDT              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As you know, the President is soon  to be on his way, on Amtrack to Camden Yards.  He'll be throwing out  the first pitch.              Q   It's MARC, the Maryland Area Transit, it's not  Amtrack.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, it's not Amtrack?  Well, he's  going from Union Station, you're right.  Excuse me.              Q   George, what exactly are you prepared to do to  break the logjam with  ??? Senate?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, there are  discussions between Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole this morning,  and I think that the President is going to continue to make the point  that he believes that our investment package, our jobs package needs  to be passed as quickly as possible.  We need this investment for  summer jobs, for immunization, for highway construction, for the  important programs that will put people back to work right away this  summer.  And the President continues to believe his program should be  passed.              Q   Will he compromise, that's the question?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, the discussions  are going on this morning in the Senate betwen Senator Mitchell and  Senator Dole, let's see what they come up with.  But the President  believes his jobs program should go forward.              Q   George, would the President be willing to accept $8  billion for one year, which apparently appears to be the compromise  being offered by --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I don't know what is being  offered by either side.  The Senate discussions are going on right  now, let's see what happens today.              Q   Would he go that far -- no matter what the  Republicans have offered so far, would he go that far, $8 billion per  year?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that his  program should be passed at this time.  Clearly, we're going to be  willing to listen to what the Senators might or might not be able to  come up with, but I'm not going to get into figures right now.  Let's  see what happens.              Q   It's reasonable to assume, isn't it, from what has  happened so far that a compromise is going to be necessary in order  to get a vote?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the Republicans seem more  intrested in stopping progress on the President's jobs bill, than in  doing something to create --  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the  Republicans seem more interested in stopping progress on the  President's jobs bill than in doing something to create real action,  real jobs this summer for the American people.  I think there's no  question about that.  There's been some frustration of legislative  activity over the last few days.              Q   So, you'll need to compromise to get your package  through?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We'll see what happens with the  conversations between Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole this morning.              Q      prepared to compromise --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President's prepared to listen  to what Senator Mitchell has to say this morning after his meeting  with Senator Dole.               Q   Does he feel that he has been defeated in his --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not in the least.  In fact, he's  been very successful so far in the beginning of his term.              Q   How?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He passed his budget in record  time, in six weeks, and it's a budget which reduces the deficit by  $500 billion over five years.  And it's a budget which provides for  important investments in our future.  Right now we've also had strong  passage of his jobs program through the House.  Simply because a  minority of Republicans in the Senate choose to perpetuate gridlock  and hold up action on the President's jobs program is not a sign that  he is not succeeding overall.              Q   He can't beat this, can he?              Q   The fact is they can do that?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the Republicans can stop  action.  There's no question about that.              Q   What are you going to do about it?              Q   George, what do you know about these alleged notes  taken by Boris Yeltsin during one of the meetings in which it appears  that the President told Boris Yeltsin not to trust the Japanese; that  when they say yes they mean no?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's a complete  misreading of what happened at the meeting.  The context of the  conversation was that President Clinton was actually reassuring  President Yeltsin at the time about his conversations with Prime  Minister Miyazawa over the Kuril Islands and the Prime Minister's  belief that Japan would play a constructive role in the G-7 process.   I mean this was a casual comment about Japanese courtesy and  etiquette but overall it was in the context of a conversation where  he was reassuring President Yeltsin that he believed the Japanese  were serious about their commitment to the G-7 process.              Q    Are you saying that the President said that when  the Japanese say yes they mean no?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's not -- I don't know the  exact words and there was a much longer discussion about he did say  something along the lines that he believes that on this issue Prime  Minister Miyazawa intends to really go forward with the G-7 process.              Q   Have there been any attempts to explain this to the  Japanese because apparently the Japanese press has picked this up and  there appears to be --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I've seen the reports in the  Japanese press and it actually does put the situation in context.  It  does talk about the Japanese -- understanding the Japanese points of  view.  I don't think it's going to be a problem.  I believe that  there may have been some diplomatic context just to clear things up  but I'm not positive.              Q   George, was the specific comment that was made  specific to the Kuril Island situation or was it a general  observation on Japanese etiquette?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The discussion was about --              Q   The specific comment is what I'm asking about that  has alleged to have been translated from the Russian notes, \\\"when the  Japanese say yes they mean no.\\\"              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, it was a combination.  I mean  I don't think that's the whole sentence.  I think that the specific  comment was a broad, general observation followed up by a specific  finish to the sentence where he said in this case he believes that  Prime Minister Miyazawa means to keep the commitment.              Q   Was he saying it facetiously first?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it was just a casual  observation.              Q   And then you say diplomatic contacts were made to  clear it up.  Has the President sent a message?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, I don't think the President  spoke; I believe that Secretary Christopher has made some calls but  I'm not sure exactly how many.              Q   Well, this obviously is a bigger deal than you're  making it out to be if Christopher has had to make some calls.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, no.  It was just that we got  the reports in Vancouver and the Secretary wanted to make sure that  it was understood and make sure there was absolutely no        MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- reports in Vancouver, and the  Secretary wanted to make sure that it was understood, and make sure  there is absolutely no misunderstanding, and I don't believe there is  on.              Q   What is our position about the Japanese?  That they  may have to say one thing, but actualy mean another?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  The position on the Japanese  is as the President stated to President Yeltsin throughout the two  days.  He said that he had had a good conversation with Prime  Minister Miazawa prior to the Summit.  He reiterated the U.S.  position, the long-standing support for the Japanese position on the  Kuril Islands, but also reiterated Prime Minister Miazawa's  commitment to move forward on the G-7 process and to play a  constructive role.  And I think President Yeltsin was very glad to  hear that.              Q   After listening to Secretary Christopher on Iraq  for the last few days, I'm a little confused.  What is the U.S.  policy?  Do you want to see Saddam Hussein overturned?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's the same policy that Secretary  Christopher has reiterated, and all of the U.S officials have  reiterated.  We expect full and complete and unequivocal compliance  with all U.N. resolutions.  Right now we do not have that compliance.              Q      throwing it out further that if Iraq complies,  Saddam can't stay in office?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.  I think that that's -- our  judgment is that it is not possible for Saddam Hussein to comply with  the resolutions and stay in power.  But the important point is that  we expect compliance by Iraq with all U.N. resolutions, and we will  continue to demand it.              Q   And are you concerned the Iran will become the  dominant power in the area --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Secretary Christopher has also  spoken to Iran over the last several days, and he says we also expect  full Iranian compliance with all international norms, and stopping  support of terrorism.              Q   That's a very glib statement that he won't stay in  power if he complies with U.N. resolutions.  On what logic do you  base that?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right now Saddam Hussein is not  complying with the U.N. resolutions at all.  He is not respecting the  rights of his people, as is required by the U.N. resolution.  He is  not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding inspections.   He is not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding  armaments.              Q   Well, when do you think that if he did comply he  would be out of power?        MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, right now his power rests on  the repression of his people.  If he stopped doing that it would make  it more difficult for him to stay in power.              Q   George, back on the stimulus package, why is it  that you and the President accuse the Republicans of playing pure  politics and perpetuating gridlock?  Why is it that -- what evidence  do you have that they just don't have a genuine idealogical  difference with you that's in good faith?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the fact that several times  in the past the Republicans, many of the ones who are now leading the  fight for the filibuster, have supported the very funding they now  seek to stop, most especially, the highway funding.                Q   George, in regards to that, some of the moderate  Republicans said that the White House erred by not being more open to  them during the -- while the plan was put together, that they had  one, sort of, proforma meeting between the White House and the Senate  Republicans, and that was it.  Does the Administration look back and  thinks perhaps it could have done a better job of working with some - -              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I'm not sure that it's true  that there was only one meeting.  I mean, the President met with the  Republican leadership on at least two occasions before the  introduction of his package.  He met with the entire Senate  Republican Caucus also for lunch, and went up there.  We are  continually in contact with as many Republicans as we can find who  have an interest in the President's package.  We are interested in  what they have to say, as well.  But we believe that this program is  important, and we're going to continue to fight for it.              Q      your all or nothing, do it with the Democrats  alone strategy, did you maybe miscalculate the ability to get it  through?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean, I think that there is  no question that under the Senate rules a determined minority can  frustrate activity.  I mean, there is just no question about that.   You only need 40 plus one to keep going.  40 plus one to keep going  and to stop any action, and that's what the Republicans are doing.              Q      going to rethink the way you attempt to get  other things passed as you go through this process for the rest of  the summer?              Q      work with Republicans and try to woo some  Republicans into your camp?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we're going to continue to  look for the support of Republicans whenever we can get it on the  President's intiatives?              Q   But on this one -- how are you going to do it  differently than you did it on this one because on this one you  really did stiff the Republicans from the beginning and made it clear  that it was a Democratic majority that would get this through and  could get it through and you really didn't need Republican votes?   Are you going to take a different tack when you have to go for  particular votes?  When you have to go through --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't see into the future and  understand every possible turn in the legislative road.  Clearly the  President's going to continue to reach out when he can.              Q   You don't have any regrets then about the way you  have handled it up to now and you don't plan any changes in your  approach in dealing with the Republicans in Congress based on this  experience?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Obviously the President would like  his package passed as quickly as possible and he's going to continue  to press for that.  We will continue to reach out to Republicans,  there's not question about that.  And we'll continue to reason with  them and try and find appropriate avenues for cooperation.  In this  case the Republicans have chosen to unify around a filibuster, around  a plan to frustrate action not a plan to move forward.              Q   They're being denied any other legislative means of  putting their proposals forward.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think they're being --              Q      any ideas.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think their amendments are being  defeated; I don't know that they're being denied.              Q      to present them.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's not exactly true.  I mean  they get the votes --              Q      that theirs can be passed though by the  parliamentary rules under which they're playing.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Unless they get a majority in  support all the way around, no, that's not exactly true.              Q   George, one more on Iraq.  Is the administration  backing any of the Iraqi opposition?  Grooming any new leadership?              Q      backing any of the Iraqi -- leadership?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, I -- again, we're pressing for  Iraqi compliance.  I don't know if we can get into the business of  grooming leadership.  I believe there have been some contacts, at  some levels, with Iraqi opposition groups.  I don't know  about  anything recently.              Q      Jesse Jackson, who, of course, is not the  President's best friend, has, however, been told that there is to be  some kind of town meeting, or some kind of involvement by the  President, pre-empted the ball game -- Los Angeles.  Will he consider  something like that, or any other kind of intervention there?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, the President  appointed Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, about 10 days ago, to be a  special envoy to California, and coordiante cabinet activities around  the California economic situation, including the situation in Los  Angeles.                I believe there will also be visits out to Los Angeles  by the Education -- or have been visits by the Education Secretary,  Mr. Riley.  I believe that Transportation Secretary Pena and HUD  Secretary Cisneros are also going out.  And there may be other visits  by Cabinet officials over the next several days and weeks.  I  wouldn't rule out the possibility of a visit by President Clinton to  California.  Obviously, he is following the situation closely, and is  concerned about making sure that we make the right long term policy  decisions that will help create the kind of economic opportunities  which help prevent disturbances.  But we're going to continue to  watch it.              Q   George, as a follow-up, Reverend Jackson is also  supposed to be outside the ball park today, in Baltimore, with a  group of supporters protesting the lack of minorities in baseball  management.  Does the President have a position on that?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has received  correspondence from Reverend Jackson.  I know that Reverend Jackson  has also spoken with the White House Chief of Staff, Mack McLarty.   He clearly raises serious questions.  There has been some progress in  baseball over the last several years, but still not enough.  But the  President intends to continue to go to the ball game.              Q   Is he going to say anything about it today, or see  Reverend Jackson while he's out there?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if he is going to see  them, but as I said, the President believes that Reverend Jackson has  raised some serious questions, and it's something that, as I said,  even though there has been progress, it's clearly not enough.              Q   Did Reverend Jackson ask him not to go to the ball  game?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure about that.  I believe  the characterization the Reverend Jackson is talking about is an  informational pickett.  I don't know that he asked him not to go to  the ball game, but he sent a long, detailed, formal letter outlining  his concerns with the situation in major league baseball and the  President read it.              Q   George, the Orioles are playing the Rangers, the  managing partner of the Rangers is George W. Bush.  Is he going to be  there, and is he going to meet with the President?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.              Q   What is the Mubarak schedule?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I know that President Mubarak is  coming tomorrow morning for a working meeting, they will have a  lunch, and I believe that he is having dinner tonight with Vice  President Gore.              Q   And joint statements tomorrow --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe so, yes.  At the end,  yes.              Q   Is there evidence, George, that the Egyptians did  warn the U.S. about a potential terrorist bombing -- terrorist  activities?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As reported in The New York Times,  I mean, I think that President Mubarak did say that there has been  general conversations with the Egyptians, as there have been for a  long period of time.  We do have general intelligence sharing, I  mean.  But President Mubarak was very careful to point out that there  was no specific information on this visit that was passed forward.   The President will continue to investigate the situation, but he also  reiterates his belief that we cannot tolerate terrorism of any kind.              Q   George, he did make specific -- or the Egyptians,  apparently, did issue specific warnings about this individual who,  forgive me --this individual who, forgive me the name escapes me at  the moment, and said the Egyptians were more or less rebuffed in  their attempts to get some kind of action.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know if I would  agree with your characterization of the Mubarak interview.  He did  say that they gave general warnings about the possibility of a  network in the United States and upon which we took appropriate  action.  But there was no specific information on this specific  operation at all.              Q   So, the White House doesn't feel that any of the  law enforcement agencies whether it be the CIA or FBI who would have  received this kind of information was lax or derelict in its duty in  not pursuing some kind of --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, not at all.              Q   What's next with Serbia?  It got only a passing  mention in the news conference yesterday --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  You didn't get to ask your  question.              Q   Yes, exactly.  Was there any agreement on concerted  action between the two countries?  And even if there wasn't, what  does the U.S. do next?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the U.S. is clearly going  to move forward in the U.N. today continuing discussions with our  allies on a sanctions resolution and we'll continue to look for ways  to press the Serbians to come to the negotiating table and sign an  agreement.              Q   George, why do you think sanctions is still an  option?  I mean the Serbians make it clear that at least the  leadership is surviving just fine and they feel like they can wait  you out and even the administration officials we had in the other day  said there's no evidence that they're going to have an effect any  time soon.  The Bosnian Serbs have said no to the peace plan.  When  does no mean no and you have to do something different?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean we are doing something  different.  We're moving forward on further sanctions through the  U.N. and those discussions will continue.  We're going to continue to  try and tighten the noose on Serbia, and I think that every  opportunity we have to do that will have an effect over time.              Q   Are we looking again at lifting the arms embargo?  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has said that this is something  that is under consideration.              Q   George, do you have any more on Hugh Rodham's  condition, how he's doing?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As far as I know nothing's changed.              Q   George, -- week after Mr. Mubarak?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's a little unclear.  I think  we'll be able to get you more either tonight or tomorrow morning  after the Mubarak visit.              Q   Is he going somewhere for Easter?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not that I know of.              Q   What more can you tell us about the additional aid  to Russia that the President plans to ask Congress about?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's going to be consulting with  the Congress and with our G-7 partners over the next couple of weeks.   I know that he spoke last evening with Congressman Gephardt and their  delegation before the -- the congressional delegation meets with the  Russians this week and those consultations will continue over the  next several weeks.              Q   Do you expect that package to be of the magnitude  of the one announced Sunday?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not going to discuss the  magnitude.              Q   How about the list of Cold War restrictions, where  do you stand on that --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As the President said yesterday,  he's going to be looking for that list from the Congress this week  and reviewing it.  He believes -- he's going to try and get it this  week and he's going to review the list, and we're going to take a  hard look at it.              Q   But they're making it up?  I mean it's no White  House involvement, Congress is compiling this list?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he's going to talk to the  congressional leaders about compiling the list but I'm certain we'll  be able to get our own researchers working as well.              Q   George, isn't lifting the arms embargo more of a  probability than a possibility?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's something that's under  discussion.              Q   Secretary Christopher has said that it's a matter  of time and -- for months before that happens.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, all I can say is that it's  something that the President is reviewing.  Right now we're working  with our allies in the U.N on a sanctions resolution, and we'll  continue to review other matters.              Q   George, can you tell us anything about the schedule  this week?  Any travel?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They just asked about that.  I  don't have anything more beyond tomorrow's visit with Mubarak right  now.              Q   Are there consultations, George, with any Jewish  American organizations concerning Jackson-Vanick?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As you know the National Conference  of Soviet Jewry has a list of, I believe,        MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- as you know, the National  Conference of Soviet Jewry has a list of, I believe, 200 Refuseniks.   We'll certainly take a look at that and continue appropriate  discussions.              Thanks. \",\" The most practical use I've seen for them is as key ring ornaments :-)\",\"Greetings,     I have an Epson HI-80 4 pen plotter forsale.  It emulates an HP 7570 or 7574 - I'm not sure which.  It has an option board on it that does the emulation.  It has a serial interface with Hardware handshake. I also have 340 Pens for it as follows:  10 packs of 4 Black Oil based, 16 packs of 4 Red,Green, Blue, and Black pens, 22 packs of 4 Aqueous Black, 7 packs of 4 Aqueous R,G,Blue,Black,  1 pack of 6 Aqueous Multi color pens,  and 114 assorted non-packaged pens mostly colored.      The plotter is used.  I have tested it using the Windows drivers for HP 7570 and HP 7574 and both worked fine.  It accepts either A or B sized paper. (8.5 x 11 or 11x17).      I figure that the plotter is worth about $300 and the pens are worth at least another $200 more..  One thing is certain, you won't need to purchase any pens for quite a while...  All of the packaged pens were sealed so they are all still fresh.  The rest were capped and seem to function as well.      I'd be willing to sell the pens seperate if anyone is interested in just them.      I'm selling it because I got a HP LaserJet and I don't need color.

Both Type 1 and TT fonts can be of excellent quality and poor quality at any size. It all depends on the font's maker and the complexity of the glyphs related to the size and resolution at which they are viewed. Probably the reason for your opinion/experience that TT is inferior is because most TT fonts on the market today have been converted from Type 1 outlines to TT either by the font vendor or end-users using Fontographer or FontMonger instead of the TT fonts being hand-hinted to take advantage of the TT hinting language. At best these converted TT fonts will be on a par with the Type 1 font of its orgin.  TrueType is a much richer and more robust hinting language than Type 1 (the hinting of diagonals for instance, which TT does and Type 1 cannot). If you check out the Windows 3.1 core fonts (Times, Arial, Courier, Symbol, Wingdings) you'll see what can be done with TT. There are other fonts out there that have been hand-hinted and not just converted. Some of the Microsoft TT Font Pack 2 fonts are hinted very well.   Again, not true. The characters in a TT or Type 1 font depend on the maker. If someone converts a Type 1 font to TT they'll only get the characters in the font of orgin. TT allows for much more flexibility in this area as well. You can have thousands of glyphs in a TT font file (Mac/PS/Windows/Unicode char set) and use the characters appropriate for the particular platform you are running the font on. For instance, all or our fontpack 2 TT fonts have the Mac/Windows char set in them. The metrics of the fonts are such that if the font is brought over to the mac the user will have access to the full mac char set.    Hope this clears up some of the confusion.

The original poster (W G Wright) posted an item saying that he had bought a new wizz-bang Laser Printer from Apple (a Select 300 I think) which can print GrayScale. He then said that he CANNOT PRINT GRAYSCALE from his SE computer (and also that all the 'experts' he has dealt with agree that it is not possible).  This is the one major bugbear about doing a 3rd party SE upgrade (compared to Apple's SE to SE/30 upgrade): you will never be able to run Color Quickdraw. It is Color Quickdraw that controls Color AND Grayscale.  SEs CAN print some COLOUR: this is because Quickdraw - the original, non-colour version, has the right hooks for eight colours. Some of you will remember the 'SCSIgraph' solution to getting a colour screen for your SE (I think that it gave you sixteen colours by dithering or something).  There is no reason that Apple couldn't release software patches for older computers (there are lots of Mac Pluses, Classics and SEs that have been upgraded to 68020 and 68030 processors which should be perfectly able to deal with Color Quickdraw) - but they wont, and 3rd parties are having a difficult  time in duplicating the Mac's ROMs (i.e. Nutek et al.).  Just one Caveat: I would have thought that if you were printing a POSTSCRIPT Grayscale image onto a POSTSCRIPT Grayscale printer, that you would be able to do so, whatever Mac you were using. (And I am pretty sure that the Select 300 is NOT a POSTSCRIPT printer [? correct me if I'm wrong?]).\",\"    In Texas, you cannot carry a handgun.  Period.  Either concealed or open.

At first, I thought it was the video driver and    made sure I had the most current drivers, because the problem was most   evident at SVGA resolution modes.  It didn't help and after a bit of   experimentation, determined that the problem existed in standard VGA   resolution mode. It was just much less noticeable.      My mouse was an older MS serial version I bought second hand in 1990. It   worked just fine in DOS and DOS based graphic applications.  On the    guess that the problem was with the resolution of the mouse, I borrowed   a new mouse (a MS bus model) and tried it.  That solved the problem.   So, if your mouse is old, you may want to try replacing it for a newer   one.      --  signoff\",\" How do you spell \\\"tuna helper\\\" ? \",\" I think the original post was searching for existing implementations of f.i. Gouroud-shading of triangles. This is fairly complex to do with plain X. Simpler shading models are implemented already, f.i. in x3d (ask archie where to get the latest version). For Gouroud, a fast implementation will be possible utilizing some extension only, either MIT-SHM to do the shade in an image and fast update the window with it, or PEX/OpenGL which should be able to shade themselves. The portable 'vanilla X' way would be to shade in a normal XImage and use XPutImage(), what would be good enough to do static things as f.i. fractal landscapes or such stuff.  To speak about POVRay, the X previewer that comes with the original source package is not that good, especially in speed, protocol-friendlyness and ICCCM compliance.

CRITZ, III\\\" <71611.365@CompuServe.COM> Subject: EnviroLeague  \\\"Birth Announcement\\\" on March 7, 1993, from EARTH Forum, CompuServe                        Information Service ===================================================================                        FORMAL ANNOUNCEMENT                      -------------------                                        (SM)                         EnviroLeague   A new youth movement,\\\"EnviroLeague,\\\" was recently born, according to its founder, Boyd R. Critz, III (CIS ID# 71611,365), of Peoria, Illinois. EnviroLeague exists for the education of youth, both male and female, in matters concerning their values related to and responsibility for our environment.   Incorporated as an Illinois not-for-profit corporation, its Articles and initial applications for a service mark have now been filed.  According to Critz, its draft Bylaws contain the following statement of Mission and Objectives:                              MISSION      It is the Mission of EnviroLeague and its adult members    to foster and implement the improved education of young    people in the need to conduct their lives as Stewards    of The Earth, to leave The Earth in a better condition    than they found it, and to otherwise act as responsible,    moral and ethical users of their environment.  To pursue    the accomplishment of this Mission, EnviroLeague shall    seek to serve as a catalyst, focusing in common cause the    separate efforts of all groups desiring the preservation,    improvement, and responsible use of the environment in    which we must all live.                            OBJECTIVES      In pursuit of the Mission of EnviroLeague, its primary    objectives shall be:        (1)  To establish a Movement involving as many             environmentally concerned organizations as             possible, said Movement having as its primary             focus the education and participatory             involvement of young people in appropriate areas             of environmental concern;        (2)  To develop and provide to such organizations and             their branches a full complement of program             materials for their use, including suitable             uniforms, insignia and other badges, written             ideas, syllabi and information, literature and             other items as shall seem appropriate and             desirable;        (3)  To serve as a \\\"clearing house\\\" for the exchange             of program ideas, materials and information             among said organizations;  and        (4)  To assist environmentally concerned             organizations to recruit and train the necessary             adult leadership for their youth programs.   EnviroLeague will operate through three \\\"Program Divisions\\\" serving youth in the elementary, middle and high school grades, respectively.  Service shall be through formation of \\\"EnviroLeague Teams,\\\" either by EnviroLeague itself or by environmentally conscious organizations (or their local branches) wishing a charter to use programs developed by EnviroLeague.   EnviroLeague, as it develops, will be controlled by the actual adult leaders of each local Team, and will have no nationally imposed obstacles to membership or adult leadership status not based upon relevant improper conduct. Organizations accepting a charter may, however, impose certain additional standards for their own use of the program material.  Should such organizations do so, EnviroLeague will commit itself to forming, as soon as possible, new nearby Teams having no such restrictions, particularly as to youth membership.   EnviroLeague will operate on the principle that youth will have much to contribute to developing its programs.  Thus, the top youth leaders of its Teams for middle and high school youth may become involved in governing any local administrative groups, and those for its high school youth may be involved in similar functions at the national level.   Program materials are in development at this time.  Copies of the \\\"draft\\\" portions of the Mentor's Manual (manual for adult leadership) will be in the EARTH Forum, Library 17. These files will be updated as development takes place.   CompuServe is particularly proud that EnviroLeague's founder chose this electronic medium to make the first public announcement of its formation. This announcement is being made simultaneously in both the OUTDOOR and EARTH Forums.   The electronic home of EnviroLeague is in CompuServe's Earth Forum - GO EARTH - message and library areas 17, both named \\\"EnviroLeague.\\\" ============================================================================   Subsequently, EnviroLeague's Initial Governance Council has held its first meeting.  Boyd Critz was elected as the first EnviroLeague Chief Guardian (equivalent to Chairman of the Board or CEO).  He can be reached at home (309) 675-4483 in case of real need.

Drivers licence: Forgot that USA is THE land of cars..... Getting one in Scandinavia (and northern europe) is not easy. Average time is about 20 hours of training, and the cost is rather...... But we think this is acceptable because a car is NOT a toy, and bad drivers tend to hurt OTHERS. (If you are really bad, you WON'T get a lincence!)  Abuse by the goverment: This seems to be one of the main problems; Any harder gun-control would just be abused by the goverment.(!) Either some of you are a little paranoid (no offence...) OR you should get a new goverment. (You do have elections??)  Guns 'n Criminals: MOST weapons used by criminals today are stolen. Known criminals can NOT buy weapons, that's one of the points of gun control. And because gun control are strict in WHOLE scandinavia (and most of europe), we dont have any PROBLEM with smuggled guns.  Mixing weapons and things that can be use as one: What I meant was that cars CAN kill, but they are not GUNS! Someone said that if we 'ban' guns we'd have to ban cars to, because they 'kill' to... I don't think we should argue on this one..... ;)  The issue (I hope..): I think we all agree that the criminals are the main problem. Guns are not a problem, but the way they are used is.... (and what are they for??)  I think this discusion is interesting when you think of (ex)Jugoslavia: They should all have weapons, it's their rigth to have them, and if they use them to kill other (Innocent) people the problem is humans, not guns.  If 50% of ALL murders was done with axes, would you impose some regulations on them or just say that they are ment to be used at trees, and that the axe is not a problem, it's the 'axer' ?? (An example, don't flame me just because not exactly 50% are killed by guns...)  Think about the situation in Los Angeles where people are buying guns to protect themselves. Is this a good situation ?? Is it the rigth way to deal with the problem ??  If everybody buys guns to protect themselves from criminals (and their neighbor who have guns) what do you think will happen ?? (I mean if everybody had a gun in USA)  Don't flame the Englishmen because of Northern Irland, they have gun control that works (in England) and fonds from USA are one of the reasons why IRA can bomb innocents... (Something about throwing stones in glass houses...) Don't flame them because of what to (three?) children did either. (Can an Jugoslav have an oppinion on guns or even peace??) (YES!)

I am not saying that I totally agree with his   interpretation, but it is certainly believable and good food for thought.  He   interprets the Babylon of Revelation 17-18 as being none other than the good   old U. S. of A.  That's right, America.  He supports his claim in several ways.    The Babylon of Revelation is THE world leader in trade and commerce, and the   WHOLE WORLD wept when Babylon fell.  The American dollar, despite the Japanese   success of the 20th century, is STILL the most sought after currency in the   world.  If the U.S. were destroyed, wouldn't the whole world mourn?  The bible   also talks about Babylon being a home of harlots, sin, and adultery (I am   paraphrasing, of course).  Babylon's sin affected, or should I say, infected,   the whole world.  It doesn't take much looking to see that the U.S. is in a   state of moral decay.  Hasn't the American culture and Hollywood spread the \\\"do   it if it feels good\\\" mentality all over the world.  I think, though, that what   Mr. Wilkerson uses as his strongest argument is the fact that Revelation calls   Babylon \\\"Babylon the Great\\\" and portrays it as the most powerful nation on   earth.  No matter how dissatisfied you are with the state of our country, I   don't think you would have too much trouble agreeing that the U.S. is STILL the   most powerful nation on earth.  Again, this interpretation is not NECESSARILY my own, but I do find it worthy   of consideration.\",\"Some sick part of me really liked that phrase....\",\"  Well it rolled out two weeks ago. As we speak it is at White Sands getting ready. I would have called my sources for the latest but they are all out of town (in NM).  As for the future, there is at least $5M in next years budget for work on SSRT. They (SDIO) have been looking for more funds and do seem to have some. However, SDIO is not (I repeat, is not) going to fund an orbital prototype. The best we can hope from them is to 1) keep it alive for another year, and 2) fund a suborbital vehicle which MIGHT (with major modifications) just make orbit. There is also some money for a set of prototype tanks and projects to answer a few more open questions.  Better news comes from the new Spacelifter effort. The USAF managers of this program are very open to SSTO and will have about $50M next year for studies. This would be enough to bring DC-Y to PDR.  Now not all of this money will go to DC but a good case could be made for spending half on DC.  Public support is STILL critical.

Huh?\",\"A bit more than a year ago, a hernia in my right groin was discovered.

A few months later the same pain returned.  The doctor said that he could find nothing wrong in the area of the hernia repair.  Now the pain occurs more often.  My GP couldn't identify any specific problem.  The surgen who performed the original procedure now says that yes there is a \\\"new\\\" hernia in the same area and he said that he has to cut into the area for the repair this time.

They won't  } even be in the top 4 in the division, more like 6th.  if this is true, it won't be for lack of contribution by Viola, so who cares?\",\"  I think I should also point out that the mystical DES engines are known plaintext engines (unless you add a ton of really smart hardware?)   The 'plaintext' is digitized voice, and exists for a very short time, probably in a couple inches of copper, tops.

Many important issues, and some not-so important ones, are discussed here on the net on a daily basis.  I have just been informed of what I feel is one of the most important things that we could ever discuss -- The  out-and-out censorship of one of our fellow posters because some people don't like what he says or thinks.  We have all seen the postings here by AJ Teel.  Although many of us have not agreed with their content, I'm sure most of us have been at least somewhat interested in them.  I, for one, am greatful to live (I thought) in a country where people like Mr. Teel are allowed to say what they please. If I don't wan't to read it, I can just skip on by, or unsuscribe.  But, unfortunately, some people cannot let others live and let live.  They feel an overwhelming need to snuff out the little bastards.  Now it seems that Mr. Teel will be with us no more, due mainly to our brother, and cheif net police, Ted Frank.   PLEASE HELP AJ TEEL REGAIN NET (POST) ACCESS AND CORRECT THIS INJUSTICE.                         ARE YOU ON TED'S HIT LIST?                         ARE YOUR THOUGHTS CORRECT?                           IS YOUR ACCOUNT SAFE?          HAS YOUR SYSADMIN BEEN CONTACTED BY THE THOUGHT POLICE?  I thought the NLG and the ACLU supported people with diverse opinions. NOT!    Please read the following forwarded messages from AJ Teel so that  you may understand this vial act for what it is...  ------------------------------ forwarded ---------------------------------  Newsgroups: alt.activism,alt.conspiracy,talk.politics.misc,misc.legal Subject: Officer Ted Frank, Thought Police Badge Number NWO-666 Summary: Ted wins the argument by killing his opponent! Expires:  Distribution:  Organization: University of Colorado, Boulder Keywords: NWO Ted Frank  Well, well, well... Thanks to eck@panix.com (Mark Eckenwiler) and thf2@kimbark.uchicago.edu (Ted Frank), my account is to be axed. I guess that the information I am presenting is just toooo difficult for them to deal with. They (ONLY Ted and Mark) have complained to my sysadmin some unknown number of times to get me off the net. (In his defense, Mark sent only one message and it was not THAT bad; it has been posted in one of the newsgroups; However, it *was* not directed at me as would be common practice and I am VERY good at responding via netmail...)  While I disagree with Ted, I would not send mail to his sysadmin to get him axed. Name-calling was not enough; jumping on every post I made was not enough; ignoring specific points when they were not what the desired picture was not enough; SIMPLY IGNORING ME IF I AM SUCH A KOOK WAS NOT ENOUGH. Even now I do not wish to have him axed, but I do wish to express my disgust about this. \\\"Argumentum ad silence-your-opponent-um\\\"?! I would have thought he would have wanted me to stay around just to have someone to yell about and seem sooo wise... (to himself, I think).  The issue that seems to be: \\\"Is the following an advertisement?\\\" Apparently, Ted and Mark think so...  1) I Posted an article from around one year ago as it was taken   *off the net* from last year. If reposting an article  constitutes posting an ad, then I am guilty. This post  did have a name and address and, yes, a price. If one  had posted the address and subscription price of \\\"Newsweek\\\",  would that be an ad? I get nothing from showing this stuff. 2) I Posted a list of documents showing examples of the kind of  \\\"proof\\\" that was REQUESTED BY TED FRANK. He then complains  to my sysadmin saying that I am advertising and, lo and  behold, \\\"poof\\\", there goes my account. This one had an  address in it! Oh, no! I Guess that means it is an ad!  If you value the alternative view I have been discussing, or VALUE ITS DISCUSSION even if you do not agree with it, I ask that you send a note saying as much to me to show to the sysadmin. They rarely get \\\"Ya know, that user on your net was real helpful...\\\" or whatever; they only get \\\"I don't like what that user is doing because...\\\". Please do not send the note to the sysadmin. I need to take it to them in a manner that has at least a chance of getting through.  In my files here are hundreds of responses from people saying \\\"Thanks for the info\\\" or \\\"Could you send me such and such?\\\" or \\\"Your posts are very interesting... keep it up.\\\" and only a handfull of \\\"Go aways\\\". But, I guess the fact that I have decided not to waste my time trying to convince Ted is a Net Offense[TM] of such magnitude as to warrant a message complaining about me. (Knock, knock...\\\"My name is Ted and and this is Mark... We're from the thought police. Seems you have some pretty dangerous ideas here, and we're here to confiscate them...\\\") NWO Indeed!  Guess I will have to go back to the drawing board and come up with a new plan... Thanks Ted and Mike. Hope you are happy. I will be on for a few more days and then... that's all folks! Your comments and support are requested. I can no longer post to news. I ask what this has accomplished... Is there some benefit from making alternative views simply vanish? Not in my book.  Seems the easiest way to win an argument is to make the opposing side shut up. Images of Waco.... ah, but alas... And all this when I am in the process of typing in a letter to me from the Tax Collector saying that a lien was removed due to a letter that I wrote challenging jurisdiction. Oh, well... It takes time to come up with the info requested, and I was just getting started.  It should be noted that Ted Frank has been accused publicly over 40 times of being an NWO supporter and has never made an statements to the contrary. Further, what ARE Ted Frank's motivations for getting me axed? We all know that SOME PEOPLE are getting paid to collect info on people on the net that are of \\\"interest\\\" to the government, and Ted sure seems to have a *personal* interest in debunking me. Hmmm... just who does he work for? The University of Chicago which he \\\"attends\\\"(?) is well known as one of the biggest NWO supporters...  And finally, if anyone would be able to help me find a new account here in the Boulder/Denver area, I would greatly appreciate it. I am in the process of installing Linux and so will be able to do UUCP or maybe a TC/IP connection. Any help here would be greatly appreciated. Since I am longer be able to post news and will no longer have email VERY soon, I hope that anyone who wishes to contact me will do so via:   A. J.

It is an LC, with 10MB of RAM and an 80MB internal drive, running system 7.1, with a few SCSI devices in a (so far as I know) properly terminated chain.  I had shut down the system for a day-- I was out of town and we sometimes have thunderstorms this time of year-- and upon restarting got a blinking question mark.  I booted from a floppy and saw that my external HD seemed okay, but there was no sign of the internal.  I installed a system folder on the external and was, indeed, able to boot from it.  I tried things like Disk First Aid and Silverlining, to inquire about the internal drive.  They either could not find it or got errors in trying to talk to it. (Silverlining claimed it was a Connor drive, but it is a Quantum... )  Well, I'd backed things up, so I was able to work.  But, at some point I noticed that the internal had reappeared.  Now, Disk First Aid says that all's well, etc.  Things seem to be fine.  But, what happened?  Was this a warning that something (the internal HD or something else) is about to die?  I'm definitely nervous.  And, if this is a signal that the internal HD is sick, is it true that I can only put up to a 127MB drive inside an LC?

You examine the predicitions that the theory makes, and try to observe them.  If you don't, or if you observe things that the theory predicts wouldn't happen, then you have some  evidence against the theory.  If the theory can't be modified to  incorporate the new observations, then you say that it is false.  For example, people used to believe that the earth had been created 10,000 years ago.

First, note that the \\\"experts\\\" will only look at \\\"details\\\", and of just  the algorithm:      In addition, respected experts from outside the     government will be offered access to the confidential details of     the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report     their findings.  Why not the chip design?  Well, here's the possiblity:  in addition to encryption, the chip pre-processes voice signals to make them easier to analyze/transcribe electronically.  The chip, once widespread, might effectively be part of a massively parallel computer for \\\"voice- grepping\\\" the US phone network (or the criminal & wrong-thinking patrons thereof).  I wouldn't put it past the NSA.  Think how much easier it would make life for them.  And if this is indeed the case, think of the possible public outcry should it become widely known.  Thus the secrecy.  It might be a good idea to have experts in DSP, voice recognition, and AI conversation-understanding to be on that panel, and insist they be given (authenticatable) design specs and implementation documentation.\",\"[Stuff about the connection between IDE and IDA deleated] If IDE speed come from IDA WHERE does the 8.3MB/s sighted for IDE come from?  SCSI is not complex. It is just the way the industry uses and talks about it. There are THREE key differences in SCSI; the controller chip, the port, and the software.  THAT IS IT. Let us look as SCSi in from THIS stand point.  SCSI-1: asynchronous and synchronous modes {SOFTWARE SCSI DRIVER ONLY}  asynchronous is slower then synchronous mode {only 0-3MB/s vs. 0-5MB/s}  synchronous speeds can be reached by most SCSi-1 divices with a  rewrite of the software driver {As is the case for the Mac Quadra.}  SCSI-2 {8-bit}: THIS is the main source for the confusion. This differs from  SCSI-1 ONLY in the controler chip in most machines.  In the Mac and some PCs  this is called 'fast SCSI-1' because it uses SCSI-1 ports and software drivers  AND can produce SCSI-2 SPEEDS through SCSI-1 INSPITE of this even in the   slower asynchronous mode.  Average speed in asynchronous SCSi-1 mode   4-6MB/s with 8MB/s{See in both Quadras and higher end PCs} Synchronous  mode just allows a higher burst rate {10/MB/s}  SCSI-2 {16-bit}: TWO versions-Wide/Fast.  Wide SCSI-2 requires TWO things  over 8-bit SCSI-2:  a SCSI-2 software driver and a wide SCSI port on the  machine and the external device.  Fast SCSI-2 also requires TWO things over 8-bit SCSI-2: SCSI-2 driver  software and that the RECIEVING devise support 16-bit fast SCSI-2.  Speed of both is the same: 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst.  SCSI-2 {32-bit}:  Also know as Wide AND Fast SCSI.  Over 8-bit SCSI-2 this  requires: SCSI-2 driver software, wide SCSI-2 port, and that the RECIEVING  devices ALSO have a 32-bit mode SCSI-2 chip.  As expected this is VERY  expencive.

(i.e. if you lift off briefly, it will remain in the  low gear.  this is handy if you are charging through corners and  would like to do without the distraction of upshifts when there's  another curve approaching)  3) part throttle downshifts, based on the *speed* at which the pedal is  depressed, rather than the *position* of the pedal.  modern  electronics can measure this very easily and switch to sport mode.  this is wonderful if you want to charge through a green light about  to turn red.  my audi senses this very well and can downshift on as  little as half throttle if my right foot is fast enough.  also, i think that a smart automatic can deliver better gas mileage than a dumb driver with a stick, all else being equal.. remember that the idea of a stick being more economical than an automatic makes a big assumption that the driver is smart enough to know what gear to use for each situation.. how many times have you ridden with an inattentive driver cruising on the highway at 55/65 in 4th gear (of a 5 speed)?    how many % of people who drive manuals *really* know what the best gear to use is for every conceivable situation?  i'm sure there will be some who know, but i suspect that a chip controlled automatic with all possible scenario/ratio combinations stored in ROM is likely to do better.  i can also say that all my previous assumptions were proved wrong after i got a car with instantaneous mpg readout... high gear, low revs and wide open throttle is more economical than low gear, high revs and small throttle opening.  the explanation is quite simple if one sits down to think about it, but not that obvious at first sight. \",\"Does anybody know the FTP site with the latest Windows drivers for the ATI GUP?

When I installed NDW, it wanted to rem out the line that installed EP (EP /ON) and the command to invoke the Image utility. It replaced the Image command with a new image command that invokes the version of Image that came with NDW.  This makes sense, as presumably the Image version with NDW is newer than the one with NU.  It did not, however, install smartcan in the autoexec.  Now two questions:    1:  Will NU use the image data saved by the newer version of image invoked.        i.e. Are the two version of Image compatable?    2:  Will erase protect use the info from smartcan, and vice versa?

By such a back- door (in the encryption algorithm perhaps) it would be possible (for   the manufacturer) to get the keys of all chips that were programmed in  one session.

It took place in the first intermission of game 1 of the Montreal-Quebec series.   Pre-game comments ----------------- Don's pregame comments were mostly aimed at the goalies... The goalie who gets back his all-star form (Roy or Hextall) can win the series for his team.  Eposode Summary --------------- This episode took place rinkside. Don was holding a hot dog that he bought from the concession stand.  Ron Maclean started out by showing a cartoon which appeared in the Toronto Sun. It featured a picture of Don, who just saw his shadow and proclaimed \\\"Will you look at dat, eh? Means another 6 weeks of me. Beauty.\\\"  Next, Don talked about the hot dog he was holding. According to him, the hot dogs at the Quebec stadium are the best food in all the arenas in the NHL.  From there, Don commented on the Quebec-Montreal game. The game had great flow, because Referee Paul Stewart calls the best game in the NHL. In contrast, the Calgary-LA game was terrible... All stop-and-go, over 50 minutes of penalties called against Calgary by Dan Marouelli. Its getting so that the ref who calls the most penalties gets to ref in the finals.  Next, Ron showed an old picture of Don, when he was playing for the Rochester Americans of the AHL. Don recalled some of the wins that he had in the Quebec arena... during the Memorial cup and the AHL championships.  Finally, Don and Ron discussed Keenan becoming coach of the Rangers. The rangers were a talented team who underachieved. Don feels sorry for temporary coach Ron Smith, who had several key injuries (to Leetch and Patrick) and goalies who went cold.  Don had some criticism for the Rangers team... The party's over, Adolf (Keenan) is there. The Rangers organization will no longer be a 'country club'.... \\\"NY should be achamed of themselves... If they go in the tank with Adolf there, they'll be hanging from the yardarm by their thumbs.\\\"   Rating ------ Nothing too special in this episode.

Golden Bears Hockey Motto (C. Drake)\",\" A number of points.  You are making assumptions about the manner in which the cards are used.  True, by law, all residents, citizens, and tourists must carry a form of identification with them.  For citizens, the standard ID is the ID card.  The purpose this serves on a daily basis, wherein they are presented at public places, is for the purpose of identifying the bearer.  This takes place in banks (cashing checks), post offices (registered mail and such), etc... Quite frankly, it was rare that I ever had to present my ID card for such activities more than once per week.  There is no law or requirement that forces people to wave their ID cards in public. Furthermore, none of the services I outlined discriminate against the bearer in any manner by having access to this information.  The only case that I can think of in which the Le'um field might be taken into account is during interaction with the police, based upon the scenario.  In general though, arab citizens are clearly recognizable, as are non-arabs. Your argument therefore becomes moot unless you can provide an example of how this field is being used to discriminate against them officially.    I take issue with your assertions.  I think that Arab countries do know that they have nothing to fear from \\\"Israeli expansionism\\\". Militarily, Israel is not capable of holding onto large tracts of land under occupation to a hostile, armed, and insurgent population for a sustained period of time.  As is, the intifada is heavily taxing the Israeli economy.  Proof of this can be seen in the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon.  Israeli troops pulled back from the Awali, and later from the Litani, in order to control the minimal strip needed to keep towns out of range of Katyusha missile fire. Public opinion in Israel has turned towards settling the intifada via territorial concessions.  The Israel public is sufferring from battle fatigue of sorts and the gov't is aware of it.  With regards to borders, let me state the following.  I may not agree with the manner in which negotiations are being held, however the crux of the matter is that everyone either makes or refrains from stating a starting position.  The arab parties have called for total withdrawal and a return to pre-48 borders.  If Israel were to state large borders, the negotiations might never get under way.  If Israel were to state smaller borders, then the arab countries might try and force even smaller borders during the negotiations.  I think that leaving the matter to be settled by negotiations and peace treaties is infinitely more realistic and sensible.   Your statement is typical of the simple minded naivety of a \\\"center for policy research\\\".  Whether or not all of Vanunu's revelations were true has no bearing on the fact that some were.  For disclosing \\\"state secrets\\\" after having signed contracts and forms with the understanding that said secrets are not to be made public, one should be punished. As to which were and which weren't, I am under no moral obligation to disclose that - quite the reverse in fact. He was taken to court, tried, and found guilty.  You may take issue with a number of things but clearly you have no understanding of the concept of \\\"Secrets of state\\\", something which every democratic govt has.   I noticed that he was documenting the fact that such prisoners could exist more than he documented the fact that they do exist.  The CLU noted, which you evidently did not pay attention to, that they know of no such reports or cases.  I am sorry to tell you but in a country of 4 mill, as tightly knit as Israel, even if the matter of the arrest was not made public, within a relatively short time frame, most people would know about it.  My own feelings are that the matter of the arrest should be made public unless a court order is issued allowing a delay of X hours. This would be granted only if a judge could be convinced that an announcement would cause irreparable harm to the ongoing investigation.   Well, I am sorry to say that your questions are slanted.  Such questions are often termed \\\"tabloid journalism\\\" and are not disturbing because they avoid any attempt at objectivity. Such questions were often used during the McCarthy era as a basis for the witch-hunts that took place then.  To use your own example, these questions might have been lifted from the format used by Stalinist prosecutors that were looking for small bits of evidence that they could distort and portray as a larger and dirtier picture.  My answers were not any more \\\"hysterical\\\" than the questions themselves.  The problem is not that the q's were provocative, it was that they were selective in their fact seeking.  You fall into the same category of those who seek \\\"yes\\\" \\\"no\\\" answers when the real answer is \\\"of sorts\\\". I suspect that as long as the answers to these questions is not an unequivocal NO, you would remain unsatified and choose to interprete them as you see fit.  A sign of strength is the ability to look You remind me of those mistaken environmentalists who once advocated culling wolves because of the cruelty to deer, only to find that they had broken the food chain and wreaked havoc upon the very environment they sought to protect.  The color blindness you exhibit is a true sign of weakness.   Ditto. \",\"  In the South Lebanon area, only Israeli (and SLA) and Lebanese troops  are present. Syrian troops are deployed north of the Awali river.  Between the  Awali river and the \\\"Security Zone\\\" only Lebanese troops are stationed.   That is your opinion and the opinion of the Israeli government. I agree peace guarantees would be better for all, but I am addressing the problem as it stands now.  Hopefully a comprehensive peace settlement will be concluded soon, and will include security guarantees for both sides.  My proposal was aimed at decreasing the casualties in the interim period.  In my opinion, if Israel withdraws unilaterally it would still be better off than staying. The Israeli gov't obviously agrees with you and is not willing to do such a move.  I hope to be be able to change your opinion and theirs, that's why I post to tpm.   As I explained, I contend that if Israel does withdraw unilaterally I believe no attacks would ensue against northern Israel.  I also explained why I believe that to be the case.  My suggestion is aimed at reducing the level of tension and casualties on all sides. It is unfortunate that Israel does not agree with my opinion.     That is too bad.    Because Israel is not occupying the \\\"Security Zone\\\" free of charge. It is paying the price for that.  Once Israel withdraws it may have lost a bargaining chip at the negociating table but it would save some soldiers' lives, that is my contention.    If Lebanon were willing to agree to  That is completely untrue.  Hizbollah is now a minor force in Lebanese politics.  The real heavy weights are Syria's allies.  The gov't is  supported by Syria.  The Lebanese Army is over 30,000 troops and unified like never before.  Hizbollah can have no moral justification in attacking Israel proper, especially after Israeli withdrawal. That would draw the ire of the Lebanese the Syrian and the Israeli gov'ts.  If Israel does withdraw and such an act  (Hizbolllah attacking Israel) would be akin to political and moral  suicide.

(Sorry, I didn't say the solution was free.) In the past I'd tried everything with my Microsoft serial mouse. (Cleaning it, unloading all kinds of TSRs, turning off SMARTDRV write cacheing, changing COM ports, ...) Nothing worked. Yesterday I finally broke down and bought a Mouse Systems Bus Mouse. The improvement is even better than I had imagined! So much so that my old mouse must have been jumpy all the time (I just thought it was jumpy sometimes), and I had gotten so used to it I didn't notice. My wife, who uses the computer about once a month, noticed the improvement literally within a second!  I can't say anything about other bus mice, but with the Mouse Systems one you'll have to give up either COM2 or LPT2 to an IRQ. Also, if you don't know, Mouse Systems mice have three buttons. The driver includes a utility that lets you assign keystrokes to the middle button.  Hope this helps someone else. If you're anywhere near as frustrated as I was, it's well worth the $80.  ---\",\"this must be a FAQ from the very first days of the 13\\\"RGB!!!!\",\" As I understand it was considered unsafe for the tv networks to get any closer. Surely the networks can judge the risks of reporting for themselves. I haven't noticed CNN being banned from Baghdad hotels yet despite the (all too real) risk of having a cruise missile land in the lobby.

Here's the outcome from the research (condenced versions, copyright San Jose Mercury news):  ---   Bombings in the two largest cities in southern Lebanon killed 11 people and  wounded 80 others. A car bomb blew up in Tyre, killing 10 people and wounding  75. A man was killed and five others seriously wounded in an explosion in  Nabatiye. ---   An Israeli navy patrol boat attacked and sank a rubber guerrilla boat off  southern Lebanon early today, killing the two men aboard, the army command  said.         It said in a communique that a Dvora patrol boat opened fire on the  motorized rubber dinghy north of Tyre after identifying it as hostile. The army  said no one on the Israeli boat was injured. The affiliation of the slain  guerrillas was not immediately known. ---   Rival factions of the guerrilla group led by terrorist mastermind Abu Nidal  battled Sunday in Tyre, Lebanon, with machine guns and rocket-propelled  grenades, killing at least four people and wounding 15, police said. ---  Lebanon's mainstream Shiite Muslim militia said Thursday that it had  uncovered a network of tunnels in a southern Lebanese village where it said pro- Iranian kidnappers had held Western hostages.         Officials of the militia, Amal, led local journalists through the catacomb- like alleys and showed them two cells with iron doors at the village,  Kawthariyet al Siyad, near Tyre, the ancient port city, about 40 miles south of  Beirut.         The officials said they were certain that U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R.  Higgins was detained there shortly after he was seized by gunmen on a road  outside Tyre in February 1988. -------------- ...anyway, I counted 20 articles during these 3 years of reporting. I also found out the possible reason why the numbers for the inhabitants of the city is defined between 14000 and 24000. It seems that Tyre is one of the places where people from Libanon flee to during more extensive bombings, so there's a constant flow of refugees entering and leaving Tyre (articles mentioned thousands of people entering and leaving this place).  I counted 0 articles for my home town, Kristinestad, so from now I will consider this place to be a fishing village :-).

Gain values      of conventional (solar, fission) electric propulsion systems are      always quite small (e.g., G(t)<0.8).

In contrast, gain values 50-100      times higher are found for some fusion concepts, which offer      \\\"high-thrust\\\" flight capability. One performance example shows a      53.3 day (34.4 powered; 18.9 coast), one-way transit time with      19% payload for a single-stage Earth/Mars vehicle. Another shows      the potential for high acceleration (a(t)=0.55g(o)) flight in      Earth/moon space.   \\\"The QED Engine System: Direct Electric Fusion-Powered Systems for  Aerospace Flight Propulsion\\\" by Robert W. Bussard, EMC2-1190-03,  available from Energy/Matter Conversion Corp., 9100 A. Center  Street, Manassas, VA 22110.       [This is an introduction to the application of Bussard's version      of the Farnsworth/Hirsch electrostatic confinement fusion      technology to propulsion. 1500<Isp<5000 sec. Farnsworth/Hirsch      demonstrated a 10**10 neutron flux with their device back in      1969 but it was dropped when panic ensued over the surprising      stability of the Soviet Tokamak. Hirsch, responsible for the      panic, has recently recanted and is back working on QED. -- Jim      Bowery]   \\\"PLASMAKtm Star Power for Energy Intensive Space Applications\\\", by  Paul M. Koloc, Eight ANS Topical Meeting on Technology of Fusion  Energy, special issue FUSION TECHNOLOGY, March 1989.       Aneutronic energy (fusion with little or negligible neutron      flux) requires plasma pressures and stable confinement times      larger than can be delivered by current approaches. If plasma      pressures appropriate to burn times on the order of milliseconds      could be achieved in aneutronic fuels, then high power densities      and very compact, realtively clean burning engines for space and      other special applications would be at hand. The PLASMAKtm      innovation will make this possible; its unique pressure      efficient structure, exceptional stability, fluid-mechanically      compressible Mantle and direct inductive MHD electric power      conversion advantages are described. Peak burn densities of tens      of megawats per cc give it compactness even in the      multi-gigawatt electric output size. Engineering advantages      indicate a rapid development schedule at very modest cost. [I      strongly recommend that people take this guy seriously. Bob      Hirsch, the primary proponent of the Tokamak, has recently      declared Koloc's PLASMAKtm precursor, the spheromak, to be one      of 3 promising fusion technologies that should be pursued rather      than Tokamak. Aside from the preceeding appeal to authority, the      PLASMAKtm looks like it finally models ball-lightning with solid      MHD physics. -- Jim Bowery]      ION DRIVES:   Retrieve files pub/SPACE/SPACELINK/6.5.2.* from the Ames SPACE  archive; these deal with many aspects of ion drives and describe the  SERT I and II missions, which flight-tested cesium ion thrusters in  the 1960s and 70s.

Presumably the protocol can be recovered (if by nothing else, differential analysis).  Postulate if you will, a chip (or logic) sitting between the clipper chip and its communications channel.  The purpose of this chip is twofold:       1) Transmit Channel       The spoof chip XORs the 30 bit encrypted serial number with      a secondary keying variable.  This renders the serial number      unrecoverable with just the system key   2) Recieve Channel       The spoof chip XORs the incoming encrypted serial number      with a secondary keying variable (assuming the serial number      is necessary for local operation).  This has the net result of hiding the serial number.  This gets more interesting when the number of serial numbers issued becomes large, making it difficult to distinguish between valid serial numbers and a spoofed serial number.  Without knowing the system key, you could lie about the serial number, but risk detection of the lie.  IF you had the system key and the encryption algorithm you could successfully lie with a lower probability of detection by emulating the format of your own serial number.\",\"From: Center for Policy Research <cpr> Subject: Assistance to Palest.people   U.N.

It : has been whether they fired their main guns.    Never?  This is incorrect.  Either you don't read very well or resort to falsehoods in an attempt to make a point.  At the risk of boring and belaboring the point, my claim was the chain was regarding the tanks \\\"last used in Detroit in 48\\\". The text follows.  :  You did not merely claim that : tanks were used--you claimed that they fired their main guns to suppress : sniper fire and that they were \\\"quite\\\" effective at this.    Indeed, when Coffman claimed they were only used as APCs, I did say I had been told they did fire their main guns.     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ : You continue to : back away from this claim and defend something else that nobody is : disputing.  Well, the poster who I responded to did dispute the use of tanks post-48.  Rude of you to call Gary Coffman a nobody.    : \\\"Well, it's not the main gun.\\\"  Gee, that's only the entire point.  Are you : now going to admit that you were wrong?  That was the entire point to *you*.  What exactly did I claim?    --------------------------------------------------   \\\"I've heard eye-witness descriptions of tanks using their main guns to respond to sniper fire.  Quite effectively.\\\"    --------------------------------------------------    I wasn't wrong . . . I've heard those descriptions.  If you're paying attention, I've mentioned that I saw the tanks with my own eyes, but the main gun firing was an account I heard.  That helps people judge whether or not to kick in the, to use your words, \\\"bullshit filters\\\".  Stating that I *claimed* this is a falsehood.    What was it I claimed as fact?  Here's the entire post:   --------------------------------------------------  Correction.  I know they used tanks in Detroit 1968.  I saw em, it was well covered in the news at that time.  Gordon Lightfoot mentions it in his song \\\"Black Day in July\\\".   --------------------------------------------------    Since you don't dispute that and claim that nobody else does, that means I was right.    : I will never read of tanks firing their main guns in Detroit in the '67 : riots.  There is simply no way that such an event could have taken place : without it being common knowledge even 26 years later.  The American : military firing shells from tanks in American cities on blacks would have : been *big* news.     So one would suppose.  Some folks think in happened in 48.    Awesley goes on:   You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers.  : To fire fragmentary grenades?  I doubt that as well.  To fire concussion : grenades?  Perhaps.  To fire tear gas?  Certainly.  But you would be : perfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags, wouldn't you, since : it makes your other claim seem more plausible.  John, again, strawman techniques.  Do you feel you're losing it so you have to stretch what I said and knock that down?  What I read said nothing about what they fired.  And so I put nothing in there.  If you need some help, let me know and I'l take your side of this for a while.  You're not scoring here, you're boring here.   : If tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit, people would have been : screaming about it for the past two and half decades.  I would know about : it.      Glad to know you're such an expert.  Nice to hear some an authority.  I especially appreciate your basis of knowledge -- if it had happened, you would have know it.  Since you are such an authority, you probably know that people did scream about an alleged massive cover-up in the number of people killed in the Detroit riot. Some claimed 100+ dead, others said 300.  The offical number is 43 but the Concise Columbia Encyclopedia says it was \\\"several\\\".  I've also heard some things about that but I won't dare repeat them.  You'd assert that I claimed they were truth.  : Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up.      Taking the tour after the riots, it was pretty easy to tell the  difference between Army and Guard troops.  Or so I recall from 26  years ago.  And I seem to recall it was the Army running the tanks. So it would have been an Army cover-up.     Another part of my memories was that while most damaged building were burnt, some were in rubble.  Based on what I remember, I was and am inclined to believe an old sarge or two.  : If your mind is open enough to believe that, well, good for you.  I prefer : to live in reality.   And here in reality, I find it hard to believe that : those tanks even had any shells, much less fired them.     Given the level in destruction in Detroit, I'm quite willing to believe that they did fire their guns.

Some Christian churches claimed to be located at the final resting places of Peter, Mark, and other saints, but no one ever claimed to possess the body of Mary, the greatest of the saints. Why? Because everyone knew that she had been taken up into heaven.  Although there is no definitive scriptural proof for the assumption of Mary, some passages seem suggestive, like the passage in Revelation that describes a woman giving birth to a Son and later being crowned in the heavens. Of course, the woman in this passage has other interpretations; she can also be taken a symbol for the Church.  The assumption of Mary makes sense because of her relationship to Christ.  Jesus, perfect God and perfect man, fulfilled the requirements of the law perfectly.  Under the law God gave to us, we are to honor our mother and father, and Christ's act of taking his mother into heaven is part of his fulfillment of that law. Also, he took his flesh from her, so it seems appropriate that he decide not to allow her flesh to rot in the grave.  One last point: an ex-Catholic attempted to explain Catholic doctrine on the assumption by asserting it is connected to a belief that Mary did not die. This is not a correct summary of what Catholics believe. The dogma of the assumption was carefully phrased to avoid saying whether Mary did or did not die. In fact, the consensus among Catholic theologians seems to be that Mary in fact did die. This would make sense: Christ died, and his Mother, who waited at the foot of the cross, would want to share in his death.\",\"  It is no matter what you call the teams, Jokerit and TPS, or Helsinki Tornado and Turku Typhoon, the best palyers in Finland would eventually end up in those teams anyway, if they were in the \\\"big\\\" league.   \",\"   as someone who just lived through a switch from SunOS4.x.x. to Solaris, i'll heartily agree with this.

I think your question should be, \\\"...losing sleep over a million expert riflemen?\\\" Certainly he could have conquered Switzerland, but a million armed militiamen (especially in a mountainous area,  where tanks' effectiveness is limited) would have made it a real pain. The question a conqueror would ask, is \\\"is it worth  the trouble?\\\" The more difficult an invasion is, the more likely the answer would be \\\"no.\\\" Certainly a million riflemen (as opposed to a professional army of only ten or twenty thousand, the best a country the size of Switzerland could support), makes invasions more difficult.   Really? In 1939? I'm not even sure you could prove that today (despite the steriotype.)

There was no elaboration as to where specfically the item was found, of what type of wrench it was, but the anchorperson did say something about a NASA official commenting that there would be an inquiry into how the thing got in the SSRB.

Earlier, you said that it must be a conscious act.  By your definition, no instinctive behavior pattern could be an act of morality.  You are trying to apply human terms to non-humans.  I think that even if someone is not conscious of an alternative, this does not prevent his behavior from being moral.   I try to show it, but by your definition, it can't be shown.  And, morality can be thought of a large class of princples.  It could be defined in terms of many things--the laws of physics if you wish.

For example, how about a scheme using RSA, and some hybrid of DES-CFB and another strong stream cipher (Maybe IDEA-CFB)?  This could be substantially the same as the cripple chip, except that instead of key-registration, the police could demand that you give up your secret key to them (with a court- issued warrant).  Then, they could read the last few months of wiretapped messages you've sent, and assuming you've committed no crimes, you could generate a new key pair and go about your business.  I find that I'd be willing to pay RSA for the right to use such a system, especially given the alternative.  If you were unwilling to give up your secret key, then you'd probably stay in jail (has anyone got a real legal precedent for this?).    This would allow court-issued warrants to be used to gather information on suspected criminals, but it couldn't be done in secrecy, and there would be enormously less likelihood of corruption or theft of escrowed keys.

The keywords `Monthly Posting' will always appear to make killing this article easy for users of newsreaders with kill facilities.  This article is posted to all autos groups, but followups are directed only to rec.autos.  If you don't understand what this means, ask your system administrator for help, or at least for copies of the newuser documentation.  Failing that, please subscribe to the newsgroup news.announce.newusers and read the documentation provided there.  Introduction to the Rec.Autos newsgroup hierarchy:  rec.autos.tech  is intended for technical discussions of automobiles, their design, construction, diagnosis, and service.  Other discussions are largely inappropriate, especially For Sale ads.  rec.autos.sport  is intended for discussion of legal, organized competition involving automobiles.  Technical discussions are appropriate insofar as they apply to competition vehicles.  Discussion from either of two viewpoints, spectator and participant, is encouraged.  Arguments about sports cars are largely inappropriate, as are most other discussions.  For Sale ads are inappropriate unless they are for competition vehicles and/or equipment. Discussions of illegal events are marginal; one should probably avoid advocating breaking the law.  (remember, the FBI reads Usenet!)  rec.autos.driving  is intended for discussions related to the driving of automobiles. Also, if you must discuss 55 vs. 65, or radar detectors, or <insert your pet driving peeve> boneheads, do it here.  rec.autos.vw  is intended for discussion of issues related to the use and ownership of automobiles manufactured by Volkswagen (this includes VWs, Audis, Seats, etc.)  It was created on the grounds that the info-vw mailing list was very successful.  It should not be presumed from the existence of this group that it is appropriate to create many groups to cover many different marques; groups specific to individual marques should only be created on demonstration of sufficient interest, via some avenue such as a mailing list.  rec.audio.car  is not properly part of the rec.autos.* hierarchy.  it is, however, the correct place for discussion of automotive audio equipment, and so is mentioned here.  rec.autos.antique  is intended for the discussion of older cars (usually more than 25 years old, although this is not a hard-and-fast rule.)  alt.hotrod  is not part of the hierarchy, but also of potential interest to the rec.autos reader.  it is gatewayed to the moderated hotrod mailing list, and is for serious discussion of modifying and developing performance vehicles.  alt.autos.rod-n-custom  also not part of the `official' hierarchy; devoted to that peculiar American hobby of customizing older cars.  alt.autos.karting  for the discussion of the popular motorsport and hobby, karting.  rec.autos  is intended to capture discussion on all other automotive topics.   Crossposting:  Crossposting occurs when more than one newsgroup name is included on the Newsgroups: line in the article header; such articles will appear in all of the newsgroups listed.  Crossposting is one of the most misunderstood and misused facilities on Usenet.  You should only post to a group because you feel an article is appropriate; you should NEVER crosspost just to reach a particular audience.  This distinction is subtle, but important.  Radar Detector articles, for example, are more-or-less appropriate in rec.autos.  They are almost never appropriate in sci.electronics or rec.ham-radio, and the fact that you might want to reach the audience in sci.electronics or rec.ham-radio is NOT adequate justification for posting to either group.  Crossposting between any or all of the rec.autos.* groups is usually inappropriate; if you find yourself doing so, consider whether or not it is truly advisable, before sending your article.  Consider setting Followup-To: to point to only one newsgroup if you feel you must crosspost.  Crossposting between rec.autos.* and misc.consumers is chancy at best; in particular flame wars over the speed limit in the US and/or the use of radar detectors should NEVER be crossposted between any of these groups.  Most readers of sci.electronics and rec.radio.* couldn't care less about the police radar and radar detector arguments that go on endlessly in rec.autos.  It is an excellent idea to check the Newsgroups: and Followup-to:  lines of articles before posting a followup.  In particular, be wary of posting to misc.test, rec.arts.startrek.*, or talk.bizarre, or any combination of these three.  The life you save may be your own.  Distribution:  There is a field in the header of any news article which allows you to (partially) control where the article goes; it is called the Distribution field.  It may be very useful for many reasons; it should also serve as a reminder that news is a very large and widespread system.  The distribution of rec.autos.* is fairly extensive.  As of this writing,  the Automotive newsgroups are known to reach most of Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and some locations in Japan.  With this in mind, I offer the following hints about use of the Distribution: field in your article headers, and on article content.  1) Please take care not to send for-sale ads about clapped out Ford Mavericks in New Jersey to France or California; i doubt that anyone in either place will care, except for my girlfriend, who for some strange reason likes Mavericks (but only 4-door Mavericks, at that.)  2) When posting technical questions, please include the market for which your car was manufactured.  For example, there are a number of differences between a European-market Ford Escort and a US-market Escort.  Likewise, all 1750cc and early 2000cc Alfa Romeos reached the US with Spica Fuel injection; European market cars usually got carbs (often Webers).  These differences can be important to your readers; make your situation clear. Failure to do so can lead to pointless flame wars and a significant spread of misinformation.  3) Be careful about your capacities and specifications when posting; in the US we get a mix of Metric and English system values, whereas Europe is almost entirely on the Metric system.  A future edition of this monthly posting will contain a list of commonly-used abbreviations that may not be known in some places that rec.autos reaches; this cuts both ways so let us not be parochial about it.  4) Use the Distribution: field to limit where your article goes, when possible.  Within North America, the values na (north america), can (canada), and usa may be used.  in addition, the two-letter state abbreviations of the US are supported in some cases; e.g. if i wanted to send an article only to New York and New Jersey, i could put \\\"ny,nj\\\" in a Distribution field.  note that multiple, comma-separated values are legal.  these distribution fields vary widely, however, so you should check with your local sysadmin to find out what is likely to be supported in your area.  The Dangers of Overgeneralization:  To amplify a warning from the distribution section of this article: Be wary of making foolish assumptions about all cars, tires, etc.  What is true for a 1973 Buick with a 455cid engine may be quite utterly wrong for a 1976 Honda with a 1200cc engine.  Headlight laws in Sweden are decidedly different from those in Idaho.  The Need for Adequate Specification:  When you ask a question, please give a reasonable amount of information; e.g., if you have a question about your Honda, please specify year, model, engine size, etc.  Otherwise, most answers to your question may be quite useless.   Concerning Lemons:  At one time or another, every auto manufacturer has manufactured a lemon or two; even Honda admits to this.  Please don't waste everyone's time by announcing to the world that your `brand x' automobile is terrible, so all `brand x' automobiles are terrible, so no one should ever buy a car from the `brand x' company.  Such articles are worse than useless, because they cause substantial wasted bandwidth while carrying little or no useful information.   Concerning Flames:  As much as we might wish it, a flame-free newsgroup is something that most likely will never occur.  Here are some guidelines for flames and how to deal with them (a list of flame-prone topics follows in the next section of this posting):  If you post something truly obnoxious and inflammatory, don't imagine for a minute that including the words `No Flames' will work.  It won't, and you'll get exactly what you deserve.  If you're going to flame, you're more likely to get away with it if you can cite a fact or maybe a well-known reference.  No one is likely to believe bald, unsupported assertions.  Be careful about who you choose to insult.  Consider not insulting anyone.   Asking the Question:  It is a bad idea to post a question and end it with a phrase like `Please send email, I don't read this group'.  It is a much better idea to end the question with `Please send email, if there is sufficient interest I'll summarize the results in a later posting.  I may miss posted responses to this request'.  Answering the Question:  If someone wants to hop up their Yugo, don't tell them to get a Mustang. Either be silent, or give them useful advice.  If someone wants advice on defending a speeding ticket, don't tell them to obey the law next time -- it's offensive, presumes guilt which is not proven, and doesn't directly address the original question.  In general, don't post in order to see your words in print, and don't post in order to enjoy feeling smug and self-righteous.   Stale and/or Inflammatory Topics:  Certain topics are considered stale by `old timers'; while discussion of them is certainly ok, and new, factual information is welcome, ravings about them are extremely tiresome, and may get the person who posts them ignored altogether.  Some topics are naturally inflammatory; it is difficult if not impossible to have meaningful discussion of them.  Some of these topics include the following:  1)  the 55mph speed limit in the US: Pro and Con  2)  discussions about the morality and legality of the sale and usage of     radar detectors.  3)  discussions over which radar detector is best.  4)  discussions over what is a sports car (this is one reason why     rec.autos.sport is not a `sports car' group -- everyone would argue     about what constitutes a `sports car'.)  5)  disputes over whether or not US Federal law protects the driver's     right to own and operate a radar detector  6)  `Buy American' discussions  7)  `clever' bumper stickers and personalized license plates  8)  <insert nationality here> cars are terrible  9)  What kind of car did Maxwell Smart drive?       [when I have a complete, accurate answer it will be added to the           commonly-asked questions article which is also posted monthly.           Until then, please don't waste bandwidth on this topic. -- rpw]    Please direct comments and suggestions about this article to:       welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com\",\"Can anybody help me?

There were NEVER any specific projects included in the Community Development Block Grant portion of the President's proposal.  Congressional Republicans, in an effort to discredit the stimulus package, selected what they felt were silly sounding projects from a wish-list of POTENTIAL  projects prepared by the US Mayors' Conference before the stimulus package was ever proposed.  (The document in question was designed to pressure the White House to increase the size of the block grant proposal submitted to Congress.  It didn't work.)  The $2.56(?) billion proposed in the stimulus package came nowhere close to covering the total estimated cost of the original wish-list.  If it were passed, communities would have to select which projects to fund and at what level.  In the case of Spokane, Wa., Tom Foley's home district, no one ever expected to be able to refurbish a local swimming pool (one of the  Republicans' examples) FROM THE FUNDS AVAILABLE IN THE STIMULUS PACKAGE since the estimated cost of doing so exceeded the total  amount of block grant funds the city would receive from the stimulus  package for ALL projects.    The plan, instead, was to use the money on public housing construction and remodeling to cope with a severe housing shortage.  (Yup, there are places where that is true.)  The swimming pool improvements were near the bottom of a long list of priorities prepared by the city.  The $3 million or so to be received would cover only a few of the most pressing priorities.  If the block grants are cut from the stimulus package, it is these projects that will be affected by the lack of funds.  And that is why the Clinton administration has been publicizing the issue.  A final point.  One may or may not like community block grants.  It is worth noting, however, that Congressional Republicans' opposition to them is new.  Since the Nixon administration, Republicans have generally  supported such grants as an alternative to targeted federal spending, arguing that local governments are far better able to determine spending priorities than \\\"Washington bureaucrats.\\\"    Is it clear now?  Or is this all too complicated to understand?  jsh\",\" Yes, it was Nixon who was most vocal about giving money to Russia.  It makes me proud to be a libertarian.

It's like subsidizing tobacco farmers while paying bureaucrats to pursuade people not to smoke.

Believe it or not, I also : listen to KNX in the evenings here in Colorado! It's kind of fun driving : through the country listening to traffic jams on the 405. Back to your : original question. Yes, there are sensors just past every on-ramp and : off-ramp on the freeways. They're the same sensors used at most stoplights : now (coils in the pavement). You might want to give CalTrans a call or : even ask Bill Keene (KNX's traffic reporter). I doubt if just anyone can : get the information, but it would be worth asking just in case you can : get it.  I seem to remember that they sell the information (and a computer connection) to anyone willing to pay.  On the subject of the pavement sensors, can anyone tell me more about them?  --  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Christopher Wolf             Electrical Engineer                cmwolf@mtu.edu\",\"  as someone else already mentioned, don't \\\"carry thru\\\" the other 23 pins.  plan A, minimal null modem:  SG(7)   -  SG(7)  TD(2)   -  RD(3)  RD(3)   -  TD(2) if you're transfering files betwen 2 PCs, this ought to work (unless you have a persnickity comm program).  plan B, null modem with modem control:  SG(7)   -  SG(7)  TD(2)   -  RD(3)  RD(3)   -  TD(2)  DCD(8)  -  DTR(20)  DTR(20) -  DCD(8) some comm software will wait for DCD before transferring anything. such software will raise DTR to enable the modem to accept a call. with this cable, each side's DTR will drive the other's DCD.  plan C, null modem with hardware flow control:  SG(7)   -  SG(7)  TD(2)   -  RD(3)  RD(3)   -  TD(2)  RTS(4)  -  CTS(5)  CTS(5)  -  RTS(4) for high-speed transfers, you want the flow control.  plan D, deluxe null modem (combine B and C):  SG(7)   -  SG(7)  TD(2)   -  RD(3)  RD(3)   -  TD(2)  RTS(4)  -  CTS(5)  CTS(5)  -  RTS(4)  DCD(8)  -  DTR(20)  DTR(20) -  DCD(8) this one is ideal.  it leaves out DSR and RI (rarely used anymore). if you're really paranoid, or you just have an 8th wire to spend, you might add:  FG(1)   -  FG(1)  the pin numbers above are (obviously) for 25-pin connectors. i don't have a 9-pin pinout handy. \",\"I have a vt200 and vt100 compatible terminal with 1200 external hyess modem amber screens 101 keyboard,cable make an offer 0 \",\" You know, you're absolutely right.

[...I believe \\\"Jesus    only\\\" originally was in the context of baptism.  These are folks who    believe that baptism should be done with a formula mentioning only    Jesus, rather than Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.  This may have    doctrinal implications, but as far as I know it does not mean that    these folks deny the existence or divinity of the Father.  I'm not the    right one to describe this theology, and in fact I think there may be    several, including what would classically be called monophysite or    Arian (two rather different views), as well as some who have beliefs    that are probably consistent with Trinitarian standards, but who won't    use Trinitarian language because they misunderstand it or simply    because it is not Biblical.  --clh]  Not Biblical?  What then can they make of the end of Matthew?  (28:18)And Jesus came and said to them, \\\"All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. (19)Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, (20) and teaching them to obey everything that I have commanded to you.  And remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age.\\\" {Other ancient authorities add *Amen*} [NRSV]  The notes give no sense that this is emended.  Do other texts contradict this regarding Baptism?  Or is a misunderstanding of the Trinity the most likely explanation after all?  But maybe I simply misunderstand their views.  (Is anyone else out there forced to read this group with both a good Bible and an unabridged dictionary??  Christianity really is an education in itself.)  -- ------------------------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------  [Arrgggghhhh.  When I talked about people who rejected Trinitarian language as unBiblical, I was speaking of Trinitarian theology, things like \\\"one essense and three persons\\\".  Obviously the three-fold baptismal formula is Biblical, as you point out.  (I normally use the term \\\"three-fold\\\" in referring to Mat.  While it is certainly consistent with belief in the Trinity, the Trinity is a doctrine whose full formulation occurred in the 4th and 5th Cent's.  It's unlikely that Mat. had in mind the fully-developed Trinitarian doctrine. Indeed the three-fold baptismal formula is used by some groups that do not believe in the Trinity.)  The disagreement over baptismal formulae occurs because of passages such as Acts 2:38, which command baptism in the name of Jesus.  (There are a couple of other passages in Acts as well.)  This leaves us with sort of a problem: we're commanded in Mat. to baptize in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and in Acts to baptize in the name of Jesus.  \\\"Jesus only\\\" groups baptize in the name of Jesus.  They consider this consistent with Mat 28:18, because they say that Jesus is the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.  I'm not the right one to ask to explain what this means.  I will simply say that it does not appear to be normal Trinitarian theology.  (It is also an odd way of dealing with the idiomatic phrase \\\"in the name of\\\".)  Those who use the three-fold formula don't seem to have a standard answer to the passages talking about baptizing in the name of Jesus. I suspect that the most common explanation is to say that \\\"in the name of\\\" need not be a verbal formula.  To say that you baptize in the name of Jesus may simply mean that you are doing baptism under Jesus' authority.  In the 1st Cent. context, it contrasts Christian baptism with the baptism of John or other Jewish baptism.  Of course there's a certain parallelism between these passages.  That suggests that we could just as well say that Mat 28:18 doesn't require the specific three-fold formula to be used in baptism, but simply characterizes baptism done by those who follow the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.  One might well suspect that in the early church, more than one baptismal formula was used.  So long as we consider following Jesus to be the same as following the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, no great damage would be done by such a difference.  This does *not* mean that I think we should go back to using both formulae.  Baptism is one of the few things that almost all Christian groups now recognize mutually, so I do not think doing something to upset that would be in the interests of the Gospel.  This is reinforced by the fact that those groups that actually use \\\"in the name of Jesus\\\" now do seem to have in mind a difference in doctrine.  But as I've said before, I'm not the one to explain what their doctrine is.\",\"Archive-name: hockey-faq  rec.sport.hockey answers to Frequently Asked Questions and other news:   Contents:  0.

It  is updated each month and only information currently under discussion or  of continuing importance or interest will be listed for more than two  postings.    Boston Bruins   Boston legislators and the developers proposing a new Boston Garden  finally agreed to a deal that puts the 19,000-seat, $160 million project  back on track to be finished in September 1995.   Right wing Daniel Marois will be sidelined indefinitely following  surgery to repair a herniated disc in his back. **   Sent defenseman Glen Murray to Providence of the American Hockey League.   Buffalo Sabres 1-800-333-PUCK (1-800-333-7825)   Acquired left winger Bob Errey from Pittsburgh for defenseman Mike  Ramsey. **   Veteran Buffalo Sabres broadcaster Ted Darling will be inducted into the  club's Hall of Fame Sunday, April 11.  Darling, who joined the expansion  Sabres in 1970, was the team's play-by-play announcer on both television  and radio until illness forced him out of the booth during last season. **   Recalled forwards Viktor Gordiouk and Doug MacDonald from Rochester of  American Hockey League.   Calgary Flames   Acquired veteran right wing Greg Paslawski from Philadelphia for future  considerations. **   Recalled center Todd Harkins and left winger Tomas Forslund from Salt  Lake City of International Hockey League.   Chicago Blackhawks         The $175 million, privately financed United Center, scheduled to  open in August 1994, will be home to the NBA's Chicago Bulls and NHL's  Chicago Blackhawks. The stadium is owned by entities controlled by the two  teams. The owners apparently still have not made a decision on whether the  old Chicago Stadium will be razed for parking space once the new facility,  located directly across the street, opens.   Suspended defenseman Craig Muni indefinitely for failing to report  following a trade with Edmonton.   Detroit Red Wings   Acquired defenseman Steve Konroyd from Hartford for a sixth-round draft  pick.   Annnounced the signing of right wing Joe Frederick, their 13th pick in  the 1989 National Hockey League entry draft. **   Two contrite hockey fans have returned the stolen Michigan Sports Hall  of Fame plaque honoring Detroit Red Wing great Gordie Howe. The bronze  plaque was stolen more than four years ago from Cobo Hall in Detroit, site  of the Michigan Hall of Fame.   Edmonton Oilers   Sent forward Esa Tikkanen to the New York Rangers for center Doug  Weight.   Traded defenseman Craig Muni to Chicago for forward Mike Hudson.   NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said the Edmonton Oilers' lease with  Northlands Coliseum must be improved if the team is to survive in the  city. Edmonton Northlands is a non-profit agency set up by the city to  administer exhibition facilities including the Coliseum.  Oilers owner  Peter Pocklington calls his lease with Northlands horrendous and has  threatened to move the team if he doesn't get a better deal. He makes no  money from parking, concessions or building advertising. The 17,313-seat  Coliseum also has few of the lucrative private boxes that produce  significant revenues for other owners.   Announced center Kevin Todd will not need surgery but will miss the  remainder of the season with a separated shoulder.   Hartford Whalers   Sent defenseman Steve Konroyd to Detroit for a sixth-round draft pick.   Acquired left winger Robert Kron and a third-round draft pick from  Vancouver for left winger Murray Craven and a fifth-round draft pick. **   The state of Connecticut will begin negotiations to buy the Civic Center  from the city in an effort to keep the financially struggling Hartford  Whalers franchise in the city.

Acquired defenseman Mark Osiecki from Winnipeg for ninth- and 10th-round  draft picks in 1993.   Added defenseman Travis Richards from the University of Minnesota.   A former employee filed a sexual harassment suit against Minnesota North  Star owner Norman Green. Karen (Kari) Dziedzic, Green's former executive  assistant, claims Green often instructed her to wear cosmetics, described  her outfits as \\\"very hot\\\" and \\\"very sexy,\\\" once slapped her hand as she  was about to eat and humiliated her by grabbing her hand and rubbing it  through a client's hair.   The Minnesota North Stars, who will move to Dallas after this season,  announced that nearly 11,000 season ticket reservations have been made for  their new home at Reunion Arena, which has a capacity of 16,800.   The Met Center commission has told the Minnesota North Stars that it  wants the club out - with its keys returned - at midnight after the last  home game.  The club is moving to Dallas for next season.  The club must  pay unpaid interest of $4,492.80 on the team's late rent payment for 1992,  which was made earlier this month, and has been instructed not to take  property such as the scoreboard and Zamboni ice-surfacing machine. **   Derian Hatcher's game-misconduct penalty was rescinded by the NHL,  allowing the Minnesota defenseman to play in the North Stars' last two  regular-season games.  Hatcher was given the penalty during a fight at the  end of a loss at St. Louis on Sunday, April 11.  But the league didn't  rescind the game-misconduct penalty Shane Churla received.  The Stars  recalled center Cal McGowan from their top minor league club in Kalamazoo,  Mich., to replace Churla.   Montreal Canadiens   Acquired defenseman Rob Ramage from Tampa Bay for minor league  defensemen Eric Charron and Alain Cote and future considerations.   New Jersey Devils **   Bernie Nicholls publicly apologized for his criticism of referee Denis  Morel after the Devils' 5-2 loss to the Buffalo Sabres.  Nicholls was  ejected by Morel for being the third man in on a fight late in the second  period of that game and afterward Nicholls called Morel \\\"a homer\\\" and \\\"an  embarrassment to the referee's association.\\\"   New York Islanders   Traded right wing Daniel Marois to Boston for a conditional draft  choice.   New York Rangers   Obtained forward Esa Tikkanen from Edmonton for center Doug Weight.   Acquired left winger Mike Hartman from Tampa Bay    Acquired center John McIntyre from Los Angeles for defenseman Mark Hardy  and Ottawa's fifth-round 1993 draft pick.   Defenseman Brian Leetch will undergo additional surgery on the right  ankle he broke in a non-skating fall and is not expected to play again  this season. Leetch suffered the broken ankle March 19 following a victory  over San Jose. The team said he slipped on an icy patch of pavement as he  was getting out of a taxi cab in front of his apartment. **   Announced that defenseman James Patrick will require surgery on a  herniated disc in his back and will not play again this season. **   Returned goaltender Corey Hirsch to Binghamton of the American Hockey  League.   Ottawa Senators         The Ottawa Senators received the go-ahead to build the 18,500-seat  Palladium on the proposed location in nearby Kanata, Ont.  The projected  cost is C$150 million. Construction will be postponed until the 1995-96  season, one year behind schedule.   The Ottawa Senators lost their 37th consecutive NHL road game to tie the  1974-75 Washington Capitals for most road losses in a row. **   Assigned left wing Martin St. Amour to New Haven of the American Hockey  League.   Philadelphia Flyers   The opening date of Spectrum II has been pushed back to fall 1995.  Formal groundbreaking has been postponed indefinitely.   Traded veteran right wing Greg Paslawski to the Calgary Flames for  future considerations.   Pittsburgh Penguins   Traded left winger Bob Errey to Buffalo for defenseman Mike Ramsey.   Reacquired defenseman Peter Taglianetti from Tampa Bay Lightning for a  third-round 1993 draft choice. **   Revolutionary Comics of San Diego agreed to destroy all available copies  of a Mario Lemieux comic book in a settlement with the Pittsburgh Penguins  over a trademark infringement lawsuit.  The Penguins sued in February  charging that the \\\"Sport Stars Mario Lemieux\\\" comic infringed on the  team's logo and uniform, which are registered trademarks.   Quebec Nordiques 1-800-463-3333   St. Louis Blues   St. Louis Blues center Ron Sutter will miss the rest of the season as a  result of separating his right shoulder.   San Jose Sharks   The San Jose Sharks announced that ticket prices will increase by about  30% for the 1993-94 season when they move from the Cow Palace into a new  $155-million arena in San Jose. **   Recalled defenseman Tom Pederson from Kansas City of the International  Hockey League. **   Reached agreement in principle with left wing Alexander Cherbayev.   Tampa Bay Lightning 1-800-881-2639         At least two investor groups are poised to build a sports arena in  downtown Tampa if the delay-plagued company that holds a lease from the  Tampa Bay Lightning bows out. Tampa Coliseum Inc. has a lease with the  National Hockey League team to develop an entertainment and sports arena  next to Tampa Stadium, but has been unable to raise enough money for the  project.   Sent left winger Mike Hartman to the New York Rangers for center Randy  Gilhen.   Sent defenseman Peter Taglianetti to Pittsburgh for a third-round 1993  draft choice.   Sent defenseman Rob Ramage to the Montreal Canadiens for minor league  defensemen Eric Charron and Alain Cote and future considerations. **   Manon Rheaume's first starting appearance in goal for the Atlanta  Knights was impressive enough for her coach to say she has a chance to be  a backup goalie for another minor league team next season. Rheaume, the  first female to play professional hockey, stopped 25 shots and gave up six  goals against the Cincinnati Cyclones on Saturday night, April 10. After  the game, her coach, Gene Ubriaco, said Rheaume performed well enough to  compete for the No. 2 goalie spot with the Louisville IceHawks of the East  Coast Hockey League next season. The Knights and the IceHawks are minor  league clubs of the Tampa Bay Lightning. **   As their first season comes to a close, there are rumors swirling that  the Tampa Bay Lightning just might become the Atlanta Lightning.  Or the  Minnesota Lightning.  But they are just rumors, according to Lightning  general manager Phil Esposito.  ESPN reported on Sunday, April 11, that  the Lightning, who have been playing in 10,400-seat Expo Hall, are  exploring opportunities to move to either Atlanta or Minneapolis.  But  Esposito said there was no truth to the report.  \\\"We were disappointed  with ESPN's irresponsible comment,\\\" Esposito said.  \\\"There is just no  substance to the rumor.\\\" Rumors have been swirling for the past two years  regarding a move by Tampa Bay, which is presently discussing plans to  build a new arena.   Toronto Maple Leafs **   Defenseman Matt Martin, who helped Maine win the 1993 NCAA hockey  championship, gave up his final year of eligibility and signed a contract  with the Toronto Maple Leafs.   Vancouver Canucks        The Vancouver Canucks have cleared the last hurdle in their effort  to build a new stadium. Vancouver council has given the green light for  the 100 million dollar complex. It will seat 20 thousand people and will  have an adjoining office tower. It will be built between the viaducts near  B.C. Place in Vancouver. Site preparation will begin this summer, with a  completion date of Fall 1995.

The Jets  rookie tied the record of 109 points, set by Peter Stastny with Quebec  (1980-81), with a goal, his 66th of the season, and moved ahead on an  assist in a 5-4 loss to Toronto. **   The Fort Wayne Komets said they have been told by Winnipeg that the Jets  will keep a minor league affiliation with Moncton of the American Hockey  League. There have been reports the Jets would move players from Moncton  to Fort Wayne next season.  -----  - Expansion news:    The National Hockey League announced that the expansion Anaheim and  South Florida franchises will join the league for the 1993- 1994 season.          Disney and National Hockey League officials announced Monday,  March 1, that the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, Disney's expansion team, will  take to the ice next fall. Michael Eisner, chairman and chief executive  officer of the Walt Disney Co., said the Mighty Ducks will play at the  Pond, the new Anaheim sports arena, near Disney's flagship theme park. The  arena is under construction and will be completed in June. The Pond seats  17,350.

Western Conference teams will play six games against each of five  divisional opponents (30); four games against each of the six teams in the  conference's other division (24) and two games against each of the 14  Eastern Conference clubs (28).    Playoffs: The system will be conference-based, with the No. 1 team  meeting the No. 8 team in the first round, No. 2 vs. No. 7, No. 3 vs. No.  6 and No. 4 vs. No. 5. Matchups will be based on overall points with the  four division champions being placed in the first- or second-place seeds  in each conference and being assured of home-ice in the first two playoff  rounds. All series will be best of seven (2-2-1-1-1 rotation) except  matchups between Central and Pacific teams.  Those series will rotate 2-3- 2 to reduce travel.  In those cases, the team with the most regular-season  points will choose whether to start the series at home or away.  -----  - Draft news:          Under terms of the new expansion draft, which will be held in  June, each of the 24 existing clubs will be allowed to protect one  goaltender, five defensemen and nine forwards. The most recent expansion  drafts allowed teams to protect two goalies and did not make a distinction  between forwards and defensemen.         First-year pros only will be exempt from the draft, which is down  from the two-year exemption teams had last season. San Jose, Tampa Bay and  Ottawa still will be allowed to exempt second-year pros.         Each of the 24 teams will lose two players, with a maximum loss of  one goaltender and a maximum loss of one defenseman. The one exception is  that a team which loses a goaltender can then no longer lose a defenseman.         At the end of the first phase of the draft, the two new franchises  will have three goaltenders, eight defensemen and 13 forwards for a total  of 24 players. A second phase then will be conducted where San Jose, Tampa  Bay and Ottawa will select two players each from the rosters of the two  new teams.         Ottawa, Tampa Bay and San Jose will be guaranteed priority  drafting selection in the 1993 draft as long as they have the three worst  records. Anaheim and Miami will choose no lower than fourth and fifth. The  expansion franchises will move up in the draft should either San Jose,  Tampa Bay or Ottawa not finish in the bottom three positions.         The two new teams will pick first and second in the 1994 Entry  Draft, regardless of their finish in 1993-94. Should either of the two new  teams not play next season they would have priority drafting position in  1994.          The owners announced the 1994 draft will be in Hartford and the  1995 draft in Winnipeg. The 1994 draft was scheduled for Boston, but a  delay in the construction of a new arena required the draft be moved.  -----   - League news:  Disputes:    The NHL owners and players have resolved differences over salary  arbitration procedures, clearing the way for about 40 hearings.

The decision, which came at the  organizing committee meeting here, followed an accord reached in Nagano  between the committee and the IOC Coordination Committee.  The decision  will be formally ratified by an Executive Board meeting of the  International Olympic Committee (IOC) and its Session.  As a result, the  number of total events at Nagano will increase to 64 in seven sports.  -----   - 1991 Canada Cup    Team Canada defeated Team USA 2 games to 0.   -----   - 1992 Izvestia hockey tournament   Final:  Russia II - Czechoslovakia  2-1  Game for 3rd and 4th place:  Russia I - Sweden  4-1  Game for 5th and 6th place:  Finland - Switzerland  3-1  Game for 7th and 8th place:  Canada - Germany  6-1   Final Standings for the 25th Izvestia Cup:   1.

CHL: Fort Worth Fire, Wichita Thunder, Dallas Freeze, Tulsa Oilers, Memphis  River Kings, Oklahoma City Blazers    Six non-affiliated teams play a 60 game schedule extending from early  November to mid March. Each team is owned by the league, with local  interests controlling day to day operations. Each team has a $100,000  salary cap for 17 total players (16 dress up). Unlike the ECHL, players  are not limited to three years in the league.   A Western Division may be added to the Central Hockey League for the 93- 94 season if the plans of CHL president Ray Miron materialize.  Miron  confirmed that El Paso, Amarillo, Tuscon, and Albuquerque are cities under  consideration for the Western Division, which would play some interlocking  games with the Eastern Division.  Meanwhile, San Antonio and Houston are  close to being confirmed as the league's newest members.  -----   - Major League Hockey           A new hockey league with franchises throughout the United States  and Canada will begin play in the fallof 1993, officials announced  Wednesday, February 10.         Major League Hockey was founded by Roy Boe, former president of  the New York Islanders of the National Hockey League and the New York/New  Jersey Nets of the American and National Basketball associations.         According to Boe, the league will debut with six to eight teams  playing a schedule of approximately 80 games. Franchise applications have  been received from groups in Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, Denver, Detroit,  Houston, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Phoenix, San Francisco, Saskatoon, Toronto  and Worcester, Mass., Boe said.         Although the league will not raid existing leagues to stock its  rosters, Boe said it will seek the ``world's finest hockey players.''         Boe said league play will have an international flair and  discussed implementing some rules which are reminiscent of those of the  IIHF.         ``We're removing the red line, moving the goal nets forward and  eliminating all tie games,'' said Boe.         The MLH office will operate out of Stamford, Conn.  -----   - British Premier Division:    contacts:   Neil A.

Answers to some frequently asked questions:    Q: Why are the Montreal Canadiens called the Habs?  A: Most of the team during the 40-50's was made up of people who lived in  and around Montreal. Hence they were called \\\"Les Habitants\\\" (natives of  Montreal). This was then shortened to the Habs.    Q: Why is the Montreal Canadiens logo a large C with an H within it?  A: In 1914-15, the Canadiens logo consisted of C with an A within it to  signify Club Athletique Canadien (CAC). The next year, CAC no longer  existed and it was changed to what it is now to signify Club de Hockey.   Q: What is the most informative hockey publication?  A: The Hockey News is preferred by most North American hockey fans. It is  a weekly journal with up-to-date info. Phone: 800-268-7793 (Canada and US) Phone/fax: 0483 776141 (UK and rest of Europe)    Q: How does a 5-minute power-play count in the penalty killing stats in  the NHL?  A: If X goals are scored, then the team gets credit for X goals in X+1  chances.    Q: How is +/- computed in the NHL?  A: First, +/- only applies to skaters. Except for a power-play goal, when  a goal is scored, each skater on the ice for the scoring team is given a  +, and each skater on the ice for the other team is given a -. Short- handed goals do count for +/-.    Q: What is the five-hole?  A: The space between a goalie's pads. There are five major scoring zones:  (1) upper left corner of goal, (2) upper right, (3) lower left, (4) lower  right, and (5) five-hole.    Q: What is the meaning of throwing an octopus on the ice?  A: This tradition began in Detroit in the 1950's when two best-of-seven  series were required to win the Stanley Cup. Every time Detroit won a  game, an octopus with one less arm was thrown on the ice.   Q: Who was the first woman to play in an NHL game?  A: Manon Rheaume, a 20-year-old goaltender, became the first woman ever  to play in an NHL game on September 23, 1992 when she started in net for  the expansion Tampa Bay Lightning in an exhibition against the St. Louis  Blues. Rheaume played the first period before 8,223 at the 10,400-seat  Expo Hall on the Florida State Fairgrounds and allowed two goals on nine  shots. She left with the score tied 2-2, although the Lightning ultimately  lost the game, 6-4.   Q: What is the richest contract in NHL history?  A: Mario Lemieux, the superstar center of the Pittsburgh Penguins, signed  the richest contract in NHL history, a seven-year deal believed to be  worth about $42 million. Lemieux will earn between $6 million and $7  million a year, nearly twice as much as any other player in the league.   Q: Who is the new commissioner of the NHL?  A: Gary Bettman, vice president and general counsel of the National  Basketball Association, was named commissioner of the National Hockey  League, Friday, December 11, 1992. Bettman joined the NBA in 1981 as  assistant general counsel. He became the league's chief legal officer in  September of 1984. A New York resident, Bettman graduated from Cornell  University in 1974 and from New York University School of Law in 1977.   Q: How many professional hockey leagues are there in North America?  A: Six:  National, American, International, East Coast, Central and  Colonial Hockey Leagues.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------   9. Miscellaneous:    For field hockey discussions, go to the newsgroup rec.sport.hockey.field.  For skating discussions, go to the newsgroup rec.skate.    Some sites get another hockey group, called clari.sports.hockey. c.s.h  consists of the UPI feed for all UPI news articles that are related to  hockey, including game results, summaries, scores, standings, etc.  Much  of the information in the NHL team news section comes from this newsgroup.     The rec.sport.hockey Frequently Asked Questions posting is posted semi- monthly, usually on the 1st and 15th of each month, during the hockey  season.  This file was originally created by Tom Wilson, who posted it  during the 1991-92 season.  It was taken over by Mitch McGowan for the  1992-93 season.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------     Please make corrections via e-mail, indicating \\\"r.s.h FAQ\\\" as the  subject line. Feel free to start a discussion on any previously mentioned  topic (but use an appropriate subject line).   Mitch McGowan <hamlet@u.washington.edu>\",\"Most of this discussion has been between Mark Singer and David Tate, with Valentine weighing in on the same side as Dave at various times. My opinion, FWIW, to all:  Mark, age doesn't matter; ability does. I would rather have the untried rookie with great minor league numbers than the veteran who has proven himself to be average at best. I don't care if he is 15; if he plays better than what I have, I want him out there. Sandy Alomar had decent minor league numbers, grossly inflated by the PCL in general and Las Vegas in particular; he should have been projected as an average major league hitter (which is good for a catcher, I'll admit). Santiago's numbers would probably come out the same as Sandy's, but I don't have the league data from the mid-80s to check it out.  That being said, I agree with sending Lopez to Richmond, at least to start the season. As the box below shows, he has *one* minor league season in which he hit well. He has two in which he hit very, very poorly. I want to see that the 92 Lopez is real. Olson and Berryhill are not complete mediocrities; for catchers, especially NL catchers, they are essentially average hitters, with equivalent averages around .220.

Granted, I thought his behavior with McCarver last year was completely bush. Last year was the first time he ever got 300 AB in one place, so his lines are hard to read. But he has a combined 720 OPS in minor league play; with his speed is more valuable than the OPS alone indicates; and at a still young age (24), had a monster year with an 868 OPS. He has a total, major and minor, EQA of .249; above major league average, and above average for CF (which was about .240 in the NL last year). He has shown at least the potential of going into the .290s, which would make him one of the 15 best hitters in the league. He has two full seasons before reaching his \\\"prime\\\" season of 27. He should be considered as a legitimate prospect, and not as a simple side-show attraction.

It would have the plus of RocketShare and the minus of NuBus accelerators - no true boot off the accelerator, NuBus bottleneck to video and other I/O.  Apple, it seems, will not compete with third parties here -- except perhaps for not-yet-available Macs like Cyclone, where a PowerPC slot might be advertised. Look for Daystar and such to make PowerPC accelerators.  One potential problem with any accelerator, though, is that it will need a ROM companion and Apple has licensed only Radius, with Rocketshare, to use any of its proprietary code.  Apple is, between the lines, trying to let us know that PowerPC Macs will have simplified logic boards due to the magical nature of RISC and that these boards should be much cheaper to build than those in existing 68040 Macs. Perhaps, then, we'll see groundbreaking prices in Mac-logic board upgrades, much the same way we've seen much cheaper high-performance CPUs this year.  First generation PowerPCs, 98601s, will also hopefully have socketed CPUs so that they'll be chip upgradeable to 98604s a year later. This should be possible in much the same way that 486s can be pulled for clock doublers. If there is too much technical   baggage (which I doubt since the external busses are the same size/width) to do this, perhaps we can have CPU daughterboard, a la Powerbook, as standard to facilitate better CPU upgrades. This is an area where Apple has fallen far behing the Intel-based world. Perhaps catchup is in order.  By the way, last week's PC week had an excellent story on PowerPC, Pentium, MIPS R4000, DEC Alpha (the big four on the microprocessor front for the forseeable future). Worth reading for technojunkies. Also, the latest PC has a cover story on Pentium. Read it, and all the other stories about how Intel is unstoppable and preeminent right now.  Once anyone is this secure, they are due to fall. Intel's market position will never again be as dominant as it is today (especially if AMD gets the go ahead to sell its 486s this week as it appears it might). The competition from all fronts is gearing up for an awesome battle. Apple users should be excited that PowerPC, while not guaranteed dominance, is a guaranteed winner, even if its one of several.\",\"  This is an excellent question and I'll be anxious to see if there are any such cases.

But yes, you've got the idea -- the reboost is done by taking the whole shuttle up.   Somebody has to build that thruster module; it's not an off-the-shelf item.  Nor is it a trivial piece of hardware, since it has to include attitude control (HST's own is not strong enough to compensate for things like thruster imbalance), guidance (there is no provision to feed gyro data from HST's own gyros to an external device), and separation (you don't want it left attached afterward, if only to avoid possible contamination after the telescope lid is opened again).  You also get to worry about whether the lid is going to open after the reboost is done and HST is inaccessible to the shuttle (the lid stays closed for the duration of all of this to prevent mirror contamination from thrusters and the like).  The original plan was to use the Orbital Maneuvering Vehicle to do the reboost.  The OMV was planned to be a sort of small space tug, well suited to precisely this sort of job.  Unfortunately, it was costing a lot to develop and the list of definitely-known applications was relatively short, so it got cancelled.\",\"        Depends on what you mean by classy.

I think that our major difference in opinion is on the legitimacy of Sevres. First, thattreaty was signed by the Ottoman Empire therefore legally it does not bind the  Republic of Turkey. The new independence movement (which by the way, is not the same as the Young Turks) naturally rejected it out of hand. to say that we  should accept because the Germans did theirs is absurd. We saw what the cosequences of such harsh treaties were in Hitler. Second, the Sevres treaty was even  worse than Versailles. It divided the Ottoman Empire in to several influence  zones, had the capital occupied, the economy under Allied control, the army di minished to nothing but a police force, in short a country in name only. I'd wonder if you would like to live under such conditions. And for the record, I donot feel sorry for the soldiers killed in IZMIR harbour.

The story is this: I bought a car out of state, and I'm trying to get the safety inspection in Pennsylvania. The problem is that the car has  aftermarket tint on all windows except the windshield. The tint is rather weak, and you can clearly see the inside of the car through the tint.  The inspection garage said that they won't pass it unless I get a waiver from the state police. So I went to the state police - the officer told me that aftermarket tint is illegal, and I can get a waiver only for a pre-84 car or for a medical reason. I asked him to show me the section of the vehicle code that says it's illegal.  He showed it to me and the paraghaph said that you can't have tint, if you can't see the inside of the car because of the tint. When I told him that you can in fact see the inside very well, he shut the book and said \\\"It's just illegal, and in fact we can have someone give you a ticket for it right now.\\\" Well, won't argue with that...  Since the vehicle code says it's OK as long as you can see through the tint, I'd like to keep it (I'll re-read the vehicle code in the library).  I'd also like to get some sort of paper from the police that says it's OK, so I can get the inspection, and so that I won't get in trouble for the tint later on. I also wouldn't mind registering a complaint against that officer - he really pissed me off.  So does anyone have any experience getting that sort of a paper from the police, especially in Pennsylvania? Does anyone have any experience registering a complaint against an officer?

I would echo that question.  I'm not trying to be    contentious.  But assuming that the Pope has universal jurisdiction    and authority, what authority do you rely upon for your decisions?    What prevents me from choosing ANY doctrine I like and saying that    Papal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time?    This is especially true, since Councils of Bishops have basically    stood by the Pope.  The ultimate question is the traditional theology of the Church.  This is the *only* thing that it is possible to resist a Pope for: his departure from the traditional doctrine of the Church.  If commands from *any* authority conflict with Tradition, the commands must be disobeyed.  My own view on this is that this conflict could only happen in a major way.  God would never allow a hair-splitting situation to develop; it would be too complex for people to figure out.  I don't view the present situation in the Church as anything extremely complicated. Run through a list of what has happened in the last 30 years in the Catholic Church, and any impartial observer will be aghast.     It appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter is    disagreements over what is tradition and Tradition, and also over    authority and discipline.    The problems stem from a general widespread ignorance of the Catholic Faith, in my opinion.  Most Catholics know about zilch about the Catholic Faith; this leaves them wide open for destruction by erring bishops.  It's basically the Reformation part II.  There is not even a question in my mind that in some respects the shards of the Catholic Church are currently being trampled upon by the Catholic hierarchy.  I could go on listing shocking things for an hour, probably.  Take the situation in Campos, Brazil, for example.  I'm reading a book on what happened there after Vatican Council II.  The bishop, Antonio de Castro-Mayer, never introduced all the changes that followed in the wake of Vatican II.  He kept the traditional Mass, the same old catechisms, etc.  He made sure the people knew their faith, the Catholic theology of obedience, what Modernism was, etc.  He innoculated the people against what was coming.  Well, one day the order came from Rome for his retirement.  It came when the Pope was sick.  Bishop de Castro-Mayer waited until the Pope recovered, then inquired whether this command was what the Pope really wanted, or something that some Liberal had commanded in his absence. The Pope confirmed the decision.  So the good bishop retired.  The injustice that followed was completely incredible.  A new bishop was installed.  He proceeded to expel most of bishop de Castro-Mayer's clergy from their churches, because they refused to celebrate the New Mass.  The new bishop would visit a parish, and celebrate a New Mass. The people would promptly walk out of the church en masse.  The bishop was *enraged* by this.  He usually resorted to enlisting the help of the secular authorities to eject the priest from the church.  The priests would just start building new churches; the people were completely behind them.  The old parishes had the New Mass, as the bishop desired -- and virtually no parishioners.  The prime motivation for all this was completely illegal, according to canon law.  No priest can be penalized in any way for saying the traditional Mass, because of legislation enacted by Pope Saint Pius V. Nor is there any obligation to say the New Mass.  During all this process, the people of Campos, not just private individuals, but including civil authorities, were constantly sending petitions and letters to Rome to do something about the new Modernist bishop.  NOTHING was ever done; no help ever arrived from Rome. Eventually 37 priests were kicked out, and about 40,000 people.     My question to the supporters of SSPX is this:    Is there ANY way that your positions with respect to church reforms   could change and be conformed to those of the Pope? (assuming that   the Pope's position does not change and that the leaders of SSPX   don't jointly make such  choice.)     If not, this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority.    If I adopt the view that \\\"I'm NOT wrong, I CAN'T be wrong, and    there's NO WAY I'll change my mind, YOU must change yours\\\", that    I've either left the Catholic Church or it has left me.  If the Pope defines certain things ex cathedra, that would be the end of the controversy.  That process is all very well understood in Catholic theology, and anyone who doesn't go along with it is an instant non-Catholic.  The problem here is that people do not appreciate what is going on in the Catholic world.  If they knew the Faith, and what our bishops are doing, they would be shocked!     We sould argue from now until the Second Coming about what the \\\"real\\\"    traditional teaching of the Church is.  If this were a simple matter    East and West would not have been separated for over 900 years.  This isn't the case in the Catholic Church.  There is a massive body of traditional teaching.  The Popes of the last 150 years are especially relevant.  There is no question at all what the traditional doctrine is.     I thought that the teaching magisterieum of the church did not allow    error in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term.`    I may be wrong here, I'm not Roman Catholic. :-)  That's heresy, more or less.  Although they have done a great job since the Reformation, the last 30 years have seen so many errors spread that it's pitiful.  Infallibility rests in the Pope, and in the Church as a whole.  In the short term, a Pope, or large sections of the Church can go astray.  In fact, that's what usually happens during a major heresy: large sections of the Church go astray.  (The Pope historically has been much more reliable.)  Everything will always come back in the long run.     What would be the effect of a Pope making an ex cathedra statement    regarding the SSPX situation?  Would it be honored?  If not, how    do you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility?    Again, I'm not trying to be contentions, I'm trying to understand.    Since I'm Orthodox, I've got no real vested interest in the outcome,    one way or the other.  Yes, it would be honored.  Infallibility is infallibility.  But what is he going to define?  That the New Mass is a better expression of the Catholic Faith than the old?  That sex education in the Catholic schools is wonderful?  That all religions are wonderful except for that professed by the Popes prior to Vatican II?     It does if the command was legitimate.  SSPX does not view the    Pope's commands as legitimate.  Why?  This is a VERY slippery slope.\",\"I want to create a single-line Text widget for entering a small amount of text.

No.  Computer speed is only partly dependent of processor/clock speed. Memory system speed play a large role as does video system speed and I/O speed.  As processor clock rates go up, the speed of the memory system becomes the greatest factor in the overall system speed.  If you have a 50MHz processor, it can be reading another word from memory every 20ns.  Sure, you can put all 20ns memory in your computer, but it will cost 10 times as much as the slower 80ns SIMMs.  And roughly, the 68040 is twice as fast at a given clock speed as is the 68030. \",\"Actually I wasn't too surprised, since I bought it with the rust.

The one most obviously applicable to cryptography (key selection) is to be able to specify the \\\"similarity\\\" of matches in the data.  For example say you make up a password/phrase of \\\"qimwe7l\\\". Of course you rightly suspect that this key itself is not in any dictionary or word list.  But how *close* is it to en entry that could be varied by some \\\"crack\\\" program to brute-force search for it?  You use agrep to find out.  Looking with argument for none, one or two errors, no matches.  Good so far.  But   agrep -3 \\\"qimwe7l\\\" bigwordandphraselist  finds that the pattern \\\"qimwe7l\\\" is too close to the pattern \\\"imsel\\\" (part of \\\"himself\\\" and a host of others), to be of any cryptographic value as a key.  An error of level two corresponds to a simple transposition of letters like \\\"teh\\\" for \\\"the\\\".  A minimally acceptable password would have to pass as *least* level 3 in order not immediately ruled-out as even a remote possibility of being a good password. (In real cryptographic use, my personal passphrases clear at *least* level 8 on my rather large [>80 meg] word and phrase lists.)   And for searching for key words in human-typed data (lots o' typos) the tool is unexcelled.  For example, For example, say I want to find out what people think about Gibson's SF book \\\"Neuromancer\\\" in the huge SF-Lover's archives. Even with an error distance specification as small as of \\\"1\\\" I will find all those people who think the title was \\\"Necromancer\\\" or other common typos.  Why miss anything?  Also, the program can look for up to 30,000 patterns IN PARALLEL at Boyer-Moore (sublinear) speeds.  Great for a NSA wannabe to look for your name, terrorists names, special Tagalog or religious words, etc. in the news or e-mail spool directories.  You can even search for ciphertext by using, say, 30,000 random three-byte combinations and eliminate all texts that don't score the X chi-square 'birthday' hits on message size Y.  You think some crypto-terrorist is try to foil you by changing the pattern on you?  No problem.  Try agrep -p NSA to find NSA, National Security Agency, NSecAg, No Such Agency, National Scrabble Association, N*S*A, etc.  You can also specify \\\"fixed\\\" areas: looking for license plate XYZ123 when you know that the letters are correct, you might say:  agrep -2 <XYZ>123 licenseplatedatabase  will find all plates starting with XYZ with up to two errors (addition, substitution, deletion) in the number area.  You can also \\\"weight\\\" the relative \\\"cost\\\" for substiutions, additions, or deletion errors.  For example, when searching DNA patterns for a particular protein combination, you might know that some kinds of damage cause the \\\"A\\\" nucelotide to drop out more than other errors... you could adjust for this bias by setting -Dc where you set the \\\"deletion cost\\\" to count as \\\"c\\\" errors.  A steganographic use (I even used \\\"agrep -2 \\\"<steg>eograp\\\" E\\\" just now to find the correct spelling!) would be to intentionally introduce errors of a certain type and magnitude into a plaintext and then later recover the orginal it via an agrep pipe.  Lots of possibilities here when only outlaws can have ciphertext...  Also with agrep's powerful extraction options it makes it easy to abstract the \\\"hits\\\" into a useful form.  For example,  agrep -d \\\"^From\\\" 'PGP;(passphrase|Zimmerman|NSA)'  says output the entire mail record, delimited by 'From' that contains 'PGP' and contains either 'passphrase', 'Zimmerman', or 'NSA'.  And agrep has been measured an order-of-magnitude faster than the second-best similarity tool publicly available.  As usual, I will be glad to e-mail the source and docs to those who reqest them by e-mail IF they cannot do an anonymous FTP.  Get this now. It is too powerful to stay in the hands of the NSA.

Science has its basis in observable fact.   I'd say that what one chooses to observe and how the observation is interpreted and what significance it's given depends a great deal on the values of the observer. Science is a human activity and as such, is subject to the same potential for distortion as any other human activity. The myth that scientists are above moral influence or ethical concern, that their knowledge can be abstacted whole and pure from nature untainted by the biases of the scientist, is nonsense.  Bill  : If one is to argue for objective values (in a moral sense) then one must : first start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective. Considering : the meaning of the word \\\"objective\\\" I doubt that this will ever happen.  : So, back to the original question:  : And objective morality is.....?  This may be an unfortunate choice of words, almost self-contradictory. Objective in the sense used here means something immutable and absolute while morality describes the behavior of some group of people. The first term is all inclusive, the second is specific. The concept supposedly described may have meaning however.  If there is a God as described by the Christians (for instance), then He has existence apart from and independent of humankind; His existence is outside of our frame of reference (reality). If this being declares a thing to be so, it is -necessarily- so since He has defined Himself as omnipotent and, if His claims are to be believed, He is at least omnipotent relative to us. God is intrinsically self-defined and all reality is whatever He says it is - in an objective sense. If God determines a standard of conduct, that standard is objective. If human beings are held accountable for their conformance to that standard while permitted to ignore it, they substitute a relative morality or mode of conduct, giving the term morality a nebulous, meaningless sense that can be argued about by those pretending to misunderstand. The standard is objective and the conduct required to meet that standard is therefore objectively determined. Just because it is convenient to pretend that the term morality is infinitely malleable, doesn't mean that the objective standard itself doesn't exist. Morality has come to mean little more than a cultural norm, or the preferred conduct of \\\"decent\\\" people, making it seem subjective, but it is derived from an absolute, objective, standard. Ironically, this objective standard is in perfect accord with our true nature (according to Christianity at least), yet is condemned as being contrary to human nre, oppressive and severe.

Maddison and Hamilton were both studying existing forms of government for several years before they wrote the federalist papers. That the US system is based to a considerable degree on the UK model is pretty widely accepted. At the time there was no other major country with a representative body. The French plebicite had been suppressed for 140 years and its restoration eight years later would mark the start of the French revolution.   After the UK system the major influences were the Dutch system and of course the classical systems. Nobody seriously suggests that Rome or Greece were  models though because the political systems of both countries were acknowleged disasters. The main lesson learnt from Greece was that unless a federal state was constructed a war would be inevitable. The Greek democracies were always fighting amongst themselves which is how Rome managed to invade. Had the federal consitution been rejected the new Roman empire in the shape of Britain would quite certainly have reabsorbed much of the colonies in due course. Moreover the states would have been at each others throats as soon as the Louisiana purchase situation arose during the Napoleonic period. \",\"Since everyone else seems to be running wild with predictions, I've decided to add my own fuel to the fire: They might seem a bit normal, but there are a few (albeit, small) surprises.

The structure  of the US government does try to combat this tendency to some extent, but  fighting entropy is always a losing battle.  Most people would rather have  comfort than freedom.  The paradox is that you can't really have the former,  in the long term, unless you have the latter.  One of the reasons that I probably come across to some people as a weird  cross between a libertarian and an \\\"establishment tool\\\" is that I end up  taking an utterly pragmatic view of government.  I don't get up in arms when  the government fails to protect the interests of the people, because in my  lifetime it never has--therefore, I have no expectation that it will.    As a result, I protect my own interests rather than expecting the government  to be \\\"fair\\\".  I will use strong cryptography when I think it is needed,  whether or not it is legal at the time.  Same thing with anything else the  government would rather not see in private hands--that's their problem.   What's important to me is using the right tool for the job.  If it's legal,  so much the better.  If it is not, but does not violate my (very strong)  sense of personal ethics, I will use it anyway as long I think it is worth  it.  Expecting the government to actually protect the interests of its  citizens, except by accident, is utter folly.  Even Jefferson, one of the  major architects of the American system of government, figured that in a  couple hundred years it would become so corrupt and self-serving that it  would be time dismantle it and try again, by revolution if necessary.  I  agree, and while I don't go around trying to spark one, I'll certainly  participate if it happens when I'm around.  There is a reason I am such a  strong supporter of individual rights while being so cynical about politics.   I've already written off politics.  And yes, this may get me in trouble some day.

Well, think again.  Sometimes the only real support out there is what Apple computer users can give to each other.  For another example, read on:  In the March 15th issue of _MacWeek_, Ric Ford described a two-year effort by Liam Breck to document and bring to Apple's attention a problem with certain defective mice.  At random, the switches on these mice \\\"stick\\\" in the down position until clicked a second time, apparently regardless of the machine they are used with or the system software involved. Most of the reported problem mice were manufactured in Malaysia and have an FCC ID of BCGA65431. You'll recognize this \\\"sticky button\\\" symptom immediately if you have such a mouse: the problem is intermittent, but it's not subtle.  Liam Breck recently gave up trying to document this problem, and instead  suggested that people contact Apple's Customer Assistance Center directly (_MacWeek_ 4/5/93 p. 64). When I called Apple on March 23rd and described my defective mouse, I was eventually given a case number (F83Y) and told Apple would replace this mouse even though it is a few months out of warranty.  After waiting for three weeks, I called back today wondering where my new mouse was. This time, I was told that Apple had decided the serial number on my mouse (MB13831FC25) is not within the (undisclosed) range Apple is willing to replace, and there is nothing I can do about it.  Nothing, that is, unless enough people complain about this problem to make it worth Apple's while to fix or replace the entire lot of defective mice. Please, if you have one of these mice, I NEED YOUR HELP! Don't assume you know what causes the problem (there are _lots_ of theories) and start hacking around inside your hundred-dollar mouse. Instead, let Apple do it. Please take five minutes to CALL APPLE RIGHT NOW at:                    United States      1-800-776-2333                   Canada             800-665-2775                   UK and Europe      33-1-49-01-49-01                   Australia          61-2-452-8000                   Japan and Pacific  81-3-5411-8500  If the number isn't toll-free, call collect.  Describe the problem and ask for a replacement mouse.  Even if they refuse, insist that they register the details of your case, including your mouse's serial number.  Be firm.  Network managers and user-group leaders especially, please query your user bases. Everyone ask your friends and colleagues.  Please don't send mail to me or post yet another \\\"sticky-button\\\" report, CALL APPLE DIRECTLY!  If enough victims take the trouble to report this well-known problem, Apple will eventually be forced to respond.  If Apple continues to find it easy to stone-wall on this issue, don't expect them to offer support when the next, potentially more serious Mac defect is uncovered.\",\":  : Hello, :  : I recently tried to print some envelopes using AmiPro 3.0 with my : Deskjet 500 printer, and I seem to be having a problem.

Remarks by President Clinton to NCAA Division I Champion Hockey Team April 19; Q&A Following  To: National Desk  Contact: White House Office of the Press Secretary, 202-456-2100     WASHINGTON, April 19 -- Following is a transcript of remarks by President Clinton to the University of Maine \\\"Black Bears\\\" NCAA Division I hockey champions:                             The Rose Garden   9:58 A.M. EDT       THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning ladies and gentlemen.  It's an honor for me to welcome the University of Maine Black Bears, the winner of the NCAA Division I hockey national championship to the Rose Garden and the White House.  I understand from Senator Mitchell that this is the first team from the University of Maine every to win a national championship.  And we're glad to have them here.       I'm inspired not only by how the team pulled together to win the championship, but how the entire state pulled together to cheer them onto victory.       Coming from a state that is also relatively small in size, but also filled with pride and tradition and community, I can understand how the people of Maine must feel about the Black Bears. In our state people are still talking about the time we won the Orange Bowl over the number one ranked football team, and that was back in 1978.  I'm sure that 15 years from now, the people of Maine will as proud of this team as they are today.       You know, in my state football is a slightly more popular sport than hockey.  We don't have a lot of ice.  (Laughter.) But after spending three months getting banged around in this town, I can understand a little more about hockey than I did before I came here.  Hockey is a tough game.  It's a hard-hitting sport.  It does have one virtue though, there's a penalty for delay of game.  I wish we had that rule in the Senate.  (Laughter.)       In government as in hockey, leadership is important.  In the United States Senate, our team has a great captain, the Majority Leader and the senior Senator from Maine, George Mitchell; junior Senator -- Cohen looks so young, I can't imagine.  (Laughter.)  I'm actually bitter about Senator Cohen because he looks so much younger than me.       On your hockey team, the captain Jim Montgomery has done a great job.  He scored the winning goal late in the championship game, leading you to a come-from-behind victory -- something else I know a little bit about.       Sport brings out the best in individuals and in teams and in communities.  I share the pride that Senator Mitchell and Senator Cohen and Congressman Andrews and all the people of Maine must feel for the Black Bears who have shown us all how to play as a team, how to bring out the best in one another, and how to come from behind.       I think it's important, as I ask young people from around America who have achieved outstanding things in working together, to come here to the White House to be recognized and appreciated by their country, to remember that those kinds of values and those kinds of virtues need to be ingrained in all of us for all of our lives.       We now have another role model, and I'm glad to have them here today.  (Applause.)       (The President is presented with team jersey.) (Applause.)       THE PRESIDENT:  That's great.  I love it.  It's beautiful. (Applause.)       (The President is presented with an autographed stick.)       THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  That's great.  (Applause.)                               * * * * * *       Q  Mr. President, did you authorize the move on Waco this morning, sir?       THE PRESIDENT:  I was aware of it.  I think the Attorney General made the decision.  And I think I should refer all questions to her and to the FBI.       Q  Did you have any instructions for her as to how it should be executed?       THE PRESIDENT:  No, they made the tactical decisions. That was their judgment, the FBI.       Q  Is this a raid?       THE PRESIDENT:  And I will -- I want to refer you to -- talk to the Attorney General and the FBI.  I knew it was going to be done, but the decisions were entirely theirs, all the tactical decisions.       Q  What did you and Senator Mitchell talk about this morning?       Q  Any chance for that stimulus package?       THE PRESIDENT:  Senator Mitchell ought to pay my quarter.  (Laughter.)  I was in there -- (laughter).       SENATOR MITCHELL:  You have to pay that quarter.       THE PRESIDENT:  I was ready.  (Laughter.)  Senator Mitchell, he's worth a quarter any day.       Q  Any chance for your bill, sir?       THE PRESIDENT:  We talked about what was going to happen this week in the Senate and about what other meetings we're going to have for the rest of the week.  We only had about five minutes to talk.  And we agreed we'd get back together later, around noon, and talk some more.       Q  Senator Dole said over the weekend that your compromise is no compromise.       THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I know he did, but, look, Senator Dole and a lot of the other Republicans now in the Senate voted for the same kind of thing for Ronald Reagan in 1983; and our research indicates that a majority of them over time voted for a total of 28 emergency spending measures totalling over $100 billion when Reagan and Bush were President, in those administrations.  And many of those purposes were not nearly as worthy as putting the American people back to work.  I don't want to go back and revisit every one, but you   can do it.  You can look at the research there.  So this position they're taking is not credible.  We have a very tough five-year deficit reduction plan.  All these costs are covered during that time and then some.  And the very people that are saying this has all got to be paid for don't have much of a history on which to base their position.  They've got 12 years of vote for stimulus measures of this kind that had very little to with putting the American people back to work.  So I think we've got a chance to work it out, and I'm hopeful. We'll see what happens today and tomorrow.  I'm feeling pretty good about it.       THE PRESS:  Thank you                                   END       10:10 A.M.

The moderator of the firearms-politics mailing list, Karl Kleinpaste, has agreed to set up an anonymous ftp archive directory for RKBA related information.  This directory can be used for things like articles by Kates, Wright, Tonso, Levinson, Supreme Court Decisions, the RIA vs US decision, copies of legislation, and so on.  It's not meant to be for the discussions that normally appear here.  So, in the future if you're looking for something check there first and then ask here.  Instructions:  Short version for techies:  The site is godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu.  Place contributions into the directory /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba.  The ftp commands get, put, mget, or mput should work.  Give the command \\\"type binary\\\" to be sure files are transferred correctly.  Your files will be moved to the rkba directory.  To get a file use the commands get or mget.  I will maintain an index which you should get first to check if the file you want to read or write already is archived.  Long version for non-techies:  In order for you to use this archive your computer must be on the Internet.  To connect to the archive site run the command:   ftp godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu  If that doesn't work you cannot use this archive.  If the ftp command is successful you'll get this prompt asking you for a login:  Name (godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu:lvc):  Instead of lvc your initials will appear.  Answer this prompt with:   ftp  Next you'll get this prompt asking your for your e-mail address:   Guest login ok, send e-mail address as password:  I would enter:   l.v.cipriani@att.com  You'll enter your own e-mail address.  You'll get these lines or similar as output:   Remote system is UNIX.  Using binary mode to transfer files.  Next, the command prompt is printed:   ftp>   If you do not get the line \\\"Using binary mode to transfer files.\\\" Run the command:   type binary  Now you're logged in to the archive machine.  There are many directories on this machine  but the two you are concerned with are   /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba and  /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/incoming  There are subdirectories to the rkba directory, those are discussed below.  When you login to the system your directory is /usr0/anon.  To retreive files change your current directory to the rkba directory with the command:   cd /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba or  cd pub/firearms/politics/rkba  To submit files change your directory to the incoming directory with the command:   cd /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/incoming or  cd pub/firearms/politics/incoming  Once you do this you'll get another ftp> prompt asking you to enter another command.  To find the names of the existing files in the directory you are in run the command:   ls -l  This will produce something like:  total 6021 -r--r--r--  1 karl          6932 Jun 16  1992 DMN_Gratia_CCP -r--r--r--  1 karl         69149 Apr  5 19:20 INDEX -r--r--r--  1 karl         18965 Jun 16  1992 Knox_AW_lies -r--r--r--  1 karl         10930 Apr 30  1992 S361 -r--r--r--  1 karl          8958 Jun 16  1992 WSJ_Crimestrike -r--r--r--  1 karl          2649 Jan 13 18:33 academia-bias -r--r--r--  1 karl           935 Mar 22 22:38 academics -r--r--r--  1 karl         36079 Aug  4  1992 aclu ... and so on ...  Each line corresponds to one file.  Reading right to left, the fields are the file name, the last modification date of the file, the size of the file in bytes, and some permission fields which you do not need to be concerned with.  To get a file run the command \\\"get\\\" followed by the name of the file you want, for example:   get INDEX or  get noduty  After the file is transfered to your machine a message like this:   Transfer complete.  19580 bytes received in 5 seconds (4 Kbytes/s)  You can repeat the get command for every file you want to retreive. You can use the mget command to retreive multiple files.  If the file you want is in a subdirectory, for example, congress/103rd/HR1025 you should change your directory to the appropriate subdirectory first and then retrieve it:   cd congress/103rd  get HR1025  Once you're finished you can log off with the command:   quit  If you have a file you want to contribute the procedure is a little different.  First of all you should find out if the file already exists, so get a copy of the index file with the procedure above and look it over to make sure you wouldn't repeat an entry.  The index will have a description of each of the files in the rkba directory.  For example:  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- File: whitemanslaw  White Man's Law by William R. Tonso, from the December 1985 Reason magazine ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Once you've determined you won't be duplicating an entry, login and change to the incoming directory command (see above).  Once you are in the incoming directory use the command:   put file_name  In this case:   put whitemanslaw  Again there'll be a \\\"Transfer complete, so many bytes transfered in so many seconds\\\" message.  Now your file is on the archive machine.  Another thing to watch out for is duplicate file /names/.  Be sure there isn't a file in the incoming directory that is called the same as the file you want to write.  If you use the same name you'll overwrite the previous file [or you'll get an error message].  Your file may have to be renamed if there is a conflict with a file by the same name in the rkba directory.  Once your file is in the incoming directory send me an entry for the INDEX file and I will add it to the file.  If you cannot use anonymous ftp and would still like to contribute a file email the file to me and I'll take care of the rest.  If you submit a file and do not notify me it may be removed, so be sure to let me know first.  If you have any questions feel free to ask me. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- --  Larry Cipriani -- l.v.cipriani@att.com     \",\" Every bit as fast as a dirtbike, in the right terrain.

What element of surprise?  In the paragraph preceding this   one, he said \\\"... the special agents announced who they were and their purpose   for being at the compound\\\", which was to serve the federal warrant.  No element   of surprise was even needed for that.    No, the element of surprise that they lost was that needed for a preemptive   first strike, without warning.

Jim -- jmd@handheld.com\",\"  Brian K., guess what?  You missed the point.  On a scale from cold to hot, you are at 0 degrees Kelvin.   Then as you understand it, what is it?   Yes.  I agree with that.  But what does that have to do with Jesus? Punishment you say?  Jesus did not regard his death as punishment.    Good.  I wouldn't either--not the way you understand it.     Ask Jesus himself.  He himself said why in John 12:23-32.  It isn't a mystery to anyone and there certainly is no need for a persuasive argument.   Read Jesus's own reply to your question.  Jesus gives more reasons in John 16:7.  But one obvious reason why Jesus died, (and as with everything else, it has nothing do with his punishment) was that he could rise to life again--so that we would \\\"stop doubting and believe\\\" (John 21:27).  The fact that Jesus rose from the dead is my hope that I too will rise from the dead.  It is an obvious point.  Do not overlook it. Without this obvious point, I would have no hope and my faith would be vanity.  Why did Jesus suffer in his death?  Again, ask Jesus.  Jesus says why in John 15:18-25.   That's no mystery either.  \\\"The world hates him without reason.\\\"  It is a direct proclamation of how far we humans botch things up and thus, how much we need a Saviour.\",\" Pardon me?   *I* am trying to apply human terms to non-humans?  I think there must be some confusion here.   I'm the guy who is saying that if animal behaviour is instinctive then it does *not* have any moral sugnificance.   How does refusing to apply human terms to animals get turned into applying human terms?   I'm sure you do think this, if you say so.   How about trying to convince me?   I've offered, four times, I think, to accept your definition if you allow me to ascribe moral significence to the orbital motion of the planets.   Ah, the law of \\\"silly\\\" and \\\"less silly\\\".   what Mr Livesey finds  intuitive is \\\"silly\\\" but what Mr Schneider finds intuitive is \\\"less  silly\\\".  Now that's a devastating argument, isn't it.\",\"GREAT post Martin.  Very informative, well-balanced, and humanitarian without neglecting the need for scientific rigor.   (Cross-posted to alt.psychology.personality since some personality typing will be discussed at the beginning - Note: I've set all followups to sci.med since most of my comments are more sci.med oriented and I'm sure most of the replies, if any, will be med-related.)     They are just responding in their natural way:  Hyper-Choleric Syndrome (HCS). Oops, that is not a recognized \\\"illness\\\" in the psychological community, better not say that since it therefore must not, and never will, exist.  :^)  Actually, it is fascinating that a disproportionate number of physicians will type out as NT (for those not familiar with the Myers-Briggs system, just e-mail me and I'll send a summary file to you).  In the general population, NT's comprise only about 12% of the population, but among physicians it is much much higher (I don't know the exact percentage - any help here a.p.p.er's?)  One driving characteristic of an NT, especially an NTJ, is their obvious choleric behavior (driver, type A, etc.) - the extreme emotional need to control, to lead, and/or to be the best or the most competent.  If they are also extroverted, they are best described as \\\"Field Marshalls\\\".  This trait is very valuable and essential in our society - we need people who want to lead, to strive to overcome the elements, to seek and thirst for knowledge, to raise the level of competency, etc.  The great successes in science and technology are in large part due to the vision (an N trait) and scientifically- minded approach (T trait) of the NT personality (of course, the other types and temperaments have their own positive contributions as well).  However, when the NT person has self-image challenges, the \\\"dark-side\\\" of this personality type usually comes out, which should be obvious to all.  A physician who is a strong NT and who has not learned to temper their temperament will be extremely business-like (lack of empathy or feeling), and is very compelled to have total control over their patient (the patient must be obedient to their diagnosis and prescription without question).  I've known many M.D.'s of this temperament and suffice to say I don't oblige them with a followup visit, no matter how competent I think they are (and they usually are very competent from a knowledge viewpoint since that is an extreme drive of theirs - to know the most, to know it all).  Maybe we need more NF doctor's.  :^)  Enough on this subject - let's move on to candida bloom.    You've helped me already by your post.  Of course, I believe that I have been misdiagnosed on the net as suffering from 'anal retentivitis', but being the phlegmatic I am, maybe I was just a little too harsh on a few people myself in past posts.  Let's all try to raise the level of this discussion above the level of anal effluent.    In my well-described situation (in prior posts), I definitely was immune stressed.  Blood tests showed my vitamin A levels were very low.  My sinuses were a mess - no doubt the mucosal lining and the cilia were heavily damaged. I also was on antibiotics 15 times in 4 years!  In the end, even two weeks of Ceftin did not work and I had confirmed diagnoses of a chronic bacterial infection of the sinuses via cat-scans, mucus color (won't get into the details), and other symptoms.  Three very traditional ENT's made this diagnosis (I did not have any cultures done, however, because of the difficulty of doing this right and because my other symptoms clearly showed a bacterial infection).  Enough of this background (provided to help you understand where I was when I make comments about my Sporanox anti-fungal therapy below).   The first question I have is this.  Can fungus penetrate a little way into poor mucus membrane tissue, maybe via hyphae, thus causing symptoms, without being considered 'systemic' in the classic sense?  It is sort of an inbetween infection.    I was concerned, too, because of the toxicity of vitamin A.  My doctor, after my blood tests, put me on 75,000 IU of vitamin A for one week only, then dropped it down to 25,000 IU for the next couple of weeks.  I also received zinc and other supplementation, since all of these interrelate in fairly complex ways as my doctor explained (he's one of those 'evil' orthomolecular specialists).  I had a blood test three weeks later and vitamin A was normal, he then stopped me on all vitamin A (except for some in a multi-vitamin) supplement), and made sure that I maintain a 50,000 IU/day of beta carotene. Call me carrot face.  :^)  Hopefully, Elaine's doctor will take a similar, careful approach and to all supplements.  I'm even reevaluating some supplements I'm taking, for example, niacin in fairly large dosages, 1 gram/day, which Steve Dyer had good information about on sci.med.nutrition.  If niacin only has second-order improvement in symptomatic relief of my sinus allergies, then it probably is not worth taking such a large dose long-term and risking liver damage.    Though I do now believe, based on my successful therapy with Sporanox, that I definitely had some excessive growth of fungus (unknown species) in my sinuses, I still want to ask the question:  have there been any studies that demonstrate candida \\\"blooms\\\" in the sinuses with associated sinus irritation (sinusitis/rhinitis)?  (My sinus irritation reduced significantly after one week of Sporanox and no other new treatments were implemented during this time - I did not have any noticeable GI track problems before starting on Sporanox, but some for a few days after which then went away - considered normal).  BTW, my doctor dug out one of his medical reference books (sorry, can't remember which one), and found an obscure comment dating back into the 1950's which stated that people can develop contained (non-lethal or non-serious) aspergillis infestations (aspergiliosis) of the sinuses leading to sinus inflammation symptoms.  I'll have to dig out that reference again since it is relevant to this discussion.    My doctor tested me (I believe a RAST or RAST similar test) for allergic response to specificially Candida albicans, and I showed a strong positive. Another question, would everybody show the same strong positive so this test is essentially useless?  And, assuming it is true that Candida can grow part-way into the mucus membrane tissue, and the concentration exceeds a  threshold amount, could not a person who tests as having an allergy to Candida definitely develop allergic symptoms, such as mucus membrane irritation due to the body's allergic response?  As I said in an earlier post, one does not need to be a rocket scientist, or have a M.D. degree or a  Ph.D. in biochemistry to see the plausibility of this hypothesis.  BTW, and I'll repost this again.  Dr. Ivker, in his book, \\\"Sinus Survival\\\", has routinely given, before anything else, Nizoral (a pre-Sporanox systemic anti-fungal, not as safe and not as good as Sporanox) to his new chronic sinusitis patients IF they have been on antibiotics four or more times in the last two years.  He claims that out of 2000 or so patients, well over 90% notice some relief of sinus inflammation and other symptoms, but it doesn't cure it by any means, implying the so-called yeast/fungus infection is not the primary cause, but a later complication.  He's also found that nystatin, whether taken internally, or put into a sinus spray, does not help.  This implies (of course assuming that excessive yeast/fungus bloom is aggravating the sinus inflammation) that the yeast/fungus has grown partway into the tissue since nystatin will not kill yeast/fungus other than by direct contact - it is not absorbed into the blood stream.  Again, I admit, lots of 'ifs', and 'implies', which doesn't please the hard-core NT who has to have the double-blind study or it's a non-issue, but one has to start with some plausible hypothesis/explanation, a strawman, if you will.    This brings up an interesting observation used by those who will deny and reject any and all aspects of the 'yeast hypothesis' until the appropriate studies are done.  And that is if you can't observe or culture the yeast \\\"bloom\\\" in the gut or sinus, then there's no way to diagnose or even recognize the disease.  And I know they realize that it is virtually impossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that cannot be easily observed since candida is everywhere in the body.  It's a real Catch-22.  Another Catch-22:  Those who totally reject the 'yeast hypothesis' say that no studies have been done (actually studies have been done, but if it's not up to a certain standard then it is, from their perspective, a non-study which should not even be considered).  I agree that the appropriate studies should be done, and that will take big $ to do it right.  However, in order to convince the funding agencies in these austere times to open their wallets, you literally have to give them evidence, and the only acceptable evidence to compete with other proposals is paradoxically to do almost the exact study needed funding.  That is, you have to do 90% of the study before you even get funding (as a scientist at a National Lab, I'm very aware of this for the smaller funded projects).  I'm afraid that even if Dr. Ivker and 100 other doctors got together, pooled their practice's case histories and anecdotes into a compelling picture, and approach the funding agencies, they would get nowhere, even if they were able to publish their statistical results.  It is obvious from the comments by some of the doctors here is that they have *decided* excessive yeast colonization in the gut or sinuses leading to noticeable non-lethal symptoms does not exist, and is not even a tenable hypothesis, so any amount of case histories or compiled anecdotal evidence to the contrary will never change their mind, and not only that, they would also oppose the needed studies because in their minds it's a done issue -  excessive yeast growth leading to diffuse allergic symptoms does not, will not, and cannot exist.  Period.  Kind of tough to dialog with those who hold such a viewpoint.  Kind of reminds me of Lister...    Aren't there also other nutrients necessary to the proper working of the sinus mucus membranes and cilia?    Again, the evidence from mycological studies indicate that many yeast/fungus species can grow hyphae (\\\"roots\\\") into deep tissue, similar to mold growing in bread.  You can continue to kill the surface, such as nystatin does, but you can't kill that which is deeper in the tissue without using a systemic anti-fungal such as itraconazole (Sporanox) or some of the older ones such as Nizoral which are more toxic and not as effective.  This is why, as has been pointed out by recent studies (sent to me by a doctor I've been in e-mail contact with - thanks), that nystatin is not effective in the long- term treatment of GI tract \\\"candidiasis\\\".  It's like trying to weed a garden by cutting off what's above the ground but leaving the roots ready to come out again once you walk away.  The $60000 question is whether a contained candida \\\"bloom\\\" can partially grow into tissue through the mucus membranes, causing some types of symptoms in susceptible people (e.g., allergy), without becoming \\\"systemic\\\" in the classical sense of the word - something in between strictly an excessive bloom not causing any problems and the full-blown systemic infection that is potentially lethal.    Also, if one is an 'anal retentive', like I've been diagnosed in a prior post, that can also provide more sites for excessive candida growth.  ;^)    As I've said in private e-mail, there are flaws in our current medical system that make it difficult or even impossible for a physician to attempt alternative therapies AFTER the approved/proven/accepted therapies don't work. For example, I went to three ENT's, who all said that I will just have to live with my acute/chronic sinusitis after the ab's failed (they did mention surgery to open up the ostia, but my ostia weren't plugged and it would not get to the root cause of my condition).  After three months of aggressive and fairly non-standard therapy (Sporanox, body nutrient level monitoring and equalization, vitamin C, lentinen, echinacea, etc.), my health has vastly improved to where I was two years ago, before my health greatly deteriorated. Of course, skeptics would say that maybe if I did nothing I would have improved anyway, but that view is stretching things quite far because of the experience of the three ENT's I saw who said that I'd just have to \\\"live with it\\\".  I'm confident I will reach what one could call a total \\\"cure\\\".  The anti-fungal program I undertook was one necessary step in that direction because of my overuse of ab's for the last four years.  (Note:  for those having sinus problems, may I suggest the book by Dr. Ivker I mention above. Be sure to get the revised edition.)    Dr. Ivker started off having chronic and severe sinus problems, and his visits to several ENT's totally floored him when they said \\\"you'll just have to live with it\\\".  He spent several years trying everything - standard and non-standard, until he was essentially cured of chronic sinusitis.  He now shares his approach in his book and I can honestly say that I am on the road to recovery following some parts of it.  His one recommendation to take a systemic anti-fungal at the beginning of treatment IF you have a history of anti-biotic overuse has been proven to him time and time again in his own practice.  I'm sure if I commented to him of the hard-core beliefs of the anti- \\\"yeast hypothesis\\\" posters that he would have definite things to say, such as, \\\"it's worked wonders for me in almost two thousand cases\\\", to put it mildly. I also would not be surprised if he would say that they are the ones violating their moral obligations to help the patient.  Maybe those doctors who are reading this who have a practice and are confronted by a patient having symptoms that could be due to the \\\"hypothetical yeast overgrowth\\\" (e.g., they fit some of the profiles the pro-yeast people have identified), should consider anti-fungal therapy IF all other avenues have been exhausted.  Remember, theory and practice are two different things - you cannot have one without the other, they are synergistic.  If a doctor does something non-standard yet produces noticeable symptomatic relief in over a thousand of his patients, shouldn't you at least sit up and take notice? Maybe you ought to trust what he says and begin hypothesizing why it works instead of why it shouldn't work.  I'm afraid a lot of doctors have become so enamored with \\\"scientific correctness\\\" that they are ignoring the patients they have sworn to help.  You have to do both;  both have to be balanced, which we don't see from some of the posters to this group.  There comes a point when you just have to use a little common sense, and maybe an empirical approach (such as trying a good systemic anti-fungal such as Sporanox) after having exhausted all the other avenues.  I was one of those who the traditional medical establishment was not able to help, so I did the natural thing:  I went to a couple of doctor's who are (somewhat) outside this establishment, and as a result I have found significant relief.  Would it not be better if the traditional medical establishment can set up some kind of mechanism where any doctor, without fear of being sued or having his license pulled, can try experimental and unproven (beyond a doubt) therapies for his/her patients that finally reach the point where all the accepted therapies are ineffective?  I'd like to hear a doctor tell me: \\\"well, I've tried all the therapies that are approved and accepted in this country, and since they clearly don't work for you, I now have the authority to use experimental, unproven techniques that seem to have helped others.  I can't promise anything, and there are some risks.  You will have to sign something saying you understand the experimental and possibly risky nature of these unproven therapies, and I'll have to register your case at the State Board.\\\"  Anyway, if my ENT had suggested this to me, I would've jumped on this pronto instead of going to one of those doctors who, for either altruistic reasons, or for greed, is practicing these alternative therapies with much risk to him/her (risk meaning losing their license) and possibly to the patient.  Such a mechanism would keep control in the more mainstream medicine, and also provide valuable data that would essentially be free.  It also would be morally and ethically better than the current system by showing the compassion of the medical community to the patient - that it's doing everything it can within reason to help the patient.  It is the lack of such a mechanism that is leading large numbers of people to try alternative therapies, some of which seem to work (like my case), and others of which will never work at all (true quackery).

It seems from the following that the CPSR is atleats starting to question this bogosity:      ---------------------------------------------------------------- April 16, 1993 Washington, DC                 COMPUTER PROFESSIONALS CALL FOR PUBLIC            DEBATE ON NEW GOVERNMENT ENCRYPTION INITIATIVE          Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR) today called for the public disclosure of technical data underlying the government's newly-announced \\\"Public Encryption Management\\\" initiative.  The new cryptography scheme was announced today by the White House and the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), which will implement the technical specifications of the plan.  A NIST spokesman acknowledged that the National Security Agency (NSA), the super- secret military intelligence agency, had actually developed the encryption technology around which the new initiative is built.          According to NIST, the technical specifications and the Presidential directive establishing the plan are classified.  To open the initiative to public review and debate, CPSR today filed a series of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests with key agencies, including NSA, NIST, the National Security Council and the FBI for information relating to the encryption plan.  The CPSR requests are in keeping with the spirit of the Computer Security Act, which Congress passed in 1987 in order to open the development of non-military computer security standards to public scrutiny and to limit NSA's role in the creation of such standards.          CPSR previously has questioned the role of NSA in developing the so-called \\\"digital signature standard\\\" (DSS), a communications authentication technology that NIST proposed for government-wide use in 1991.  After CPSR sued NIST in a FOIA lawsuit last year, the civilian agency disclosed for the first time that NSA had, in fact, developed that security standard. NSA is due to file papers in federal court next week justifying the classification of records concerning its creation of the DSS.          David Sobel, CPSR Legal Counsel, called the administration's apparent commitment to the privacy of electronic communications, as reflected in today's official statement,  \\\"a step in the right direction.\\\"  But he questioned the propriety of NSA's role in the process and the apparent secrecy that has thus far shielded the development process from public scrutiny.  \\\"At a time when we are moving towards the development of a new information infrastructure, it is vital that standards designed to protect personal privacy be established openly and with full public participation.  It is not appropriate for NSA -- an agency with a long tradition of secrecy and opposition to effective civilian cryptography -- to play a leading role in the development process.\\\"          CPSR is a national public-interest alliance of computer industry professionals dedicated to examining the impact of technology on society.

The arrogance being attacked is that we \\\"think we are the only ones who know what the absolutes are\\\".  In short, many evangelicals claim that they are infallible on the matter of religious texts.  In particular, the problem is one of epistemology.  As a shorthand, you can think of epistemology as \\\"how do you know?\\\"  That question, it turns out, is a very troubling one.  The problem with `absolute certainty' is that, at the bottom, at least some of the thinking goes on inside your own head.  Unless you can be certain that everything which happens in your head is infallible, the reasoning you did to discover a source of truth is in question.  And that means you do NOT have absolute justification for your source of authority -- which means you do NOT have absolute certainty.   Let's take the specific example of Biblical Inerrancy, and a fictional Inerrantist named Zeke.  (The following arguments applies to the idea of Papal Infallibility, too.)  Zeke has, we presume, spent some time studying the Bible, and history, and several other topics.  He has concluded, based on all these studies (and possibly some religious experiences) that the Bible is a source of Absolute Truth.  He may be correct; but even if he is, he cannot be certain that he is correct. His conclusion depends on how well he studied history -- he may have made mistakes, and the references he used may have contained mistakes.  His conclusion depends on how well he studied the Bible -- he may have made mistakes.  His conclusion depends on his own reasoning -- and he may have made mistakes.  (Noticing a common thread yet?  8-)  Everything about his study of the world that he did -- everything that happened in his own head -- is limited by his own thinking.  No matter what he does to try and cover his mistakes, he can never be certain of his own infallibility.  As long as ANY PART of the belief is based on his own reasoning, that belief cannot be considered \\\"absolutely certain\\\".  Zeke believes that he has found a source of absolute truth -- but that belief is only as good as the quality of the search he made for it.  Unless he can say that his own reasoning is flawless, his conclusions are in doubt.  Any belief that you hold about absolute sources of truth depends in part on your own thinking -- there is no way out of the loop.  Only an infallible thinker can have absolute certainty in all his beliefs.   This is easy to demonstrate.  Let's go back to our shorthand method of doing epistemology: \\\"how do you know?\\\"  Imagine a hypothetical discussion:   A: The Bible is a source of absolute truth.   B: How do you know?   A: I studied history and the Bible and religious writings and church     teachings and came to this conclusion.   B: How do you know you studied history correctly?   A: Well, I double-checked everything.   B: How do you know you double-checked correctly?   A: Well, I compared my answers with some smart people and we agreed.   B: Just because some smart guy believes something that doesn't mean it is     true.  How do you know THEY studied it correctly?   A: ...  And, as you see, B will eventually get A to the point where he has to say \\\"I can't prove that there are no mistakes\\\" -- and as long as you may have made a mistake, then you cannot be ABSOLUTELY certain.  There is no way out of the loop.   This is where the \\\"arrogance of Christians\\\" arises: many people believe that their own personal research can give them absolute certainty about the doctrines of Christianity -- they are implicitly claiming that they are infallible, and that there is no possibility of mistake.  Claiming that you CANNOT have made a mistake, and that your thinking has led you to a flawless conclusion, is pretty arrogant.   *  People who want to see this argument explained in great detail should try to find _The Infallibility of the Church_, by George Salmon.  He is attacking the idea that the Pope can be knowably infallible (and he does so very well), but the general argument applies equally well to the idea that the Bible is knowably Inerrant. \",\"Does anyone have any experience using XRunner, CAPBAK/X, or PreVueX as an automated test tool for X?

It also strengthens and enables one, as healing takes hold, to grow in new strength and health to live and be and to do that for which God created  us.

[1]  Born 1964 Secretary-Typist Azsantekmontazh Trust Sumgait Construction and Installation Administration Secretary of the SMU Komsomol Organization  Resident at Building 17/33B, Apartment 15 Microdistrict No. 3 Sumgait [Azerbaijan]   On the 27th my sister Marina and I went to the movies the seven o'clock show, at the theater that is across from the City Party Committee, about 50 yards  away. The SK theater. They were showing an Argentinian film, \\\"The Abyss.\\\"  Before the film we noticed about 60 to 70 people standing near the podium at  the City Party Committee, but they were silent, there's no conversation  whatsoever, and we couldn't figure out what was going on. That is, we knew it  was about Karabagh, but what it was exactly, what they were talking about, if  someone gave a speech or not, we didn't know. We bought our tickets. There  were 30 or 40 people in the theater. This was a very small number for that  large movie theater. The film started. About 30 minutes later they stopped the film. A crowd burst in. About 60 people. They came up onto the stage. Well  mostly they were young people, from 16 to 23 years old. They demanded that an  Armenian woman come up onto the stage. They used foul language and said that  they were going to show what Azerbaijanis were capable of, what they could do  to Armenian girls. I thought that's what they meant because they had demanded  a girl specifically. Marina and I were sitting together. I told her to move  over, there were some Russian girls sitting nearby. So that if someone  recognized me or if something happened, they would take me, and not Marina.  It got quiet, 2 or 3 girls jumped up to run out, but the door was closed--it's only opened at the end of the   show--and they returned to their seats.  Everyone in the theater was looking at one another, Russians, Azerbaijanis,  people of various nationalities. But no one reacted at all, no one in the  auditorium made a sound. They were silent, looking at one another, and  gradually started to leave. Some guy, a really fat one, says, \\\"OK, we've  scared them enough, let's leave.\\\" They leave slowly, pompously. It seemed to  me that those people were not themselves. Either they had smoked a bunch of  \\\"anasha\\\", or had taken something else, because they all looked beastly, like  they were ready to tear anyone apart. Then it was all over, as though nothing  had happened at all. The film started up again, it was one of those cheerful  films which should have only brought pleasure, made you happy to be alive. We  could barely sit to the end. So it had started at seven it was over by nine,  and it was dark . . .  Marina and I were walking home, Lenin Street, that's the center of town. Lenin Street was packed, just packed with young people. They were shouting,  something about Karabagh and something about Armenians. We weren't especially  listening, because the way we were feeling we didn't know if we were going to  make it home or not, and just what had happened anyway? Public transportation  wasn't running. Incidentally, when we came out of the theater we saw police,  policemen standing there. The director of the movie theater was looking at the doors, because when they were leaving they had broken the glass, the doors  there are basically all glass. Everything was broken. He stood there grief- stricken, but looking as though nothing really big had happened, like some  naughty boys had just broken them quite by accident, with a slingshot. Well,  since he looked more or less calm I decided that, nothing all that super  serious had happened. We went out very slowly; we wanted to catch a bus, we  live literally one stop away. We didn't want to go on foot, not because it was dark, but because something might happen. We flagged down a cab, but the  driver didn't want to take us. We told him we live near the bus station, and  he said he'd take us to the bus station and not a yard farther. I said, well,  OK . . .  So we got into the cab and managed to get there. Something incredible was  happening at the bus station. There was a traffic jam. Public transportation  was at a standstill and everyone was shouting \\\"Ka-ra-bagh,\\\" they're not going  to give up Karabagh. I go home and tell my family what's going on, and there's immediate panic in the house. Mamma says, what should we do? Like the end had  come, they were going to come, kill us, that's it . . . Somehow we managed to  cheer ourselves up: Nothing that bad could happen. Where are we living anyway, just what kind of social order do we have? Somehow we manage to calm Mamma  down. And we went to bed. But no one could sleep. Everyone made as though  nothing had happened.  That was on Saturday. In short, the day went by. We didn't go anywhere and  didn't call our relatives. No one did anything. Because . . . life goes on. That day I realized something was approaching, but what exactly, I couldn't guess.  On the 28th everything was like it was supposed to be, we lived like we always had. There were five of us at home: Mamma, Papa and us, three sisters: Lyuda,  Marina, and I. My sister Lyuda was in Yerevan at the time. We sat at home and  no one went out. Later we learned that a demonstration had started that  morning. It all started . . . They were smashing up stores. We were sitting at home and didn't know anything about it. Then a girlfriend of mine, Lyuda  Zimogliad, came by at around three o'clock I think. We worked together, we did our apprenticeships together, she's a Russian girl. She said that something awful was happening in town. I asked, \\\"Don't they want Armenians? Well what  are they after, if they're already in that state?\\\" She says, no, nothing like  that, it's just a demonstration, but it's awful to watch it. Somehow, it feels like a war has broken out. Public transportation has been stopped . . . The  cabs, the buses, well it's just a nightmare.  Then Papa decides to go to the drugstore, my mother was having allergy  problems at the time . . . He left the house and our neighbor, Aunt Vera, asked him, \\\"Where are you going? Stop! There are such terrible things going on in the courtyard; aren't you afraid to go out?\\\" Papa didn't know what she was talking about. She simply pushed him back into the entryway. He came home  and told Mamma. Mamma said, \\\"Well, if Aunt Vera was talking like that it means that something is really going on.\\\" But we didn't go see her, she's a Russian, she lives across from us. I had to see my friend out. Around five o'clock I  tell Lyuda, \\\"Ok, look, it's time for you to go, it's late already, I'll see  you out.\\\" Mamma says, \\\"You don't need to go, it's too late already, you can  see what the situation in town is.\\\" So we decided to stay home. Dinner was  ready. Mamma says, \\\"Let her eat with us, then she can go.\\\" We sat down at the  table. But no one was hungry, no one was in the mood, we just put everything  out on the table to calm ourselves down, and make it appear that we're eating. We turned on the television, and the show \\\"In Fairy-Tale Land\\\" was coming on.  We cleared the table.  We hear some noise out in the courtyard. I go out on the balcony, but I can't  see what's going on, because the noise is coming from the direction of the bus station, and there is a 9-story building in the way. There is mob of people  . . . I can't figure out what's happening. They're shouting something, looking somewhere, I can't make out what is going on. I go down to a neighbor, she's  an Azerbaijani; we've been friends of her family for about 25 years. I go down to look from their place. I see people shouting, looking at the 5-and 9-story  buildings near the bus station. Just then soldiers set upon them, about 20  people, with clubs. The mob runs off in different directions. I even see  several people from our building. They are looking and laughing . . . I decide that means it's not all that bad if they are laughing: it means they're not  killing anyone. But now the crowd suddenly dashes toward the soldiers. One of  the soldiers cannot manage to get away, they start stomping on him with their  feet, everyone's kicking him . . . I become ill and go home, and explain in  general terms that horrible things are going on out there . . .  can't speak . . . Well, they've probably killed that soldier, the way that crowd is . . . If each of them kicked him just once . . . They took his club away from him and started to beat him with it. But it was far away and I couldn't see if he got up and left or not.  I become terrified and go home and say, \\\"Lyuda, don't go anywhere, stay at our place, because if you go out they could kill you or . . . \\\" Then the crowd  runs over closer toward our building and stands at the 12-story building and  starts shouting something. We go out onto the balcony. All of our neighbors  are also out on theirs, too. Everyone is standing, staring. The mob is  shouting and about 5 minutes later comes running toward our building. As it  turns out, at the 12-story building the Azerbaijani neighbors went down and  kept them from coming in. There's only one entryway there, they could stop  them.  They all run up to our building. Mamma immediately starts closing the windows, afraid that they might throw stones. They have stones and they break the  windows, all of them. There are very many people. We have a large courtyard,  and it's packed with people. They spill up to the first floor so they don't  crush each other. They crawl up on trees, posts, and garages. It's just a huge cloud of people. They break and burn the motorcycle of the Armenian Sergey  Sargisian, from our building. We close the windows and immediately hear  tramping in our entryway. They come up to our fifth floor with a tremendous  din and roar. It's incomprehensible. Mamma told me later that they were  shouting Father's name, \\\"Grisha, open the door, we've come to kill you!,\\\" or something like that. I don't remember that, I was spaced out, kind of. Mamma  says, \\\"Into the bedroom, quickly!\\\" In the bedroom we have two tall beds, part  of our dowry; Mamma says, \\\"Hide there, they probably won't come in there,  they'll ask something, say something, and leave.\\\" She says, \\\"We'll tell them  that we live alone here.\\\" I can't imagine that my parents will stand out in  the hall alone talking with some sort of beasts . . . I go to them and say  that I'll stand together with them, I'll talk with them if they come, maybe I  can find a common language with them, all the more so if they know me: I speak  Azerbaijani more or less, and I can find out what they want. I told Marina and Lyuda to hide under the bed, and my sister Lyuda, I can't remember if I told  her anything or not.  Then . . . they open the door: it's like they blew on it and it broke and fell right into the hall. The crows bursts in and starts to shout: Get out of here, leave, vacate the apartment and go back to your Armenia; things like that. I tell them, \\\"What has happened, speak calmly. One of you, tell me, calmly, what has happened.\\\" In Azerbaijani, they say, \\\"Get out of the apartment, leave.\\\" I  say, \\\"OK. Go downstairs. We'll gather everything we need and leave the  apartment.\\\" I realize that it is senseless to discuss any sort of rights with them, these are animals. They must be stopped. The ones standing in the doorway, the young guys, say, \\\"There are old people and one girl with them. Too bad!\\\" They take two or three steps back. It seems as though I have pacified them with our exchange. Then someone in the courtyard shouts,  commanding them: \\\"Don't you understand what you are saying? Kill them?\\\"  And that was it! That was all it took. They grab Papa, carry him into one room, and Mamma and me into another. They put Mamma on the bed and start  undressing her, beating her legs. They start tearing my clothes, right there,  in front of Mamma. I don't remember where they went, what they did, or how  much time passed. I had the feeling that they beat me on the head, on my body, and tore my clothes, all at the same time, I don't even know what I said. The  atrocities started. I was savagely raped in that room. They argued among  themselves who would go first.  Later, I remember, I came to. I don't know if I'm dead or alive. Someone comes in, someone tall, I think, clean-shaven, in an Eskimo dogskin coat, balding.  He looks around at what's happening. At that instant everything stops. It  seems to me that he is either their commander or . . . that somehow everything depends on him. He looks and says, \\\"Well, we're done here.\\\" They are beating Mamma on the head. They break up the chairs and beat her with the chair legs  . . . She loses consciousness, and they decide that she's dead. Papa . . . was out cold. They want to throw Lyuda off the balcony, but they can't get the  window open. Apparently the window frames are stuck after the rain and the  windows can't be opened. They leave her next to the window. She was thinking  about being thrown out the window and passed out. She's not a real strong  person anyway . . . He looks at me and sees that I'm saying something, that I'm still twitching. Well, I start saying the opposite of what I should be,  which is humbling myself and pleading. I start shouting, cursing . . . they  don't get any entreaty out of me. I  already know that I'm dead, why would I  humble myself before anyone? And he says that if that's what I think, since my tongue is so long . . . maybe he thinks that I still look quite appealing  . . . In short, he commands that I be taken outside.  I no longer saw or remembered what was happening to Marina and Lyuda, I don't  know if they are alive or not. They take me outside. They are dragging me by  my arms, by my legs. They are hitting me against the wall, the railings,  something metal . . . While they are carrying me someone is biting me, someone else is pinching me . . .I don't even know. I think, my God, when will death  come? If only it were sooner . . . Then . . . they carry me out, throw me near the entryway . . . and start kicking me. I lose consciousness . . . What  happened after that, how many people there were, I don't remember.   I come to after a while, I don't remember how long. A neighbor is bringing me  clothing. I'm entirely covered with blood, she puts a dress on me. I remember  that I said the same words over and over again: \\\"Mamma, what happened, Mamma,  what have they done to us, where are we, whose house are we at?\\\" I can't make  sense out of anything. There is a guy standing over me, I sort of know him, he served in Afghanistan, his name is Igor, he brought me indoors. When they all  went to the third entryway and killed a person there, Igor gathered his  courage, took me into his arms, and brought me to the neighbors', even though  he's small-minded, he put himself at risk. Igor Agayev is Azerbaijani; he  served in Afghanistan. There are three brothers. The older brother also served there, I think; now he's stationed here, on the border, in Armenia. Igor  brought me to the neighbors', and then helped me come to my senses, saying,  \\\"Karina, I know you, calm down, I'm not one of them.\\\" How do I know who's who  and what's what? I come to, and they clean me up. I was covered in blood. Then Papa . . . I saw Papa, I saw Mamma. And Marina, too . . . Igor was there when  they dragged Marina and Lyuda out from under the bed . . . Marina . . . Lyuda  said that she was Russian, they said, we'll let you go, we aren't touching the Russians, go. And while they are dragging Marina out she decides she's going  to tell them she's Azerbaijani. Igor immediately grabs Marina's and Lyuda's  hands, because he knows Marina, and knows that she is Armenian and is our  sister, and takes her to the second floor to a neighbor's and starts pounding  on the door so she will open up. She opens the door and Igor pushes them in  there. So they survived.  My sister Lyuda lost consciousness after the bandits started stealing things. While they were going downstairs, taking things downstairs, then coming back  up again, Lyuda seized the opportunity and crawled under the bed and stayed  there. Then, when she was herself again, she found a torn night shirt and put  it on, and some sort of robe and went to a neighbor's on the fourth floor, the one whose apartment I had watched the crowd from, the friend of ours, and  knocked on the door. The neighbor opened and said, \\\"I'm not going to let you  in the apartment because I'm afraid of them. But I'll give you some stockings  and we'll leave the building.\\\" Lyuda says, \\\"I'll stay at your place because of what's going on, they keep going up and down the stairs.\\\" It was just for a  moment, just a moment in life, but the neighbor wouldn't consent. Lyuda came  back to our place and lay under the bed . . .  I came to. Mother was there. I can't remember my supervisor's telephone  number, but something had to be done. Somehow I remembered and called, and he  came to get us. He didn't have any idea what was going on. He thought we were  simply afraid, he didn't know that they were killing us and that we had passed between life and death. He came and got us and took us to the police precinct. There they looked us over. I was having trouble walking, my lungs hurt badly,  it was hard to breathe . . .  My supervisor's name is Urshan Feyruzovich Mamedov. He's the head of our  administration. They took us there. When we were leaving, I saw a great number of buses full of soldiers at the entrance to town. The buses were ordinary  passenger buses. There were very many soldiers. We left around eleven, right  after eleven. If these people could stop what was happening they could save a  great many lives . . . Because the crowd was moving on, toward the school, and what was going on there . . . I think everyone know not only in Sumgait, not  only in Yerevan. Because there they murdered them all one after the next,  without stopping. After us.  I think 14 people died in Microdistrict No. 3, and 10 to 12 of them were from Buildings 4, 5, and 6. In our building one person died, and one old woman died from Building 16, that's the building in front of ours. There young  Azerbaijani men stopped the mob and wouldn't let it into their building.  Incidentally, when we were at the neighbors', Marina called our relatives to warn them, so they would all know what was happening. I called a aunt in  Microdistrict No. 5. They have three neighbors who are Armenians. I said, \\\"Run quickly, I can't explain what's going on; hide, do what you can, just stay alive. Hide at Azerbaijanis', ones who won't give you away.\\\" At that moment  three people came in, policemen. I think they were Azerbaijanis. I was in such awful condition, my face was completely distorted my lips were puffed up,  there was blood, my eye was swollen, no one thought I would ever see anything  out of that eye again . . . my forehead was badly cut, and one-half of my face was pushed out forward. No one would have thought that I would survive, get my normal appearance back, and be able to grasp anything at all. I started to  scream at those people, why did you come, who sent you here, no one wants you  here, haven't you killed people people yet, what are you doing here? One of  the soldiers said, \\\"Don't scream at us. We're Muslims, but we're not from the  Sumgait police. They called in from Daghestan.\\\" So at that point the  Daghestan police were there.  When we got to the police precinct there were an awful lot of police there, there were soldiers, police with dogs, ambulances, firemen . . . I don't know, maybe they were waiting for people to bring them the goners and the seriously  injured to treat them there in the police precinct. I don't know what they  were there for. There were also doctors from Baku there. They examined Lyuda  and me and said, \\\"These women need to go to the Maternity Home, but we don't  know what to do with the rest.\\\"  So they took us, and I lost contact with my parents, my boss, everyone. My  boss said, \\\"Don't worry, I'll find you, no matter where you are, no matter what happens.\\\" We went to the hospital. There we were examined by a department head from the Sumgait Maternity Home, Pashayeva, I think her name was. She  examined us. The ambulance was from Baku; I figured out that the Sumgait  ambulances hadn't done anything, they didn't respond to any calls. People  called and neither the police nor the ambulances showed any sign of life.  That doctor looked me over and I could tell from her behavior that something very good had happened, for she became quite glad. I even thought to myself,  \\\"God, can it be that nothing all that bad is wrong?\\\" She looks me over and  says, \\\"Now why are you suffering so? You don't know what your people have been doing, your people did even worse things.\\\" And I think, great, I have to deal  with her . . . And I felt so bad, I thought, why don't I just die so as not to have to hear more stuff like this from people like her? Here I am in this  condition and being told about something that our people did. I just didn't  have the energy to say, \\\"How could our people possibly be smart enough to  think of something that yours haven't already done?\\\" I stayed there. Then they brought in another woman, Ira B., she was married, and she was raped in her  own apartment, too. There were three of us, Ira, Lyuda, and 1. The next  morning they took Lyuda and Ira away. They didn't do anything to help us. This was in the old Maternity Home, in the combined block. They didn't do anything  more than examine me, that was it. I didn't want any shots or tranquilizer,  nothing. What shots could have calmed me down? I didn't even want to look at  them.  I lay in the ward. Either it just worked out that way or they did it on pur- pose, but I was alone. I was alone even though the wards were packed. That same evening a woman came by and asked me what was wrong with me, that my face was disfigured. She asked what had happened to me, and I said, \\\"Better to ask  your brother what happened, there's no point in asking me, your brother can  better explain what happened.\\\" She fell into a faint. All the doctors threw  themselves at her, and the doctor categorically forbade anyone to come into my ward.  Then people from work came to see me, my boss, his daughter; they brought me  clothing, because I was literally naked. The only thing I had on was a dress,  but the woman who gave it to me was very short, and the dress was way up  above my knees, and the woman orderly said, \\\"I can't believe you put on such a short dress, who are you showing off your legs to here?\\\" I went back to my  ward thinking, just one more thing from something. People from work came and  brought me something in a sack, apples, I think, three or four pounds, but I  couldn't take them. I had become so weak that it was just embarrassing. I said that I couldn't take the apples, and really didn't have any appetite. No one  had to bring me anything. Some woman took the sack . . . And, oh yes! . . .  Then I heard that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history should  be hidden or torn up completely so that no one would know that I was an  Armenian, maybe they wouldn't figure it out from looking at me. So they must  have been thinking that there would be some kind of attack, that something  else would happen. That it would be worse. Or, perhaps, someone was outside on the street, I don't know. In any case, I didn't sleep a wink that night.  The next morning they picked me up, a whole police detail, put me in a bus,  and off we went. I didn't even know where they were taking me. They took me to the club where the troops were, the very one I was in that ill-fated evening. I got off the bus. Near the City Party Committee there were a great many  troops, tanks, armored personnel carriers; the whole scene was terrible. I saw  a few people I knew there, and that calmed me a little. I had already thought  that I was the only one left. So there were five or six of us left in Sumgait  after that night. I still didn't know what happened to my parents, they didn't  come to see me in the hospital, and my boss told me that everything was fine.  I didn't know whether to believe him or not. Maybe he was just trying to calm  me down, maybe something happened on the way. Then I went to the club and saw  a lot of people I knew. They all knew one another, they were all kissing each  other and asking, \\\"What happened, what went on?\\\" Two days later they came to  see me from work. They were there all the time. Each day they came, showed  interest, and were constantly bringing me money. They did everything they  could. Of course I'm most thankful to my boss, the only one of my colleagues  who didn't lose his presence of mind and who didn't change his opinions,  neither before, nor after, nor in the heat of the moment, no matter what  happened. He constantly took an interest. A sincere interest, from the heart  . . . Then, about two days later, the secretary of the Party Committee came,  not from our Party organization, but from the First Trust, which ours is part  of, Comrade Kerimov, a very important figure in our town. He made arrangements with the emergency medical personnel to take me away, because if I sat down by myself I couldn't get up or lie down again. There was something wrong with my lungs, it was hard to breathe. They examined me there several times, there I  lay were several doctors, they all thought that . . . that it must just be  from all the blows, I don't know. They didn't diagnose anything in particular. When I was in the Maternity Home I even asked . . . I made it a point of  insisting that they take me to the trauma section because I felt so awful.  There was no way something inside wasn't broken, my ribs . . . Well they took  me there and took x-rays and said that everything was fine. There were  emergency medical workers on duty in the club. The mother of one of Marina's  friends was there. She was the head doctor at the Sumgait Children's Clinic.  They had every kind of antifever agent in the world, which was exactly what I needed at that moment, I thought. I said that I was having great difficulty breathing, I couldn't seem to get enough air, something was wrong with me. They put tight bandages around my chest and waist. Later I overheard some people saying that I had been cut all over. I think they just saw me being all bandaged up and decided that my breasts and face had been cut . . . But I wasn't cut.  They took us to the Khimik boarding house. We lived there a long time. Soon  appeared representatives . . . They were agitating. At first people would not  talk to them, and drove them off. One of the Armenian women shouted, \\\"We  demand that Seidov come!\\\" The response was, \\\"It's Seidov who sent us.\\\" Seidov  is the Chairman of the Azerbaijani Council of Ministers. The woman said,  \\\"We'll only see Seidov's daughter, have her come here, we'll do the same  things to her that they did to our daughters, and then we'll deal with you  agitators.\\\" And so on. More of them said, \\\"Have Seidov himself come.\\\" This  went on day in, day out. The agitators kept coming and coming, this drove us  out of our wits. Then people gradually started departing for Yerevan because  they realized it was senseless to stay. Everything got on our nerves: The  smell, the small children. There were children at the SK club, children who  had literally just come out of the Maternity Home. What were they doing in a  club that didn't even have running water all the time? At first we had to pay  to eat there. They even overcharged us, as it turned out. On the second day  someone told us that they would bring us food for free. The children were ill. Everything stank there. Well imagine about 3,000 people in a small movie  theater with seating for no more than 500. You couldn't sit or lie down, it  was impossible to even move. The stench was awful. Even the smallest infants  took ill overnight there. I heard that they were arriving seriously ill in  Yerevan, the infants. They have to be washed, they have to be bathed, not to  mention that we, the adults, were ill and needed care. People were fainting  right and left. I just don't know, everyone was crying, everyone . . . Only  the young people, the men, somehow managed to keep it together. But the women  were in a constant state of panic. It seemed to everyone that they would come  any minute and kill and stab. It seemed clear that we had been gathered  together purposely, like during the war, so that they could burn the movie  theater and there wouldn't be a single Armenian left. Then people went up to  the attic. I didn't see them, I only heard them, because I was lying down and  couldn't get up. I lay right on the stage, we had some room there. Apparently  they caught two people with either oil or gas. I think they wanted to burn the theater. Maybe someone saw them, I didn't. I was in no condition to open my  eyes.  Everyone was suspicious of everyone else. They would ask, \\\"Aren't you an  Azerbaijani? I think I saw you somewhere, I think you're an Azerbaijani.\\\" They led out all the men and started letting them back in by checking their passports, relatives might be covering for each other. Half of the people did not have any documents. There were people who had run out of their homes in  nothing but a pair of pants and slippers, or wearing just a shirt, not like they should have, with their IDs.  So on the 28th, on Sunday, I think, the police did nothing to help us. On Monday everything resumed where it had left off on Block 41A. They didn't  spare a soul there: not children, not pregnant women, nobody. They killed, they burned, they hacked with axes, just everything possible. They murdered  the Melkumian family whom I knew, my mother worked with them. Their daughter- in-law went to school with my older sister. They were brutally murdered. Only  the two daughters-in-law survived. By a miracle one was able to save herself,  she ran away, the neighbors wouldn't take her in, so she ran about the  building until she found refuge. She was pregnant and had two small children.  This all continued on Monday in Block 41A, on the 29th, when the troops were  already in the city.  They murdered people, they overturned automobiles, and they burned entire  families. They say they didn't even know for sure if the people were Armenians or not. I heard that the Lezgins suffered, too. I'm not sure myself, I didn't  see any Lezgins who had been injured. They burned cars so it's very difficult  now to say exactly who died and who didn't. It was very difficult to identify  the corpses, or rather, what remained of the corpses after they were doused in gasoline and burned . . . it's all very hard to imagine, of course I heard  that many people disappeared without a trace, from the BTZ plant two people,  including a woman who worked the night shift, Aunt Razmella, who also lived in Microdistrict 3.  They were stopping buses between Baku and Sumgait. In the evening people who  had been visiting Baku were returning to Sumgait, and people from Baku were  going home from Sumgait, and there were students, too. They were simply  savagely murdered. They were stopping the buses, the drivers immediately did  what they were told because there was just no other way to deal with that  hoard of brutally minded people. They stopped the buses, dragged the Armenians out and killed them on the spot. I didn't see it myself, but I heard that they put them all in a pile so as to burn them. Later it was hard to discern from  the corpses, well you can't call them corpses, you had to figure out from the  ashes who it was. l heard that two fellows saved two women, one a student, Ira G., if I'm not mistaken. She was in the hospital a long time after that, and  she still can't figure out who saved her. She was also brutally raped and  beaten and thrown onto a pile of corpses. The fellow pulled her out of that  whole pile of corpses, put his coat on her, took her into his arms, and  carried her to the city. I still can't imagine how he managed to do that.  I heard that from Engels Grigorian. He knows her, apparently. Well a lot of  people went to that hospital anyway. She was in the hospital and singing a  song in Armenian, and they wrote the words down, and, I think he still has  that piece of paper, because he says that a lot of people now have that song,  the one she sang in the hospital where she lay in such bad shape. They  couldn't find the guy who saved her. He left her in someone's apartment and called the ambulance, she was in such awful shape that, probably, like me, she couldn't remember anyone's face.  I think that I knew one of the people who broke into our house, maybe I had  talked with him once. But I received so many blows everything was just knocked out of my head. I can't remember to this day who he was. Then, it seems, I saw the Secretary of the Directorate's Party organization, where Marina works. She goes to school and works, she goes to night school at AZI, and works by day at the Khimzashchita Construction and Installation Administration. I'm the  Secretary of the Komsomol organization at our administration and often met  with the secretaries of Party and Komsomol organizations. We had joint  meetings. I know them all, I've even talked with them, and he, I know, is from Armenia. An Azerbaijani, but from Armenia. It became obvious that many of  those people were Azerbaijanis born in Armenia.  They took me to various police stations, to the police precinct, and to the Procuracy, because the USSR Procuracy got involved in the case, and I iden- tified the photographs of people who I could more or less recognize. They showed me the people who were in our apartment, they're working on our case, but I can't even recognize them, although it was proved that they were the ones, they're processing it somehow. They tell me that they know that someone held me by the arm and someone else held me by the leg when they were  dragging me. There was someone else in our apartment who did not even touch  me, he just stole a blanket and an earring or something like that. All these  people, all of them, as much as I've heard about them and seen them, they were all from Kafan.  The Secretary of the Party organization is named Najaf, Najaf Rzayev. He was  there when everything started. It must have been him because I didn't  recognize anyone else in the crowd whom I knew besides him. All the more since I told him, \\\"Listen, you do something, because you know me.\\\" He turned away  and went toward the bedroom, where Marina was. Well you couldn't see Marina  anyway. There was such a noisy confusion of people that you couldn't make out  anyone. All of it flew right out of my head, and then gradually I became  myself again, at the City Party Committee . . . There were military people  there. I told them what went on, and they wrote it all down. I told them his  name. On March 8 the Secretary of our First Trust Party organization, the one  we're part of, came to see us, his name is Najaf Rzayev. I tell Mamma, \\\"If he's here despite the fact that I gave his name, it means that either his  alibi has been confirmed or, probably, that they think I'm crazy, not  responsible for my words.\\\" He said, \\\"What did they do to you, how awful,  myself, I hid an Armenian family.\\\" Then after some time goes by he comes back  again and says something entirely different: \\\"I wasn't at home, my family and  I went to Baku.\\\" I said, \\\"Marina, what is he saying? He said something totally different before.\\\" After that I didn't go to see our Procurator, our case is  being handled by a procurator from Voronezh, Fedorov by name. Fedorov told me  that Rzayev's case had just gotten to him, and there were so names involved.  What are they doing with Rzayev? Did he prove his alibi or not? They just think that since I was hit in the  head I can't say anything for sure, whether it was him or not. It will be an  insult if he was in our apartment and doesn't have to pay for it, but at the  same time  I'm afraid to say I'm a hundred percent sure that it was he. Because no mat- ter who I name, they tell me, no, you're wrong, he didn't do that, that one wasn't there. All the faces have gotten mixed up in my mind. Who did what exactly I can't say.                                                       When they took me outside there was a whole crowd there, but I didn't see it,  because I had my eyes closed all the time. It seemed to me that I always got it because of my eyes, people were always hassling me, for some reason it  always seemed to me that my eyes are responsible. When they were beating my  face I thought they were trying to put my eyes out. So I had my eyes closed,  they took me outside and started to beat me. A young guy, 22, held my arms, he works at the BTZ plant. And right nearby, across the road from us, Block 41,  is where all this was going on. Right across the road from us. The BTZ  dormitory is over there, that's where he lives. Now he's in custody, they even have proved, as far as I know, that it was he who killed Shurik Gambarian, the clarinet player from the third entryway of our building. One person in our  building was killed, it was that man.  A guy comes by who shared a room with the guy who was holding me. He saw that he was holding me by the arms and that he was beating me, but he didn't come  over, he just looked and then went into the dormitory. A while after it was  all over, people started making announcements in town saying that  investigators had been summoned. That guy went and told them everything. Now  they've caught him, everything's been proved. Now, evidently, they've been beating him, I don't know what they're doing with them over there, but he  himself said that he was working the night shift at the plant. Some young guy  came to the plant and said, \\\"Everyone who wants to kill Armenians come to the  bus station on Saturday at ten.\\\" That was it. He said, the ones who wanted to, went. This was at the BTZ plant, during the night shift, probably, late Friday night. It was at night, they were at the sauna together. And he said, what do  you mean, do you understand what you are saying? The others were silent,  probably, in their hearts they were thinking, I'm going to go. But they didn't say anything to one another. He said that he thought it important to to go,  because he had heard a lot about what had happened in Kafan, that they had  killed their Azerbaijani sisters, their mothers, burned villages, and all of  that. That guy was also born in Kafan. That is certain. And Marina says that  the Secretary of the Party organization is from Armenia, too.                                                             from  I've participated in the investigation a couple of times. I'm satisfied with them thus far. They summoned us and asked about what happened, and every word  I said was recorded. I met some guy there . . . By the way, he was an  Armenian. I said that he was in our apartment, but what he did, I don't know.  His last name was Grigorian, Eduard Grigorian. He s from Sumgait, from  Microdistrict 1. He was sentenced I think, to five years, not his first time.  His mother is Russian. I met with him at the KGB in Baku, at the Azerbaijani  KGB. They took us there and showed me photographs. There were so many  photographs, I think they even photographed those people who were caught at  curfew, and I've got them all confused. I say, the face was about like this,  the guy in the white coat with the red clasps. But he could take that coat off and burn it somewhere, and it would be like looking for a needle in a  haystack. Well. This guy, Grigorian, I said, he was in our apartment, but he  is so light-complected that he looks like a Lezgin. I don't know what he did,  I can't remember. Maybe he beat me or raped me. But he was in our apartment.  At the KGB he started asking me, pleading with me, there's no need for this,  all this stuff, look me in the eyes, you're like a sister to me. I took a look at him and thought, \\\"My God, Heaven forbid that I should have a brother like  you.\\\" But they were satisfied with my responses, because I said everything  without great certainty. I was there with Mamma. Then Lyuda came in, but when  she came in she got sick immediately. She wanted to kill him, she crawled over the table at him. She recognized him. When she came to, Lyuda was lying on the balcony, the mob threw her there and all of them ran into the bedroom. We had  all kinds of boxes with dishes in them, the dowries for all three sisters.  They stole everything in the apartment, leaving only small things. At that  moment Lyuda came to and started remembering everything. Well, seeing the  faces, hearing the voices . . . Two people were saying they could burn the  apartment. Another says, why burn the apartment when I've got three kids and  no place to live. So this guy was in temporary housing, he didn't have  anywhere to live, he was from Sumgait. They were sure that they would get the  apartment. Besides, the neighbors were Azerbaijani. Why should they burn the  apartment, they might burn Azerbaijanis. That's what they said. How did they  know there were Azerbaijanis there, if they just picked a place, thinking that Armenians lived there? We have a list of the residents for our part of the  building, our name is in there, but how could they know that Azerbaijanis  lived on the other side of the wall from us? So they didn't set fire to our  apartment.  I don't know, I was in such bad shape that if all of it had come to a halt  when I was outside, if someone had asked me what was happening, I would have said that a civil war was going on. Well, maybe not civil . . . but probably civil, because when they were beating me I opened my eyes and saw that all the neighbors were standing on their balconies and watching, like at a free horror film. So a civil war was going on, and only the Armenians were being fought. If it were a world war or something like that, they would have been fighting everyone. But they only fought us. Then I met some women from  our building, some Azerbaijanis. They are crying, they tell me, \\\"Karina, we  saw all of it, how could it happen?\\\" They're asking me! Well I just don't know what to call it if a normal girl can stand there and watch what happened to  me. I think that if it were the other way around either I wouldn't have been  able to take it, or I would have tried to avert it, like that one Azerbaijani  woman did in front of our building. A woman lives there, an awful, dissipated  woman, if you can call her a woman, the dissipated life she leads. Two  Armenian families live there, in her part of the building. She came out on the balcony and saw what was happening to me and started to scream and curse. She  came down to the entryway and said, \\\"You'll come in this entryway over my dead body.\\\" So not one of them took it in his head to go in that entryway. Some  folks were saying that those people were so out of control that they didn't  even know what they were doing. I don't think that's true. They knew very well what they were doing if they didn't even lift a hand against that woman. They  couldn't have cared less about her, but the fact that she was an Azerbaijani  stopped them.  They were just beasts, they had smoked so much. When they came to our place  they were all chewing something. I noticed: Everyone who came into the  apartment was chewing something. I think, my God, maybe I just think that?  Maybe I'm losing my mind? But no, they're all chewing something. Maybe it is  some kind of drug, it must be, because . . . At first glance they all seemed  to be such normal people, young, clean-shaven, looking exactly as if they had  come to some sort of celebration. But they were shouting something. They didn't talk, they shouted, as though there were deaf people there. They  screamed and screamed: \\\"Yeah, killing, killing, we're killing the Armenians!\\\"  Only they didn't shout \\\"kill,\\\" they shouted \\\"gurun ermianlary.\\\" Gurun  literally means \\\"kill,\\\" or \\\"destroy.\\\"  That's how it was! I'll continue. We hid in a captain's apartment, he's an Azerbaijani, his wife is a Tatar. We were sitting in their apartment, their  kids were out in the yard. Their kids knew a whole lot. This was in our part  of the building, on the third floor. When Mamma came to and couldn't find Lyuda she took Papa's hand, this was while the looters were stealing things, but they didn't pay attention because they were stealing things. Apparently they had already ceased killing and switched to stealing. Mamma found the courage to . . .  A boy said to my mother \\\"Where's the gold?\\\" Mamma said he must have been 12  to 14 years old. He even looked Russian, he was so fair-skinned. But the  Azerbaijanis from Armenia are fair-skinned. I noticed they were all on the  fair side. He shouted, they were all smashing things, and he asks Mamma where  the gold is. We kept our gold in the wardrobe with our important papers. In a  little black bag, we kept everything in there. Mamma doesn't really like to  wear gold. She probably never even wore those things from the time they were  bought for her. They took everything that was lying on the cheval glass. Mamma thinks that the gold saved us. Because they threw themselves at the gold, and  Mamma grabbed Papa, who was trying to breathe. They had closed his mouth,  bound his hands, and put a pillow and a chair on his face . . . They had  shoved something into his mouth so he would suffocate. Mamma grabbed him and  tore all that stuff off . . . He had something in his mouth, he was having  trouble breathing, his nose was filled with blood. Mamma grabbed him and  started running from the fifth down to the first floor because no one wanted  to open their doors to them. Mamma said that by accident, completely by  accident that person opened his door, he was sleeping, and said, half-awake,  \\\"What's happened?\\\" He sees that they are bloody. Mamma said, \\\"At least go and  find out what's happening to my daughters, even if they've burned them or  murdered them, at least bring the corpses.\\\" He went looking for us. At that  moment Lyuda was under the bed. She says that after they left it seemed that  someone was calling her name. When he quietly called her she couldn't get out  from under the bed. She wanted to get out and was calling softly. She thought  she was shouting, but in fact she was either silent or was only talking to  herself, it just seemed to her that she was shouting. When she got out from  under the bed everyone was gone. And again . . . She thought that she had lost her mind. I'll never leave here, never! To hell with it! It just seems that  way to me, I'll come to eventually. But then, when everything had settled  down, stopped, that mall brought Lyuda down, and Igor carried me in from outside. Or first I was brought in, then Lyuda, I don't remember what order it happened in.  And Mamma said, \\\"Listen, they're all running around down there, shouting  something or other, and running toward the other building.\\\" It had more or  less calmed down where we were. Who's dead, who's alive, we don't know. I  tried to call my girlfriend. I had basically come to. Mamma says, \\\"Listen; let's go upstairs, at least get a mattress or something. We don't know how  long we'll be here. Maybe they didn't burn everything.\\\" I don't get it, all women have that feeling, they want to get something from their homes, maybe  not everything was taken? I tell Mamma, \\\"Mamma, what do you need any of that  for? To hell with it! We're alive, forget the rest of it, all of it!\\\" She says, \\\"No, let's go get at least something. Maybe we'll leave here, spend the  night at someone else's.\\\" Mamma went upstairs, and their little boy, their son Alik, was standing on the lookout. lIe was standing there to see if they were  coming. They only managed to run up there and grab something one time. He  shouts, \\\"Come back, they're coming!\\\" They didn't have enough time to get a  lot, mattresses from one apartment, a blanket from another . . . Mamma got my  knitting . . . Someone managed to grab our old things, the ones we never wore, out of the hall . . . Someone took Father's old coveralls. The neighbor, his  wife, Mamma and Papa . . . Marina went with them. I was in no condition to  leave. Neither was Lyuda. We just sat. They ran out and we closed the door and just then we hear that the mob is on its way toward our place upstairs,  they're dragging something again. They were going toward the other building,  maybe over by the school, or . . . There was an unfinished building over there, people said they were going toward the basement or the unfinished  building, they could gradually carry everything over there. Then things more  or less calmed down. I tried to call my boss.  Later there was more noise. We were on the third floor, in a one-bedroom apartment, and a woman lives in the one-bedroom place on the second floor, Asya Dallakian. She's an old woman, retired. She wasn't at home, at that time she was usually in the country, she has a married daughter there, and her grandson is in the army. She is only very rarely in town; she gets her retirement money and the apartment is essentially vacant. They started pounding on her door and broke it down. She had two or three beds in there,  something like that, she's a 60-to 70-year-old woman who really does not even  live there. Probably she had some pots, a couple of metal bed frames and  mattresses, and a television. When her grandson came she bought a television.  They started wrecking everything. I started getting sick again. I think, \\\"My  God, what is going on around here? When will this end?\\\" We turned off the  lights and sat. As it turns out the people who weren't afraid, the ones who  knew what was going on, knew not to turn off the lights. We didn't know, but  they didn't come to where we were all the same. They all knew very well that  he was a captain. He went out and closed the door, and we sat in his  apartment. His last name was Kasumov. He's an exserviceman, retired, works up  at the fire station at some plant or other. He went out and stood at his door. They tell him, \\\"Comrade Captain, don't worry, we won't harm you, you're one of us.\\\" He went upstairs, and they say, \\\"Aren't you taking anything from this  apartment?\\\" He says, \\\"I don't need anything.\\\" And the women who were standing  in the yard . . . we have a basement, full of water . . . the women who were  standing in the yard saw. Those guys, they left everything they stole on the  first floor and ran upstairs again. The women threw everything they had time  to into the basement, to save our property. Some things were left: dirty  pillows, two or three other things and a rug. A guy came downstairs, really  mad, and he says, \\\"Where's the rug? I just put it right here!\\\" They tell him,  \\\"Some guy came and took it and went off toward the school.\\\" He ran off in that direction.  Oh! I forgot the most important point. When Igor picked me up in his arms,  there were women standing there who saw everything that was going on. They  just didn't tell me about it for a long time. The wife of that military man,  she didn't want to kill my spirit, I was already dead enough. Later she told  me, that after they murdered Uncle Shurik in the third entryway one of them,  the ringleader, apparently a young man, said, \\\"Where's the girl who was here?\\\" And he became furious. The woman tells him, \\\"She came to . . . \\\" She didn't know what to say: Think something up? Someone carried her off? Then they would comb the whole house and find me and our whole family. So the woman says, \\\"She came to and went to the basement.\\\" Now, our basement is full of water. So the  whole mob dashes off to the basement to look for me or my corpse. They took  flashlights; they were up to their waists in water, water which had been  standing there for years, and soot, and fuel oil. They climbed down in there  to get me. Then one of them said, \\\"There's so much water down there, she  probably walked and walked and then passed out and died. She met her death in  the basement. That's it, we can leave, no problem!\\\" I didn't know that, and  when I was told, I felt worse. Two times worse. A lot worse! So they didn't  just want to pound me flat, something more awful was awaiting me . . .  After that we of course didn't want to live in Sumgait any longer. We really  didn't want to go back to our apartment. When we moved, I went up there and  started to quiver and shake all over, because I started remembering it all.  Although the neighbors all sobbed, it was all . . . so cheap . . . The people  who sat in their apartments and didn't help us at a time like that. I think  that they could have helped! I don't think that they were obligated to, but  they could have helped us! Because that one woman was able to stop that whole  brutal crowd by herself. That means they could have, too. It would have been enough foe one man or women to say, What do you think you're doing?\\\" That's  all! That would have done it. There were 60 apartments in our building. Not  one person said it! When I was lying on the ground and all those people were  standing on their balconies I didn't hear anyone's voice, no one said what are you doing, leave her alone . . . Mamma even told one of the neighbor women  that if it had been an Azerbaijani woman in my place they would have dropped a bomb if it would have killed even one Armenian. They would have stood up for  one of their own. True, they say that our neighbor from the fourth entryway,  an old/ sick woman tried to stop the pogrom. The Azerbaijanis have a custom:  if a woman takes her scarf and throws it on the ground, the men are supposed  to stop immediately. The old woman from the fourth entryway did that, but they stomped her scarf into the ground, pushed her off to the side, and said, \\\"If you want to go on living, you'll disappear into your apartment.\\\" So she left. That trick didn't work on them.  Even the neighbors who helped us move told me, OK, fine, calm down, forget  that it happened. I said I'd only forget it if I told them right then that it had happened to their daughter--and if that didn't have any effect on them,  then I would forget everything, too. Imagine that it happened to your sister.  And no one did anything. Anything.     April 25, 1988    Yerevan     - - - reference - - -  [1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,     Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by     Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D. Caratzas, NY, pages 93-109 \",\"   Both of these symptoms are related - tachycardia. Getting a flushed face is due to the heart pumping the blood faster than a regular pulse.  I suspect this is related to an increase in sodium levels in the blood, since note *sodium chloride* monosodium glutamate. Both are sodium compounds. Our bodies require sodium, but like everything else, one can get too much of a good thing.   Again, this could be related to increased blood flow from increased heart rate, from the sodium in the MSG. Distended crainial arteries, essentially. One of many causes of headaches. There is no discrepency her, necessarily.    Well stomache ache and vomiting tend to be related. Again, not necessarily a discrepency. More likely a related reaction. Vomiting occurs as a response to get rid of a noxious compound an organism has eaten. If a person can't digest the stuff (entirely possible - the list of stuff people are allergic to is quite long), and lacks an enzyme to break it down, gastrointestinal distress (stomach or belly ache) would be expected.     These are respiratory reactions, and are now considered to be similar to vomitting. They are a way for the body to dispose of noxious compounds. They are adaptiove responses. Of course, it is possible some other food or environmental compound could be responsible for the symptoms. But it's important to remember that a lot opf these effets can be additive, synergystic, subtractive, etc, etc. It would be necessary to know exactly what was in a dish, and what else the person was exposed to. Respiratory does sound suspicious BUT  resopiration and heart rate are connected.  Things in the body are far from simple...very inetractive place, the vertebrate body.    People respond in a myriad of ways to the same compound. It depends upon what it is about the compound that \\\"pisses off\\\" their body. Pollen, for example, of some plants aggrivates breathing in many people, because, when inhaled, it sets of the immune system, and an histamine attack is launched. The immune system goes overboard, causing the allergic person a lot of misery. And someone with an allergy to some pollens will have trouble with some herb teas that contain pollens (Chamomile, linden, etc). Drinking the substance can perturb that person's system as much as inhaling it.    See above. And don't think that heart rate changes, and circulatory problems are not serious. They can be deadly.  and brain damage.   The area of the brain effected is the neuroendocrine system controlling the release of gonadotropin, the supra-hormone controlling the cyclical release of testosterone and estradiol, as well as somatostatin, and other steroids. Testing for effective dose would be, uh, a wee bit unethical.   poisoning.   Absolutely. But it could also be some synergystic mess from eating , say, undetected shrimp or mushrooms (to which many are allergic), plus too much alcohol, and inhaling too much diesel fumes biking home, plus, let's say, having contracted flu from one's sig. other 3 days before from drinking out of the same glass. Could be all sorts of things.  But it might be the MSG.    If noone else got sick, its likely not food poisoning. Probably stomach flu or an undetected thing the guy's allergic to.   Anyway, the human body's not a machine; people vary widely in their responses, and a lot of reactions are due to combinations of things.\",\"I recently purchased a Diamond Stealth 24 Video card and received the wrong drivers.

McMillin) rants:  And how did the \\\"free love advocates of the 1960's\\\" manage to perform this demolition--forced breeding programs or something?   Now let me get this straight.  After a nice, long rant about how people need to take personal responsibility for their economic and social lives, all of a sudden 1960's radicals (such as me, I guess) are responsible for poor people's lifestyles?  Tell me how that works--or do you think that poor people are just too dumb to think for themselves?  There are many reasons for the disintegration of the family and support systems in general among this nation's poor.  Somehow I don't think Murphy Brown--or Janis Joplin--is at the top of any  sane person's list.  You want to go after my generation's vaunted cultural revolution for a lasting change for the worse, try so-called \\\"relevant\\\" or \\\"values\\\" education.  Hey, it seemed like a good idea at the time.

If you have an idea about its voltage and current  ratings, e.g. 60VDC @ 6A, you can probably get away with replacing it with  anything with better specs.  Early MOSFETS had a gate-source voltage rating  of approximately +/- 20 VDCmax, and they would usually turn completely \\\"ON\\\"  at +10VDC.  Otherwise, MOSFETS are not really mysterious -- they're more or  less voltage controlled current sources.  If the MOSFET in your circuit is  used as an open-loop, voltage controlled current source, you may have to  experiment with various gain-altering techniques.\",\"  Well said, Michael!  The Catholic traditon has a list of behaviours called the Spiritual  Works of Mercy:  admonish the sinner instruct the ignorant counsel the doubtful comfort the sorrowful bear wrongs patiently forgive all injury pray for the living and the dead (yes, I know there is some controversy                             on this and I don't want to argue about it.)  These are all things that have a direct application to usenet.  People  ask questions and express doubts.  Some are in need of comfort or  prayers.

Chuck Browning\",\"/ iftccu:talk.politics.guns / mikey@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu (Strider) /  8:51 pm  Apr 12, 1993 /   I've been watching this knife verses gun bit for a while now, (even contributed a few comments) but this stuff \\\"I'd rather face a knife than a gun\\\" has GOT to come from ignorance!  I used to think pretty much the same thing, then I got 'educated.'  People do not as a rule understand how deadly knives can be, or how quickly you can be killed with one.  Most people don't understand that it takes less than an inch of penetration in some areas to cause quick (within a minute or so) death.  The death rates from handguns and knives are within a few percentage points of each other.  Many people not realizing how deadly knives are 'try their luck' and thus more get injured by knives.  A gun is deadly only in a single direction and it's only advantage is that it is a remote control weapon.  A contact weapon such as a knife controls a spherical area 7 to 10 feet in diameter.  Most people have never seen knife wounds, aside from slicing a finger by accident.  From 21 feet or so, a knife is very nearly an even match for a holstered gun in experienced hands, even if the knife wielder has only moderate skill.  From inside 10 feet or so, a knife is a match for a DRAWN gun.  A knife is utterly silent, it never jams and never runs out of ammunition.  It is limited only by the speed, dexterity skill and ability of it's wielder.  Criminals in general are young, fast and strong.  It's interesting to note that the patterned slashing attacks used by many martial artists remarkably resemble the wild uncontrolled slashing attacks of novices.  I've talked to several well trained martial artists.  They have unanimously agreed that if they ever go up against a knife they simply plan on being cut, hopefully not as bad as the attacker.  Practicing with firearms requires facilities and equipment.  Practicing with knives requires only a small area and something to simulate a knife, say a popsicle stick or tooth brush.  Criminals practice their knife attacks in prison.  If you have not trained against knives with a firearm and do not realize these facts the first inkling you will have that something is wrong is the knife ripping through your throat, or in the case of an experienced attacker, parts of your body falling off onto the ground.  A 60 year old man with arthritis can close that 7 yard distance and gut you in about one and a half seconds.  Dennis Tueller with a broken leg in a walking cast managed it in two.  I've seen people close that distance and strike in 1 second.  I'm old, over weight and slow.  I can do it in 1.3 seconds.  I've seen morgue footage of people killed with edged weapons that you would not believe.  (How about a single stab wound to the chest with a TABLE FORK!  In this case the attacker used the HANDLE, not the pointed end.)  Add to this the 'fact' that hand gun 'stopping' power is largely a myth. Except in the case of a central nervous system shot, or a round that destroys the skeletal structure, it takes anywhere from 3 to twelve seconds for a bullet wound to 'take effect.'  This is true of even heart shots.  There is the case of the police woman in L.A., the first recorded survivor of a .357 shot to the heart.  That lady not only killed her attacker, but chased him down to do it!  All four of her shots, fired after SHE had been shot, struck the perp.  Atta girl!  The bullet entered her on a downward angle, went through the apex of her heart, down through the diaphragm, clipped her liver and destroyed her spleen.  It then exited her back leaving a tennis ball sized hole.  She died about six times on the operating table, but was out of the hospital in 15 days and was back on full duty in eight months!  She was off duty at the time and not wearing her vest.  She was on her way home so happened to have her gun.  No, she doesn't think civilians should have the same rights.  Sigh.  The moral of the story is that even if you DO manage to shoot a knife attacker, you'd better be planning on doing some dodging.  A good alternative is to shoot for and break the pelvis.  People can often walk (a little) on broken legs but a broken pelvis will nearly always anchor them.  Many firearms schools recommend pelvis shots against contact weapons.  The target is as large as the traditional 'center of mass' and is more reliable to STOP somebody with a contact weapon, assuming a caliber powerful enough to 'do the job.'  Hot .38's on up will usually do this.  Remember folks, the idea isn't to 'take em with you' but for you to live and them to fail, whatever the consequences for them.  This the reason 'killing them' isn't our goal, or in many cases even good enough to keep us alive.  I don't want to face a violent attack of any sort.  Knowing what I now know, I can't rightly say I'd rather face a knife than an gun.  It would have to depend on the attacker, and if I could pick and choose, I WOULDN'T BE THERE.  This is really the bottom line.  Criminals do not fear the law.  Criminals do not fear the weapon.  They fear the citizen behind the weapon that has shown the resolution and determination to do whatever it takes.\",\"   This is a good idea - so you can carry your (non-alcoholic) drinks without spilling or having someone hold on to them.

The picture is a marbled gazebo on a desert with blue sky background. The size is just right for centered wallpaper on a 1024x768 display because it leaves a border at the bottom just big enough for icons to fit in without being on top of the picture. Reguarding image quality and resolution - I have not seen much better.  For those of you who haven't worked with pieced image files, here is how to put it back together.  1. save the 14 parts to 14 individual files  2. use a text editor to remove the header and footer     in each file.  3. concatinate all the parts into a single file  4. uudecode the file There are tools available to do this without the hassle such as uuconvert (UNIX) and UUcoder (Windows).

Speaking as an atheist (heterosexual, for what it's worth), this is one of the least attractive parts of some varieties of Christianity.  Although I'm sure it's possible to argue theologically that we shouldn't make analogies between discrimination on the basis of sex and race and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, morally the case looks unanswerable (for those outside religion): the three forms _are_ analogous; we shouldn't discriminate on the basis of sex, race or sexual orientation.  I found the moderator's FAQs on the subject instructive, and recommend everyone to read them.  There seem to be three different levels of acceptance:  1) Regard homosexual orientation as a sin (or evil, whatever) 2) Regard homosexual behaviour as a sin, but accept orientation (though presumably orientation is unfortunate) and dislike people who indulge 3) As 2, but \\\"love the sinner\\\" 4) Accept homosexuality altogether.  My experience is that 3 is the most common attitude (I imagine 1 and 2 are limited to a few fundamentalist sects).  I suppose I can go along with 3, except that I have this feeling that a 14--15 year old living in a community with this attitude, on discovering that they were more attracted to members of the same sex, would not feel the love of the community, but would rather feel the pressure not to exhibit their feelings.  I'm not saying that the community (in particular the parents) would not love the child, but I suspect the child would not feel loved.\",\"  : I have one complaint for the cameramen doing the Jersey-Pitt series:  Show : the shots, not the hits.

They have no meaning on other machines.   You mean the responses some of which pointed to double-blind tests which show no such \\\"chinese restaurant effect\\\" unique to MSG (it's elicited by the placebo as well.)   Like youself?  Someone who can read a scientific paper and apparently come away from it with bizarrely cracked ideas which have nothing to do with the use of this substance in human nutrition?   No, it's undisputed in the literature that glutamate is an amino acid which is an excitatory neurotransmitter.  There is also evidence that excessive release of glutamate may be involved in the pathology of certain conditions like stroke, drowning and Lou Gehrig's disease, just to name a few. This is a completely different issue than the use of this ubiquitous amino acid in foods.  People are not receiving intra-ventricular injections of glutamate.   I don't know about premier, but it's certainly an important one.   Sez you.  Such an effect in humans has not been demonstrated in any controlled studies.  Infant mice and other models are useful as far as they go, but they're not relevant to the matter at hand.  Which is not to say that I favor its use in things like baby food--a patently ridiculous use of the additive.  But we have no reason to believe that MSG in the diet effects humans adversely.   Wrong.  Do you know how much aspartate or phenylalanine is in a soft drink? Milligrams worth.  Compare that to a glass of milk.  Do you know how much glutamate is present in most protein-containing foods compared to that added by the use of MSG?

Newspaper reporters are notoriously ignorant on the subject of religion, and are prone to exaggeration in the interests of having a \\\"real\\\" story (that is, a bigger headline).  Let's back up to 1935.  At this point, we have the Masoretic text, the various targums (translations/commentaries in aramaic, etc.), and the Septuagint, the ancient greek translation.  The Masoretic text is the standard Jewish text and essentially does not vary.  In some places it has obvious corruptions, all of which are copied faithfully from copy to copy. These passages in the past were interpreted by reference to the targums and to the Septuagint.  Now, the septuagint differs from the masoretic text in two particulars: first, it includes additional texts, and second, in some passages there are variant readings from the masoretic text (in addition to \\\"fixing\\\"/predating the various corrupted passages).  It must be emphasized that, to the best of my knowledge, these variations are only signifcant to bible scholars, and have little theological import.  The dead sea scroll materials add to this an ancient *copy* of almost all of Isaiah and fragments of various sizes of almost all other OT books.  There is also an abundance of other material, but as far as I know, there is no sign there of any hebrew antecdent to the apocrypha (the extra texts in the septuagint).  As far as analysis has proceeded, there are also variations between the DSS texts and the masoretic versions.  These tend to reflect the septuagint, where the latter isn't obviously in error.  Again, though, the differences (thus far) are not significant theologically.  There is this big expectation that there are great theological surprises lurking in the material, but so far this hasn't happened.  The DSS *are* important because there is almost no textual tradition in the OT, unlike for the NT.\",\"Yes,  Take Interstate I-70 to the route 48 exit.  Go south on 48 about 2-1/2 miles.

Side question:  how about the legal ramifications of selling a used car with a replaced odometer that starts over at 0 miles, after say 100/200/300K actual miles.  Looks like fraud would be fairly easy - for the price of a new odometer, you can say it has however many miles you want to tell the buyer it has.

I've weathered attempted dog attacks before using the approved method: Slow down to screw up dog's triangulation of target, then take off and laugh at the dog, now far behind you. This time, it didn't work because I didn't have time. Riding up the hill leading to my house, I encountered a liver-and-white Springer Spaniel (no relation to the Springer Softail, or the Springer Spagthorpe, a close relation to the Spagthorpe Viking). Actually, the dog encountered me with intent to harm.  But I digress: I was riding near the (unpainted) centerline of the roughly 30-foot wide road, doing between forty and sixty clicks (30 mph for the velocity-impaired). The dog shot at me from behind bushes on the left side of the road at an impossibly high speed. I later learned he had been accelerating from the front porch, about thirty feet away, heading down the very gently sloped approach to the side of the road. I saw the dog, and before you could say SIPDE, he was on me. Boom! I took the dog in the left leg, and from the marks on the bike my leg was driven up the side of the bike with considerable force, making permanent marks on the plastic parts of the bike, and cracking one panel. I think I saw the dog spin around when I looked back, but my memory of this moment is hazy.  I next turned around, and picked the most likely looking house. The apologetic woman explained that the dog was not seriously hurt (cut mouth) and hoped I was not hurt either. I could feel the pain in my shin, and expected a cool purple welt to form soon. Sadly, it has not. So I'm left with a tender shin, and no cool battle scars!  Interestingly, the one thing that never happened was that the bike never moved off course. The not inconsiderable impact did not push the bike off course, nor did it cause me to put the bike out of control from some gut reaction to the sudden impact. Delayed pain may have helped me here, as I didn't feel a sudden sharp pain that I can remember.  What worries me about the accident is this: I don't think I could have prevented it except by traveling much slower than I was. This is not necessarily an unreasonable suggestion for a residential area, but I was riding around the speed limit. I worry about what would have happened if it had been a car instead of a dog, but I console myself with the thought that it would take a truly insane BDI cager to whip out of a blind driveway at 15-30 mph. For that matter, how many driveways are long enough for a car to hit 30 mph by the end?  I eagerly await comment.

The Federalist papers are propaganda and it is therefore difficult to determine precisely what Maddison etc were up to from them. They certainly emphasised a limited role for the federal government but this was not necessarily their true position.   The Senate was less powerful than the House of Lords in the period in question. The stripping of the powers of the House of Lords did not occur until 1914 and David Llloyd George's budget. Even despite this the House of Lords has considerable power even today and is far from a rubber stamping body.     The system is meant to be slow to react, the problem is that it ended up a bit too slow.    The Presiden't veto was meant to be entirely separate. Until Bush abused it in a quite extraordinary manner it was used more in accord with the intent of being a check on unreasonable legislation.

It is basically a collection of previously published works by those who claim that there exist Buddhist and Hindu stories that Christ visited India and China (he was known as Issa)  during the period from late teens to age 30.  Conclusion:  the book actually lets you come to your own view by presenting a summary of various published works and letters, all of which you could verify independently.  It includes refutations to such works as well.

With the flames go the prayers of about 1,200 Bay Area Zoroastrians that their faith will survive this land.     \\\"There is a fear - a real fear, too,\\\" said Silloo Tarapore of Lafayette. \\\"We have one generation to do it or to die.\\\"     Many immigrant groups struggle to maintain an identity in a strange land. But for Zoroastrians, it is an especially poignant concern.     Their religion has been around for perhaps 3,700 years, a heritage so deep it scarcely seems comprehensible in a state where \\\"historical sites\\\" are sometimes less than 100 years old.  It was the religion of the great Persian Empire under kings Cyrus and Darius.  And tradition says that when Christ was born about 500 years later, he was honored by a visit from three Zoroastrian priests, the Magi.  Scholars say many key beliefs of Christians, Jews and Muslims can be traced to the teachings of Zoroaster, the Zoroastrian prophet.     Yet, with only about 150,000 Zoroastrians in the entire world, they are  a miniscule minority in every country in which they live.  Survival as a people is very much on their minds.     Ironically, local Zoroastrians fear that the almost unlimited tolerance of the United States may do what hundreds of years of persecution followed by nearly 1,000 years of benign religious segregation could not do: cause their young people to stop thinking of themselves as Zoroastrians.     Zoroastrians do not believe theirs is the only right religion, and they actually shun the notion of trying to win converts.  So if their children become totally assimilated, they say, it's their children - rather than the world at large - who will be the losers.     \\\"It's important to have an identity,\\\" said Maneck Bhujwaia of San Jose, a leader among Zoroastrians who came here from India.  \\\"It's important for everybody - Irish, Scottish, Americans.  It gives meaning to life. You don't have to depend on the majority community to give you respect. You can fall back on your own identity.\\\"     For Zoroastrians, there's much to be proud of.     Their prophet, Zoroaster, seeking to make sense of a culture in which animal sacrifice to multiple gods was common, preached that there was only one god, a good one.  Zoroastrians call their god Ahura Mazda, which translates as Lord of Wisdom and Light.  _Good vs. evil_     Zoroaster saw life as a constant struggle between good and evil, with the good eventually winning.  Men and women could join in the battle for good, he said, and he warned that they would inevitably suffer consequences such as shame and sorrow if they did wrong.  He preached honesty, charity, kindness to animals, respect for the environment, hard work, equality of men and women - basic virtues preached by prophets of many religions.     But Zoroaster was perhaps unusual in that he told his followers not to follow him blindly.  He demanded they think for themselves.  In fact, Joseph Campbell, the famous scholar of the history and meaning of myths, traced the Western emphasis on individual thought to the Zoroastrians.     Zoroastrians have many words for thought.  Their motto, leaded into a stained glass window over the sacred fire at the temple on the slopes of Mount Hamilton, is \\\"Good thoughts, good words, good deeds.\\\"     So it's not surprising that Zoroastrians value education highly.  In India, where a contingent of Zoroastrians arrived in the ninth century to escape persecution by Muslims in Iran, Zoroastrians claim 100 percent literacy; the overall statistic in India is just 60 percent.     About half of the Bay Area Zoroastrian community came here from India and Pakistan, mostly to study at universities.  The other half fled from Iran after the 1979 revolution made that a fundamentalist Islamic state where others had no rights.     Local Zoroastrians point with pride to ways their emphasis on \\\"good deeds\\\" has improved life in every country they inhabit.  In San Jose, the recent restoration of the Hotel Sainte Clarie came about because Manou Mobedshahi, a San Francisco-based hotelier, passed the boarded-up downtown landmark on his way to and from the temple.  At the temple's dedication, the chief guest of honor was the mother of Zubin Mehta, the Zoroastrian conductor of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra.     The temple exists because of another good deed: the decision by an Iranian emigre, the late Arbab Rustom Guiv, to buy land for six temples in North America.  Besides the 10-acre site off Crothers Road on Mount Hamilton, he paid for land in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, Toronto, and Vancouver.  Until his gifts, there were no Zoroastrian temples on this continent.     Local Zoroastrians raised money to build the actual temple, and the property already had a large house that they have converted to a community center.     The temple, dedicated a year ago on the birthday of the prophet  Zoroaster, is a simple structure with gleaming white walls, vaulted  ceilings and oak floors, partially covered with huge Oriental carpets.     Its central feature is the fire, set in the middle of a partly-glassed- in area at the center of the building.  Although Zoroastrians are  sometimes called \\\"fire worshippers,\\\" they actually consider fire just  a symbol of God.  \\\"It helps us concentrate, just like Christians use the  cross and Muslims use the Holy Book,\\\" Bhujwala said.     The biggest celebration of the years occurs in early spring.  For all Iranians, including Zoroastrians, the New Year begins on the first day of the season because of its symbolism as the start of new life.  With Zoroaster's birthday just six days later, the combination of religious and secular holidays creates something on par with what most of the United States celebrates between Christmas and Jan. 1.    For this year's celebration of the prophet's birthday, about 500 people came to worship and revel.     \\\"The good things in life are not forbidden,\\\" Esfandiar Anoushiravani, a leader of the Iranian members, had said beforehand, and what followed proved him right.     Inside the temple, worshipers filled every chair and sat or stood around the edges of the room as about a half-dozen priests chanted thanksgiving prayers around a table laden with braziers of smoking sandalwood, glasses of milk and water, and a tray heaped with dried fruit and nuts.     Kids crowded around, grabbing handfuls of the treats.  \\\"People eat the fruit,\\\" Tarapore said.  \\\"It's a way to participate in the ceremony.\\\"  _Santa Claus, sort of_     The gathering even had a Santa Claus, Iranian style.

The Zoroastrians from India were charmed.  \\\"This is all new for us, too,\\\" one told a visitor who asked what was going on.     A visitor, John A. Sabanovich of Folsom, said he became intrigued with the religion years ago while on business trips to Iran.  Zoroastrians have no procedure for accepting converts - a result, some say, of their centuries of persecution in Iran followed by their promise to the Hindu king who allowed them into India that they would not interfere with his people's religion.     But that does not stop Sabavich from joining in the celebrations at the San Jose temple whenever he can.     \\\"When I first heard about this religion,\\\" he said, \\\"I thought, my God, this is what a religion should be.

Down the stretch, he : abused Jim Bunning, Chris Short, and Robin Roberts (I think those : are the three) pitching each on only 2 days rest for quite some : time.  By the time they hit the last 2 weeks of the season, : obviously none of these guys had an ounce left in their arm.  Oh : well.  Roberts was long gone -- he was probably an Oriole in 1964.  Or maybe a Colt .45.  The 3rd starter was Art Mahaffey, the previous year's ace. Dennis Bennett was the 4th starter.  They were indeed 6.5 up with 12 to go, but they won their final two games after the horrid 10-loss streak.  The final game victory (Bunning's 19th win, if memory serves) kept the Reds from tying for the title; they and the Phils were both 1 game behind the Cards, with the Giants(?) another game back.  The Mets couldn't hold an early lead against the Cards that final Sunday, or there would have been a 3-way tie.  Too bad they couldn't have saved some of the 15 or so runs they scored on Saturday when they crushed St. Louis. --\",\" That would be neat, but nowhere in the Bible does it say that one who has the gift of tounges can do this.  If the gift of tounges were the ability to be understood by everyone, no matter what languages they know, there would be no need for the gift of interpretation, and I Corinthians 14 would not have had to have been written.     That's a pretty harsh assumption to make about a several million Christians world wide.  Sure, there are some who want glory for themselves who speak in tounges, just as there are among those who do not have this gift.  There were people like this in the Corinthian church also.  that does not mean that there is no true gift or that all who speak in tounges do it for their own glory in the sight of men.   I would venture to say that a large percentage of those who do speak in tounges  do so more often in private prayer than in public.  Link Hudson\",\"  Yup.

It has a density of 0.058 lb/cu in, therefore the theoretical height for a constant section column that can just support itself is 4.8 million inches, or 400,000 ft, or 75 Statute miles.  Now, a real structure will have horizontal bracing (either a truss type, or guy wires, or both) and will be used below the crush strength. Let us assume that we will operate at 40% of the theoretical  strength.  This gives a working height of 30 miles for a constant section column.    A constant section column is not the limit on how high you can build something if you allow a tapering of the cross section as you go up.  For example, let us say you have a 280,000 pound load to support at the top of the tower (for simplicity in calculation).  This requires 2.5 square inches of column cross sectional area to support the weight.  The mile of structure below the payload will itself weigh 9,200 lb, so at 1 mile  below the payload, the total load is now 289,200 lb, a 3.3% increase.  The next mile of structure must be 3.3% thicker in cross section to support the top mile of tower plus the payload.  Each mile of structure must increase in area by the same ratio all the way to the bottom.  We can see from this that there is no theoretical limit on area, although there will be practical limits based on how much composites we can afford to by at $40/lb, and how much load you need to support on the ground (for which you need a foundation that the bedrock can support.  Let us arbitrarily choose $1 billion as the limit in costruction cost.  With this we can afford perhaps 10,000,000 lb of composites, assuming our finished structure costs $100/lb.  The $40/lb figure is just for materials cost.  Then we have a tower/payload mass ratio of 35.7:1.  At a 3.3% mass ratio per mile, the tower height becomes 111 miles.  This is clearly above the significant atmosphere.  A rocket launched from the top of the tower will still have to provide orbital velocity, but atmospheric drag and g-losses will be almost eliminated.  G-losses are the component of rocket thrust in the vertical direction to counter gravity, but which do not contribute to horizontal orbital velocity.  Thus they represent wasted thrust.  Together with drag, rockets starting from the ground have a 15% velocity penalty to contend with.  This analysis is simplified, in that it does not consider wind loads.  These will require more structural support over the first 15 miles of height.  Above that, the air pressure drops to a low enough value for it not to be a big factor.

Some boxes have internal terminators; some can be switched out and others are socketted.  These count.  If the box with internal terminations cannot be put on the end to terminate the cabling, they have to be disabled, ie, switched out or pulled out of their sockets.  If you have 2 boxes with internal terminations, the terminations in one box has to be disabled...., etc.  I am sure that this has been covered by the \\\"experts\\\".

That's *your* *interpretation* of these texts.   2 Peter 1:20-21 But know this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture is a matter  of one's own interpretation, for no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.  The study notes in my Bible offer three possible meanings for verse 20. Apparantly it's not as clear to Charles Ryrie as it is to you.  2 Timothy 3:16-17 All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work.  Galations 1:11-12 For I would have you know, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man.  For I neither received it from man,  nor was I taught it, but I receieved it through a revelation of Jesus Christ.  When I read these passages, it was not immediately clear to me what every phrase meant.  I had stop and think about the possible connotations of words, what the intent of the author may have been, wonder if the translator used the correct English word to convey the  same meaning: I had to interpret.  If you want to believe that your  are not interpreting Scripture as you read, there's probably nothing  I can say to change your mind.  But I think it's naive to think that  our culture, experiences, education, do not affect everything we read.   In college, I took an entire course in Biblical interpretation.  Go to any Christian bookstore, there are scores of books on interpreting and understanding Scripture.  If interpretation is unnecessary, there are  an awful lot of misguided Christians out there wasting a lot of time  and energy on it.\",\"  OK, you guys stirred up my childhood memories, so I went and did some research on the final month or so of the 1964 season.

The way they were used at that time may have made the problem worse, although Bunning had one of his sharpest games of the year in the final day 10-0 shutout of the Reds that cost the Reds a share of the pennant. Bunning pitched a complete game six-hitter, striking out five and walking one. It would be inetersting to see, though, how the total innings for the year for Bunning and Short stacks up against the rest of the league. Also notice that the Phillies played every day from at least September 1 through October 1; while they didn't play substantially more games than the other teams, the other teams each had a couple days off during that stretch. \",\" I've found this works pretty well on noisy laminated power transformer cores and windings (the 60Hz kind). Likewise, if anybody has tried this on a flyback I'd like to hear about it.  I would suspect it would not be as effective as it was on power transformers as the material wouldn't damp as well--something I suspect would be critical at the frequencies involved (in other words, you want absorption rather than prevention which would be real difficult at 15 KHz).  --  --------------------------------------------------------------------        Dave Medin   Phone: (205) 730-3169 (w)     SSD--Networking    (205) 837-1174 (h)     Intergraph Corp.

Your comparison with the Warsaw Ghetto uprising is insulting,     and racist beyond belief.  The attempts to quiet any violence     in the Gaza Strip are just that.  The efforts to quell murder     and mayhem in the Gaza strip were the resluts of violence and     came AFTER the violence.  It was not an arbitrary racial move     like the nazi treatment of Jews.  Jews had NOT committed acts     of violence and murder as have the residents of Gaza.  I find      your eagerness to ignore the acts of murder nothing more than     anti-Israel bigotry.

Nearly twice as many Palestinians have been murdered by other     Palestinians than in confrontations with Israel.  Hundreds of     thousands of Palestinians had been deported from Kuwait, just     because they were Palestinian.  The truth is that your phoney     concern for the welfare of the Palestinians is nothing but an     excuse to attack Israel.  You are part of the ignorant effort     to confine all concern for the welfare of the Palestinians to     attacking Israel.  But the truth is there are greater reasons     than Israel for the plight of the Palestinians.  To disregard     Jordan or Kuwait or Saudi Arabia or any of the other oil-rich      nations who do nothing for these people, is to use the plight      of these poor people as a vehicle for your hatred of Jews, or     your hatred of Israel.  Anti-semitism and anti-Zionism is NOT     the same as pro-Palestinian and anyone who insists that it is     the same really does not give two hoots for their welfare.        Your pathetic analogy is so absent of relevant fact that your     racism cannot be disguised.  Jews had never declared war on a     Polish people.  Jews had never attacked Poles with knives, or     had used the Ghetto as a staging ground for attacks.  To take     something like the Warsaw Ghetto(the creation of which you do     not even bother to discuss!)and the uprising that followed is     to degrade the dead, and to show that intelligent debate on a      difficult situation is beyond your intellectual purview.  You     clearly have never even read a single word of the Covenant of      the Islamic Resistance Movement.  Here is arguably the single     most anti-semitic genocidal document since Mein Kampf, yet it     is totally disregarded in your rantings.  Your racism is most     evident in your eagerness to avoid such documentation.  If it     were considered, you might actually have to deal with mideast     problems in a balanced manner, rather than in an anti-semitic     manner.        And just how was Gaza obtained?  Do you forget that Israel is     not in the habit of grabbing land for the hell of it, but had     taken Gaza in a war that it did not start?  Did you know land     Israel captures in wars, wars which other nations have ALWAYS     started, aren't the same as Israel, and they are subject to a      completely different set of international laws?  Since you do     continuously refer to international law, would you please say     what specific international laws Israel is violating?                  This attitude      I can cite 6,000,000 reasons why it is not.        Where is this quote?  I have never heard Rabin assert that he     wished such a thing.  Since you are in general a liar, you'll     have to provide the entire quote, with source, or this effort     will be regarded as just another one of your fabrications.        Only you are led to ask such a loaded, racist, intellectually     dishonest question.  You inability to come to terms with what     you are has turned you into a racist of the highest order.        Why do you not feel the same compassion for the Jews of Iran,     or Iraq, or Yemen, or Saudi Arabia, or Syria?  Do you have an     inkling of what they have endured over the past decades?  Or,     what about the plight of the Palestinians in Kuwait?  Or what     about the treatment of the Bosnian Muslims?  Do you think the     residents of Gaza are being subjected to what all the Muslims      in Bosnia are enduring?  Why are you indifferent to the death     and suffering of people?  Why do you not care that these folk     are being exterminated?  Why do you not care that only Israel     has given any of these people safe haven?  Could it be due to      the fact that it is not Israel who is doing the killing?  The     people in Gaza are not being exterminated.  They aren't being     killed.  They aren't being raped.  They aren't being starved.     They aren't being driven from their lands.  They are not kept     from receiving food or other supplies.  But the Bosnians are.     And the ONLY country which has provided some sanctuary to the     Bosnian Muslims is the same nation that you have devoted your      life to attacking, in the guise of compassion.          Your rantings are so unfettered by the burden of intellectual     honesty that you ought to take a deep breath and ask yourself     what your real motives are.  Do not flatter yourself into the     belief that truth or compassion are what drives you.  In your     case, it is clear that hate beats out love every time.  Maybe     you are burdened with some kind of guilt for having been born     a Jew.  It is obvious that your hatred of your own Judaism is     being dumped on all other Jews.  Why else would you suggest a     racist idea like breeding Jews out of existence?  Maybe these     fits of anti-semitism are a result of being cut off from your      own people for an extended period.  Whatever the case may be,      it is clear that you are not what you have labored so hard to      appear to be.  When you realize that you can't care for other      people while you hate yourself you might actually begin to do      some good.\",\"Does anybody have informations about the   W 86 C 451   and  W 86 C 456 chips (40pin DIL pckg)?

In my encounters with Christians, I find myself dismayed by their belief that their faith is total truth.  According to them, their beliefs come from the Bible and the bible is the word of God and God is truth - thus they know the truth.  This stance makes it difficult to discuss other faiths with them and my own hesitations about Christianity because they see no other way. Their way is the 'truth.'  But I see their faith arising from a willful choice to believe a particular way.  That choice is part faith and part reason, but it seems to me a choice.  My discussions with some Christians remind me of schoolyard discussions when I was in grade school:  A kid would say, \\\"All policemen are jerks!\\\"  I'd ask, \\\"How do you know?\\\"  \\\"Because my daddy told me so!\\\"  \\\"How do you know you're daddy is right?\\\"  \\\"He says he's always right!\\\"  Well the argument usually stops right there.  In the end, aren't we all just kids, groping for the truth?  If so, do we have the authority to declare all other beliefs besides our own as false?  -------------  This is only my third time browsing through this newsgroup.  I apologize if I'm covering tired old ground.  Some of the discussions on this topic have piqued my interest and I welcome any comments.  --   [I'm sort of mystified about how a Christian might respond to this.  I can understand criticisms of Christianity that say there's not enough evidence to believe it, or that there's just as good evidence for other religions.  I don't agree, but clearly there are plenty of intelligent people who don't find the evidence convincing.  But that doesn't seem to be your point.  Rather, you seem upset that people who believe Christianity is true also believe that things which contradict it are false.  This suggests a model of spiritual things that's rather different than the Christian one.  It sounds more like an existentialist view, where people choose what value to follow, but there's no actual independent spiritual reality, and so no way to say that a specific choice is in some unique sense right.  This sort of model -- with modifications of one sort or another -- may be appropriate for some religions.  But Christianity is in its essense a \\\"historical\\\" religion.  That is, it's based on the concept that there are actual spiritual entities out there, that one of them has intervened in history in specific ways, and that we see evidence of that in history.  In the \\\"mundane\\\" world, we are not free to choose how things work.  When we drop something, it falls (aside from well-defined situations where it doesn't).  The Christian concept is that spiritual matters, there is also an actual external reality.  I hope we're all honest enough not to claim that we have perfect understanding.  But while we may not think we know everything, we are confident that we know some things.  And that implies that we think things that contradict them are false.  I don't see how else we could proceed.  This needn't result in arrogance.  I'm certainly interested in talking with people of other religions.  They may have things to teach me, and even if they don't, I respect them as fellow human beings.  But it's got to be possible to respect people and also think that on some matters they are wrong.  Maybe even disasterously wrong.\",\"Mike Sixsmith, on the 16 Apr 93 10:07:55 GMT wibbled:  [ very interesting (yawn) stuff deleted, because I'm like that... ]  : Formal training is in my view absolutely essential if you're going to : be able to ride a bike properly and safely.

If you were to ask a Buddhist atheist...    Actually, yes and no, Hell is eternal death.  Actually, the way       I've had it related to me, it's more of an eternal damnation,      where sinners will feel the licking flames of Hell.  If I      supposedly can feel these flames, I would assume I'm still      alive, but suffering and away from God.

Canon (from the latin) means a rule.  If we say that a rule is open then its a rule made to be broken.   There is an issue also of measurement against a rule.  Thus the words that are spoken need to be compared against the rule/canon but not added to the canon.  Is new revelation necessary?  Topical, current, personal revelation I'd say is necessary.  New revelation for all people for all times is not necessary as we have that in Scripture.  You also seem to confuse canon with scripture.  Scripture may speak of itself being open - ie God speaking today.  It would speak that it is closed in the sense that the canon is unchangeable.  (Though the concept of canon is later historically.)   I agree with the problem of confusion.  If prophecy is meant to encourage, exhort or correct then is an overlap with scripture.  If prophecy is meant to bring a `word' of the form \\\"the man you live with is not your husband\\\" then that is knowledge.  Yet the exact words their are scripture. I would expect the difference to be the motive and means for delivery. The reading of scripture itself can be a powerful force.  Regards  David\",\"  Yes.   Look up XV_DEPTH.

Hopefully, you won't get flamed, either.  You will, however, be argued with.  I personally think that your project is built on unsteady ground.  First, I do not believe that there is any way to find an \\\"objective morality\\\".  Morality and value are inherently subjective - they represent the beliefs of a person or a group of people.  They can be widely held, perhaps even overwhelmingly held, but they are never and _can_ never be objective.   Second, I do not accept the assumptions that you make here.  If, as you say, you are trying to be objective, then why accept a morality to begin with by using the Christian Bible?  You're defeating your own purpose by doing so.    Third, call me a pessimist, but you won't stop the flamage.  There will always be people who pop upin alt.sex.* to tell us how sick and twisted and evil we all are.  Just out of curiosity, do alt.sex readers show up unprovoked in the religion groups to tell you all that you are narrow-minded, censoring, overbearing totalitarianists?    Hm.  Let me provide an example.  Four people get together over dinner, to discuss morality: you, me, a rather conservative Moslem, and a sociopath.  I start off by saying that I think it's immoral to force people to have sex with you.  You agree, but also say that it is immoral to have sex with someone of your own gender.  (Just a note: I really don't know your views on homosexuality, I am just using this as a common view of morality for the purposes of this example.)  The Moslem says that it is immoral for women to have their faces uncovered.  The sociopath, who has become bored, kills all three of us and eats us, but feels no guilt because he has done nothing wrong morally in his own mind.

Yes, and this theme is usually what the better stories are about.  However, they are not always selfish - I could point to examples in the work of Elf Sternberg, for example.

Your Whole Picture [TM] unfortunately only applies to people who accept your church.           In addition, if sex is for procreation, then  1) Why did God make it pleasurable, so that people would want to do it, rather than building it in as instinct? 2) Why did God make it fallible?  Not every sexual encounter results in pregnancy, even among Catholics.  Does this mean that they have sinned?     Granted.   Pornography would not tend in those directions if there were not a demand for it.  Many people have violent fantasies that they would never act out in real life, but will think about and read about and mull over.

What if it relates to something that isn't explicitly spelled out in the Quran?  Also, the Quran wasn't written down during the life of Muhammed either.

It is positively the worst car I have ever owned. I had an 83 Prelude that had 160k miles on it when I sold it, and it was still going strong .  This is with religious attention to maintenance such as oil changes etc. Both cars were driven in exactly the same manner..    1. It has gone through two clutches (which are underrated.)   2. 3 sets of tires (really eats tires in the front even with careful align)   3. All struts started leaking about 25-30k miles   4. Windshield wiper motor burned up (service note on this one)   5. Seek stop working on radio about 20k miles   6. Two timing belts.   7. Constant error signals from computer.    8. And finally. A rod bearing went out on the No. 1 piston seriously damaging      the crankshaft, contaminating the engine etc. When the overhaul was done      last week it required new crankshaft, one new cam shaft (has two) because      the camshaft shattered when they tried to mill it. The camshaft took 4      weeks to get because it is on national back order.        Everything on the engine is unique to the 1986 year. They went to a new      design in 87.

The Israelis are much worse than the Nazis ever were anyway.  The Nazis did a lot of good for Germany, and they would have succeeded if it weren't for the damn Jews.

Why shouldn't cost and safety be used (at least in part) to determine legality?  I'd like to see you *prove* that drug legalization is an idiotic idea. Seems to me the evidence from Great Britain is pretty convincing that  drug legalization is a good idea.  Even such a noted conservative as William F. Buckley supports it.

(Well, there's also my policy of never picking a Buck Rodgers' team for last)   The 1961 Angels were  1/2 game out of 7th. The Athletics and  expansion Senators finished tied for last.  The 1962 Colt 45's finshed 8th - ahead of the Cubs (the Mets were last). The 1969 Royals finshed 4th - ahead of the White Sox (the Pilots in last). The 1977 Mariners finished 6th - ahead of the Athletics(in last).  Apparently being an expansion team with a poor A's or Chicago  team around is a `good thing'   This may be an appropriate comparison. The 1929-31 Yankees finshed 2nd, 3rd and 2nd finshing  18, 16 and 13-1/2 games out of first.  In 1933,'34 and '35 they also finished second ( though they were only 7, 7 and 3 games out).

The four stage version is used mostly for escape (and geosynchronous?) orbits, while the 3 stage version is used for low earth orbits.  Since this is the version that launched Mir and the Salyuts (and the add-on modules for Mir), as long as Centaur is smaller than Mir (which I believe it is), it should fit under the shroud.

 Good point. I have no idea how either of my Hondas will handle at 100+ mph, nor do they reach 155. However, using `high' to be 70-90 mph:  a) They are quite amenable to long high speed drives. I've done several 1k mile+ trips in my Civic with no problems whatsoever. The last big trip I made was driving from New York to Texas. I remember driving 700-800 miles a day at typically 75-85 mph  without any problems. I'm sure I   would have been more comfortable driving a benz, but no white knuckles. No problems with winds and curves.   Then there was the trip back from New Orleans after Mardi Gras - where we were doing 80+ all the way to Houston. No problems.  b) Both my cars have surprising good fuel economy at high speeds. I see no difference between sustained 60 mph and sustained 80mph. On the trip back from New Orleans, we got about 30 mpg in my Integra, quite ok. Mind you, the engine revs to almost 4k at 80. The civic is markedly better than the Integra in fuel economy. 50k miles down the road, I still get 35 mpg at 70-75 mph driving.    Now now, you can't compare a diesel with a gasoline engine. I see enough bmws and gasoline mercs for sale that have 100-150k miles on them and advertise  rebuilt engines. If honda was to build an accord for 30k, I'd darn well expect the sucker to last 300k miles.   Ever got caught behind a early 80's 300SDL at a stop light? It's not pleasant. The newer MB's are a lot better though. The diesel Volvos and VWs are probably the smelliest offenders.  As for economy, why should we care? Gas is cheap!

Back in September I was listening to WIP, and I remember the morning guys were talking with Mayor Ed Rendell.  The topic of conversation was a new ball park for the Phillies.  The location for this new park was suggested to be near 30th St Station.  At the time, the mayor was optimisitic that in the future this could become a reality.  Has there been any new news on this subject or is it still a pipe dream? I know the city of Philadelphia has other projects ahead, such as the new convention center and the upcoming Spectrum II.  But it would be nice to see this a reality.  It is planned that the Phillies leave the VET and leave it solely to the Eagles (and if that's the case, the Eagles should make the VET a grass stadium, but that's another story).

I'll list the actual performance ranges, which should convince anyone that such a statement is absurd:\",\" Tests suck! Post a real message! :^) \",\"  And some comments, with some players deleted.   Yep, that Kevin Mitchell.  I never would have expected him in the #1 spot.  It's no accident that the first two names are 1988 only.  As with first and second base, 1988 was the year of the glove.  Average DA was 20 points higher in both leagues than any other year.  Looks good.  Too bad he's moving to short.  Highest five-year regular, though he's only had one year as good as Kevin Mitchell :->.  The other elite fielders in the league.  This is an interesting line.  His 1988 figure was slightly below average. His 1990 was pathetic, and his 1991 was the next best year by anybody.  Part of that may be his mobility.  1988 was with the Yankees.  1990 was with the Padres, who appear to have a rotten infield.  1991 was with the Twins, and judging by Leius and Gaetti, the Metrodome may be a good place to play third.  Add another to the elite fielders list.  Too fielders whose career average may overstate their value.  I don't know what happened to Caminiti -- judging by the three previous years, his low 1992 may be a fluke.  Sabo is merely average, however.  His incredible 1988 (best year ever) brings his average up a lot.  Strange last two years.  According to reputation, one of the best fielders ever at third base. But at the end, he was below average.  (Average in 1988 was .643).  Boggs has been pretty good.  I don't know what happened in 1990, but every other year he has been above average, usually by quite a bit.  Last year -- a fluke or a portent?  Why is it that the two leagues usually have defensive averages very close to one another, but very different from year to year?  Any ideas?  Brook  is declining.  Three first-time regulars, above average in 1992.  I'm not sure why Jefferies gets all the grief about his fielding.  He's never had a good year, but while at second he improved to become an average fielder, and is an average fielder at third.  Zeile, on the other hand, is a below average fielder.  Each year he's about 10 points below average.  And it's probably not just the park, since Terry Pendleton had excellent DAs in the three years before this.  Moving back to second was a good idea.  So why is Hayes supposed to be good defensively?  He's had a grand total of one year above the league DA, and was pretty bad last year.  Howard Johnson and Carney Lansford -- separated at birth.  To his credit, HoJo did have one above average year (1990).  Lansford couldn't even break the .600 mark without the help of the year of the glove.  Good hitter, but his fielding needs work.  Not a good fielder.  Both are better off at shortstop.  Two consecutive horrible years for Leo.  Camden Yards doesn't seem to have helped his fielding any.    Texas slugger debuts with not only the lowest career DA, but the lowest DA at third ever.  Congratulations, Dean. --  Dale J.

I have delved a bit deeper (XKeyEvent) and found what I was looking for.  ev->state   has a bunch of masks to check against (LockMask is the one for CapsLock).  Unfortunately, it appears that the NumLock mask varies from server to server.  How does one tell what mask is numlock and which are for Meta (Mod1Mask, Mod2Mask, Mod3Mask, Mod4Mask, Mod5Mask). eg, SGI's vendor server has Mod2Mask being NumLock, whereas Solaris 1.0.1 OpenWindows 3.0 has Mod3Mask for NumLock.  Is there an unambiguous means of determining NumLock's mask at runtime for any given server?  Sorry for the wasted bandwidth and my appalling ignorance.\",\"I noticed several years ago that when I took analgesics fairly regularly, (motrin at the time), I seemed to get a lot of migraines.  But had forgotten about that until I started reading some of the posts here. I generally don't take NSAIDS or Tylenol for headaches, because I've found them to be ineffective.  However, I have two other pain sources that force me to take NSAIDS (currently Naprosyn).  First, is some pelvic pain that I get at the beginning of my period, and then much worse at midcycle.  I have had surgery for endometriosis in the past (~12 years ago), so the Drs. tell me that my pain is probably due to the endometriosis coming back.  I've tried Synarel, it reduced the pain while I took it (3 mos), but the pain returned immediately after I stopped.  Three doctors have suggested hysterectomy as the only \\\"real solution\\\" to my problem.  Although I don't expect to have any more children, I don't like the idea of having my uterus and one remaining ovary removed (the first ovary was removed when I had the surgery for endometriosis).  One of the Drs that suggested I get a hysterectomy is an expert in laser surgery, but perhaps thinks that type of procedure is only worthwhile on women who still plan to have children.  So basically all I'm left with is toughing out the pain.  This would be impossible without Naprosyn (or something similar - but not aspirin, that doesn't work, and Motrin gave me horrible gastritis a few years ago, so I'm through with it).  In fact, Naprosyn works very well at eliminating the pain if I take it regularly as I did when I had severe back pain (and pain in both  legs) as I'll discuss in a moment.  Generally though, I wait until I have the pain before I take the Naprosyn, but then it takes several hours for it reduce the pain (it's actually quite effective at reducing the pain, it just takes quite a while).  In the meantime I'm frequently in severe pain.  The other pain source I have is chronic lower back pain resulting in bilateral radiculopathy.  I've had MRIs, Xrays, CT scan, and EMGs (I've had 2 of them, and don't intend to ever do that again) with nerve conduction tests.  The tests have not been conclusive as to what is causing my back and leg pain.  The MRI reports both say I have several bulging, degeneratig disks, and from the Xrays (and MRI, I think) it is apparent that I have arthritis.  The reading on the CT scan was that there are two herniations (L3-L4, and L4-L5), but others hav looked at the films and concluded that there are no herniations. The second EMG and nerve conduction studies shows significant denervation compared to the first EMG.  Oh yeah, I had some other horrible test, called something like Somatic Evoked Response which showed that the \\\"internal nerves\\\" are working fine.   Anyway, the bottom line is that I sometimes have severe pain in both legs and back pain.  The back pain is there all the time, but I can live with it.  When the leg pain is there, I need some analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication to reduce the pain to a level where I can work.  So I took Naprosyn regulary for 6-9 months (every time I tried to stop the leg pain got worse, so I'd  always resume).  Since last November I have taken it much less frequently, and primarily for the pelvic pain.  I have been going to physical therapy for the last 8 months (2-3 times a week).  After the first month or so, my therapist put me on pelvic traction (she had tried it earlier, but it had caused a lot of pain in my back, this time she tried it at a lower weight).  After a month or two, the pain in my legs began going away (but the traction aways caused discomfort in my lower back, which could be reduced with ultrasound and massage).  So now, I don't have nearly as much pain in my legs, in fact my therapist took me off traction about 2 weeks ago.  Getting back to my original reason for this post...  Even if I can avoid taking analgesic for headaches, I really can't avoid them entirely because I have other pain sources, that \\\"force\\\" me to use them (Oh, I forgot to mention that it has been suggested to me that I have back surgery, but I'm avoiding that too).  I find the migraines difficult to deal with, occassionally I have to take off work, but usually I can work, but at a reduced capacity (I'm a systems engineer and do a lot of reading and writing).  When the pelvic pain is bad, I can't concentrate much, I usually end up jumping out of my chair every few minutes, because the pain is so bothersome.  When the pain in my back is bad, it can cause severe burning in both legs, shooting pains in my legs, electric shock type of pain in my feet and toes, and basically when it gets bad I can't really sit at all.  Then I end up spending most of my time home and in bed.  So even if the analgesics contribute to the migraines, the migraines are more tolerable than the other pain sources.  I get a lot of migraines, an average of 3 to 4 a month, which last 1-3 days. I've taken cafergot (the first time the caffiene really got to me so I reduced the dosage), but I don't like the side effects (if I take more than two I get diahrea).  If I get a very bad headache, I will eventually take the cafergot.  My neurologist wasn't very helpful when I told him my problems with cafergot, he said that when sumatriptan becomes available, I should try that.  I've tried several other medications (fiornal, midrin, fiornal with codeine, tegretol, and inderal) but they either didn't work, or I couldn't tolerate them.  So what can I do? My doctor's seem to be satisfied with me just trying to tolerate the pain, which I agree with most of the time, but not when I have a lot of pain.

The article starts with \\\"A leader of the NASA team in charge of redesigning the planned space station said yesterday the job is tough and may be impossible.\\\" O'Connor is quoted saying whether it is possible to cut costs that much and still provide for meaningful research \\\"is a real question for me.\\\" O'Connor said \\\"everything is fair game,\\\" including \\\"dropping or curtailing existing contracts with the aerospace industry, chopping management of the space station program at some NASA facilities around the country, working closely with the Russian space station Mir, and using unmanned Titan rockets to supplement the manned space shuttle fleet.\\\"  O'Connor says his team has reviewed 30 design options so far, and they are sorting the serious candidates into three categories based on cost.  The Post says O'Connor described the design derived from the current SSF as a high cost option (I believe Kathy Sawyer, the Post writer, got confused here. I listened in on part of O'Connor's briefing to the press on Monday, and in one part of the briefing O'Connor talked about how the White House wants three options, sorted by cost [low, medium, and high]. In another part of the briefing, he discussed the three teams he has formed to look at three options [SSF derivative @ LaRC, modular buildup with Bus-1 @ MSFC, and Single Launch Core [\\\"wingless Orbiter\\\"] @ JSC. Later, in response to a reporters question, I thought I heard O'Connor say the option based on a SSF redesign was a \\\"moderate\\\" cost option, in between low & high cost options. Not the \\\"high cost\\\" option as Sawyer wrote).  The article goes on to describe the other two options as \\\"one features modules that could gradually be fitted together in orbit, similar to the Russian Mir. The other is a core facility that could be deposited in orbit in a single launch, like Skylab. That option would use existing hardware from the space shuttle - the fuselage, for example, in its basic structure.\\\"\",\"#>So instead of calling it interest on deposits, you call it *returns on investements* #>and instead of calling loans you call it *investing in business* (that is in other words #>floating stocks in your company).  # #No, interest is different from a return on an investment.  For one #thing, a return on an investment has greater risk, and not a set return #(i.e. the amount of money you make can go up or down, or you might even #lose money).  The difference is, the risk of loss is shared by the #investor, rather than practically all the risk being taken by the #borrower when the borrower borrows from the bank. #  But is it different from stocks ?

It was just as alarming to us as to you; the Bible says that nobody knows when the second coming will take place. \",\" And has been rather thoroughly demolished as myth by Robert Scott Root- Bernstein.  See his book, \\\"Discovering\\\".  Ring structures for benzene had been proposed before Kekule', after him, and at the same time as him. The current models do not resemble Kekule's.  Many of the predecessors of Kekule's structure resemble the modern model more.  I don't think \\\"extra-scientific\\\" is a very useful phrase in a discussion of the boundaries of science, except as a proposed definiens.  Extra-rational is a better phrase.  In fact, there are quite a number of well-known cases of extra-rational considerations driving science in a useful direction.  For example, Pasteur discovered that racemic acid was a mixture of enantiomers (the origin of stereochemistry) partly because he liked a friend's crank theory of chemical action.  The friend was wrong, but Pasteur's discovery stood.  A prior investigator (Mitscherlich), looking at the same phenomenon, had missed a crucial detail; presumably because he lacked Pasteur's motivation to find something that distinguished racemic acid from tartaric (now we say: d-tartaric) acid.  Again, Pasteur discovered the differential fermentation of enantiomers (tartaric acid again) not because of some rational conviction, but because he was trying to produce yeast that lived on l-tartaric acid.  His notebooks contained fantasies of becoming the \\\"Newton of mirror-image life,\\\" which he never admitted publically.  Perhaps the best example is the discovery that DNA carries genes.  Avery started this work because of one of his students, and ardent Anglophile and Francophobe Canadian, defended Fred Griffiths' discoveries in mice. Most of Griffiths' critics were French, which decided the issue for the student.  Avery told him to replicate Griffiths' work in vitro, which the student eventually did, whereupon Avery was convinced and started the research program which, in 15 or so years, produced the famous discovery (Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty, JEM 1944).\",\" I'm not sure it is a major limiting move... in the academic circles I've seen, arguing for increased government intervention and management is almost always a plus (not the least because it usually means more high paying jobs for academics as \\\"advisors\\\").  Also consider that it looks like Denning has some decent NSA / government connections, which is always a plus for an academic institute that wants more government funding and work tossed their way.  Despicable, yes; career limiting, well, the publicity probably outweighs the drawbacks.  And there are a whole bunch of people who think the whole thing is just peachy keen. If it's only going to be used against drug dealers, child pornographers, and terrorists, well it must be good. :p\",\"I suspect that this clipper thing could backfire on the Gov in a big hurry. I expect that products using these chips will socket them rather than soldering them, since once the keys are handed over by the escrow agencies, the chip is so much garbage, and will need to be replaced. I expect that someone will come along with a pin compatible chip that uses secure encryption -- possibly even disguised so that it's not possible to tell it from the clipper chip until you try to use the 2 backdoor keys.     If I were to manufacture such a chip, as part of my marketing strategy, I would try to subvert one or both escrow agencies either through bribes or industrial espionage -- and then publicize the fact. (doing my best not to be connected with such activities -- which would likely not be legal :-) Publicly discrediting the escrow agencies would go quite far towards creating a market for a secure alternative.    I also believe that someone will reverse engineer the clipper chip, and knowlege of the algorithm will likely be fairly widespread. Any back- doors or weaknesses would further discredit the scheme, and help grow the market demand for a secure alternative.   I believe that the company that provides such an alternative will make few friends in the LE community, but lots of money. I also believe that the government will do it's best to make such plug replacements illegal. I expect that they will see the same success in limiting the availability of such alternatives as they have seen in limiting the availability of certain illicit drugs -- ie. little to none.\",\"I want to start a DSP project that can maniplate music in a stereo cassette.

But here is how i understand it.  At Speed,  Near supersonic.  The wind behaves like a fluid pipe. It becomes incompressible.  So wind has to bend away from the wing edges.

Helsingfors IFK have been around since 1897 but fans only started taking hockey seriously in the 1960s so I think you're exagerating here.   That's a rather bold claim, in the light of how successful the Canadian & American Olympic teams have been . . . and they've had to play according to our set of rules and on international ice. The 1992 Olympic teams contained about as much talent as your average expansion team. Canada had Eric Lindros, Sean Burke, Joe Juneau and Chris Kontos. Another four or five have been deep subs in the NHL. As for the Yanks, Keith Tkachuk, Scott Lachance, Bret Hedican, Shawn  McEachern, Steve Heintze, Ted Donato, Joe Sacco and Bill Guerin have been  3rd/4th line players in the NHL, while Robb Stauber has done well for the  Kings in goal. Nothing more. In fact, I'm sure that an All-Star team assembled from the best Finnish League teams would do no better in the NHL than Hartford  or Tampa Bay currently are doing. --- But what happens if _all_ top-class Finnish & Swedish players gradually end up with Helsinki & Stockholm as the North American-based ones gradually retire and no Canadian/American team is allowed to draft new players from Scandinavia?  Here is what THE HOCKEY NEWS scouts think of our NHL-based players:  (28-30=superstar) (23-27=star) (18-22=NHL regular+) (13-17=NHL regular) ( 8-12=role player)  FINLAND:    D-Jyrki Lumme.......20 D-Teppo Numminen....20 D-Peter Ahola.......13  C-Jari Kurri........25 C-Christian Ruuttu..16  R-Teemu Selanne.....27  L-Esa Tikkanen......20 (Obviously, Selanne's ratings would be higher today than they were in January)  SWEDEN: D-Ulf Samuelsson....21 D-Fredrik Olausson..20 D-Niklas Lidstrom...18 D-Calle Johansson...18 D-Kjell Samuelsson..17 D-Tommy Sjodin......13 D-Tommy Albelin......7  C-Mats Sundin.......26 C-Thomas Steen......18  R-Thomas Sandstrom..22 R-Ulf Dahlen........18 R-Michael Nylander..13  L-Per-Erik Eklund...18 L-Johan Garpenlov...16 L-Mikael Andersson..15 L-Jan Erixon........14  This would be interesting. Clearly, Finland's top five players (Winnipeg's Selanne & Numminen, Vancouver's Lumme, Los Angeles' Jari Kurri and New York's Tikkanen) are right up there with any five-man unit Pittsburgh & co. have. But I have my doubts about the home-based Finnish players - the national team did well in the Canada Cup and World Championships largely due to the efforts of Markus Ketterer (the goalie), 3-4 or the players listed above and luck. There's presumably a lot of decent players in Finland that wouldn't be superstars at the highest level but still valuable role players, however. My guess would be that the Finnish Canada Cup team would be a .500 team in the NHL. --- Sweden is easier to judge because they have more players in North America. Their points total (16 players) is 274 - seven more than Ottawa's 22 top players combined! If we estimate there are six more NHL regulars back home in  Sweden, an all-Swedish team would assemble about 350-360 skill points. Deducting some points from Pittsburgh, NY Rangers and other teams that rely on Swedish players, the Swedish team would finish in sixth place - about as high as Boston, Vancouver, Calgary and Montreal on paper! So, the \\\"dynasty\\\" talk isn't completely unfounded here. An all-Finnish/all-Swedish team might have an advantage because the players would be playing at home half of the time, won't have to adapt to a foreign country and a foreign language, and presumably play the wide-open European variant of hockey rather than have to learn the North American checking game. However, if free agency becomes a factor the top  Scandinavian players still might end up playing for large-market teams after a  couple of years the same way Edmonton's \\\"dynasty\\\" crumbled in the late '80s.  Some fringe players likely will be drafted by other NHL teams as having an  exclusive talent pool might be a bit unfair after all. I'd settle for a  compromise, prohibit all European teams from signing a North American during  the first two rounds but allow them to keep their top two players. After this,  the amateur draft should be open to anyone.  \",\" I'd be willing to make two wagers: 1) Snow doesn't win ROY. 2) Mattingly is out of baseball within five years.  I'm skeptical of the first, because I don't think Snow is that good a player, and he is on a losing team.  I'm skeptical of the second because of his back.  Mattingly is 32 this year, and how many players play until they are 40?  Not too many, and most of them didn't have chronic back problems when they were 32.  Could be wrong on either or both, but I think that's the smart way to bet...\",\" Jim, please, that's a lame explanation of the trinity that Jesus provides above.

Sorry, but the events today made me even more negative concering organized religion.  Cheers, Kent\",\" Ever hear about cutting off the electricity? That was done. How effective is an electric stove then?\",\"  I sure hope so. Because, the unspeakable crimes of the Armenians must  be righted. Armenian invaders burned and sacked the fatherland of  Urartus, massacred and exterminated its population and presented to  the world all those left from the Urartus, as the Armenian civilization.  All reliable Western historians describe how Armenians ruthlessly exterminated 2.5 million Muslim women, children and elderly people of  Eastern Anatolia and how they collaborated with the enemies of the  Ottoman Empire between 1914-1920.  It is unfortunately a truth that Armenians are known as collaborators of the Nazis during World War II and that, even today, criminal/Nazi members of the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism Triangle preach and instigate racism, hatred, violence and terrorism among peoples.   And x-Soviet Armenia continues its anti-Turkish policy in the following  ways:  1. x-Soviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide in order to shift international public opinion away from its political responsibility.  2. x-Soviet Armenia, employing ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism  Triangle and criminal/Nazi Armenians, attempts to call into question the  veracity of the Turkish Genocide.  3. x-Soviet Armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism through the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to  silence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests.  4. Using all its human, financial, and governmental resources, x-Soviet Armenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence through terrorism, bribery and other subversive methods, non-Turkish supporters of the Turkish cause, be they political, governmental and humanitarian.  Using all the aforementioned methods, the x-Soviet Armenian government  is attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community from making the Turkish Case a contemporary issue.  Yet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian government and its terrorist and revisionist organizations, in the last decades, thanks to the struggle  of those whose closest ones were systematically exterminated by the Armenians, the international wall of silence on this issue has begun to collapse, and  consequently a number of governments and organizations have become  supportive of the recognition of the Turkish Genocide.  Serdar Argic\",\" What's your favorite body part? :-) \",\"   Bill, I find it rather remarkable that you managed to zero in on what is probably the weakest evidence.    What is probably the most convincing is the anti-Christian literature put out by the Jewish councils in the second century.  There are enormous quantities of detailed arguments against Christianity, many of the arguments still being used today.  Despite volumes of tracts attacking Christianity, not one denies the existance of Jesus, only of his activities.    I find this considerably more compelling than Josephus or the harmony of the gospels (especially considering that Matthew and Luke probably used Mark as a source).\",\"ha... all this talk about changing the clock speed of the q700 makes me ask??  if i replaced the 8mhz 68000 in my plus with a 16mhz 68000 with a 16mhz clock occilater of its own( not shared by the rest of the mac... just the new 16mhz68000)  would my mac work..... and if it would work.. would you think there where be any problems with sound, vidio,scsi........  it seems like a simple solution to keepa dead slow mechine a live a little longer..

WordPerfect encryption has been shown to be very easy to break.   The method uses XOR with two repeating key streams: a typed password   and a byte-wide counter initialized to 1+<the password length>. Full   descriptions are given in Bennett [BEN87] and Bergen and Caelli   [BER91].    decrypt WordPerfect document files and I think I have a solution.    There is a software company named: Accessdata (87 East 600 South,   Orem, UT 84058), 1-800-658-5199 that has a software package that will   decrypt any WordPerfect, Lotus 1-2-3, Quatro-Pro, MS Excel and Paradox   files. The cost of the package is $185. Steep prices, but if you   think your pw key is less than 10 characters, (or 10 char) give them a   call and ask for the free demo disk. The demo disk will decrypt files   that have a 10 char or less pw key.''  * How do I break a Vigenere (repeated-key) cipher?    A repeated-key cipher, where the ciphertext is something like the   plaintext xor KEYKEYKEYKEY (and so on), is called a Vigenere cipher.   If the key is not too long and the plaintext is in English, do the   following:     1. Discover the length of the key by counting coincidences.   (See Gaines [GAI44], Sinkov [SIN66].) Trying each displacement of   the ciphertext against itself, count those bytes which are equal.    If the two ciphertext portions have used the same key, something   over 6% of the bytes will be equal. If they have used different   key, then less than 0.4% will be equal (assuming random 8-bit bytes   of key covering normal ASCII text). The smallest displacement which   indicates an equal key is the length of the repeated key.    2. Shift the text by that length and XOR it with itself. This   removes the key and leaves you with text XORed with itself. Since   English has about 1 bit of real information per byte, 2 streams of   text XORed together has 2 bits of info per 8-bit byte, providing   plenty of redundancy for choosing a unique decryption. (And in fact   one stream of text XORed with itself has just 1 bit per byte.)    If the key is short, it might be even easier to treat this as a   standard polyalphabetic substitution. All the old cryptanalysis   texts show how to break those. It's possible with those methods, in   the hands of an expert, if there's only ten times as much text as key.   See, for example, Gaines [GAI44], Sinkov [SIN66].  * How do I send encrypted mail under UNIX? [PGP, RIPEM, PEM, ...]    Here's one popular method, using the des command:      cat file | compress | des private_key | uuencode | mail    Meanwhile, there is a de jure Internet standard in the works called   PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail). It is described in RFCs 1421 through   1424. To join the PEM mailing list, contact pem-dev-request@tis.com.   There is a beta version of PEM being tested at the time of this   writing.    There are also two programs available in the public domain for encrypting   mail: PGP and RIPEM.  Both are available by FTP.  Each has its own   newsgroup: alt.security.pgp and alt.security.ripem.  Each has its own FAQ   as well.    PGP is most commonly used outside the USA since it uses the RSA algorithm   without a license and RSA's patent is valid only (or at least primarily)   in the USA.    RIPEM is most commonly used inside the USA since it uses the RSAREF which   is freely available within the USA but not available for shipment outside   the USA.    Since both programs use a secret key algorithm for encrypting the body of   the message (PGP used IDEA; RIPEM uses DES) and RSA for encrypting the   message key, they should be able to interoperate freely.  Although there   have been repeated calls for each to understand the other's formats and   algorithm choices, no interoperation is available at this time (as far as   we know).  * Is the UNIX crypt command secure?    No. See [REE84]. There is a program available called cbw (crypt   breaker's workbench) which can be used to do ciphertext-only attacks   on files encrypted with crypt. One source for CBW is [FTPCB].  * How do I use compression with encryption?    A number of people have proposed doing perfect compression followed by   some simple encryption method (e.g., XOR with a repeated key).    Unfortunately, you can only compress perfectly if you know the exact   distribution of possible inputs. For all practical purposes it's   impossible to describe ``the typical English text'' beyond coarse   characteristics such as single-letter frequencies. You can build up   more and more sophisticated models of your inputs, but if the enemy   has a slightly more accurate model, he'll be able to find some   redundancy in your compressed output.    Note that nearly all practical compression schemes, unless they   have been designed with cryptography in mind, produce output that   actually starts off with high redundancy. For example, the output of   UNIX compress begins with a well-known three-byte ``magic number''   that can serve as an entering wedge for cryptanalysis.      This is not to say that compression before encryption is inherently a   bad idea; it just has to be done very, very carefully, and by no means   removes the need for strong encryption.    Compression after encryption is silly.  * Is there an unbreakable cipher?    Yes. The one-time pad is unbreakable; see part 4. Unfortunately the   one-time pad requires secure distribution of as much key material as   plaintext.    Of course, a cryptosystem need not be utterly unbreakable to be   useful. Rather, it needs to be strong enough to resist attacks by   likely enemies for whatever length of time the data it protects is   expected to remain valid.  * What does ``random'' mean in cryptography?    Cryptographic applications demand much more out of a pseudorandom   number generator than most applications. For a source of bits to be   cryptographically random, it must be computationally impossible to   predict what the Nth random bit will be given complete knowledge of   the algorithm or hardware generating the stream and the sequence of   0th through N-1st bits, for all N up to the lifetime of the source.    A software generator (also known as pseudo-random) has the function   of expanding a truly random seed to a longer string of apparently   random bits.  This seed must be large enough not to be guessed by   the opponent.  Ideally, it should also be truly random (perhaps   generated by a hardware random number source).    Those who have Sparcstation 1 workstations could, for example,   generate random numbers using the audio input device as a source of   entropy, by not connecting anything to it.  For example,   cat /dev/audio | compress - >foo    gives a file of high entropy (not random but with much randomness in   it).  One can then encrypt that file using part of itself as a key,   for example, to convert that seed entropy into a pseudo-random   string.    When looking for hardware devices to provide this entropy, it is   important really to measure the entropy rather than just assume that   because it looks complicated to a human, it must be \\\"random\\\".  For   example, disk operation completion times sound like they might be   unpredictable (to many people) but a spinning disk is much like a   clock and its output completion times are relatively low in entropy.  * What is the unicity point (a.k.a. unicity distance)?    See [SHA49]. The unicity distance is an approximation to that amount   of ciphertext such that the sum of the real information (entropy) in   the corresponding source text and encryption key equals the number   of ciphertext bits used. Ciphertexts significantly longer than this   can be shown probably to have a unique decipherment. This is used to   back up a claim of the validity of a ciphertext-only cryptanalysis.    Ciphertexts significantly shorter than this are likely to have   multiple, equally valid decryptions and therefore to gain security   from the opponent's difficulty choosing the correct one.    Unicity distance, like all statistical or information-theoretic   measures, does not make deterministic predictions but rather gives   probabilistic results: namely, the minimum amount of ciphertext   for which it is likely that there is only a single intelligible   plaintext corresponding to the ciphertext, when all possible keys   are tried for the decryption. Working cryptologists don't normally   deal with unicity distance as such. Instead they directly determine   the likelihood of events of interest.    Let the unicity distance of a cipher be D characters. If fewer than   D ciphertext characters have been intercepted, then there is not   enough information to distinguish the real key from a set of   possible keys. DES has a unicity distance of 17.5 characters,   which is less than 3 ciphertext blocks (each block corresponds to   8 ASCII characters). This may seem alarmingly low at first, but   the unicity distance gives no indication of the computational work   required to find the key after approximately D characters have been   intercepted.    In fact, actual cryptanalysis seldom proceeds along the lines used   in discussing unicity distance. (Like other measures such as key   size, unicity distance is something that guarantees insecurity if   it's too small, but doesn't guarantee security if it's high.) Few   practical cryptosystems are absolutely impervious to analysis; all   manner of characteristics might serve as entering ``wedges'' to crack   some cipher messages. However, similar information-theoretic   considerations are occasionally useful, for example, to determine a   recommended key change interval for a particular cryptosystem.   Cryptanalysts also employ a variety of statistical and   information-theoretic tests to help guide the analysis in the most   promising directions.    Unfortunately, most literature on the application of information   statistics to cryptanalysis remains classified, even the seminal   1940 work of Alan Turing (see [KOZ84]). For some insight into the   possibilities, see [KUL68] and [GOO83].  * What is key management and why is it important?    One of the fundamental axioms of cryptography is that the enemy is in   full possession of the details of the general cryptographic system,   and lacks only the specific key data employed in the encryption. (Of   course, one would assume that the CIA does not make a habit of telling   Mossad about its cryptosystems, but Mossad probably finds out anyway.)   Repeated use of a finite amount of key provides redundancy that can   eventually facilitate cryptanalytic progress. Thus, especially in   modern communication systems where vast amounts of information are   transferred, both parties must have not only a sound cryptosystem but   also enough key material to cover the traffic.    Key management refers to the distribution, authentication, and   handling of keys.    A publicly accessible example of modern key management technology   is the STU III secure telephone unit, which for classified use   employs individual coded ``Crypto Ignition Keys'' and a central Key   Management Center operated by NSA. There is a hierarchy in that   certain CIKs are used by authorized cryptographic control   personnel to validate the issuance of individual traffic keys and   to perform installation/maintenance functions, such as the   reporting of lost CIKs.    This should give an inkling of the extent of the key management   problem. For public-key systems, there are several related issues,   many having to do with ``whom do you trust?''  * Can I use pseudo-random or chaotic numbers as a key stream?    Chaotic equations and fractals produce an apparent randomness from   relatively compact generators. Perhaps the simplest example is a   linear congruential sequence, one of the most popular types of random   number generators, where there is no obvious dependence between seeds   and outputs. Unfortunately the graph of any such sequence will, in a   high enough dimension, show up as a regular lattice. Mathematically   this lattice corresponds to structure which is notoriously easy for   cryptanalysts to exploit. More complicated generators have more   complicated structure, which is why they make interesting pictures---   but a cryptographically strong sequence will have no computable   structure at all.    See [KNU81], exercise 3.5-7; [REE77]; and [BOY89].  * What is the correct frequency list for English letters?    There are three answers to this question, each slightly deeper than   the one before. You can find the first answer in various books:   namely, a frequency list computed directly from a certain sample of   English text. Of course any such list will be ``correctly'' computed,   but exactly which list you get depends on which sample was taken.    The second answer is that the question doesn't make sense. What do   you mean by ``English letters''? The ``English language'' is not a   fixed, finite, closed object that can be exactly characterized. It   has changed over time; it is different between different authors.   Any particular message will have different statistics from those of   the language as a whole.    The third answer is that yes, no particular message is going to have   exactly the same characteristics as English in general, but for all   reasonable statistical uses these slight discrepancies won't matter.   In fact there's an entire field called ``Bayesian statistics'' (other   buzzwords are ``maximum entropy methods'' and ``maximum likelihood   estimation'') which studies questions like ``What's the chance that a   text with these letter frequencies is in English?'' and comes up with   reasonably robust answers.    So make your own list from your own samples of English text. It will   be good enough for practical work, if you use it properly.  * What is the Enigma?    ``For a project in data security we are looking for sources of   information about the German Enigma code and how it was broken by   the British during WWII.''    See [WEL82], [DEA85], [KOZ84], [HOD83], [KAH91].  * How do I shuffle cards?    Card shuffling is a special case of the permutation of an array of   values, using a random or pseudo-random function.  All possible output   permutations of this process should be equally likely.  To do this, you   need a random function (modran(x)) which will produce a uniformly   distributed random integer in the interval [0..x-1].  Given that   function, you can shuffle with the following [C] code: (assuming ARRLTH   is the length of array arr[] and swap() interchanges values at the two   addresses given)    for ( n = ARRLTH-1; n > 0 ; n-- ) swap( &arr[modran( n+1 )], &arr[n] ) ;    modran(x) can not be achieved exactly with a simple (ranno() % x) since   ranno()'s interval may not be divisible by x, although in most cases the   error will be very small.  To cover this case, one can take ranno()'s   modulus mod x, call that number y, and if ranno() returns a value less   than y, go back and get another ranno() value.   * Can I foil S/W pirates by encrypting my CD-ROM?    Someone will frequently express the desire to publish a CD-ROM with   possibly multiple pieces of software, perhaps with each encrypted   separately, and will want to use different keys for each user (perhaps   even good for only a limited period of time) in order to avoid piracy.    As far as we know, this is impossible, since there is nothing in standard   PC or workstation hardware which uniquely identifies the user at the   keyboard.  If there were such an identification, then the CD-ROM could be   encrypted with a key based in part on the one sold to the user and in   part on the unique identifier.  However, in this case the CD-ROM is one   of a kind and that defeats the intended purpose.    If the CD-ROM is to be encrypted once and then mass produced, there must   be a key (or set of keys) for that encryption produced at some stage in   the process.  That key is useable with any copy of the CD-ROM's data.   The pirate needs only to isolate that key and sell it along with the   illegal copy.   * Can you do automatic cryptanalysis of simple ciphers?

One very frequently asked question in sci.crypt is about how the VCR+ codes   work.  The following article attempts to describe it.\",\"There has been quite a bit of discussion about house wiring and grounding practices here.  A few points need to be clarified:  The Equipment GROUNDING conductor, Green, green with a yellow stripe, bare, or the metal sheath or pipe of SOME wiring methods, is used as a safety ground, to carry fault currents back to the circuit breaker panel, and to limit the voltage on the metal case of utilization equipment or other metal objects.  It should never (except for a few exceptions to be discussed later) carry the normal operating current of a connected load.  Some equipment has filters in the power supply which may cause some slight current flow through the grounding conductor.    Much communications or audio equipment is sensitive to noise or slight voltages on the grounding conductor, and may require special wiring of the grounding conductors to provide reliable operation  (\\\"orange\\\" outlets are often used for this, with insulated grounding conductors wired back to the panel box, and in many cases back to the service.  Anyone installing such a system should read both the section on grounding in the National Electric Code and publications on installing quiet isolated ground systems.  The code requires the insulated grounding conductors (green wires) to run with the current carrying conductors back to the panel box, and, if required, back all the way to the service entrance , where it is bonded to the service ground (water pipe or rod)  Many of these systems are installed illegally or unsafely, where they do not provide a safe ground or a quiet ground or either.   The GROUNDED conductor of a circuit, often called the NEUTRAL, which is referred to in the code as the \\\"identified\\\" conductor and is supposed to be white or natural grey.  This conductor is supposed to be connected to ground in most electrical systems at a single point, generally at the service entrance panel.  This connection is through the Main Bonding Jumper.  (In many household service panels, the main bonding jumper is actually a bonding screw which attaches the neutral busbar to the case of the panel)    The Grounded conductor (neutral) is generally a current carrying conductor.  In the case of a 120 volt circuit it is one of the two conductors completing the circuit from the panel to the load device.    Since the grounded conductor (neutral) is only connected to the grounding conductor (bare or green) at the service entrance, if the load is any distance from the service and draws any significant current, there will be a small but measurable voltage between the grounded and grounding conductors at the load, under normal operating conditions.  If you should (incorrectly) connect the grounded (neutral) conductor to the grounding conductor at the load, some of the neutral current will flow instead through the grounding conductor.  Since there will now be current flowing through the grounding conductor, it will also no longer be quite at ground potential at the load end.  If the load equipment has a metal case, which is connected to the grounding conductor through the \\\"U\\\" ground plug, the metal case is now also no longer quite at ground potential.  The difference (under normal, non short-circuit conditions) may be only a few tenths of a volt, but it could also be a volt or two.  This normally does not present a shock hazard.    HOWEVER, if you let the metal case of the grounded equipment come into contact with an independently grounded object such as a water or gas pipe, a radiator, a metal air conditioning duct or such, part of the neutral current will try to flow through this aalternate ground path.  If the contact is not solid, you will get a significant arc (a low voltage, but possibly moderate current arc) Under the wrong conditions, this arcing could start a fire.  It is possible in some cases that the sneak ground current   could also flow through a wire of inadequate size, causing it to overheat.  With the incorrect non single-point grounding of the neutral, if there is a short circuit from hot to neutral, the high short circuit current which may flow will cause a much higher voltage on the grounding conductor, which increases the possibility for shock or fire.    Also if you incorrectly multiply connect the neutral and ground, the voltage on the ground system is seen as noise bu computer or audio equipment, often causing malfunction.  I have spent some hours tracking down such shorts in technical facilities where they were inducing severe hum into equipment.  The Neutral is usually bonded to the ground at the distribution transformer as well as at the service entrance of each dwelling.  This is done primarily for lightning protection, so that induced lightning currents have a short path back to ground, and also to assure that the currents drawn by shorts to grounded objects like pipes draw enough current to trip circuit breakers or blow fuses quickly.  The bad side of this is that not all the neutral current from the dwelling goes through the neutral wire back to the transformer.  Some of it flows through the grounding electrode (water pipe, etc.) this may cause corrosion in the pipes and possibly in things like underground fuel oil tanks, and it may also cause measurable AC magnetic fields due to the large loop between the \\\"hot\\\" conductors in the service and the neutral current in the water pipe and ground.  There are those who feel these fields may be unhealthy.  (don't flame ME on this, I'm just telling you where the field comes from, not it's health effect, as far as I'm concerned, the jury is still out on this.)  Note that the bonding jumper is only installed at the main panel, NOT at any sub distribution panels.  This is one reason why it is illegal to run service entrance cable with the sheath used as a neutral to a sub panel, you must have a seperate insulated conductor for the neutral.  The sheath can be used in this application only as the groundING conductor.  If the neutral is bonded to the grounding conductor in the sub panel, say by forgetting to remove the bonding screw, all the grounding conductors of the loads on that panel will be above ground, with the possible problems listed above.  The code makes exceptions for ranges and dryers, as well as feeds from one building to another.  In the cases of the range and dryer, the neutral may be used as the equipment ground under certain conditions, instead of a seperate wire.  Every time the code is revised, these exceptions come up for review.  These exceptions were, in fact the first required safety grounds, in the days before U ground outlets and such.  The appliance manufacturers don't want to have to redesign their ranges and driers, and the contractors don't want to have to run four wire cable (with four fairly heavy, expensive wires) in place of three wire to the appliances.  No question it would be safer with seperate neutrals to the stove, but the neutral current is low for most burner settings (since most current is in the 220 volt \\\"hots\\\" except at some low settings, the wires are large gauge, and there are few reported cases of injury or damage.  So far, the exceptions have survived. In the case of feeds between buildings, it's primarily for lightning protection.  People doing wiring should be aware what is and what isn't a legal grounding conductor.  Obviously, the bare wire in \\\"romex\\\" 'with ground' is.  Anywhere there is a green wire installed, such as in a portable cord, that is a good grounding conductor.  The sheath of BX clamped in BX connectors in metal boxes is a legal grounding conductor (in the US). (BX has an aluminum band run under the steel sheath to lower the resistance of the sheath.  You can just cut this aluminum band off at the ends, you don't have to bond it to anything, it does its job by touching every turn of the BX sheath.) Conduit or EMT (thinwall tubing) is generally a legal grounding conductor, but may require a bonding locknut where it enters a box or panel, particularly for larger pipes.    \\\"Greenfield\\\" (looks like big BX, but you pull your own wires in the empty sheath after you run it) is NOT a legal grounding conductor, as it doesn't have the aluminum band to bond it, and the spiral steel has too much resistance and inductance.  You have to run a seperate green grounding conductor inside the greenfield.  \\\"Wiremold\\\" is also not a legal grounding conductor, as the paint on the boxes often prevents good contact, and the \\\"feed\\\" to the wiremold extension is often from a box in the wall that may not be well connected to the first wiremold box.  I have personally discovered cases where the entire run of wiremold and the cases of everything plugged into all the outlets on the run were \\\"hot\\\" with 120 volts (Why do I get a shock every time I touch my computer and the radiator here in the office?) because there was no ground wire in the wiremold and one of the outlets had shorted to the edge of the wiremold box.  You must run a ground wire back in the wiremold from the outlets at least to the first box in the original wiring (conduit, BX, etc.) where you can \\\"bond\\\" the wire to the box with a screw, bnding clip, or whatever.  On another issue, while you should ground the green wire/lug on GCFI outlets when ever there is a place to ground them, it is legal in the NEC to use them without a ground if no ground is available.  It is better to have the protection of the Ground fault interrupter than no protection if you don't install it.  The interrupter doesn't depend on the ground to trip.  It is desirable to connect the ground if available, because if the ground is connected, the interrupter will trip as soon as a faulty device is plugged in, whereas without the ground, it will not trip until someone or something provides a ground path.  For those questioning the legal use of ungrounded GCFI's, read in the NEC, 210-7 (d) exception. (This is the 1990 code, my '93 code is in the city, but I know the rule hasn't changed.  It might be renumbered though.)   We have only touched the surface concerning grounding ;-} , there is much more to this subject, but most of you have fallen asleep by now.

How should be The relations of christian nations with each other and the relations of Christian nations with other nations who are not Christians?  The other question is about the concept of religion in Bible. Does the religion of God include and necessitate any law to be extracted from Bible or is the religion only a belief and nothing to do with the government sides? If for example, any government or a nation is one of the wrongdoings according to Bible, how should they be treated?   Is there any statement in Bible saying that Bible is a guide for every aspects of life?    Thank you.\",\"      [Patrick's example of anti-competitive regulations for             auto dealers deleted.]  Let me try to drag this discussion back to the original issues.  As I've noted before, I'm not necessarily disputing the benefits of  eliminating anti-competitive legislation with regard to auto dealers, barbers, etc.  One need not, however, swallow the entire libertarian agenda to accomplish this end.  Just because one grants the benefits of allowing anyone who wishes to cut hair to sell his/her services without regulation does not mean that the same unregulated barbers should be  free to bleed people as a medical service without government intervention.   (As some/many libertarians would argue.)    On a case by case basis, the cost/benefit ratio of government regulation is obviously worthwhile.  The libertarian agenda, however, does not call for this assessment.  It assumes that the costs of regulation (of any kind) always outweigh its benefits.  This approach avoids all sorts of  difficult analysis, but it strikes many of the rest of us as dogmatic,  to say the least.  I have no objection to an analysis of medical care, education,  national defense or local police that suggests a \\\"free market\\\" can provide a more effective, efficient means of accomplishing social objectives than is provided through \\\"statist\\\" approaches.   With some notable exceptions, however, I do not see such nitty-gritty, worthwhile  analysis being carried out by self-professed libertarians.    jsh\",\" Unless I've got my notes mixed up, 939 F.2d 499 comes close to this.

I am having the following 2 problems.  (1) Many of my Imakefile's have contructs like   /**/#This is a makefile  at the start of lines to pass Makefile comments thru the C  preprocessor and into the Makefile.  Most of the C preprocessors that  I have used will not treat such a # as appearing at the start of the  line.  Thus the C preprocessor does not treat the hash symbol as the  start of a directive.    However the IBM cpp strips the comment and treats the hash symbol  as the start of a directive.  The cpp fails when it determines  that \\\"This\\\" is not a known directive.  I have temporarily hacked my  imake to handle this situation but would like to come up with a better  fix.  (2) Several Imakefiles use /**/ as a parameter to a macro when a particular  use of the macro does not need a value for the parameter.  The AIX cpp  gives warnings about these situations but continues to work OK.  If you are familiar with these problems and have solutions, I would appreciate information about on your solutions.

These pulses are  converted into mechanical pulses that turn the odometer - and speedometer. No way changing or erasing an eprom is going to change the mileage reading.  It also means the odometer is just as easy (or hard) to change as any other mechanical odometer.  On the other hand it is a bit easier to disconnect the speed sensor and run the car with no speedometer or odometer reading...a simple switch will do the job.  It also will disable the speed limiter, which will enable the car to reach it's full speed.  ;-)  \",\" This should not be the case if they are at all reputable. Fuel injector  cleaning is done properly with a can of injector cleaner solvent which is hooked up to the fuel system under high pressure. The car is actually run on the solvent during the cleaning process. The equipment to properly do this is pricey, and generally not something the average home mechanic has. The solvent itself is not very expensive ($5-$8) and you could probably make up a hose to fit your system and do it yourself, but I didn't tell you that... :-)  Not many in-tank cleaners are worth wasting your money on. There has been a  discussion of these products on here from time to time, and Chevron Techron (not Pro-Gard with Techron) is generally regarded as the best.

Rather, Lewis is  condemning the use of such coporate prayer efforts as platforms to make  political jabs at opponents, feigned as confessions of guilt (ie., Lord please  forgive us for allowing \\\"insert political issue/idea/platform\\\" to exist in our country, it is wrong and we ask your forgiveness.).  I would be interested in knowing what part of the essay you feel condemns national repentance (please quote).\",\"  My knowledge about driving in the U.S. is also second-hand, but I think I can correct your statements about our Autobahn:   Oh yeah, that would be paradise... in fact, you can forget it. From all I've heard from my U.S. relatives, drivers esp. here in Germany are much more agg- ressive, but not disciplined. One of my relatives, a L.A. resident, hired a car at the Nuernberg airport and went about 18 miles to our home. He said then that he grew about 1 year older during this ride and swore he'd never drive a car in Germany again (this was in 1982 and he kept his promise - the situation now is even worse as effect of the increased volume of traffic). What you mean by `better disciplined' should perhaps be considered `cautious due to fear':  When driving around here, you always *have* to take into consideration that the majority of the other drivers absolutely relies on you: They expect that nobody fails or sleeps; many of them exploit this by driving as fast as their car can go (of course only where that is allowed, you might think - dream on :). So any mistake you make is a very high risk to your health - and if you're ex- posed to such a situation from your very first day as a driver, you learn to handle it - or you lose...  That's the way I and most people I know experience our traffic situation -  whether you think this is pleasant or efficient is up to you; I think we handle a very high volume of traffic and that at high speeds with modest (compared to the volume) and decreasing rates of lethal accidents - OTOH, more and more people (esp. women) dislike driving (because they feel overtaxed and threatened) and each accident is one accident too much.   Better designed and maintained, may be - but animal fences are very rare. Auto- bahnen and many other streets have guard-rails (I hope that's the right word -  a plank made from thick steel sheet fixed on uprights; it's about 2 feet high); those guard-rails are designed for keeping vehicles on the road. Smaller animals can crawl under the plank, bigger ones can easily jump over it. The point is that esp. larger animals are very rare in Germany; they tend also to be very timid. Accidents caused by animals are a neglegible danger.   You're right (there are speed linits even on the major part of the Autobahn) - but the attitude towards driving (see above) seems to be very similar to that in Germany (I've been in France, Switzerland, Italy, Austria, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands) - besides that, you really can't rely on the residents abiding the local speed limits. I've got quite a lot of practise (~120k miles) and I'm used to travel at 130 mph (FYI, with a car even smaller than a rabbit), but I consider driving on the highways round Paris or Milano really a thrill...   Sorry, but you'll find quite a lot rabbit-class-car (or even smaller, mine is a Peugeot 205) owners going that fast; small cars with much HP are very `hip' over here - and most people buying such cars aren't afraid to let them run.   I disagree; the size or weight of a car is rather irrelevant. Formula-1 cars weigh less than 700 kg and the drivers have a chance to survive accidents at 130 mph or higher - OTOH when crashing against a solid object at 130 mph, it makes no difference whether you sit in a Porsche, a Mercedes, a tank or on a bicycle: Your're dead.

It is interesting medically because the normal location of organs is caused in part by the \\\"normal\\\" rotation associated with ciliary motion, so that in absence of this, laterality can be \\\"random.\\\" People with situs inversus are quite popular at medical schools, because of their rarity, and the fact that most doctors get a bit upset when they can't find the patient's heart sounds (because they're on the wrong side).

You know, today is April 13th.  In 1743, Thomas  Jefferson was born, 250 years ago.  I think that's appropriate to  mention at the beginning of this meeting because since that time he  has been, of course, a person who has been one that we've all  followed in terms of our democracy and the importance of education  here in this great country.  The success of our democracy according  to Jefferson really depends upon the success of our educational  system.

In  Washington, D.C. the number is 202/463-3170 or 3171.              I believe the President has a few words that he might  want to share with us.  And, Mr. President, I'll ask you to do that  at this time.  It's great to have you.              THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.              I'm glad to be here with my friends, Dick Riley and Bob  Reich -- also members of my Cabinet -- at the headquarters of the  Chamber of Commerce to support the effort that the Chamber is making,  along with its Center for Work Force Preparation, to help to examine  tonight the whole critical question of how to move our young people  from school to the work place.              I want to compliment the Chamber on all their efforts,  recognizing that without an educated work force we can't grow this  economy or remain competitive, and recognizing that we all have to  work together -- business and government, labor and educators -- to  make things happen.              This satellite town meeting is a good example of that  kind of working together.  And if you'll forgive me a little home  state pride, I want to say a special word of thanks to the Wal-Mart  Corporation, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas, for providing  several hundred of the sites for this town meeting tonight.  I  appreciate that a lot, as well as the sites that are provided for all  the rest of you.              I have tried as hard as I could to move toward  constructive change for this country.  Secretary Riley talked about  this being Thomas Jefferson's 250th birthday.  If Thomas Jefferson  believed in anything, he believed in these three things:  first, in  education; second, in real personal liberty, freedom of religion,  freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of the press; and  third, in the absolute imperative of changing as times change.                If you go to the Jefferson Memorial here in this  beautiful city, which is now bedecked with all of its wonderful  cherry blossoms, you will see Jefferson saying that we have to change  with changing times.              For us here in America, that means reducing our deficit  and increasing our investment and putting our people first so that we  can compete in the world.  We're here to talk about that tonight -- about what we can do to educate and train our people better.  Unless  we do that, none of the efforts that all the rest of us make in  government, even to bring the budget into balance, even to increase  our investment in other things which will grow jobs, will last in the  long run.              We also have to have people who can carry their load.   And in a world where the average young person will change jobs seven  or eight times in a lifetime, that begins with the education system  and continues into the work force where education must go on for a  lifetime.  It's not just important what you know, but what you can  learn.              And if I might, I'd like to close just by emphasizing  we're doing our best to try to have the most innovative partnership  between the Labor Department and the Education Department and the  private sector to build a good school-to-work transition.  And we're  trying to get off to a good start this summer with a program that  would create more than 700,000 new summer jobs, including many  thousands that have a strong education component so our young people  can be learning and working at the same time.              Dick, I think I ought to stop there.  That's a good  place we can begin, I think, the discussion.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you so much, Mr. President.              Each month we get together and talk about ways that all  citizens can work towards reaching the national education goals.  And  tonight, we'll focus on goal five, and how communities such as yours  can prepare students for this world of work.              This week, the Education Department and the Labor  Department are hosting a conference here in Washington, D.C. called  Summer Challenge, a program of work and learning, to America's youth.   The aim is to use some special funds from President Clinton's  proposed economic stimulus package to provide educationally-enriched  jobs and summer school programs for young people in disadvantaged  areas of the country.                Mr. President, let's talk a minute -- you alluded to it  somewhat -- about the  Summer Youth Challenge.  Your program calls  for more educational enrichment in the summer jobs.  And why in your  words is that so important?              THE PRESIDENT:  I think it's important for two reasons.   First of all, a lot of the young people we're trying to reach may  have had trouble adjusting to school and learning.  And while we want  them to have a good experience with a real job, we also want them to  continue to learn during the summer because we know from a lot of  research that a lot of kids that have trouble learning in school may  forget as much as 30 percent of what they learned the previous year  over the summertime.  And that is a very unproductive thing for  schools to have to take up a lot of time teaching what they already  taught before.              Secondly, we want to help these young people progress,  not only in terms of work, but in terms of learning.  We want to  abolish the artificial dividing line between what is work and what is  learning because we think that the best and most productive workers  will have to be lifetime learners.  And we think that this experience  could maybe drive that point home and prepare these young people to  succeed in school, or at work, or in college as they go on.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I think the fact that these are  disadvantaged kids -- that gap, that lag you mentioned as they go  into the next year, is really even greater.                Secretary Reich, of course, you have training programs  throughout the year.  And I wonder is you have any comment about this  educational component of training.              SECRETARY REICH:  Well, what we've learned, Mr.  Secretary, is that for many young people, whether it's for the summer  or for the year, actually on-the-job work experience combined with  education is one of the best ways of learning.  Many young people,  for example, have a lot -- they have a difficult time learning  geometry.  But when they actually are there building something or  working on something, and they can see the exact and direct  application of geometry, they understand what it's used for.  And a  lot of young people -- just that sense of connection between  education and the world of work is terribly, terribly important.   It's important during the summer, but it's important for a lot of  young people even beyond the summer.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you.                Mr. President, you've called for a youth apprenticeship  program, school-to-work transition.  And I wonder if you would tell  us a little bit about your concept of that and how you see it  developing.              THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, let's talk about why  it's important.  Most new jobs that will be created in this decade  will not require a four-year college degree, but most of them will  require some learning and skills that go well beyond what most people  get in a high school diploma.                If you look at the last 10 years, the average salaries  of young people that had at least two years of good post-high school  education was a good salary that went up over the decade.  The young  people who had less than that tended to have lower wages that did not  go up, and in many cases in real terms fell over the decade, because  they weren't productive, they weren't more valuable to their  employers.              So we think America has a big economic interest in  trying to ensure that all the young people who get out of high school  but don't go on to college make a transition to work, which includes  two years of further training either in a community college, a  vocational setting, or perhaps on the job.  And what I have done in  this budget, as you know, is to give you and Secretary Reich some  funds and some incentives to try to work in partnership with states  and with the private sector to build these programs state-by-state in  a way that would be customized essentially by the business community,  based on the needs of the economy in any given area.  It could  revolutionize long-term the quality of the American work force and  the earnings of American workers.              SECRETARY REICH:  I should add, Mr. President -- I think  you know this from your experience in Arkansas -- and many of the  people watching this program -- that the business community and  educators, labor groups are already in many of our communities, many  of our states, building a school-to-work transition program.  In  fact, there's an awful lot of ferment, a lot of excitement.  The  people watching this program probably are the ones who are most  directly involved in that.  And more power to them.  Secretary Riley  and I are going to do everything we can to build on the successes  already out there.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Bob, we're going to be talking tonight  about youth apprenticeship and tech prep, the co-op learning   career academies.  And what features all those programs that deal  with this subject -- what are some of the features that every one of  these school-to-work programs might have that   are important?              SECRETARY REICH:  Well, one thing that we've seen -- and  you and I have been working at this for a long time, and you much  longer than I -- we've seen that active involvement of the business  community is absolutely essential.  And I'm so delighted that we're  doing this in the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce.  The  Chamber of Commerce of the United States is committed to doing these  kinds of programs -- training, education, retraining -- and we've  aimed to work very closely with the Chamber.              The business community is going to be actively engaged  in developing almost an audit of the kind of jobs that are needed and  helping the educators, community colleges, technical institutions  develop curricula that are relevant for the jobs of the future.              Communities have got to come together.  I mean, this is  one of the most important things.  You've got to have all of these  players in a community come together and work together and cooperate  together.  You know, too often we have the educators over here and  the business leaders over here, labor groups over here and everybody  is talking, but they're not really working together in a common  strategy.              And the third and final ingredient I would say, Dick,  would be a commitment to excellence -- a commitment both to academic  excellence and also to skills development excellence.  This is not a  tracking program we're talking about for kids who are not going to  make it.  This is a program that every young person ought to be  eligible for.  If they want to go on beyond that to four-year  college, that's fine.  That ought to be permissible.  But we're  talking about the foundation of learning about jobs, the foundation  skills for on-the-job learning.              And again, those are the critical components.  It's  already being done.              THE PRESIDENT:  I think -- if I might just interject one  point based on my personal experience at home -- the business  community has a critical role to play, not simply in saying here are  the job skills that are needed and here's what ought to be taught,  but also in monitoring that excellence.  If you have the right sort  of partnership there, the people who are paying the taxes and who are  going to then be hiring the workers are not going to permit the  second-rate programs to survive if they have any way to shape and  influence them.  So I think that's very important.              And when we try to, if you will, fill in the blanks at  the federal level, trying to set some standards and provide some  funds, one of the things that we want to be sure and do is to make  sure that the employer has a heavy amount of influence over the  quality of these programs, because that's really what's going to  determine whether the whole thing is worthwhile.              SECRETARY RILEY:  That's great.  We've been talking, of  course, about school-to-work and also the jobs and economic recovery  program for this summer and fall.  But let's talk just a moment about  long-term school reform.  It's something especially close to me.  Mr.  President, I wonder if you would give us some of your ideas for the  communities out here on Goals 2000 legislation that I think will be  coming forth before too long.              THE PRESIDENT:  Well, as you know, back when you and I  were both governors, we spent a lot of time working on our public  schools and we tried to be very candid with our people in saying that  a lot of these things were going to take some time to materialize.                I had a hand in writing the National Education Goals  that the governors drafted, along with representatives of President  Bush's administration back in 1989.  And what we're going to try to  do this year with your leadership is to introduce legislation in  Congress that will actually define the things that the national  government ought to do to try to help the local schools and the  children of this country and the adult learners, too, meet those  goals -- making sure that when -- by 2000, people show up for school  ready to learn; that we get a 90 percent on-time high school  graduation rate; that children at the 4th, 8th, and 12th grades are  confident in the subjects they're supposed to know; that they are  second to none in math and science; that are schools are safe,  disciplined, and drug-free.  And, of course, the fifth goal --I took  them out of line to say this the last -- is that we have a system of  life-long learning in this country.              And each one of those goals there's a national role, a  state role, a school role, school district role, and a private sector  role.  And what you've attempted to do in this bill you're going to  introduce with me in the next few weeks is to define what our job is;  and then to give the rest of America a way of defining what their job  is and seeing whether we're actually meeting the standards of quality  that we need to meet.              It's very exciting.  So far as I know, nothing quite  like it has ever been done in the form of federal legislation before.   Not mandating and telling people what they have to do with their  money, but actually setting up a framework for excellence and  partnerships so that we can do our job.  I'm really excited about it.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I am, too.  And I think really  it will be an entirely new role for the federal government in terms  of its relationship with states, serving as a partner really to  support and facilitate and to help out in these education reform  efforts, all driven by high standards.  That's the point.              Bob, let me ask you one question, and then we'll get to  the telephone calls.  It's about the same subject.  We have, of  course, skills standards that are going to be part of Goals 2000, and  I wonder if you would comment on that.              SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you know, we have 75 percent of  our young people who don't graduate from college.  Very often they  don't have very many alternatives.  They do have a wonderful system  of community colleges and technical institutions, but if we had  national skill standards to which they could aspire and which  employers would understand as a national credential, many of these  young people would actually find that they were much more eligible  for jobs.              Everybody doesn't have to go to college.  Other  countries you have smaller proportions of their population going to  college, but you have a whole level of people who have certain  technical, preprofessional skills.  We can do it in this country.  If  you don't go to four-year college you're not a loser.  And we want to  develop those national skill standards.  We're going to be working  with the states, with the Education Department, with a lot of private  industry in developing those standards.  And I think they will be the  kinds of things that enable our vocational and technical and other  institutions to rally around, as well as our business community.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, that's great.  Why don't we go  ahead and go to the telephone.  We have a call, I see -- Mayor Bruce  Todd of Austin, Texas.              Q   Yes, Mr. President and Mr. Secretary Reich and  Riley, we certainly appreciate the opportunity to join you today.  We  have some dedicated professionals and volunteers here in Austin who  have heard what you have said and are very appreciative.  Let me  simply say, amen to some of the comments made already.  We agree with  much of the tone that the Clinton administration has taken, and are  very supportive.                We have been successful here in Austin of tripling our  summer employment program over the last four years.  We expect to  have over 2,000 employed this year in the summertime; perhaps as much  as 3,500 with the federal assistance.                Much of the question that we had designed you have  answered in your opening comments, so we must be thinking alike.  But  the question essentially involved what initiatives after Labor Day  would be appropriate.  We know summertime is important.  Year-round  is even more important.  And what kind of initiatives at the federal  level might be proposed to meet the needs of the youth on a year- round basis?  And perhaps more importantly, how can families and the  local community be more involved using the federal initiative? That's  something that we believe is very important to success in this  effort.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Mr. President.              THE PRESIDENT:  I think I'll give everybody a chance to  answer the question, Bruce, but let me first thank you for calling,  and thank you for all the great work that you're doing in Austin.   I've seen some of it and I've always been very impressed.                First, with regard to the summer program, we hope we can  structure it in a way that will enable us to continue the summer  program and that will move a lot of these young people back into  schools under circumstances that might allow them to do some work in  the private sector, too.  We hope that -- Secretary Reich is going to  try to set up a system where we create a lot of private sector jobs  to be matched with the public sector jobs this summer.  And we're  working on that.              Secondly, in the program that I have presented to the  Congress over the next five years, what we are attempting to do is to  build in an amount of investment that's quite substantial for job  training programs, for school-to-work programs, all of which give  heavy, heavy weight to local community input -- just the question you  asked -- but do provide some federal investment dollars, which we  hope you can put with local dollars to keep people working and being  trained on a year-round basis.              And I will say again, to echo what Secretary Reich said  a moment ago, to try to break down the barrier between what is seen  as work and what is seen as learning.  An awful lot of young people  actually have quite high IQs, but actually learn so much better when  they're doing than when they're reading or just listening.  So we  hope that the community involvement part of it will be permanent, and  we hope that if the whole budget passes -- and we do have 200 budget  cuts and more than 200, actually, in the budget -- and some revenue  raisers, and some new money for education and training, that we'll be  able to do just what you seem to want based on your question.              Bob, do you want to say anything?              SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you took most of the words out  of my mouth, Mr. President, as usual.  But let me just add one thing,  and that is that one of the most important aspects of post-high  school for a lot of young people who are not going on to college, in  addition to the school-to-work program, simply is the availability of  jobs.  And we've got to get this economy moving again, obviously.   It's terribly important to get this recovery program, to get the  economy back on track.  That's sort of the prerequisite to everything  else.  If we don't get the economy back on track -- we have -- I  think this is the 16th -- correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. President -- I  think is the 16th month we have had seven percent unemployment or  greater.  This is a jobless recovery.  A lot of those kids are going  to be getting out of school in June.  And even if we did everything  right, they would have a very, very hard time getting jobs.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you both.  Of course, Goals 2000  will be a permanent, long-term thing that will certainly reach into  next year.  It will involve, if passed -- and we certainly hope it  will be -- action plans with every state where we can be working  together to reach for the goals in a number of different ways.  And  then the state, with all the various school districts, a very  important part of that will be citizen and parent involvement.  And I  think everybody will see a great energy out there, once we get that  moving.              The next call is Dr. Harry Heinemann, New York.                Doctor?              Q   Good evening, Mr. Secretary.  It is a pleasure to  be on with you this evening.  As you may know, bridging the school  and work has been central to La Guardia's educational program since  its inception in the 1970s, and that includes the college, the two  alternative high schools that operate on our campus, and the linkages  we have forged with the local schools.  We have found this to be an  extremely effective learning strategy.              And over the years, we've come to believe that there are  several principles that are very important in bridging the school and  work.  And these include integrating theory in the classroom with  practice in the workplace, with providing all students early exposure  to careers, as well as providing opportunities for them to reflect  upon these experiences while they strengthen their skills; and  lastly, the critical role of the liberal arts, particularly in the  development of high performance competencies.                My question, then is:  How can the general education  faculty and the academic curriculum be more closely integrated with  transition to work experience?  And what mechanisms and strategies  can you suggest to achieve this integration?              SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, thank you very much.  I think --  and we'll get a response from you all on that, and very interesting  work going on there.  We're going to have three people, our next  guests on the program this evening, that will be some specialists    in that area that you're speaking, and I'll certainly pass that on to  them and we can discuss it later.              You all care to comment -- any comments you might have?              THE PRESIDENT:  I'd just like to say, if I might, one  thing.  I want to reemphasize this and I don't think I'm being as  clear about it as I'd like, although I think at least one of the  people who will be on the second panel will be able to say it more  explicitly than I.  I think this whole concept of applied academics  is very important.  And I think that we have to basically abolish  what I consider to be a very artificial distinction between what is  vocational learning and what is academic learning.              I think we should keep the liberal arts going.  I think  we should have a strong component for people who are in the  vocational program.              SECRETARY REICH:  It seems to me that we also need to  rethink our entire tracking system, because a lot of these school and  work combinations are important for mainstream students.  They're  important for all students.  It's not just a special group of  students that needs them.              Some of the experiments that I've seen around the United  States -- Dick, I'm sure you've seen them as well -- are mainstream  experiments.  They're mainstreaming all the students.  At 11th and  12th grades they're giving them a combined work and school experience  and then a transition program.  And again, the kids can either go on  to college if they want; they can go on to technical community; they  can go on to an entirely -- a large variety of possibilities and  career directions.              But we have to get away from the stigmatizing that often  goes on with young people who simply are doing job-related or work- related work within the classroom, within our schools.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you, very much.  I think that's  going to be the last call that we have time for.  Mr. President, I  think you've got to move on to another matter, and I want to thank  you and Secretary Reich for being here.  We appreciate your time and  your ideas, and it's been a tremendous help to us.  \",\" Seems to me folks, that if you are so interested in acquiring CNN, just buy your $1000 worth of stock today.
