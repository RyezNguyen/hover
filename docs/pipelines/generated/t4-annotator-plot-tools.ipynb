[I'm not enforcing the inclusion limits on this FAQ because most of our readers probably haven't seen it.  --clh]  Christ warns that anyone who \\\"breaks one of the least of these commandments *and* teaches otheres to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven\\\" (Matt. 5:19.  This FAQ is so full of error that I must respond to it.  I hope that whoever maintains will remove from it the partisan theology.   1.  The law was known to man before it was revealed on Mount Sinai.  Rom 4:15 notes that \\\"where no law is, there is no transgression.\\\"  Not only did sin exist before Sinai (Eden), but the Sabbath was kept before it was revealed on Sinai (Ex 16).  2.  The problem with the first covenant was not the law, but the promise which undergirded it.  God wanted to perform his will in the lives of the people, but in their ignorance after 400 years of slavery, they promised \\\"what ever He says to do we will do.\\\"  That is why the new covenant is based on \\\"better promises\\\" (Heb. 8:6).  Rather than do away with the law God promised to \\\"put my laws in their minds and write them on their hearts\\\" (Heb. 8:10).  3.  Including the Sabbath in the Acts 15 is selective inclusion.  The Sabbath was more important to the Jews than circumcision.  If any attempt had been made to do away with the Sabbath the reaction would have been even more strident than is recorded in Acts 15.  Do not confuse the weekly Sabbath of the Decalogue with the ceremonial sabbaths which could occur at any time of the week and were part of the law (ceremonial) which was *added* because of transgression (of the moral law) (Gal 3:19).  4.  Israel stands for God's people of all time.  That is why God *grafted* the Gentiles in.  Roma 9:4 says that the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the service of God and the promises belong to Israelites.   In explanation Paul makes it clear that being born into Israel is not enough \\\"For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel\\\" v 6.  Then in Gal 3:19 he says \\\"if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.\\\"  All Christians are Abraham's seed, Jews, Israelites.  Not physically, for that is not the criterion, but spiritually.  We are joint heirs with Jesus based on the promise God made to all his people the Israelites.   People would probably agree but they are wrong.  How can the Sabbath commandment be ceremonial when it is part of a law which predates the ceremonial laws?  You are not free to choose your time of worship.  Even if you were why do you follow a day of worship which has its origins in pagan sun worship.  Would you rather give up a day which God blessed, sanctified, and hallowed in exchange for one which all church leaders agree has not biblical foundation (see Sabbath Admissions in soc.religion.christian.bible-study). I do not care what Calvin or any theologian says.  My guide is what God says.  If being not under the law means we do not have to keep the law, why is it that the only section of the law we have trouble with is the Sabbath commandment, which is the only one God thought was important enough to say *REMEMBER*?  If you study the word deeply you will note that the message is that we are no longer under the condemnation of the law but freed by the grace of God.  If a cop pulls me over for speeding, then in court I ask for mercy and the judge does not throw the book at me but gives me grace, do I walk out of the court saying \\\"I can now go on speeding, for I am now under grace?\\\"  Being under grace I now drive within the speed limit.  Paul adds to it in Rom. 3:31 \\\"Di we then make void the law through faith?  God forbid: yea, we establish the law.\\\"  \\\"Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good\\\" (Rom. 7:12).   Do you prefer implication to fact?  A careful study of the Acts 20 shows that the meeting was on Saturday night and that on Sunday morning Paul did not go to a worship service, but set off on a long journey by foot to Assos.  In ICor 16 there is no way you can equate \\\"lay by him in store\\\" with \\\"go to a worship service.\\\"  Wrong.  These are the sabbath days of the ceremonial law, not the Sabbath day of the moral law. Why would you prefer to twist and turn, relying on different arguments which conflict with each other, rather than obey a simple request from a God who loved you enough to die for you.  Jesus died because the law could not be changed.  Why bother to die in order to meet the demands of a broken law if all you need to do is change the law.  Penalties for law breaking means the law is immutable.  That is why it is no sin not to follow the demands of the ceremonial laws.  It will always be a sin to make false gods, to violate God's name, to break the Sabbath, to steal, to kill, etc.  Except it you disagree.  But then your opinion has no weight when placed next to the word of God.  Darius  [It's not clear how much more needs to be said other than the FAQ.  I think Paul's comments on esteeming one day over another (Rom 14) is probably all that needs to be said.  I accept that Darius is doing what he does in honor of the Lord.  I just wish he might equally accept that those who \\\"esteem all days alike\\\" are similarly doing their best to honor the Lord.  However I'd like to be clear that I do not think there's unambiguous proof that regular Christian worship was on the first day.  As I indicated, there are responses on both of the passages cited.  The difficulty with both of these passages is that they are actually about something else.  They both look like they are talking about nnregular Christian meetings, but neither explicitly says \\\"and they gathered every Sunday for worship\\\".  We get various pieces of information, but nothing aimed at answering this question.    Act 2:26 describes Christians as participating both in Jewish temple worship and in Christian communion services in homes.  Obviously the temple worship is on the Sabbath.  Acts 13:44 is an example of Christians participating in them.  Unfortunately it doesn't tell us what day Christians met in their houses.  Acts 20:7, despite Darius' confusion, is described by Acts as occuring on Sunday.  (I see no reason to impose modern definitions of when days start, when the Biblical text is clear about what was meant.)  The wording implies to me that this was a normal meeting.  It doesn't say they gathered to see Paul off, but that when they were gathered for breaking bread, Paul talked about his upcoming travel.  But that's just not explicit enough to be really convincing.  Similarly with 1 Cor 16:2.  It says that on the first day they should set aside money for Paul's collection.  Now if you want to believe that they gathered specially to do this, or that they did it in their homes, I can't disprove it, but the obvious time for a congregation to take an offering would be when they normally gather for worship, and if they were expected to do it in their homes there would be no reason to mention a specific day. So I think the most obvious reading of this is that \\\"on the first day of every week\\\" simply means every time they gather for worship.    I think the reason we have only implications and not clear statements is that the NT authors assumed that their readers knew when Christian worship was.\",\" From: \\\"Preston K. Covey\\\" <covey+@andrew.cmu.edu> Subject: Gun Stats & Mortal Risks Date: Mon, 15 Feb 1993 18:35:05 -0500 (EST)   Folks,  Hail from the nether world.  On February 4th, the Wall Street Journal carried a front-page article by Erik Larson entitled \\\"Armed Force.\\\"  I felt a reply was in order to his citation of the notorious scare stat that \\\"A Gun is 43 times more likely to kill than to protect.\\\"  I sent the following to the WSJ.  -----  Gun Stats & Mortal Risks  Preston K. Covey    Erik Larson~s even-handed article on Paxton Quigley (~Armed Force,~ 2/4/93, WSJ) cites the world~s most notorious ~statistic~ regarding guns in the home:  ~A pioneering study of residential gunshot deaths in King County, Washington, found that a gun in the home was 43 times more likely to be used to kill its owner, spouse, a friend or child than to kill an intruder.~  The ~43 times~ stat is everywhere these days;  it has grown in media lore like the proverbial urban myth: it was inflated by one pugilistic talk-show pundit to ~93.~  Given the shock value of the finding, the conclusion of the 1986 New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) study is remarkably understated:  ~The advisability of keeping firearms in the home for protection must be questioned.~     Responsible people should indeed question the risks and benefits of bringing a firearm into their home.   But what we need to know is this:  What exactly are the risks and benefits?  The NEJM testimony is neither the whole truth about the benefits nor nothing but the truth about the risks.  Further, as with motor vehicles, we want to know:  What control do we have over the risks and benefits?  And, as with the risks of cancer or heart disease or auto accidents:  How can we minimize the risks?  Like raw highway death tolls, the NEJM stat is not very helpful here.    The NEJM finding purports to inform us, but it is framed to warn us off.  It is widely promulgated in the media as a ~scare stat,~ a misleading half-truth whose very formulation is calculated to prejudice and terrify.  The frightful statistic screams for itself:  The risks far outweigh the benefits, yes?   What fool would run these risks?   If your car were 43 times more likely to kill you, a loved one, a dear friend or an innocent child than to get you to your destination,  should you not take the bus?     Uncritical citation puts the good name of statistics in the bad company of lies and damned lies.   Surely, we can do better where lives are at stake.   Let~s take a closer look at this risky business:   The ~43 times~ stat of the NEJM study is the product of dividing the number of home intruders/aggressors justifiably killed in self-defense (the divisor) into the number of family members or acquaintances  killed by a gun in the home (the dividend).  The divisor of this risk equation is 9: in the study~s five-year sample there were 2 intruders and 7 other cases of self-defense.  The dividend is 387:  in the study there were 12 accidental deaths, 42 criminal homicides, and 333 suicides.  387 divided by 9 yields 43.  There were a total of 743 gun-related deaths in King County between 1978 and 1983,  so the study leaves 347 deaths outside of homes unaccounted.   The NEJM~s notorious ~43 times~ statistic is seriously misleading on six counts:   1.  The dividend is misleadingly characterized in the media:  the ~or acquaintances~ of the study (who include your friendly drug dealers and neighborhood gang members) is equated to ~friends.~  The implication is that the offending guns target and kill only beloved family members, dear friends, and innocent children.  Deaths may all be equally tragic, but the character and circumstance of both victims and killers are relevant to the risk.  These crucial risk factors are masked by the calculated impression that the death toll is generated by witless Waltons shooting dear friends and friendly neighbors.  This is criminological hogwash.   2.   The study itself does not distinguish households or environs populated by people with violent, criminal, or substance-abuse histories -- where the risk of death is very high -- versus households inhabited by more civil folk (for example, people who avoid high-risk activities like drug dealing, gang banging and wife beating) -- where the risk is very low indeed.  In actuality, negligent adults allow fatal but avoidable accidents; and homicides are perpetrated mostly by people with histories of violence or abuse, people who are identifiably and certifiably at ~high risk~ for misadventure.  To ignore these obvious risk factors in firearm accidents and homicides is as misleading as ignoring the role of alcohol in vehicular deaths: by tautology, neither gun deaths nor vehicular deaths would occur without firearms or vehicles; but the person and circumstance of the gun owner or driver crucially affect the risk.    3.  One misleading implication of the way the NEJM stat is framed is that the mere presence of a gun in the home is much more likely to kill than to protect, and this obscures -- indeed, disregards -- the role of personal responsibility.  The typical quotation of this study (unlike Larson~s) attributes fatal agency to the gun:  ~A gun in the home is 43 times as likely to kill . . . .~  (The Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, a major promulgator of the NEJM statistic, uses this particular formulation.)  We can dispense with the silly debate about whether it~s people or guns that accomplish the killing:  again, by tautology, gun  deaths would not occur without the guns.  The question begged is how many deaths would occur anyway, without the guns.  In any case, people are the death-dealing agents, the guns are their lethal instruments.  The moral core of the personal  risk factors in gun deaths are personal responsibility and choice.  Due care and responsibility obviate gun accidents; human choice mediates homicide and suicide (by gun or otherwise).  The choice to own a gun need not condemn a person to NEJM~s high-risk pool.  The gun does not create this risk by itself.  People have a lot to say about what risk they run with guns in their homes.  For example, graduates of Paxton Quigley~s personal protection course do not run the touted ~43 times~ risk any more than skilled and sober drivers run the same risks of causing or suffering vehicular death as do reckless or drunk drivers.  Undiscriminating actuarials disregard and obscure the role of personal responsibility and choice, just as they disregard and obscure the role of socio-economic, criminological and other risk-relevant factors in firearm-related death.  This is why we resent insurance premiums and actuarial consigment to risk pools whose norms disregard our individualities.  Fortunately, nothing can consign us to the NEJM risk pool but our own lack of choice or responsibility in the matter.   4.  Suicide accounts for 84% of the deaths by gun in the home in the NEJM study.  As against the total deaths by gun in King County, including those outside the home, in-house suicides are 44% of the total death toll, which is closer to the roughly 50% proportion found by other studies.  Suicide is a social problem of a very different order from homicide or accidents.  The implication of the NEJM study is that these suicides might not occur without readily available guns.  It is true that attempted suicide by gun is likely to succeed.  It is not obviously true that the absence of a gun would prevent any or all of these suicides.  This is widely assumed or alleged, but the preponderance of research on guns and suicide actually shows otherwise, that this is wishful thinking in all but a few truly impulsive cases.  (See:  Bruce L. Danto et al., The Human Side of Homicide,  Columbia University Press, 1982;  Charles Rich et al.,  ~Guns and Suicide,~  American Journal of Psychiatry,  March 1990.)  If suicides were removed from the dividend of the NEJM study~s risk equation, the ~43 times~ stat would deflate to ~six.~  The inclusion of suicides in the NEJM risk equation -- like the causes, durability, or interdiction of suicidal intent itself -- is a profoundly debatable matter.  Quotations of the NEJM study totally disregard this issue.   5.  Citations of the NEJM study also mislead regarding the estimable rate of justifiable and excusable homicide.  Most measures, like the NEJM homicide rate, are based on the immediate disposition of cases.  But many homicides initially ruled criminal are appealed and later ruled self-defense.  In the literature on battered women, immediate case dispositions are notorious for under-representing the rate of justifiable or excusable homicide. Time~s January 18, 1993, cover story on women ~Fighting Back~ reported one study~s finding that 40% of women who appeal have their murder convictions thrown out.  Time~s July 17, 1989, cover story on a week of gun deaths reported 51% of the domestic cases as shootings by abuse victims; but only 3% of the homicides were reported as self-defense.  In a May 14, 1990, update, Time  reported that 12% of the homicides had eventually been ruled self-defense. In Time~s sample, the originally reported rate of self-defense was in error by a factor of four.  The possibility of such error is not acknowledged by promulgators of the NEJM statistic.    6.  While both the dividend and the product of the NEJM risk equation are arguably inflated, the divisor is unconscionably misleading.  The divisor of this equation counts only aggressors who are killed,  not aggressors who are successfully thwarted without being killed or even shot at.   The utility of armed self-defense is the other side of the coin from the harms done with guns in homes.  What kind of moral idiocy is it to measure this utility only in terms of killings ?  Do we measure the utility of our police solely in terms of felons killed  -- as opposed to the many many more who are otherwise foiled, apprehended, or deterred?  Should we not celebrate (let alone count ) those cases where no human life is lost as successful armed defenses?  The question posed to media that cite the NEJM scare stat is this:  Why neglect the compendious research on successful armed defense, notably by criminologist Gary Kleck (Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America , Aldine de Gruyter, 1992)?  Kleck~s estimations of the rate and risk of defensive firearm use are based on victimization surveys as well as other studies:  the rate is high (about one million a year) and the risk is good (gun defenders fare better than anyone, either those who resort to other forms of resistance or those who do not resist).  Dividing one million gun defenses a year by 30,000 annual gun deaths (from self-defense, homicides, suicides, and accidents) yields 33.  Thus, we can construct a much more favorable statistic than the NEJM scare stat:    A gun is 33 times more likely to be used to defend against assault or other crime than to kill anybody.      Of course, Kleck~s critics belittle the dividend of this calculation; what is good news for gun defenders is bad news for gun control.  We should indeed question the basis and method of Kleck~s high estimation of defensive firearm use, as I have questioned the NEJM statistic.  Clearly, the issue of how to manage mortal risks is not settled by uncritical citation of statistics.   One thing troubles me still:  we can hardly escape the unquestioned NEJM scare stat in our media,  but we hardly ever find Kleck~s good work mentioned,  even critically. \",\"Having read the various \\\"Clipper\\\" announcements on the net over the last few  days and a LOT of uninformed speculation about the chip, its uses, government plots, etc, I have the following questions.    1) What does the \\\"Clipper chip\\\" actually implement? Just the Skipjack  cryptographic algorithm? Or does it also implement a \\\"chip to chip\\\"  communications protocol? If it does implement a communications  protocol, can it be used as just a \\\"crypt chip\\\" also.    2) Where can the chip specifications and spec sheets be obtained?    3) Who may purchase them and under what conditions?    4) Are there restrictions as to how the chip may be used in a system?    5) The security of the algorithm and the encrypted communications does  not appear to require that the \\\"Family key\\\" be a secret. Why is  it a secret? What happens when the \\\"family key\\\" becomes well known?  If it's a secret to make traffic analysis more difficult, does  the \\\"Law enforcement message\\\" contain any random information?  How much and how random is it?    6) Can the chip be programmed to reveal the \\\"Unit key\\\"? The chip \\\"serial  number\\\"? Any of the programming parameters?  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Raymond S.

They are used in the sweep portion of a TV set. Thanks in advance,\",\"  Any projectile traveling at or near typical bullet speeds is potentially lethal.  Even blanks [which have no projectile] can cause death if the muzzle is in close proximity to the victim.  I have heard of rubber or plastic bullets being used effectively during riot situations [where the intent is crowd control, rather than close range self defense]; i've also seen reports of deaths caused by them [the British in Northern Ireland].  Use of a firearm for self defense is appropriate and lawful only in the gravest of situations; at that point, i consider deadly [lethal] force to  be a proper reaction [and so does the law].    Furthermore, use of less effective [but still potentially lethal] force has its own set of problems.  It may well take more applications of the less effective force to stop the incident; this places all parties at some risk; the victim because the attack has not stopped, and the assailent  since the aggregate damage done by the multiple applications may well be more deadly. \",\"This may be the dumbest question of the year, but is there a way to 'piggyback' or expand a 6-slot motherboard (all 16-bit) to get the usual 8?

In one of Jesus' revelation in this century, \\\"...same thing as in the old days.  People refuse to believe my messengers.  Even when I was alive here on earth, they refuse Me.  What more when I am just talking through somebody else?\\\" (paraphrased).  With all the knowledge believers accumulated, He would think that we would be 'enlightened' enough to detect which ones are  'authentic and divine' as opposed to 'evil or man-made'.  These signs, these miracles, are you afraid that they are not from God? That these are the signs we should not open our hearts and mind to for thinking   they are evil? Well, is faith in God evil? Is true peace evil?  Is true love that is divine and pure evil?  Why can't someone accept that God can do what He wants in fulfillment of His   generous love and Jesus' never ending forgiveness to those who turn back to   Him for salvation? Why are we refusing God's messenger of this truth?  The mother to all who are   in Christ? What brings us these:     fears of being shamed by what others will think or say about us?         which, in contrary, could be pleasing to God?     fears of being humbled?     fears of being judged as wrong (wrt mainstream standard of what is right)? Why can't we tolerate non-believers' mockery or ridicule of us for the   sake of peace, love and obedience to God?  The humbling lessons left to us   by martyrs and saints? We'd rather engage in never-ending bickering and disproof of each other's   opinion - looking at each other's mistakes - for the sake of arguments,   instead of having communion in one body with Christ. What makes us go blind to the truth that God is All Powerful and that He can   not be binded by what people wrote and have written about Him in all ages? Why is our faith in God limited?  By all the words and literature we muster? What prevents us from going *beyond* being saved and extend God's rich love   to others who are not?  Why are our eyes not wide open to see that He continuously sees our faith, hope   and love which glorify Him and so He gives us indications of His    acknowledgements with signs/miracles (ordinary/common or divinely inspired)    everywhere?  Isn't that like an atheist/agnostic's view that all these   are just ordinary here on earth and not caused by anything supernatural?  Why then does the Holy Mother comes back to remind us:   \\\"We must really __accept that prayer__ changes the course of things and that   with prayers __even wars can be prevented__.\\\" but then she continues:   \\\"You often have an egotistic attitude.  Dear children, in these days you   have prayed very much, __but your hands have remained empty__.\\\" Why hesitate in proclaiming what needs to be done:   \\\"prayer, conversion, peace, penance, fasting, the Holy Mass, living life   as what the Gospel brings.\\\"? Why not do so?  How?  To the world?   \\\"Start in your family.  Be a good example.  Live the Word.\\\" Why worry if it is going to be of good use to many?   \\\"The fruits, __leave them to the Lord__, do not worry about anything or    anyone but entrust yourself to the Lord.\\\"  Although the Holy Mother does not insist because:   \\\"You are free; I bow before the freedom which God gives you.\\\" but she follows this with:   \\\"You are surprised because I say to you: Decide for God and yet, see how   you have lived this day.\\\" Why does she constantly conveys:   \\\"Take this life toward God in the way as to __experience__ the Lord Himself   in your __behavior__ and __not only__ when you pray\\\" or one time when we    decide that we are saved, or talk/write about God, etc. The Holy Mother warns:   \\\"Satan (the serpent) is always trying to dissuade you to turn you away from   my peace plan and prayer.\\\"  (Rev 12:17, the dragon became angry with the woman   and went off to wage war against the rest of her offsprings, those who keep   God's commandments, and bear witness to Jesus.)  Do you have fear or hate for God's current messenger of true peace, love and   our motherly protector from the anti-Christ? The one who is being apprehensive of communism, wars, famine and other evils   that the serpent brings upon us?  This obedient and blessed new Eve? The mother who warns us so we can be prepared and be strong against Satan? Haven't there been renewed faith, hope, love, peace and obedience wherever   this messenger has shared her blessings and graces that God has given her   in good purpose? Why do we choose to be blind? Why fear the truth that God has been giving us a chance and sharing Christ's   ever-forgetting forgiveness to us through the obedient mother? The mother who has been consecrated the task __to reverse__ the disobedient   harm and example done by the ancient Eve. She has been preparing the new Eden with her Immaculate Heart. The new Eden as sanctuary (the womb) for the next coming and judgement of the    righteous by our Lord, Jesus Christ; when The Lamb marries His bride. Shouldn't we give her a hand in her exhaustive job of preparing us for the   second coming of her Son as she has been conceived without sin to bear   the Son of God in her womb? Why fear true peace, love and renewed faith and obedience to God that Mary   faithfully brings to God's children?  She has been protecting the flock   (the rest of the offsprings) from the greedy dragon so as to present more    righteous members for her Son's coming. Not all apparitions and miracles that resulted from them are worthy   of belief.  With prayer and guidance from the Holy Spirit and, of course,   approval of our Church authorities, we should be aware of the true and   divinely inspired ones; specifically, the ones which aligns with the   Scripture.     Also, our Lady reminds us of recommendation of __silence__ in our prayers:   \\\"If you speak unceasingly in your prayers, how will you be able to hear   God?  Allow Him room to answer you, to speak to you.\\\"   She encourages us (with motherly nurturing) to continue in exuberant  faith, hope and love to Jesus, constantly.  NOT with mere emotions,  but with deep, constant obedience to Jesus, her Beloved Son and acknowledgement of our need to have Him as part of our lives.  Let's not wait to the last minute to renew our faith and the life that God wants us to live; when there won't be enough time or when it will be late.                                                        Nowadays, Mary says,  \\\"Pray, pray, pray for peace...reconciliation, my children.\\\" Have peace within yourself first before you can promote peace to others.  For without peace, you can not fully accept my Son.\\\"                                                                          And you think she's just an ordinary lady.  Not to me.  She's our good Mother/messenger from God and she is so nice enough to share God's kingdom to us through her Son and experience it.  With Mary, we are assured that The Lamb always succeeds.  ----- Note:  All enclosed in quotes are from \\\"Latest News of Medjugorje\\\"        Number 10, June, 1991 by Fr.

Hrudey made 21 saves in Sundays 6-3 opening victory.  But Stauber clearly is upset with his sudden status as the No. 3 man behind Rick Knickle.  Stauber had a 4-1-2 record and 2.98 goals-against average down the stretch in the regular season and nearly wrestled the No. 1 job from Hrudey.  Knickle?  He won 2 of 3 decisions but had a bloated 5.26 average, twice was  yanked from games (once for stomach cramps) and hasn't played since March 29.  Yet, when the series resumes Wednesday, Knickle will serve as Hrudey's backup again and Stauber will have to satisfy his playoff hunger by munching on Olympic Saddledome popcorn.  \\\"If I'm supposedly close to being the starter or could have been the starter...I dropped too. 3.  What happened to No. 2?\\\"  Stauber wondered.  \\\"Not that I'd be happy with No. 2, but I feel I should at least be a part of this team in the playoffs.\\\"  Perhaps Stauber eventually will get his chance, but Melrose apparently is not convinced the 25-year old is capable of handling playoff pressure.  While insisting he is the Kings' \\\"goalie of the future,\\\" Melrose said Stauber flubbed all four of the big games he was asked to win this season.  They were, according to Melrose: a 7-2 loss to San Jose on Dec. 26; An 8-3 loss to the New York Rangers on Jan. 23; a 6-6 tie with Detroit on Feb. 11; an 8-6 loss to  Vancouver on Thursday.  \\\"Four times this season Robb could have emerged as the elite goalie, he could have taken it away from Kelly Hrudey, and he didn't do it,\\\" Melrose said.  \\\"An elite goaltender has to carry the ball when you give it to him.  The mark of a great goalie is that he isn't satisfied to be a backup.\\\"  \\\"I'm not blaming Robb for the losses, but if you're going to be No. 1, you've got to be able to walk your talk.  You've got to be able to play when everything is on the line.  Robb Stauber has a great deal of ability, but maybe I expect more from him than he does.\\\"  Ouch.  That remark stung Stauber.  He began the season 9-0-1, struggled when the team hit a mid-season slump, didn't play for a month after Knickle was signed off the San Diego Gulls roster, then came on at the end.  \\\"I expect more from myself than anybody, including Barry Melrose,\\\" said Stauber, a three-year star at the University of Minnesota who left school in 1989, only  to have his development hampered by a string of serious injuries.  \\\"What I've been through the last four years - two knee operations, a herniated disk in my back, shoulder surgery - what more can I go through?  I obviously do expect a lot from myself, otherwise I wouldn't be here.\\\"  \\\"Anybody who would disagree with that doesn't know me.  I'm not saying Barry  doesn't know me, but don't say I've been without expectations.  If anything, I'm a perfectionist.\\\"  Stauber acknowledged he played poorly in the four games Melrose mentioned. \\\"But  even though I didn't play well, I get knocked down from maybe on to three? It's  a bit of a jump,\\\" he said.  \\\"You're almost No. 1, or if you play a good game  you're No. 1 and if you don't you're No. 3?  Why does Jack Nicklaus shoot a 67  and then a 75?  Can you explain that?  That's what barry wanted me to explain  to him, why I didn't come through when he counted on me.  I don't know. What I  do know is, it's a sport.  I'll be there.\\\"  Melrose's \\\"goalie of the future\\\" statement doesn't mean much to Stauber. \\\"Before you know it, I'll be 30 and there will be no future,\\\" he said.  ------  *Game 1 of the Kings @ Flames playoff series drew a 4.2 Nielsen rating on ABC  Channel 7 here in LA.

How long are you going to keep repeating this utterly idiotic [and increasingly saddening] drivel?  oz\",\"  At the cost of repudiating the FAQ, I think too much is made of the strong vs weak atheism issue, although in the context of alt.atheism, where we're continually attacked on the basis that strong atheists \\\"believe\\\" in the non-existence of god, I think the separation is a valid one.  To cover my arse, what I'm trying to say is that there is an infinitely grey area between weak and strong, as well as between strong and the unattainable mathematical atheism (I wish!).  Whereas I _logically_ can only support the weak atheist position, in effect I am a strong atheist (and wish I could be a mathematical one).  To justify my strong atheist position I believe I need only show that the evidence presented in favour of any of the gods under scrutiny is faulty.  If I read the FAQ correctly, no argument for the existence of god (generic, as represented by mainstream theologians) has ever been found to be unassailable.  To me this is adequate evidence that the _real_god_ is undefinable (or at least no definition has yet been found to be watertight), which in turn I accept as sufficient to base a disbelief in each and every conceivable god.  I'm a little fuzzy on the edges, though, so opinions are welcome (but perhaps we should change the thread subject).\",\"I have two questions:  1) What would be required to create a Macintosh PC network    including laser printers, line printers, etc.?\",\"   [More stuff deleted]  This seems to be a pretty arogant definition of belief.  My beliefs are those things which I find to be true based on my experience of the world.  This experience includes study of things that I may not have experienced directly.  But even then, I can only understand the studies to the extent to which I can relate what I study back to what I have experienced.  Which means that by beliefs about God are directly related to my experience of God.  Having experienced God, I try to make sense of that experience.  I study religion and read the Bible.  I find things that echo what I have already experienced.  Out of this I build my beliefs.  I also find things that don't match my experience.  That doesn't make them false.  They just don't match my experience.  Maybe I will understand that stuff later.  I don't know.  Maybe all of my beliefs are wrong.  I can change my beliefs.  If someone else has beliefs that are different from mine, so what. Neither of us are necessarily wrong.  Someone else is making sense out of a different set of experiences.  Even though we have different explanations and beliefs, if we talk we might even discover that the underlying experiences are similar.  Some people approach religion as a truth that can only exist in one form, and usually has a single revelation.  The more dogmatic and inflexible the belief system, the more arrogant it will appear to an outsider.  There is another approach possible, however.  God is a mystery.  I am trying to solve the mystery, so I look at the evidence available to me.  I try to arrive at the best understanding that I can based on the evidence.  New evidence may cause me to change my understanding.  When I encounter someone with a different belief than my own, it isn't a threat, it is an opportunity to perhaps discover something new about this mystery I can never fully comprehend.

As he said himself:     The folkish-minded man, in particular, has the sacred duty, each in    his own denomination, of making _people_stop_just_talking_    superficially_of_God's_will,_and_actually_fulfill_God's_will,_and_    not_let_God's_word_be_desecrated._[orig. ital.]     For God's will gave men their form, their essence, and their    abilities.  Anyone who destroys His work is declaring war on the    Lord's creation, the divine will.  Therefore, let every man be    active, each in his own denomination if you please, and let every    man take it as his first and most sacred duty to oppose anyone who    in his activity by word or deed steps outside the confines of his    religious community and tries to butt into the other.     [...]     Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will    of the Almighty Creator: _by_defending_myself_against_the_Jew,_I_am_    fighting_for_the_work_of_the_Lord._[orig. ital.]            -- Adolf Hitler, from \\\"Mein Kampf\\\", trans. Ralph Mannheim.  Of course, someone bad believing something does not make that belief wrong.  It's also entirely possible that Hitler was lying when he claimed  to believe in God.  We certainly can't conclude that he's an atheist,  though.  ------------------------------  Subject: The Bible proves it  Typical posting:  In the Bible it says that...  Response:  Most of the readers of alt.atheism feel that the Bible is of questionable accuracy, as it was written thousands of years ago by many authors who were recording oral tradition that existed many years before.  Thus, any claimed 'truth' in it is of questionable legitimacy.  This isn't to say that The Bible has no truth in it; simply that any truth must be examined before being accepted.  Many of the readers of this group also feel that because any passage is subject to \\\"interpretation\\\", any claim that a passage 'means' one thing and one thing only is not legitimate.  Note that this feeling tends to extend to other books.  It is also remarkable to many atheists that theists tend to ignore other equally plausible religious books in favour of those of their own religion.  ------------------------------  Subject: Pascal's Wager  Typical posting:  If you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing -- but if you don't believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you will go to hell. Therefore it is foolish to be an atheist.  Response:  This argument is known as Pascal's Wager.  It has several flaws.  Firstly, it does not indicate which religion to follow.  Indeed, there are many mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out there.  This is often described as the \\\"avoiding the wrong hell\\\" problem.  If a person is a follower of religion X, he may end up in religion Y's version of hell.  Secondly, the statement that \\\"If you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing\\\" is not true.  Suppose you're believing in the wrong God -- the true God might punish you for your foolishness. Consider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine in favour of prayer.  Another flaw in the argument is that it is based on the assumption that  the two possibilities are equally likely -- or at least, that they are of  comparable likelihood.  If, in fact, the possibility of there being a God  is close to zero, the argument becomes much less persuasive.  So sadly the argument is only likely to convince those who believe already.  Also, many feel that for intellectually honest people, belief is based on  evidence, with some amount of intuition.  It is not a matter of will or  cost-benefit analysis.  Formally speaking, the argument consists of four statements:    1. One does not know whether God exists.   2. Not believing in God is bad for one's eternal soul if God does      exist.   3. Believing in God is of no consequence if God does not exist.   4. Therefore it is in one's interest to believe in God.  There are two approaches to the argument.  The first is to view 1 as an assumption, and 2 as a consequence of it.  One problem with this approach, in the abstract, is that it creates information from no information.  This is considered invalid in information theory.  Statement 1 indicates one has no information about God -- but statement 2 indicates that beneficial information can be gained from the absolute lack of information about God.  This violates information entropy -- information has been extracted from no information, at no \\\"cost\\\".  The alternative approach is to claim that 1 and 2 are both assumptions.  The problem with this is that 2 is then basically an assumption which states the Christian position, and only a Christian will agree with that assumption. The argument thus collapses to \\\"If you are a Christian, it is in your interests to believe in God\\\" -- a rather vacuous tautology, and not the way Pascal intended the argument to be viewed.  The biggest reason why Pascal's wager is a failure is that if God is omniscient he will certainly know who really believes and who believes as a wager.  He will spurn the latter... assuming he actually cares at all whether people believe in him.  ------------------------------  Subject: What is Occam's Razor?  Typical posting:  People keep talking about Occam's Razor.  What is it?  Response:  William of Occam formulated a principle which has become known as Occam's  Razor.  In its original form, it said \\\"Do not multiply entities  unnecessarily.\\\"  That is, if you can explain something without supposing the existence of some entity, then do so.  Nowadays when people refer to Occam's Razor, they generally express it  more generally, for example as \\\"Take the simplest solution\\\".  The relevance to atheism is that we can look at two possible explanations  for what we see around us:  1. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, which came into being as a result of natural processes.  2. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, and  there is also a God who created the universe.  Clearly this God must be  of non-zero complexity.  Given that both explanations fit the facts, Occam's Razor might suggest  that we should take the simpler of the two -- solution number one. Unfortunately, some argue that there is a third even more simple solution:  3. There isn't an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there.   We just imagine that there is.  This third option leads us logically towards solipsism, which many people  find unacceptable.   ------------------------------  Subject: Why it's good to believe in Jesus  Typical posting:  I want to tell people about the virtues and benefits of my religion.  Response:  Preaching is not appreciated.  Feel free to talk about your religion, but please do not write postings that are on a \\\"conversion\\\" theme.  Such postings do not belong on alt.atheism and will be rejected from alt.atheism.moderated (try the newsgroup talk.religion.misc).  You would doubtless not welcome postings from atheists to your favourite newsgroup in an attempt to convert you; please do unto others as you would have them do unto you!  Often theists make their basic claims about God in the form of lengthy analogies or parables.  Be aware that atheists have heard of God and know the basic claims about him; if the sole purpose of your parable is to tell atheists that God exists and brings salvation, you may as well not post it, since it tells us nothing we have not been told before.  ------------------------------  Subject: Why I know that God exists  Typical posting:  I *know* from personal experience and prayer that God exists.  Response:  Just as many theists have personal evidence that the being they worship exists, so many atheists have personal evidence that such beings do not exist.  That evidence varies from person to person.  Furthermore, without wishing to dismiss your evidence out of hand, many people have claimed all kinds of unlikely things -- that they have been abducted by UFOs, visited by the ghost of Elvis, and so on.  ------------------------------  Subject: Einstein and \\\"God does not play dice\\\"  Typical posting:  Albert Einstein believed in God.  Do you think you're cleverer than him?  Response:  Einstein did once comment that \\\"God does not play dice [with the universe]\\\".  This quotation is commonly mentioned to show that Einstein believed in the Christian God.  Used this way, it is out of context; it refers to Einstein's refusal to accept the uncertainties indicated by quantum theory. Furthermore, Einstein's religious background was Jewish rather than Christian.  A better quotation showing what Einstein thought about God is the following: \\\"I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists, not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings.\\\"  Einstein was unable to accept Quantum Theory because of his belief in an objective, orderly reality; a reality which would not be subject to random events and which would not be dependent upon the observer.  He believed that QM was incomplete, and that a better theory would have no need for statistical interpretations.  So far no such better theory has been found, and much evidence suggests that it never will be.  A longer quote from Einstein appears in \\\"Science, Philosophy, and Religion, A Symposium\\\", published by the Conference on Science, Philosophy and Religion in Their Relation to the Democratic Way of Life, Inc., New York, 1941.  In    \\\"The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events    the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side    of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature.  For him    neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an    independent cause of natural events.  To be sure, the doctrine of a    personal God interfering with natural events could never be    *refuted* [italics his], in the real sense, by science, for this    doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific    knowledge has not yet been able to set foot.     But I am convinced that such behavior on the part of representatives    of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal.  For a doctrine    which is to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark,    will of necessity lose its effect on mankind, with incalculable harm    to human progress.  In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers    of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal    God, that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past    placed such vast power in the hands of priests.  In their labors they    will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable    of cultivating the Good, the True, and the Beautiful in humanity    itself.  This is, to be sure, a more difficult but an incomparably    more worthy task...\\\"     \\\"It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religous convictions,    a lie which is being systematically repeated.  I do not believe in a    personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly.    If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the    unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our    science can reveal it.\\\"  The latter quote is from \\\"Albert Einstein: The Human Side\\\", edited by Helen  Dukas and Banesh Hoffman, and published by Princeton University Press.   Also from the same book:    \\\"I do not believe in immortality of the individual, and I consider ethics    to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind     it.\\\"  Of course, the fact that Einstein chose not to believe in Christianity does  not in itself imply that Christianity is false.  ------------------------------  Subject: Everyone worships something  Typical posting:  Everyone worships something, whether it's money, power or God.  Response:  If that is true, everyone is a polytheist.  Theists care just as much about those things that atheists care about.  If the atheists' reactions to (for example) their families amount to worship then so do the theists'.  ------------------------------  Subject: Why there must be a causeless cause  Typical posting:  Sets of integers that have a lower bound each have a smallest member, so chains of causes must all have a first element, a causeless cause.  Response:  The set of real numbers greater than zero has a definite lower bound, but has no smallest member.  Further, even if it is true that there must be a causeless cause, that does not imply that that cause must be a conscious supernatural entity, and especially not that any such entity must match the description favoured by any particular religion.  ------------------------------  Subject: The universe is so complex it must have been designed  Typical posting:  The presence of design in the universe proves there is a God.  Surely you don't think all this appeared here just by chance?  Response:  This is known as the Argument From Design.  It is a matter of dispute whether there is any element of design in the universe. Those who believe that the complexity and diversity of living creatures on the earth is evidence of a creator are best advised to read the newsgroup talk.origins for a while.  There is insufficient space to summarize both sides of that debate here. However, the conclusion is that there is no scientific evidence in favour of so-called Scientific Creationism. Furthermore, there is much evidence, observation and theory that can explain many of the complexities of the universe and life on earth.  The origin of the Argument by Design is a feeling that the existence of something as incredibly intricate as, say, a human is so improbable that surely it can't have come about by chance; that surely there must be some  external intelligence directing things so that humans come from the chaos deliberately.  But if human intelligence is so improbable, surely the existence of a mind capable of fashioning an entire universe complete with conscious beings must be immeasurably more unlikely?  The approach used to argue in favour of the existence of a creator can be turned around and applied to the Creationist position.  This leads us to the familiar theme of \\\"If a creator created the universe, what created the creator?\\\", but with the addition of spiralling  improbability.  The only way out is to declare that the creator was not created and just \\\"is\\\" (or \\\"was\\\").  From here we might as well ask what is wrong with saying that the universe just \\\"is\\\" without introducing a creator?  Indeed Stephen Hawking, in his book \\\"A Brief History of Time\\\", explains his theory that the universe is closed and finite in extent, with no beginning or end.  The Argument From Design is often stated by analogy, in the so-called  Watchmaker Argument.  One is asked to imagine that one has found a watch on the beach.  Does one assume that it was created by a watchmaker, or that it evolved naturally?  Of course one assumes a watchmaker.  Yet like the  watch, the universe is intricate and complex; so, the argument goes, the  universe too must have a creator.  The Watchmaker analogy suffers from three particular flaws, over and above  those common to all Arguments By Design.  Firstly, a watchmaker creates  watches from pre-existing materials, whereas God is claimed to have  created the universe from nothing.  These two sorts of creation are  clearly fundamentally different, and the analogy is therefore rather weak.  Secondly, a watchmaker makes watches, but there are many other things in  the world.  If we walked further along the beach and found a nuclear  reactor, we wouldn't assume it was created by the watchmaker.  The argument  would therefore suggest a multitude of creators, each responsible for a  different part of creation.  Finally, in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that  the watch is not part of nature because it is ordered, and therefore  stands out from the randomness of nature.  Yet in the second part of the  argument, we start from the position that the universe is obviously not  random, but shows elements of order.  The Watchmaker argument is thus  internally inconsistent.  ------------------------------  Subject: Independent evidence that the Bible is true  Typical posting:  The events of the New Testament are confirmed by independent documentary evidence.  For example...  Response:  The writings of Josephus are often mentioned as independent documentary evidence.  Early versions of Josephus's work are thought not to have mentioned Jesus or James; the extant version discusses John in a non-Christian context.  Many scholars believe that the original mentioned Jesus and James in passing, but that this was expanded by Christian copyists.  Several \\\"reconstructions\\\" of the original text have been published to this effect.  Much information appears in the Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius (about 320 C.E.).  It is worthless as historical material because of the deliberate falsification of the wily Eusebius who is generally acknowledged as 'the first thoroughly dishonest historian of antiquity.' It is Eusebius who is generally given the title of authorship for this material.  Aside from the New Testament, the biographical information about Jesus is more well-documented.  For further information, please consult the Frequently Asked Questions file for the newsgroup soc.religion.christian.  ------------------------------  Subject: Godel's Incompleteness Theorem  Typical posting:  Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible for the Bible to be both true and complete.  Response:  Godel's First Incompleteness Theorem says that in any consistent formal  system which is sufficiently expressive that it can model ordinary  arithmetic, one can formulate expressions which can never be proven to be  valid or invalid ('true' or 'false') within that formal system.  (Technically speaking, the system must also be recursive; that is, there must be a decision procedure for determining whether a given string is an axiom within the formal  system.)  Essentially, all such systems can formulate what is known as a \\\"Liar  Paradox.\\\"  The classic Liar Paradox sentence in ordinary English is \\\"This  sentence is false.\\\"  Note that if a proposition is undecidable, the formal  system cannot even deduce that it is undecidable.  The logic used in theological discussions is rarely well defined, so claims that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible to prove or disprove) the existence of God are worthless in isolation.  One can trivially define a formal system in which it is possible to prove the existence of God, simply by having the existence of God stated as an axiom.  This is unlikely to be viewed by atheists as a convincing proof, however.  It may be possible to succeed in producing a formal system built on axioms that both atheists and theists agree with.  It may then be possible to show that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem holds for that system.  However, that would still not demonstrate that it is impossible to prove that God exists within the system.  Furthermore, it certainly wouldn't tell us anything about whether it is possible to prove the existence of God generally.  Note also that all of these hypothetical formal systems tell us nothing about the actual existence of God; the formal systems are just abstractions.  Another frequent claim is that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that a religious text (the Bible, the Book of Mormon or whatever) cannot be both consistent and universally applicable. Religious texts are not formal systems, so such claims are nonsense.  ------------------------------  Subject: George Bush on atheism and patriotism  Typical posting:  Did George Bush really say that atheists should not be considered citizens?  Response:  The following exchange took place at the Chicago airport between Robert I. Sherman of American Atheist Press and George Bush, on August 27 1988. Sherman is a fully accredited reporter, and was present by invitation as a member of the press corps.  The Republican presidential nominee was there to announce federal disaster relief for Illinois.  The discussion turned to the presidential primary:   RS: \\\"What will you do to win the votes of Americans who are atheists?\\\"   GB: \\\"I guess I'm pretty weak in the atheist community.  Faith in       God is important to me.\\\"   RS: \\\"Surely you recognize the equal citizenship and patriotism of       Americans who are atheists?\\\"   GB: \\\"No, I don't know that atheists should be considered as citizens,       nor should they be considered patriots.  This is one nation under       God.\\\"   RS: \\\"Do you support as a sound constitutional principle the separation       of state and church?\\\"   GB: \\\"Yes, I support the separation of church and state.  I'm just not       very high on atheists.\\\"  UPI reported on May 8, 1989, that various atheist organizations were still angry over the remarks.  The exchange appeared in the Boulder Daily Camera on Monday February 27, 1989.  It can also be found in \\\"Free Enquiry\\\" magazine, Fall 1988 issue, Volume 8, Number 4, page 16.  On October 29, 1988, Mr. Sherman had a confrontation with Ed Murnane, cochairman of the Bush-Quayle '88 Illinois campaign.  This concerned a lawsuit Mr. Sherman had filed to stop the Community Consolidated School District 21 (Chicago, Illinois) from forcing his first-grade Atheist son to pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States as \\\"one nation under God\\\" (Bush's phrase).  The following conversation took place:    RS: \\\"American Atheists filed the Pledge of Allegiance lawsuit yesterday.       Does the Bush campaign have an official response to this filing?\\\"    EM: \\\"It's bullshit.\\\"    RS: \\\"What is bullshit?\\\"    EM: \\\"Everything that American Atheists does, Rob, is bullshit.\\\"    RS: \\\"Thank you for telling me what the official position of the Bush       campaign is on this issue.\\\"   EM: \\\"You're welcome.\\\"  After Bush's election, American Atheists wrote to Bush asking him to retract his statement.  On February 21st 1989, C. Boyden Gray, Counsel to the President, replied on White House stationery that Bush substantively stood by    \\\"As you are aware, the President is a religious man who neither supports    atheism nor believes that atheism should be unnecessarily encouraged or    supported by the government.\\\"  For further information, contact American Atheist Veterans at the American Atheist Press's Cameron Road address.  ------------------------------  Subject: I know where hell is!  Typical posting:  I know where Hell is!  Hell is in Norway!  Response:  There are several towns called \\\"Hell\\\" in various countries around the world, including Norway and the USA.  Whilst this information is mildly amusing the first time one hears it, readers of alt.atheism are now  getting pretty fed up with hearing it every week.  ------------------------------  Subject: Biblical contradictions wanted  Typical posting:  Does anyone have a list of Biblical contradictions?  Response:   American Atheist Press publish an atheist's handbook detailing Biblical contradictions. See the accompanying posting on Atheist Resources for details.  There is a file containing some Biblical contradictions available from the archive-server@mantis.co.uk. See the contacts file for more information.  ------------------------------  Subject: The USA is a Christian nation  Typical posting:  Because of the religious beliefs of the founding fathers, shouldn't the United States be considered a Christian nation?  Response:  Based upon the writings of several important founding fathers, it is clear that they never intended the US to be a Christian nation.  Here are some quotes; there are many more.    \\\"What influence, in fact, have ecclesiastical establishments had on society?    In some instances they have been seen to erect a spiritual tyranny on the    ruins of the civil authority; on many instances they have been seen    upholding the thrones of political tyranny; in no instance have they been    the guardians of the liberties of the people.  Rulers who wish to subvert    the public liberty may have found an established clergy convenient    auxiliaries. A just government, instituted to secure and perpetuate it,    needs them not.\\\"       - James Madison, \\\"A Memorial and Remonstrance\\\", 1785    \\\"I almost shudder at the thought of alluding to the most fatal example of    the abuses of grief which the history of mankind has preserved--the Cross.    Consider what calamities that engine of grief has produced!\\\"       - John Adams, in a letter to Thomas Jefferson    \\\"History I believe furnishes no example of a priest-ridden people    maintaining a free civil government.  This marks the lowest grade of    ignorance, of which their political as well as religious leaders will    always avail themselves for their own purpose.\\\"        - Thomas Jefferson to Baron von Humboldt, 1813    \\\"I cannot conceive otherwise than that He, the Infinite Father, expects or    requires no worship or praise from us, but that He is even infinitely    above it.\\\"        - Benjamin Franklin, from \\\"Articles of Belief and Acts of Religion\\\",         Nov. 20, 1728  ------------------------------  Subject: The USA is not a Christian nation  Typical posting:  Is it true that George Washington said that the United States is not in any sense founded upon the Christian religion?  Response:  No.  The quotation often given is in fact from Article XI of the 1797 Treaty of Tripoli (8 Stat 154, Treaty Series 358):     Article 11     As the government of the United States of America is not in any sense    founded on the Christian Religion, -- as it has in itself no character of    enmity against the laws, religion or tranquility of Musselmen, -- and as    the said States never have entered into any war or act of hostility    against any Mehomitan nation, it is declared by the parties that no    pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption    of the harmony existing between the two countries.  The text may be found in the Congressional Record or in treaty collections such as Charles Bevans' \\\"Treaties and Other International Agreements of the United States of America 1776-1949\\\", vol. 11 (pp. 1070-1080).  The English text of the Treaty of Tripoli was approved by the U.S. Senate on June 7, 1797 and ratified by President John Adams on June 10, 1797.  It was recently discovered that the Arabic version of the treaty not only lacks the quotation, it lacks Article XI altogether.  The person who translated the Arabic to English was Joel Barlow, Consul General at Algiers, a close friend of Thomas Paine -- and an opponent of Christianity.  It is possible that Barlow made up Article XI, but since there is no Arabic version of that article to be found, it's hard to say.  In 1806 a new Treaty of Tripoli was ratified which no longer contained the quotation. \",\"(note: this is not about the L.A. or NY Times)  A few times a year, a funny thing happens: the bike engine runs perfectly.

Currently the most stable of anonymous remailing and posting sites   is anon.penet.fi operated by julf@penet.fi for several months, who   has system adminstrator privileges and owns the equipment.    Including anonymized mail, Usenet posting, and return addresses    (no encryption).  Send mail to help@penet.fi for information.     Hal Finney has contributed an instruction manual for the cypherpunk   remailers on the ftp site soda.berkeley.edu (128.32.149.19):   pub/cypherpunks/hal's.instructions. See also scripts.tar.Z (UNIX   scripts to aid remailer use) and anonmail.arj (MSDOS batch files to   aid remailer use).    ebrandt@jarthur.claremont.edu   -----------------------------     Anonymized mail.  Request information from above address.        elee7h5@rosebud.ee.uh.edu   -------------------------     Experimental anonymous remailer run Karl Barrus     <elee9sf@Menudo.UH.EDU>, with encryption to the server.  Request     information from that address.        hal@alumni.caltech.edu   ----------------------     Experimental remailer with encryption to server and return     addresses.  Request information from above address.    hh@soda.berkeley.edu   hh@cicada.berkeley.edu   hh@pmantis.berkeley.edu   ----------------------     Experimental remailer.  Include header `Request-Remailing-To'.    nowhere@bsu-cs.bsu.edu    ----------------------     Experimental remailer allowing one level of chaining.  Run by     Chael Hall.  Request information from above address.    phantom@mead.u.washington.edu    -----------------------------     Experimental remailer with encryption to server.  `finger' site     address for information.    Notes   =====      - Cypherpunk remailers tend to be unstable because they are often     running without site administrator knowledge. Liability issues     are wholly unresolved.      - So far, all encryption is based on public-key cryptography and PGP     software (see the question on cryptography).     - Encryption aspects (message text, destination address, replies)     vary between sites.    - Multiple chaining, alias unlinking, and address encryption are     mostly untested, problematic, or unsupported at this time.  _____ <8.2> What are the responsibilities associated with anonymity?       Users   -----    - Use anonymity only if you have to. Frivolous uses weaken the     seriousness and usefulness of the capability for others.   - Do not use anonymity to provoke, harass, or threaten others.   - Do not hide behind anonymity to evade established conventions on     Usenet,  such as posting binary pictures to regular newsgroups.   - If posting large files, be attentive to bandwidth considerations.     Remember, simply sending the posting to the service increases     network traffic.   - Avoid posting anonymously to the regular hierarchy of Usenet; this     is the mostly likely place to alienate readers. The `alt'     hierarchy is preferred.   - Give as much information as possible in the posting (i.e.     references, etc.) Remember that content is the only means for     readers to judge the truth of the message, and that any     inaccuracies will tend to discredit the entire message and even     future ones under the same handle.   - Be careful not to include information that will reveal your     identity or enable someone to deduce it.  Test the system by     sending anonymized mail to yourself.   - Be aware of the policies of the anonymous site and respect them.      Be prepared to forfeit your anonymity if you abuse the privilege.   - Be considerate and respectful of other's objections to anonymity.   - ``Hit-and-run'' anonymity should be used with utmost reservation.     Use services that provide anonymous return addresses instead.   - Be courteous to the system operator, who may have invested large     amounts of time, be personally risking his account, or dedicating     his hardware, all for your convenience.    Operators   ---------    - Document thoroughly acceptable and unacceptable uses in an     introductory file that is sent to new users.  Have a coherent and     consistent policy and stick to it. State clearly what logging and     monitoring is occurring. Describe your background, interest, and     security measures. Will the general approach be totalitarian or     lassaiz-faire?   - Formulate a plan for problematic ethical situations and anticipate     potentially intense moral quandaries and dilemmas. What if a user     is blackmailing someone through your service? What if a user     posts suicidal messages through your service? Remember, your     users trust you to protect them.   - In the site introductory note, give clear examples  of situations     where you will take action and what these actions will be (e.g.     warn the user, limit anonymity to email or posting only, revoke     the account, 'out' the user, contact local administrator, etc.)   - Describe exactly the limitations of the software and hardware.     Address the bandwidth limitations of your site. Report candidly     and thoroughly all bugs that have  occurred.  Work closely with     users to isolate and fix bugs. Address all bugs noted below under     ``(in)stability of anonymity''.   - Document the stability of the site---how long has it been running?     What compromises have occured? Why are you running it? What is     your commitment to it?   - Include a disclaimer in outgoing mail and messages.  Include an     address for complaints, ideally appended to every outgoing item.      Consult a lawyer about your liability.   - Be committed to the long-term stability of the site. Be prepared     to deal with complaints and `hate mail' addressed to you.  If you     do not own the hardware the system runs on or are not the system     adminstrator, consult those who do and are.   - Be considerate of providing anonymity to various groups.  If     possible, query group readers.   - Keep a uniformity and simplicity of style in outgoing message     format that can be screened effectively by kill files.  Ensure     the key text `Anon' is  somewhere in every header.   - Take precautions to ensure the security of the server from     physical and  network-based attacks and infiltrations.    Readers   -------      - Do not complain, attack, or discredit a poster for the sole reason     that he is posting anonymously, make blanket condemnations that     equate anonymity with cowardice and criminality, or assail     anonymous traffic in general for mostly neutral reasons (e.g. its     volume is heavy or increasing).   - React to the anonymous information unemotionally.  Abusive posters     will be encouraged further if they get irrationally irate     responses.  Sometimes the most effective response is silence.   - Notify operators if very severe abuses occur, such as piracy,     harassment, extortion, etc.   - Do not complain about postings being inappropriate because they     offend you personally.   - Use kill files to screen anonymous postings if you object to the     idea of anonymity itself.   - Avoid the temptation to proclaim that all anonymous postings     should be barred from particular groups because no `possible' or     `conceivable' need exists.

It accepts the need of a system   > operator to know the name of a user; but suggests that the use of   > a handle is analogous to a request to withhold the name in a   > letter to the editor. The article concludes with a set of   > guidelines for preserving the right to be anonymous.  _____ <8.3> How do I `kill' anonymous postings?    James Thomas Green <jgreen@zeus.calpoly.edu>:    > Try putting this in your kill file:   >      >   /Anon/h:j   >   /Anonymous/h:j   >    > This will search the headers of the messages and kill any that   > contain `Anon' or `Anonymous' in them.  Not perfect and won't   > kill followups.       Note that anonymous server operators have the capability to mask   anonymous postings under which the above method will not work; so   far this practice is not widespread, but it may become more common   as a countermeasure to widespread anonymous filtering.    _____ <8.4> What is the history behind anonymous posting servers?    Originally anonymous posting services were introduced for   individual, particularly volatile newsgroups, where anonymity is   almost the preferred method of communication, such as talk.abortion   and alt.sex.bondage.  One of the first was one by Dave Mack   started in ~1988 for alt.sex.bondage. Another early one was   wizvax.methuen.ma.us run by Stephanie Gilgut (Gilgut Enterprises)   but was disbanded due to  lack of funds.  The system provided   anonymous return addresses. n7kbt.rain.com (John Opalko) took up   the functions of this server, including reinstating the anonymous   alias file. The group ``alt.personals has been chewing through   servers like there's no tomorrow.''      Spurred by the disappearance of `wizvax' and interested in   researching the idea, Karl Kleinpaste   <Karl_Kleinpaste@godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu> developed his own system   from scratch in six hours. By this time the idea of extending the   server to new, more `mainstream'  groups was starting to emerge,   and he explored the possibility partly at the specific request  by   multiple users for anonymity in other groups. ``The intended   advantage of my system was specifically to allow multiple group   support, with a single anon identifier across all.  This was   arguably the single biggest deficiency of previous anon systems.''    K. Kleinpaste posted a message on rec.nude asking users whether an   anonymous service would be welcome there, and judged a consensus   against it.     K. Kleinpaste introduced what he calls a ``fire extinguisher'' to   `squelch' or `plonk' abusive users in response to complaints, and   used this in three cases. Nevertheless, after a few months of   intense traffic he was eventually overwhelmed by the abuses of his   server. ``Even as restricted as it was, my system was subjected to   abuses to the point where it was ordered dismantled by the   facilities staff here. Such abuses started right after it was   created.''    In ~Nov 1992, Johan Helsingius (julf@penet.FI) set up the most   controversial anonymous site to date. anon.penet.fi is based on   scripts and C code written by K. Kleinpaste and supports anonymized   mail, posting, and return addresses. He initially wanted to confine   the service to Scandinavian users but expanded it to worldwide   accessability in response to 'lots' of international requests.      J. Helsingius policy of allowing anonymous posting to every Usenet   newsgroup has been met with strong and serious ideological   opposition (e.g. by news adminstrators in news.admin.policy).   Because of the relative newness and recent emergence of the medium,   abuses by anonymous posters  tend to have higher visibility than   ``routine'' abuses. His total commitment to preservation of   anonymity is also controversial.    For example, in a highly controversial and publicized case in ~Feb   1993,  an anonymous user posted a supposed transcript of desperate   crew dialogue during the Challenger shuttle disaster via   anon.penet.fi to sci.astro. Despite that the transcript had been   posted in the same place up to a year earlier (then   non-anonymously) and actually originated not with the poster but a   New York news tabloid, subsequent responses consisted largely of   vociferous outrage at the poster's use of anonymity, reverberating   through many newsgroups.       The original poster, using the same anonymous handle, later conceded   that the story ``seemed likely to have been fabricated,''   suggesting the plausible possibility that the original intent was   not to provoke outrage but gauge reactions on the authenticity of   the story (albeit crudely), free of personal risk from perceived   association with the item.  The ensuing commotion generated queries   for the original article by late-entering readers. The anonymous   user later posted deliberately offensive comments at his   detractors.    Despite piercingly irate and outraged complaints, and even the vocal   opposition and verbal abuse of K. Kleinpaste and eminent news   operators, J. Helsingius has largely avoided use of the ``fire   extingisher'' and the ``group bouncer'' mechanisms that limit the   scope of the service. As of ~March 1993 the anon.penet.fi site is   best described as `inundated': it has registered over 13,000 users   in its initial three months of operation, forwards ~3000 messages a   day, and approximately 5% of all Usenet postings are anonymized   through the site. The immense popularity is probably largely due   to the capability for `global' anonymity which has allowed users to   find creative uses in diverse areas not previously envisioned.    Johan Helsingius has been subject to extraordinary pressure to   dismantle his server in ~Feb 1993. At one point K. Kleinpaste   threatened publicly to organize a sort of vigilante group of irate   news operators to  send out revocation commands on all messages   originating from the site.  J. Helsingius has also alluded to   threats of flooding the  server.  The server has crashed several   times, at least once due to a saturation `mailbombing' through it   by an anonymous user.  Mr. Helsingius reports spending up to 5   hours per day  answering email requests alone associated with the   service's administration. In response to the serious threats he   disabled global group access temporarily for one week and   encouraged his users to defend the service publicly.      Based on fast-moving dialogue and creative suggestions by   ``cypherpunks,'' J. Helsingius has identified many security   weaknesses and valuable new features for the service, and is   currently in the process of code development and testing. He is   planning on upgrading the IBM compatible 386 machine to a 486 soon   to handle the voluminous load and is  considering integrating a new   system with very sophisticated functionality, including multiple   email aliases, alias allocation control, public-key encryption,   etc.    A very sophisticated anonymous posting system was set up in Dec.   1992 by D. Clunie <dclunie@pax.tpa.com.au> that used cryptography   in both directions (to/from) the server for the highest degree of   confidentiality seen so far.  However, it was running on a public   access account, and he had to shut it down after only several   weeks, upon receiving requests and conditions apparently ultimately   originating from NSF representatives. D. Clunie has released the   software to the public domain.    Recently the idea of a newsgroup devoted to `whistleblowing' on   government abuses has received wide and focused attention, and   group formation is currently underway.  In the basic scenario the   group would allow people to post pseudonymously using remailers,   and even establish reputations based on their authentifiable   digital signatures. The traffic may eventually reach reporters in   the mainstream news media.  deltorto@aol.com has volunteered to   attack multiple aspects of this project, including distributing   easy-to-read documentation on posting, anonymization, and   encryption.

Each option would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal year 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development, operations, utilization, Shuttle integration, facilities, research operations support, transition cost and also must include adequate program reserves to insure program implementation within the available funds.          Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within the NASA budget for the President's new technology investment.  As a result, station options above $7 billion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions in the rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space station option of $9 billion would require $2 billion in offsets from the NASA budget over the next 5 years.          Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of the advisory committee.  Generally, the members-designate focused upon administrative topics and used the session to get acquainted.  They also received a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the Station Redesign Team is following to develop options for the advisory committee to consider.          Gibbons also announced that the United States and its international partners -- the Europeans, Japanese and Canadians -- have decided, after consultation, to give \\\"full consideration\\\" to use of Russian assets in the course of the space station redesign process.          To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate in the redesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis, so that the redesign team can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR and the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems. The U.S. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of the Russian participants in assessing Russian systems and technology.  The overall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing station costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilitiaes. Careful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achieving that goal.          Gibbons reiterated that, \\\"President Clinton is committed to the redesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the science, the technology and the jobs that the space station program represents.  However, he also is committed to a space station that is well managed and one that does not consume the national resources which should be used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation.\\\"          NASA Administrator Daniel S.  Goldin said the Russian participation will be accomplished through the East-West Space Science Center at the University of Maryland under the leadership of Roald Sagdeev.\",\"Thanks for the Update.\",\"Does anybody know anything about the chips D6275A/D6235A/D6205A chips from DSP Telecommunications Inc?

But in regard to AeroStich it really depends on your particular size, shape and needs. If you upper and lower body are not proportional (according to aero dimensions) then it probably is going to be better mixing and matching the 2 piece suit. I have the 2 piece suit and I am very happy with it. Having my life quota of scars from crashing off road, I am very concerned with good protection and I believe that the difference in protection between the 1 and 2 piece suits is almost negligible. I think the optional hip pads and back protector make much more of a difference. One thing that is nice about the 2 piece is if you go somewhere and then want to walk around for a while (still with jacket) you can just detach and stow the pants.   One thing to note is that Goldfine has problems getting a good fit for many women (with standard suits). Supposedly for smaller women (and petite men for that matter) the 1 piece will fit better.

BACKGROUND  ----------   The racing listserver (boogie.EBay.sun.com) contains discussions   devoted to racing and racing-related topics. This is a pretty broad   interest group. Individuals have a variety of backgrounds: motojournalism,   roadracing from the perspective of pit crew and racers, engineering,  motosports enthusiasts.   The size of the list grows weekly. We are currently at a little  over one hundred and eighty-five members, with contributors from  New Zealand, Australia, Germany, France, England, Canada  Finland, Switzerland, and the United States.   The list was formed (October 1991) in response to a perceived need   to both provide technical discussion of riding at the edge of   performance (roadracing) and to improve on the very low signal-to-noise   ratio found in rec.motorcycles. Anyone is free to join.   Discussion is necessarily limited by the rules of the list to   issues related to racing motorcycles and is to be \\\"flame-free\\\".     HOW TO GET THE DAILY DISTRIBUTION  ---------------------------------   You are welcome to subscribe. To subscribe send your request to:           race-request@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM    Traffic currently runs between five and twenty-five messages per day  (depending on the topic).

If anyone serves Me, him My Father will honor.\\\"  Why would I want an eternal life if I hate this one?  If we were created by a deity, why would that deity not wish us to enjoy what he has given us?  Why would I want to live forever?  The challenge in my life is that I will die, and that I must give my life the meaning I wish it to have before that happens.  My time is here and will someday pass; I will be content to live on in the memories of my friends, and once they too are dead, then I will no longer have any reason to exist.  In short: even if your deity *does* exist, that doesn't automatically mean that I would worship it.  I am content to live my own life, and fend for myself, so when I die, I can be proud of the fact that no matter where I end up, it will be because of *my* actions and *my* choices.  If your god decides to toss me into a flaming pit for this, then so be it.  I would much rather just cease to exist.  But if your god wants my respect and my obedience, then it had better earn these; and if it does, then they will be very strong and true.   Jesus wasn't the only one who rose from the dead -- I think it was Osiris who did the same, as well as a few characters from Greek or Norse legend, if memory serves.  But still: WHY would I want to rise from the dead?  Why do *you* want to?   If your god wants to win my devotion, then it knows what it can do -- provide some way for me to believe without having to resort to blind faith that could be applied equally well to any religion.   That's precisely it.  I neither see nor know Zeus either, nor Odin. Shall I offer them the same devotion I offer Jesus?   You've got to understand my point-of-view: I see Christians spouting Bible verse all the time as if it were some sort of magic spell that will level all opposition.  Truth is, it's not.  Robert has never demonstrated that he actually understands what the verses imply; he just rattles them off day by day.  Some brazenly fly in the face of common sense and reality, and I point these out where I can.  But even more than that, even when Christians *do* try to explain the verses in their own words, they do so from a Christian point of view, which is that every human being would want to be a Christian if only he or she understood the Christian message properly, and then all strife and suffering on the earth would end.  Here's the problem with that: substitute \\\"Moslem\\\" or \\\"Buddhist\\\" or \\\"Satanist\\\" instead of \\\"Christian\\\", and it means the same thing.  Christanity is a very nice belief set around a very nice book.  But if you want to make me believe that it has any bearing on the REAL WORLD, you've got some convincing to do.   And in my opinion, you're bumbling about blindly making up entities where there aren't any, and depriving yourself of a true understanding and enjoyment of your life.  As long as you keep your beliefs to yourself, I'll keep my beliefs to myself -- but as soon as you start waving them around, expect me to toss in my opinions, too.\",\"(Frank DeCenso)   How incredibly fucking stupid.

Take your foot out of your mouth, I wondered about that already when I was a Catholic Christian. The fact that the contradiction is unresolvable is one of the reasons why I am an atheist.   Believe me, I believed similar sentences for a long time. But that shows the power of religion and not anything about its claims.       It follows from a definition of evil as ordinarily used. Letting evil happen or allowing evil to take place, in this place even causing evil, is another evil.       The omniscient attribute of god will know what the creatures will do even before the omnipotent has created them. There is no choice left. All is known, the course of events is fixed.   Not even for the omniscient itself, to extend an argument by James Tims.       And when I am not omnipotent, how can I have free will? You have said something about choices and the scenario gives them. Therefore we have what you define as free will.   Imagine the following. I can do good to other beings, but I cannot harm them. Easily implemented by making everyone appreciate being the object of good deeds, but don't make them long for them, so they can not feel the absence of good as evil.   But whose case am I arguing? It is conceivable, so the omnipotent can do it. Or it would not be omnipotent. If you want logically consistent as well, you have to give up the pet idea of an omnipotent first.   (Deletion)   That the bible describes an omniscient and omnipotent god destroys the credibility of the bible, nothing less.\",\"THE EMPTY TOMB:  CAN WE TRUST IT?                     by the late Wilbur M. Smith, D.D.                               (1894-1977)            When Jesus was on Earth, He made an amazing prediction about      Himself, and frequently repeated it.  Let me quote it for you:                   Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son                of Man shall be betrayed unto the chief                priests and unto the scribes, and they shall                condemn Him to death, and shall deliver Him                to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and                to crucify Him; and the third day He shall                rise again\\\" (Matthew 20:18-19).            Wholly different from the normal experience of men, Jesus,      who had *never* done anything worthy of death, even deserving      reproval, knew He would die before He was 40 years of age.  He      knew the very city where He would die.  He knew that the religious      leaders of His own race would condemn Him to death.  He knew that      one of His own would betray Him.  He knew that before His actual      death took place He would be mocked and scourged.  He knew exactly      how He would die--*by crucifixion.*            All this is in itself remarkable.  But more amazing than the      minute particulars of His foreknowledge was what He predicted      would follow shortly after He was buried--*that He would rise      again.*  He even designated the time--on the third day.            But since it is on this central fact--the death and resurrec-      tion of Jesus Christ--that the whole truth or untruth of Chris-      tianity turns, let us examine it more closely.            The body of Jesus was embalmed in long sheets of cloth      between the layers of which a great abundance of spices and      ointments was distributed.  The body was placed in a tomb which      had never before been used, and a great stone was rolled against      the entrance.  The Jewish authorities, fully aware that Jesus had      predicted He would rise again, had the stone officially sealed and      on Saturday placed a guard before the tomb to prevent the      disciples from carrying away the body.  Early Sunday morning some      of the women who were faithful followers of Christ went out to the      tomb to further anoint the body.  To their utter astonishment,      they found the stone rolled away, the body gone.  They rushed back      to tell the disciples.  Shortly two of Jesus' friends, Peter and      John, utterly skeptical about the whole affair, came and found the      tomb empty, just as the women had said.  Even the guards came      hurrying into the city to tell the Sanhedrin that had hired them      to guard the tomb that the body was gone (Matthew 28:11).            How did this tomb become empty?            One of the most famous New Testament scholars in America--      professor of New Testament literature in a large theological      seminary--wrote to the author in answer to my question of *how*      the tomb became empty, and wrote it in a letter *not* marked by      bitterness or sarcasm, that he could no more explain how the tomb      became empty than he could explain how Santa Claus comes down the      chimney at Christmas time.            But he didn't realize that Santa Clause never did come down      any chimney at Christmas time, *because there never was a Santa      Claus!*  ...And there *is* a Jesus.  He died; He was buried in the      tomb of Joseph of Arimathea, and on Sunday the body was gone.            Those are facts of history.  No one can escape the responsi-      bility of coming to some conclusion about what really happened by      mentioning a myth we all abandoned before we were eight years old.            Another professor, Dr. Kirsopp Lake of Harvard University,      tried to explain the empty tomb by saying (what no other scholar      in the field of New Testament criticism has ventured to adopt)      that the women went to the wrong tomb.            The facts are these:            First, so far as we know, there was no other tomb nearby to      which by mistake they could have gone.            Second, it is contrary to all similar experience for three or      more people to forget the place where they have buried their      dearest loved one within less than three days.  Even if the women      did miss the tomb, when Peter and John came, did they too go to      the wrong tomb?            Third, were the soldiers *guarding* the wrong tomb?            There is, of course, a record of an attempt to escape the      evidence of the empty tomb in the New Testament itself.                    Now when they were going, behold, some                of the watch came into the city and showed                unto the chief priests all the things that                were done.  And when they were assembled                with the leaders and had taken counsel, they                gave large money unto the soldiers, Saying,                Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole                Him away while we slept.  And if this come to                the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and                secure you.  So they took the money, and did                as they were taught:  and this saying is com-                monly reported among the Jews until this day                (Matthew 28:11-15).            This is a good illustration of many later attempts to escape the      fact that the tomb was empty.            You will notice at once that the chief priests and the elders never      questioned but that the tomb *was* empty.  They never even went out to      see if what the guards had reported was true--they *knew* it was true.            Another fact about this story makes it ridiculous to maintain that      the tomb was empty--the soldiers were told to say that Jesus' disciples      came and stole the body away *while they* (the soldiers) *were asleep!*            How could they know what was going on while they were asleep?      Obviously, such testimony would be valueless in any court.            Even aside from the shallowness and sordidness that make us reject      the explanation, the very character and the later history of the      disciples compel us to believe they did not steal and secretly carry away      the body of Jesus.            First, as Professor Heffern points out, the leaders of Judaism in      Jerusalem, who had put the Lord Jesus to death, had nothing to offer to      contradict these disciples as they continued to preach Jesus and His      resurrection--because all Jerusalem knew the tomb was empty.  If there      had been trickery here, sooner or later it would have been suspected,      then proved.            Second, surely *one* of the disciples, even *most* of them, would      have confessed the fraud under the terrific persecution they underwent.      It may be possible to live a lie, but men seldom die for a lie--and most      of these men did.            The result ultimately would have been that the message that Christ      had risen would have suffered the fate of all such unfounded stories--it      would have lost it *power.*  Instead, this truth swept the world, closed      pagan temples, won millions of disciples, brought hope to a despairing      humanity, was the very foundation truth of the early church, and is today      as believable and as freshly glorious as ever.            But not only did Jesus come alive again, He did not disappear to      leave the disciples speculating through all the subsequent days as to      what had happened to Him.            Instead, He appeared to them--literally, visibly, frequently.            He appeared to the women at the tomb on Resurrection morning      (Matthew 28:1-10); later that day to Mary Magdalene alone (John 20:11-      18); and to Simon Peter, also alone (Luke 24:34).  In the afternoon He      walked with two of His followers toward Emmaus (Luke 24:13-35); and that      night He appeared to ten of the apostles gathered together in an upper      room at Jerusalem (Mark 16:14-16; Luke 24:36-40; etc.).            A week later He appeared to all eleven of the apostles, probably at      the same place (John 20:26-28).  Once He was seen by above 500 brethren      on a mountain in Galilee (I Corinthians 15:6); and finally to the      apostles just before His ascension (Mark 16:19; Luke 24:50-52; Acts 1:3-      8).            As with the fact of the empty tomb, so in regard to these histor-      ically recorded appearances, all kinds of theories have been proposed      attempting to deny their literalness.  But these theories are      unreasonable, without supporting evidence.  None has ever won the      unanimous approval of those who refuse to believe in the reality of the      appearances.            Moreover, while it is true we are living in an age when may of our      leading scientists and agnostics and many of our philosophers are      antisuperanaturalistic, let us not forget that some of the greatest      thinkers of the ages have firmly believed in this great miracle.      Increase Mather, president of Harvard; Timothy Dwight, president of Yale;      Nathan Lord, president of Dartmouth; Edward Hitchcock, president of      Amherst; Mark Hopkins, president of Williams; John Witherspoon, president      of Princeton--these men and countless others have believed it.            But suppose Christ *did* rise from the dead, what of it?  What has      it to do with *my* life?  What has it to do with *your* life?  Just this:      it seals with certitude the teachings of Christ.            Jesus taught many great truths--especially many about Himself.  He      claimed to have come down *from* God.            He said He was the way *to* God.            He said He was the Son of God, who alone knew God perfectly.            He said that whoever believed on Him had eternal life, and no one      else had it.            He said that whatever we ask God in His name, He would grant it to      us.            Thus when He did rise from the grave on the third day, He revealed      that in these amazing, unparalleled predictions, *He spoke the truth!*            Do you know any reason, *any good reason,* why we should not believe      that His words are all true?            The point is, does not the truth of the Resurrection convince us      that He is none other than the One He claimed to be--the Son of God?            And then, of course, the fact that Christ rose from the dead      testifies that He has broken the power of death, and that He will some      day raise us also up from the grave, as He promised.            In other words, if this Person, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, in all      this, He should be the cornerstone of the foundation of your life.  For      He said a life built on Him would know forgiveness of sins, His compan-      ionship and help, a joy that no circumstances can ever take away, and a      hope that shineth more and more unto a perfect day.\",\"  I think you need the EMM386.EXE noems This will let the expanded mem be active but not use any, therefore this will give you more extended mem for windows yet have all the bases covered.

Actually, I just finished writing a motif animation program... (take-lots-of-image-data-and-display-it-pretty-darn-fast). When using on-server pixmaps or shared memory, I had to insert a delay loop to keep it from going too quickly :). Testing both methods side by side, they were just about equal.    The advantage of SHM is that your X server doesn't grow to ridiculous sizes; but pixmaps can work over a network and *are* removed if your application dies (one tends to use ipcrm manually quite a bit when debugging SHM apps).    Shared memory also has the problem that some operating systems (e.g. Ultrix) seem to allow only a small number of segments (~6) to be attached to a process at once; consequently, a redraw becomes XShmAttach();XShmPutImage();XShmDetach(); on Dec systems. And Dec's 24 bit displays (like the ones I tend to use most often) don't seem to support the extension (maybe someone compiled them wrong?), and using pixmaps causes the X server to crash (failed mallocs), so one *has* to use the local unix domain socket (which really isn't that bad; one copies the info three times per redraw instead of one).    In short: allowing all three forms of display, within the program is a Good Thing (minus SHM if running over a network), and let the user pick whatever feels fastest.

WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SATURN V PLANS      Despite a widespread belief to the contrary, the Saturn V blueprints     have not been lost. They are kept at Marshall Space Flight Center on     microfilm.      The problem in re-creating the Saturn V is not finding the drawings, it     is finding vendors who can supply mid-1960's vintage hardware (like     guidance system components), and the fact that the launch pads and VAB     have been converted to Space Shuttle use, so you have no place to launch     from.      By the time you redesign to accommodate available hardware and re-modify     the launch pads, you may as well have started from scratch with a clean     sheet design.       WHY DATA FROM SPACE MISSIONS ISN'T IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE      Investigators associated with NASA missions are allowed exclusive access     for one year after the data is obtained in order to give them an     opportunity to analyze the data and publish results without being     \\\"scooped\\\" by people uninvolved in the mission. However, NASA frequently     releases examples (in non-digital form, e.g. photos) to the public early     in a mission.       RISKS OF NUCLEAR (RTG) POWER SOURCES FOR SPACE PROBES      There has been extensive discussion on this topic sparked by attempts to     block the Galileo and Ulysses launches on grounds of the plutonium     thermal sources being dangerous. Numerous studies claim that even in     worst-case scenarios (shuttle explosion during launch, or accidental     reentry at interplanetary velocities), the risks are extremely small.     Two interesting data points are (1) The May 1968 loss of two SNAP 19B2     RTGs, which landed intact in the Pacific Ocean after a Nimbus B weather     satellite failed to reach orbit. The fuel was recovered after 5 months     with no release of plutonium. (2) In April 1970, the Apollo 13 lunar     module reentered the atmosphere and its SNAP 27 RTG heat source, which     was jettisoned, fell intact into the 20,000 feet deep Tonga Trench in     the Pacific Ocean. The corrosion resistant materials of the RTG are     expected to prevent release of the fuel for a period of time equal to 10     half-lives of the Pu-238 fuel or about 870 years [DOE 1980].

IMPACT OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE ON THE OZONE LAYER      From time to time, claims are made that chemicals released from     the Space Shuttle's Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) are responsible     for a significant amount of damage to the ozone layer. Studies     indicate that they in reality have only a minute impact, both in     absolute terms and relative to other chemical sources. The     remainder of this item is a response from the author of the quoted     study, Charles Jackman.      The atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effects on the     stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups, and was     organized by Dr. Michael Prather, NASA/Goddard Institute for Space     Studies.  The three groups involved Michael Prather and Maria Garcia     (NASA/GISS), Charlie Jackman and Anne Douglass (NASA/Goddard Space     Flight Center), and Malcolm Ko and Dak Sze (Atmospheric and     Environmental Research, Inc.).  The effort was to look at the effects     of the space shuttle and Titan rockets on the stratosphere.      The following are the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine:         Industrial sources:    300,000,000 kilograms/year    Natural sources:     75,000,000 kilograms/year    Shuttle sources:   725,000 kilograms/year      The shuttle source assumes 9 space shuttles and 6 Titan rockets are     launched yearly. Thus the launches would add less than 0.25% to the     total stratospheric chlorine sources.      The effect on ozone is minimal:  global yearly average total ozone would     be decreased by 0.0065%. This is much less than total ozone variability     associated with volcanic activity and solar flares.      The influence of human-made chlorine products on ozone is computed     by atmospheric model calculations to be a 1% decrease in globally     averaged ozone between 1980 and 1990. The influence of the space shuttle and     Titan rockets on the stratosphere is negligible.  The launch     schedule of the Space Shuttle and Titan rockets would need to be     increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about     the same effect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons     do at the present time.

HOW LONG CAN A HUMAN LIVE UNPROTECTED IN SPACE      If you *don't* try to hold your breath, exposure to space for half a     minute or so is unlikely to produce permanent injury. Holding your     breath is likely to damage your lungs, something scuba divers have to     watch out for when ascending, and you'll have eardrum trouble if your     Eustachian tubes are badly plugged up, but theory predicts -- and animal     experiments confirm -- that otherwise, exposure to vacuum causes no     immediate injury. You do not explode. Your blood does not boil. You do     not freeze. You do not instantly lose consciousness.      Various minor problems (sunburn, possibly \\\"the bends\\\", certainly some     [mild, reversible, painless] swelling of skin and underlying tissue)     start after ten seconds or so. At some point you lose consciousness from     lack of oxygen. Injuries accumulate. After perhaps one or two minutes,     you're dying. The limits are not really known.

Dunn, eds, Report SAM-TR-65-48 (June 1965), USAF School     of Aerospace Medicine, Brooks AFB, Texas.       HOW THE CHALLENGER ASTRONAUTS DIED      The Challenger shuttle launch was not destroyed in an explosion. This is     a well-documented fact; see the Rogers Commission report, for example.     What looked like an explosion was fuel burning after the external tank     came apart. The forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the     astronauts, never mind destroy their bodies, according to the Kerwin     team's medical/forensic report.      The astronauts were killed when the more-or-less intact cabin hit the     water at circa 200MPH, and their bodies then spent several weeks     underwater. Their remains were recovered, and after the Kerwin team     examined them, they were sent off to be buried.       USING THE SHUTTLE BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT      You can't use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low Earth orbit     because it can't get there. It is big and heavy and does not carry     enough fuel, even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tanks.      Furthermore, it is not particularly sensible to do so, because much of     that weight is things like wings, which are totally useless except in     the immediate vicinity of the Earth. The shuttle orbiter is highly     specialized for travel between Earth's surface and low orbit. Taking it     higher is enormously costly and wasteful. A much better approach would     be to use shuttle subsystems to build a specialized high-orbit     spacecraft.      [Yet another concise answer by Henry Spencer.]       THE \\\"FACE ON MARS\\\"      There really is a big rock on Mars that looks remarkably like a humanoid     face. It appears in two different frames of Viking Orbiter imagery:     35A72 (much more facelike in appearance, and the one more often     published, with the Sun 10 degrees above western horizon) and 70A13     (with the Sun 27 degrees from the west).      Science writer Richard Hoagland has championed the idea that the Face is     artificial, intended to resemble a human, and erected by an     extraterrestrial civilization. Most other analysts concede that the     resemblance is most likely accidental. Other Viking images show a     smiley-faced crater and a lava flow resembling Kermit the Frog elsewhere     on Mars. There exists a Mars Anomalies Research Society (sorry, don't     know the address) to study the Face.      The Mars Observer mission will carry an extremely high-resolution     camera, and better images of the formation will hopefully settle this     question in a few years. In the meantime, speculation about the Face is     best carried on in the altnet group alt.alien.visitors, not sci.space or     sci.astro.      V. DiPeitro and G.

Jesse  Agreed.\",\" <stuff deleted>   Good gravy! Decibels are all *ratios.* The question that remains in any ratio is the reference unit used. Sometimes, this will be a reference power, such as 1 milliwatt (given a certain circuit impedance which should also be included in the fine print or known, like 50 ohms in an RF circuit of that impedance), leading to an accepted notation of dBm. Maybe it might be dBV, disregarding the impedance of the circuit and power developed, using 1 volt as reference *amplitude* (rather than reference power). Or, it might have an arbitrary or omitted reference that is not included in the notation, leading to just plain dB. So. look at it this way--'dB' has an implied reference while notation such as 'dBm' has an explicit reference.  For power:    dB = 10*log( P(measured)/P(reference) )  For amplitude    dB = 20*log( A(measured)/A(reference) )  'B' is for bel, which is a standard term for a log ratio to the base 10, named after Alexander Graham Bell. A 'deci' Bel is 1/10 of a bel. It has nothing to do with the Bell Telephone company except for the common founder's name. The small 'd'/large 'B' is per SI notation convention. I don't know anyone that's been crucified for messing it up.  Common references for audio are:   0 dBm = 1 milliwatt across 600 ohms  0 dBV = 1 volt   0 VU (a zero on the VU meter) = +4 dBm  (pro gear line level)  0 VU = -10dBV (consumer gear line level)   Often times, a power amp VU meter will be aligned using the rated power of the amp as the 0 dB point. It is all done to whatever reference is reasonable for the application or moment.  Note that in a circuit with a given (and maybe unknown) linear impedance, if the amplitude goes up so many decibels, the power will also increase the same amount. This proof can be done with the above two identities and ohm's law.  --  --------------------------------------------------------------------        Dave Medin   Phone: (205) 730-3169 (w)     SSD--Networking    (205) 837-1174 (h)     Intergraph Corp.

I am in the process of purchasing an EISA/VL Bus 486 DX2-66 computer and I found two places that sell machines that have what I want and have the same price. The first is Ares and they use a Cache motherboard (that's the brand of the motherboard) with OPTI chip set, the other is Micron (formerly Edge Technology) and they use the Micronics EISA/VLB motherboard.  I said that this might be a silly question since I believe that Micronics is a very well known motherboard manufacturer while I never heard of Cache! I am however leaning towards the Ares machine because my impression is that they are known for building good, solid machines and they have good tech support (24 hr, 7 days/wk), and a better warrantee (2 years).  Micron, on the other hand, seems to have recently aquired Edge Technologies and I'm not sure how much I should trust the company.  I would REALLY appreciate any input on this. Is the Micron machine the clear choice?  Does anyone know anything positive or negative about either company? Has anyone ever heard of Cache motherboards? Should I go with Micron just because it has the Micronics motherboard? etc.  Thanks very much in advance for any information. \",\"  Is this a figment of your imagination? Here is another one:    Source: \\\"Mitteilungsblatt, Berlin, December 1939, Nr. 2 and 5-6\\\"   Yet another historical fact: a fact that for years has been deliberately   forgotten, concealed, and wiped from memory - the fact of Armenian-Nazi   collaboration.   A magazine called Mitteilungsblatt der Deutsch-Armenischen Gesselschaft  is the clearest and most definite proof of this collaboration. The   magazine was first published in Berlin in 1938 during Nazi rule of Germany  and continued publication until the end of 1944. Even the name of the  magazine, which implies a declaration of Armenian-Nazi cooperation,  is attention-getting.   This magazine, every issue of which proves the collaboration, is historically  important as documentary evidence. It is a heap of writing that should be  an admonition to world opinion and to all mankind.    In Nazi Germany, Armenians were considered to be an Aryan race and certain  political, economic, and social rights were thus granted to them. They   occupied positions in public service and were partners in Nazi practices.  The whole world of course knows what awaited those who were not considered   \\\"Aryan\\\" and what befell them.

I'd estimate that 5% of the people at my high school couldn't do it.  (I was one of the few who failed shop.)  People who have actually seen me do mechanical work would probably say that 1% is more like it.  Starting with even 90% of the population, you can be sure that \\\"enough\\\" people will be motivated.   How much is \\\"through the nose\\\"?  After all, we know quite a bit about how much a gun is worth to a criminal, so if that is dwarfed by the price demanded by the \\\"bad\\\" part of that 90%....  The relevant economic analysis has been made.  The \\\"profit\\\" of gun crime is high enough that the price required to push criminals out of the market is high enough that everyone will be motivated. That analysis ignored some \\\"improvements\\\" in the criminal gun market that could make them even cheaper.

Perhaps in the judgement of the majority of Chicago's finest, a close-to- 100% reliable weapon like a revolver is preferable to a 99.99% reliable automatic. I note that in Germany, where certainly the 9mm semi-auto handgun is king, some of the more elite police types want revolvers.

And key size is one of the things that can be verified externally.  Feed lots of random key/input pairs into the chip, then try flipping random key bits, and see what happens to the output.  We already know what *should* happen -- about half the output bits should vary, on average, from a 1-bit key change or input change.  If they were out to build a weak cryptosystem, it might be the case that some of the bits are much less powerful than others, in the sense that they only enter into the encryption very late in the game.  By contrast, DES was designed to use each key bit as early as possible; the 50% output change rate appears as early as round 5.  Again, though, I don't think NSA is going to cheat that crudely; they're likely to get caught.  Remember that they've promised to let a committee of outside experts see the cryptosystem design.  If you assume something DES-like, a biased subkey generation schedule will stick out like a sore thumb.  The committee can and should run lots of tests, and retain the output.  This can be verified later against the chip.  And yes, the civilian community has at least some secure storage facilities that I don't think even NSA can get into without it being noticed, until Fort Meade gets its transporter working again. (Oops -- I don't think I was supposed to talk about that...)  The committee members can even retain secure copies of the code -- in two halves, which you have to XOR together to recover the program...  Seriously, there are, I think, problems with this whole scheme.  But the people who invented it aren't stupid, and they've been in the crypto game and the smoke-and-mirrors game far longer than most of us.  They're not going to lie in ways that can be detected easily, since their credibility is the *only* thing they can use to sell this system.  If they've lied about the civilian committee, no one will believe them about the absence of other back doors.  If they've lied about the key size, no one will believe that they haven't copied the programming disk with the U keys. If they've lied about obvious aspects of the strength of the cryptosystem, no one will believe the escrow agencies aren't in cahoots with them.  That isn't to say that they aren't lying about all those other things anyway.  And I'm certainly not claiming that NSA can't build a cryptosystem with a back door that the committee can't find -- look how long it took for folks to believe that the S-boxes weren't sabotaged.  It's entirely possible that the committee will release an ambiguous report, for just such reasons.  But that's a subtle point (i.e., one you can't explain to a Senator...).   I don't like the unit key generation process any better than you do. However -- S1 and S2 are supposed to be under control of the same escrow agents.  If they can't be trusted to keep the seed values secure, they can't be trusted to keep the half-keys secure.  I still don't know if or when S1 and S2 change.  I thought I had seen something about them being constant, but I just reread Denning's technical information post, and it doesn't say anything, one way or the other. \",\"In Texas (Well, Corpus Christi anyway) if you pick up the phone and dial 890 the phone company will read back the number to you.

Randy Weaver/Kevin Harris trial update: Day 4.  Friday, April 16, 1993 was the fourth day of the trial.  Synopsis: Defense attorney Gerry Spence cross-examined agent Cooper under repeated objections from prosecutor Ronald Howen.  Spence moved for a mistrial but was denied.  The day was marked by a caustic cross-examination of Deputy Marshal Larry Cooper by defense attorney Gerry Spence.  Although Spence has not explicitly stated so, one angle of his stategy must involve destroying the credibility of agent Cooper.  Cooper is the government's only eyewitness to the death of agent Degan. Spence attacked Cooper's credibility by pointing out discrepancies between Cooper's statements last September and those made in court. Cooper conceded that, \\\"You have all these things compressed into a few seconds...It's difficult to remember what went on first.\\\"  Cooper acknowledged that he carried a \\\"9mm Colt Commando submachine gun with a silenced barrel.\\\" [I thought a Colt Commando was a revolver!] Cooper continued by stating that the federal agents had no specific plans to use the weapon when they started to kill Weaver's dog.  When Spence asked how seven cartridges could be fired by Degan's M-16 rifle when Degan was apparently dead, Cooper could not say for sure that Degan did not return fire before going down.  Spence continued by asking with how many agents (and to what extent) had Cooper discussed last August's events, Cooper responded, \\\"If you're implying that we got our story together, you're wrong, counselor.\\\"  Spence continued to advance the defense's version of the events: Namely, that a marshal had started the shooting by killing the Weaver's dog.  Cooper disagreed.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Ronald Howen repeatedly objected to Spence's virulent cross-examination of agent Cooper, arguing that the questions were repetitive and Spence was wasting time.  Howen also complained  that Spence was improperly using a cross-examination to advance the defense's version of the events.  U.S. District Judge Edward Lodge sustained many of the objections; however, both lawyers persisted until Judge Lodge had the jury leave the room and proceded to admonish both attorneys.  \\\"I'm not going to play games with either counsel.  This has been a personality problem from day 1, so start acting like professionals.\\\"  Spence told the judge that, \\\"When all the evidence is in, we'll see that ... his [agent Larry Cooper] testimony is not credible, that he was panicked and cannot remember the sequence of events.\\\"  Spence continued, \\\"We're going to find...that there is a very unlikely similarity - almost as if it had come out of a cookie cutter - between the testimony of Mr. Cooper and the other witnesses.\\\"  Spence then moved for a mistrial on the grounds that Howen's repeated objections would prevent a fair trial, \\\"We can't have a fair trial if the jury believes I'm some sort of charlatan, if the jury believes I'm bending the rules or engaging in some delaying tactic or that I'm violating court orders.\\\"  Judge Lodge called the notion that his repeated sustainings of Howen's objections had somehow prejudiced the jury was \\\"preposterous\\\" and denied the motion for a mistrial.  Lodge did tell Howen to restrict his comments when objecting.  The trial resumed with the prosecution calling FBI Special Agent Greg Rampton.  The prosecution's purpose was simply to introduce five weapons found in the cabin as evidence: However, the defense seized on the opportunity to further address Cooper's credibility.  Defense attorney Ellison Matthews (Harris' other attorney) questioned Rampton about the dog.  Rampton stated that there were no specific plans to kill the Weaver's dog without being detected.  Matthews then had Rampton read  a Septtember 15, 1992 transcript in which Rampton had said that Cooper had said that the purpose of the silenced weapon was to kill the dog without being detected, if the dog chased them. Rampton then acknowledged that he believed that Cooper had said that, but he could not remember when.  He then stated that, \\\"I did not conduct the primary interview with Deputy Cooper, but I have had conversations with him since the interview was conducted.\\\"\",\"I have a 42 yr old male friend, misdiagnosed as having  osteopporosis for two years, who recently found out that his  illness is the rare Gaucher's disease.   Gaucher's disease symptoms include: brittle bones (he lost 9   inches off his hieght); enlarged liver and spleen; internal  bleeding; and fatigue (all the time). The problem (in Type 1) is  attributed to a genetic mutation where there is a lack of the  enzyme glucocerebroside in macrophages so the cells swell up.  This will eventually cause death.  Enyzme replacement therapy has been successfully developed and  approved by the FDA in the last few years so that those patients  administered with this drug (called Ceredase) report a remarkable  improvement in their condition. Ceredase, which is manufactured  by biotech biggy company--Genzyme--costs the patient $380,000  per year.

I stated that I  would not block a would-be passer.  I would not block a would-be passer \\\"for their own good\\\" or for any reason other than I was prevented from  doing so due to the traffic circumstance.  I fail to see how deterring a passer under these circumstance would IN ANY WAY decrease YOUR chances of being involved in an accident, fatal or otherwise.  In fact, I could imagine how blocking a would-be passer would actually INCREASE your  chances of being \\\"offed\\\" or involved in an accident, especially if  this \\\"passer\\\" is riding your bumper.  Intentionally blocking a person riding your bumper is certainly NOT a \\\"wise driving practice\\\", it  only causes the jam to become more congested.

If someone decides then to  pull up on my bumper, I signal my intention to move to the right, and  do so at the first opportunity (& hope they will open the jam).

Unfortunately, from time to time we are obliged to do this immoral thing for reasons of self-preservation, and so we have to bear the moral consequences of that.

Generally, these telegrams were issued by the Turkish Minister of the Interior, Talaat Pasha, for example, we have the following set regarding children:   \\\"To the Government of Aleppo.    November 5, 1915. We are informed that the little ones belonging to   the Armenians from Sivas, Mamuret-ul-Aziz, Diarbekir and Erzeroum   [hundreds of km distance from Aleppo] are adopted by certain Moslem   families and received as servants when they are left alone through   the death of their parents. We inform you that you are to collect   all such children in your province and send them to the places of   deportation, and also to give the necessary orders regarding this to   the people.      Minister of the Interior,        Talaat\\\" [1]   \\\"To the Government of Aleppo.    September 21, 1915. There is no need for an orphanage. It is not the   time to give way to sentiment and feed the orphans, prolonging their   lives. Send them away to the desert and inform us.      Minister of the Interior,       Talaat\\\" [2]   \\\"To the General Committee for settling and deportees.    November 26, 1915. There were more than four hundred children in the   orphanage. They will be added to the caravans and sent to their   places of exile.        Abdullahad Nuri. [3]    \\\"To the Government of Aleppo.    January 15, 1916. We hear that certain orphanages which have been   opened receive also the children of the Armenians. Whether this is   done through the ignorance of our real purpose, or through contempt   of it, the Government will regard the feeding of such children or   any attempt to prolong their lives as an act entirely opposed to it   purpose, since it considers the survival of these children as   detrimental. I recommend that such children shall not be received   into the orphanages, and no attempts are to be made to establish   special orphanages for them.      Minister of the Interior,        Talaat.\\\" [4]   \\\"To the Government of Aleppo.     Collect and keep only those orphans who cannot remember the tortures   to which their parents have been subjected. Send the rest away with   the caravans.      Minister of the Interior,        Talaat\\\" [5]   \\\"From the Ministry of the Interior to the Government of Aleppo.    At a time when there are thousands of Moslem refugees and the widows   of Shekid [fallen soldiers] are in need of food and protection, it is   not expedient to incur extra expenses by feeding the children left by   Armenians, who will serve no purpose except that of giving trouble   in the future. It is necessary that these children should be turned   out of your vilayet and sent with the caravans to the place of   deportation. Those that have been kept till now are also to be sent   away, in compliance with our previous orders, to Sivas.      Minister of the Interior,        Talaat\\\" [6]  In 1926, Halide Edip (a pioneer Turkish nationalist) wrote in her memoirs about a conversation with Talaat Pasha, verifying and \\\"rationalizing\\\" this ultra-national fascist anti-Armenian mentality, the following:   \\\"I have the conviction that as long as a nation does the best for   its own interest, and succeeds, the world admires it and thinks   it moral. I am ready to die for what I have done, and I know I   shall die for it.\\\" [7]   These telegrams were entered as unquestioned evidence during the 1923 trial of Talaat Pasha's, assassin, Soghomon Tehlerian. The Turkish government never questioned these \\\"death march orders\\\" until 1986, during a time when the world was again reminded of the genocide of the Armenians.  For reasons known to those who study the psychology of genocide denial, the Turkish government and their supporters in crime deny that such orders were ever issued, and further claim that these telegrams were forgeries based on a study by S. Orel and S. Yuca of the Turkish Historical Society.  If one were to examine the sample \\\"authentic text\\\" provided in the Turkish  Historical Society study and use their same forgery test on that sample, it  too would be a forgery!. In fact, if any of the tests delineated by the  Turkish Historical Society are performed an any piece of Ottoman Turkish or  Persian/Arabic script, one finds that anything handwritten in such language is a forgery.   Today, the body of Talaat Pasha lies in a tomb on Liberty Hill, Istanbul, Turkey, just next to the Yildiz University campus. The body of this genocide  architect was returned to Turkey from Germany during WW2 when Turkey was in a  heightened state of proto-fascism. Recently, this monument has served as a focal point for anti-Armenianism in Turkey.  This monument represents the epitome of the Turkish government's pathological denial of a clear historical event and is an insult to a people whose only crime was to be born Armenian.     - - - references - - -  [1] _The Memoirs of Naim Bey_, Aram Andonian, 1919, pages 59-60  [2] ibid, page 60  [3] ibid, page 60  [4] ibid, page 61  [5] ibid, page 61  [6] ibid, page 62  [7] _Memoirs of Halide Edip_, Halide Edip, The Century Press, New York (and     London), 1926, page 387  \",\"Reposting and summarizing, for your information or additional comment.  *** THIS IS LONG ***  I have 16MB of memory on my 386SX (25 MHz), an Intel math coprocessor, and a 120MB hard drive with 20MB free (no compression).

It is a bit lengthy for a posting, but I thought I'd share it with all of you anyway. Feel free to pass it along to anyone whom you feel might benefit from what it says. May God richly bless those who read it.   =======================================================================                      D O E S  G O D  L O V E  Y O U ?     Q. What  kind  of  question  is that?   Anyone who can read sees signs,    tracts, books, and bumper stickers that say, \\\"God Loves You.\\\"  Isn't    that true?   A. It  is  true that God offers His love to the whole world, as we read    in one of the most quoted verses in the Bible:         For  God  so  loved  the world, that he gave his only begotten       Son, that whosoever believeth in him should  not  perish,  but       have everlasting life.                               John 3:16           The way of the wicked is an abomination unto the LORD:  but he       loveth him that followeth after righteousness.   Proverbs 15:9         For  the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of       the ungodly shall perish.                            Psalm 1:6     Q. But  I am not wicked.  I am a decent, moral person.  Surely the good    I have done in my life far outweighs whatever bad I have done.   How    can these verses apply to me?   A. By  God's  standard  of  righteousness even the most moral person is    looked upon by God as a desperate sinner on his way to  Hell.    The    Bible teaches that no one is good enough in himself to go to Heaven.    On  the  contrary,  we  are all sinners and we are all guilty before    God.         As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:  There       is  none  that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after       God.                                            Romans 3:10-11         The  heart  is  deceitful  above  all  things, and desperately       wicked: who can know it?                         Jeremiah 17:9     Q. If I am such a wicked person in God's sight, what will God do to me?   A. The  Bible  teaches that at the end of the world all the wicked will    come under eternal punishment in a place called Hell.         For  a  fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the       lowest hell, and shall consume the earth  with  her  increase,       and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.  I will heap       mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them.  They       shall  be  burnt  with hunger, and devoured with burning heat,       and  with  bitter  destruction:  I will also send the teeth of       beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.                                                 Deuteronomy 32:22-24     Q. Oh,  come  on now!   Hell is not real, is it?  Surely things are not    that bad.   A. Indeed,  Hell is very real, and things are that bad for the individ-    ual who does not know the Lord Jesus Christ as Savior.    The  Bible    makes  many  references  to Hell, indicating that it is both eternal    and consists of perpetual suffering.         And  whosoever  was  not found written in the book of life was       cast into the lake of fire.                   Revelation 20:15         So  shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come       forth, and sever the wicked from among  the  just,  And  shall       cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and       gnashing of teeth.                            Matthew 13:49-50         ...    when  the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with       his mighty angels, In flaming fire taking  vengeance  on  them       that  know  not  God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord       Jesus   Christ:    Who  shall  be  punished  with  everlasting       destruction  from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory       of his power;                            2 Thessalonians 1:7-9     Q. That is terrible!  Why would God create a Hell?   A. Hell  is  terrible,  and  it  exists  because  God created man to be    accountable to God for his actions.  God's perfect  justice  demands    payment for sin.         For the wages of sin is death;                     Romans 6:23         For  we  must  all  appear before the judgment seat of Christ;       that every one may  receive  the  things  done  in  his  body,       according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.                                                   2 Corinthians 5:10         But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak,       they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.                                                        Matthew 12:36     Q. Does that mean that at the end of the world everyone will be brought    to life again to be judged and then to be sent to Hell?   A. Indeed  it  does;  that  is,  unless  we  can find someone to be our    substitute in bearing the punishment of eternal  damnation  for  our    sins.    That  someone  is  God  Himself, who came to earth as Jesus    Christ to bear the wrath of God for all who believe in Him.         All  we  like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one       to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity  of       us all.                                            Isaiah 53:6         But  he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for       our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace  was  upon  him;       and with his stripes we are healed.                Isaiah 53:5         For  I  delivered  unto  you  first  of  all that which I also       received, how that Christ died for our sins according  to  the       scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the       third day according to the scriptures:    1 Corinthians 15:3-4         For  he  hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that       we might be made the righteousness of God in him.                                                   2 Corinthians 5:21     Q. Are  you  saying that if I trust in Christ as my substitute, Who was    already punished for my sins, then I will not have  to  worry  about    Hell anymore?   A. Yes, this is so!  If I have believed in Christ as my Savior, then it    is  as  if  I  have already stood before the Judgment Throne of God.    Christ as my substitute has already paid for my sins.         He  that  believeth  on  the Son hath everlasting life: and he       that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but  the  wrath       of God abideth on him.                               John 3:36     Q. But  what  does it mean to believe on Him?  If I agree with all that    the Bible says about Christ as Savior, then am I saved from going to    Hell?   A. Believing  on  Christ  means  a  whole lot more than agreeing in our    minds with the truths of the Bible.  It means that we hang our whole    lives  on Him.   It means that we entrust every part of our lives to    the  truths  of the Bible.  It means that we turn away from our sins    and serve Christ as our Lord.         No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one,       and  love  the  other;  or  else  he will hold to the one, and       despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.                                                         Matthew 6:24         Repent  ye  therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be       blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from  the       presence of the Lord;                                Acts 3:19     Q. Are  you  saying  that  there  is no other way to escape Hell except    through Jesus?   What about all the other  religions?    Will  their    followers also go to Hell?   A. Yes, indeed.  They cannot escape the fact that God holds us account-    able  for  our  sins.   God demands that we pay for our sins.  Other    religions  cannot  provide  a  substitute  to bear the sins of their    followers.  Christ is the only one who is able to bear our guilt and    save us.         Neither  is  there  salvation  in any other: for there is none       other name under heaven given among men, whereby  we  must  be       saved.                                               Acts 4:12           I  am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the       Father, but by me.                                   John 14:6         If  we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us       our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.                                                           1 John 1:9     Q. Now I am desperate.  I do not want to go to Hell.  What can I do?   A. You  must  remember  that God is the only one who can help you.  You    must throw yourself altogether on the mercies of God.   As  you  see    your hopeless condition as a sinner, cry out to God to save you.         And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much       as  his  eyes  unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying,       God be merciful to me a sinner.                     Luke 18:13         ...  Sirs, what must I do to be saved?  And they said, Believe       on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, ...                                                        Acts 16:30-31     Q. But how can I believe on Christ if I know so little about Him?   A. Wonderfully,  God  not  only saves us through the Lord Jesus, but He    also gives us the faith to believe on Him.  You can pray to God that    He will give you faith in Jesus Christ as your Savior.         For  by  grace  are  ye  saved  through faith; and that not of       yourselves: it is the gift of God:               Ephesians 2:8      God works particularly through the Bible to give us that faith.  So,    if  you  really  mean  business  with  God about your salvation, you    should  use  every opportunity to hear and study the Bible, which is    the only Word of God.    In  this  brochure,  all  verses  from the Bible are within indented    paragraphs.  Give heed to them with all your heart.         So  then  faith  cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of       God.                                              Romans 10:17     Q. But does this mean that I have to surrender everything to God?   A. Yes.    God wants us to come to Him in total humility, acknowledging    our sinfulness and our helplessness, trusting totally in Him.         The  sacrifices  of  God  are  a broken spirit: a broken and a       contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.      Psalm 51:17      Because  we  are sinners we love our sins.  Therefore, we must begin    to pray to God for an intense  hatred  of  our  sins.    And  if  we    sincerely desire salvation, we will also begin to turn from our sins    as  God  strengthens  us.    We know that our sins are sending us to    Hell.         Unto  you  first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him       to bless you, in turning  away  every  one  of  you  from  his       iniquities.                                          Acts 3:26     Q. Doesn't  the  Bible teach that I must attend church regularly and be    baptized?  Will these save me?   A. If  possible,  we should do these things, but they will not save us.    No work of any kind can secure our salvation.   Salvation  is  God's    sovereign gift of grace given according to His mercy and good pleas-    ure.  Salvation is         Not of works, lest any man should boast.         Ephesians 2:9     Q. What else will happen at the end of the world?   A. Those  who have trusted in Jesus as their Savior will be transformed    into their glorious eternal bodies and will be with Christ  forever-    more.         For  the  Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout,       with the voice of the archangel, and with the  trump  of  God:       and  the  dead  in Christ shall rise first:  Then we which are       alive  and remain shall be caught up together with them in the       clouds,  to meet the Lord in the air:  and so shall we ever be       with the Lord.                         1 Thessalonians 4:16-17     Q. What will happen to the earth at that time?   A. God  will destroy the entire universe by fire and create new heavens    and a new earth where Christ will reign with His believers  forever-    more.         But  the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in       the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise,  and       the  elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and       the   works  that  are  therein  shall  be  burned  up.    ...       Nevertheless  we,  according  to  his  promise,  look  for new       heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.                                                      2 Peter 3:10,13     Q. Does  the  Bible  give us any idea of when the end of the earth will    come?   A. Yes!    The end will come when Christ has saved all whom He plans to    save.         And  this  gospel  of the kingdom shall be preached in all the       world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall  the  end       come.                                            Matthew 24:14     Q. Can we know how close to the end of the world we might be?   A. Yes!   God gives much information in the Bible concerning the timing    of the history of the world and tells us that while the Day  of  the    Lord  will come as a thief in the night for the unsaved, it will not    come  as  a  thief for the believers.  There is much evidence in the    Bible  that  the  end  of  the world and the return of Christ may be    very, very close.* All the time clues in the Bible point to this.         For  when  they  shall  say,  Peace  and  safety;  then sudden       destruction cometh upon them, as travail  upon  a  woman  with       child; and they shall not escape.          1 Thessalonians 5:3         Surely  the  Lord  GOD  will  do nothing, but he revealeth his       secret unto his servants the prophets.                Amos 3:7     Q. But that means Judgment Day is almost here.   A. Yes,  it  does.    God  warned  ancient Nineveh that He was going to    destroy that great city and He gave them forty days warning.         And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he       cried,  and  said,  Yet  forty  days,  and  Nineveh  shall  be       overthrown.                                          Jonah 3:4     Q. What did the people of Nineveh do?   A. From  the  king on down they humbled themselves before God, repented    of their sins, and cried to God for mercy.         But  let  man  and  beast  be  covered with sackcloth, and cry       mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his  evil       way,  and  from  the violence that is in their hands.  Who can       tell  if  God  will  turn  and  repent, and turn away from his       fierce anger, that we perish not?                  Jonah 3:8-9     Q. Did God hear their prayers?   A. Yes.  God saved a great many people of Nineveh.     Q. Can  I still cry to God for mercy so that I will not come into judg-    ment?   A. Yes.   There is still time to become saved even though that time has    become very short.         How  shall  we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which       at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed       unto us by them that heard him;                    Hebrews 2:3         In  God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength,       and my refuge, is in God.   Trust in  him  at  all  times;  ye       people,  pour  out  your heart before him: God is a refuge for       us.                                               Psalm 62:7-8                     A R E  Y O U  R E A D Y  T O  M E E T  G O D ?       A  book  entitled  1994?,  written by Harold Camping, presents Biblical information that we may be very near the end of time.  For  information on  how to obtain a copy or to receive a free program guide and list of radio  stations on which you can hear our Gospel programs, please write to Family Radio, Oakland, California, 94621 (The United States of Amer- ica), or call 1-800-543-1495.                  ----------------------------------------     The  foregoing  is a copy of the \\\"Does God Love You?\\\" tract printed by, and available free of charge from, Family Radio.   A  number  of  minor changes  have  been  made to its layout to facilitate computer printing and  distribution.  The only change to the text itself is the paragraph which  describes  the  way in which Biblical passages appear within the text.    In  the  original  tract they appear in italic lettering; they appear here as indented paragraphs.     I have read Mr. Camping's book, compared it with what the Bible actual- ly  says, find it to be the most credible research with respect to what the  future holds that I have ever come across, and agree with him that there  is just too much data to ignore.  While none of us is guaranteed one  more  second  of  life, and while we, therefore, should take these matters  very seriously regardless of when Christ will actually return, it  would appear that our natural tendency to postpone caring about our eternal  destiny  until we feel that our death is imminent is even more senseless  now  because,  in  all  likelihood, the law of averages with respect  to life expectancy no longer applies.  If you wish to obtain a copy  of  this book so that you can check out these facts for yourself, you may find the following information helpful:         title:       1994?       author:      Harold Camping       publisher:   Vantage Press       distributor: Baker and Taylor       ISBN:        0-533-10368-1     I  have  chosen  to share this tract with you because I whole-heartedly agree with everything it declares and feel that now, perhaps more  than ever  before,  this information must be made known.  To paraphrase Acts 20:27,  it  does not shun to declare unto us all the counsel of God.  I am  always  willing  to  discuss  the  eternal truths of the Bible with anyone who is interested as I believe them to be the only issues of any real  importance since we will spend, comparatively speaking, so little time  on this side of the grave and so much on the other.

Or, to convert me to ANYTHING.   There are many types of violence, physical murder is only one.  'Trying' to convert is an insult. It's like trying to tell me that me and/or my God/my lack of God are just crap, that I need a new, 'converted' one.  This does not apply for muslims only, of course. Same for jews and for some friendly, nicely dressed neighbours who show on sunday with empty speaches and cheap booklets about some church ....  And when the objective is (I think, however that you are wrong) to convert  everybody, it's just a matter of time when violence will occur.   Aren't we able to learn anything from thouthands of years of 'conversion related violence' ?   Why not let 'the other, more inferiour' people live as they wish and take care  your business?. You do assume that they are inferiour (or their beliefs are) as long as you want to change their thinking.  \",\"Heya all, I've got a pair of Oakley forsale  There are frogskins, with aurborn red.

Don't you have to have a mobile reciever to even have land-mobile telephone service?  What about ship-to-shore telephone service? \",\" I couldn't have said it better, Mark!\",\" That depends entirely upon the advertiser whose number you circled. Radio Electronics compiles all of the cards, then each advertiser gets a computer printout of the names and addresses of all of the readers who circled their number. Some magazines also provide the data on self-adhesive labels, and the really big magazines provide the data on computer disk.  The advertiser decides what to do with the data they get. You will notice that the Radio Electronics information card (commonly called a \\\"bingo card\\\" in the industry) includes lines for a company name and a business phone number. My guess would be that the big, national advertisers make a distinction between hobbiests and professionals as best they can. For example, if you include Motorola as your company and include a business phone (and a mail stop), Tektronics will probably send you a copy of their hard-bound catalog and have a sales engineer call you about a week later. If you leave it blank, odds are they will send you a slick brochure and direct you to a local retail outlet. Medium and small companies are more likely to send you th e whole catalog. And then some companies, like Digikey or Jameco, have nothing to mail out accept the catalog.  A couple of other interesting points about bingo cards: Free, industry magazines like EDN and such also log your card to their computer. They use the information at least three ways. They note that you really do read the magazine and are more likely to continue your subscription or push you, through repeated mailings, to re-subscribe. They also compile how many people requested which data for their marketing demographics. This way thay can tell a prospective advertiser that \\\"23% of readers requesting data were interested in capacitors.\\\" And finally, some magazines rent lists of readers who request certain information. For example, Tektronics can rent a list of everyone who requested information about test equipment OTHER THAN TEKTRONIC's, in the past 6 months.  The other point, in the data the advertiser receives, many magazines include how many items you circled on the card. If they want, the advertiser can attempt to cull out the \\\"literature collectors\\\" from the serious potential customers.  \\\"Can you say qualified sales leads? I thought you could.\\\"  What's the BEST way for a hobbiest to deal with bingo cards?    Never circle more than 8 number on the card. If you want more   than 8 items, use the second card and mail it a couple of   weeks later.    If you are really, really serious and you really, really want   the information, CALL THE ADVERTISER AND ASK! This will also   cut about 15 days off the the response time. Virtually   everyone takes a voice on the phone more seriously than data   on a computer printout.    To help insure you keep getting a trade magazine that you're   not really \\\"qualified\\\" for, send in a bingo card at least every   other month and circle two or three numbers.    Include a business name and phone number, even if it's your house.   Advertisers almost never call. \",\":  {much deleted] :  :  : The fact that this happened while eating two sugar coated cereals made : by Kellog's makes me think she might be having an allergic reaction to : something in the coating or the cereals.

I have seen it described, and the algiorithm seems a  little bit long.  I developed my own method, which requires that the points be in a counter-clockwise order, and returns whether you are looking at the back or the front, similar to the plane eqn method.  It uses few calculations however, basically it is several comparisons.  The only disadvantage I see is that it must be done after the transformation from view coordinates to coordinates to display on the screen, which means that a little more calculation isneeded beforehand.  My method basically figures out whether the points that will appear on the screen are clockwise or counterclockwise.  When looking at the back of something, the points occur in an opposite direction from the front, so merely by figuring out which way the points go, you can tell whether you are looking at the back or front of a 2d polygon.  Has anyone heard of this method before?  It is so simple, I doubt i am the first to think of it.

Regarding the verses relevant to nature, I prefer to use Dr. Maurice Bucaille's translations (in his book, \\\"The Bible, the Qur'an and Science\\\") for in general his translations are more literal.   Maurice Bucaille translates the portion of the verse you are addressing as   \\\"...Each one is travelling with an orbit in its own motion.\\\"  (Also note that \\\"the celestial bodies\\\" in the first translation quoted by you above is the translator's interpolation -- it is not existent in the original Arabic, which is why it is included in brackets.)    You're right, what the verses _do_ contain isn't all that remarkable.  However, Dr. Bucaille (a surgeon, that's how he's a \\\"Dr.\\\") thinks it is significant that the above verse contains no geocentric ideas, even though geocentrism was all the rage up until the 17th century (?) or so. (And this goes for the rest of the Qur'an as well, which has about 750 verses or so regarding nature, I think I remember reading once.)\",\" You can probably get this information by calling your public health department in your county (in Pittsburgh, they give the shots free, as well).

If the answer is positive, you would know if ms-windows is a \\\"mature\\\" OS.    Days ago people doubted that ms-windows is not a real OS. I can see why they have such question. Ms-windows confuses many people. Microsoft simulated Mac, but it did a lousy job.  For example:  (1) You can not create hierarchy groups. There is no way to create a group     in a group. (If you know how, please tell me.) (2) Too many system parameters to take care of.  (3) uncomplete documentation. It's not easy to find the reason why causes     an unpredictable error. (4) Group deleting/file deleting     After deleting a group, users have to use file manager to delete files.     But if users forget to delete some related files, the disk will be full     of nonsense files. (5) share problem     Once you create two windows doing compilation and editing in some     language (w/o good editor), there will be a sharing problem. You just     can not open or save the program if it is loaded. It makes sense to     prevent from saving, but not opening.  Microsoft try to compromise between DOS and windows, but they just make  ms-windows a graphical DOS with capacity doing mutiple DOS jobs;  the worst thing is they complicate the environment. The orginal purpose of ms-windows should be to simplify the environment, and make PC easier  to use.      It's by no means easy to satisfy everybody, but if Microsoft want to keep their reputations, they should evaluate the user interface more carefully before products distribute.    No flame, please.\",\"I just hooked up my Mac IIsi to a relatively old (1 year?) Asante EN/SC adapter. The 10Base-T connection works like a charm. I installed the newest drivers from Asante's ftp server.  The problem begins when I attach one more device to the SCSI chain - specifically a 50MB drive. I power up the drive, then the Mac. The Mac tests memory, etc. Just before the \\\"happy Mac face\\\" normally shows up, the power light on the EN/SC goes out, and the boot process stops. So I can use the network, or the external drive, but not both at once. This makes the Asante box pretty much unusable.  It doesn't look like a purely electrical SCSI problem, because if I turn on the drive just a second or so too late, so that it doesn't get noticed during the initial SCSI polling, the Mac boots normally and the adapter works, even though the hard disk is powered on and connected. The Mac has *never* once failed to boot from its internal drive up to now (and I've had it for over a year).  Here is what I tried: changing the SCSI ID's of the EN/SC and the disk -- several permutations; changing the order of devices, i.e. the EN/SC at the head or tail of the chain; overterminating with an external terminator (both devices have internal ones); underterminating, i.e. removing internal resistors from the hard disk; trying another EN/SC box; trying another identical drive; trying several different SCSI cables.  Has anybody seen this? More importantly, does anyone have a solution? Thanks a lot.    E. \",\"I once read an article on  Computer technology  which stated that  every new computer technology was actually lower and slower then what it replaced.  Silicon was less  effective then the germanium  products then available.   GaAs  was less capable then Silicon.  Multi-processors were slower then  existent single processors.

Whether that player is in Kindersley, Saskatchewan or Chelyabinsk, Russia, if the GM believes him to be the better player, the GM should be drafting him.  Where do you get off calling the NHL THEIR league, when referring to Canadian players.  It doesn't belong to them, it belongs to the owners.  The owners can do what they want.  While a 'Canadian content' rule might be enforcable here in Canada, there is enough doubt that it would be enforcable in the US that the CFL (sorry for the football reference) didn't even TRY to push their import ratio rule on the Sacromento Goldminers.  Increasing the competition for the 'elite' positions, in most cases, would make players better anyways.  (Oh yeah, and how many Europeans play at the lower levels of professional hockey in North America?  While there are some that play in the AHL, or the IHL where that's an NHL team's primary farm club, you don't hear of many Europeans playing in the CHL, the ECHL, or on the secondary farm teams in the IHL.  (ie. the Jets do have a few Russian players in Moncton, but I don't believe there are any Europeans in Ft. Wayne.)) So with all those teams, there are plenty of positions for hockey players in North America.   I'm in favour of the NHL being the league for the premier players in the world.

When someone claimed that guerillas were manifestations of popular sentiment, the topic arose:\\\"When does a civilian stop becoming a civilian?\\\".  If he houses and shelters guerillas of his own free will, aiding them, has he violated his \\\"civilian\\\" status?   But don't you see that the same statement can be made both ways? If Lebanon was interested in peace then it should accept the word of Israel that the attacks were the cause for war and disarming the Hizbollah will remove the cause for its continued occupancy.  Afterall, Israel has already staged two parts of the withdrawal from areas it occupied in Lebanon during SLG.   That is not exactly true.  The Hizbollah and their affiliated groups have made several attempts to infiltrate the border of Israel.   True, but the Syrians did allow (until at least 1984) guerillas to operate in the areas that were under their control, provided that those guerillas were attacking Israeli lines.  The problem is that Syria is also not as stable a partner for long term peace as others in the area might be. \",\"The internal HD in my LC disappeared for a day last week, and I'd like to hear any (reasonable) theories folks can suggest for what happened.  It is an LC, with 10MB of RAM and an 80MB internal drive, running system 7.1, with a few SCSI devices in a (so far as I know) properly terminated chain.  I had shut down the system for a day-- I was out of town and we sometimes have thunderstorms this time of year-- and upon restarting got a blinking question mark.  I booted from a floppy and saw that my external HD seemed okay, but there was no sign of the internal.  I installed a system folder on the external and was, indeed, able to boot from it.  I tried things like Disk First Aid and Silverlining, to inquire about the internal drive.  They either could not find it or got errors in trying to talk to it.

The BRaves organization is a fertile ground to test this hypothesis, as they had little talent on their roster for some time.  Steve Avery, for example, was rushed to the majors, and he fared very poorly during his initial campaign. His subsequent pitching has not been affected by his 5+ ERA during his rookie year.  Bill James pointed out that it was relatively unusual to struggle so and then rebound.  Bob Horner was also rushed to the majors (out of Arizona State directly) had good numbers immediately.  I am not certain of the ages of people like Pete Smith, Craig McMurty, and Derek Lilliquist.  The Braves pitching staffs were so bad when they came up that they might have been rushed.  Lilliquist and Smith struggled, but it didn't hurt PS and DL may have been overhyped.

When he first logs on (via xdm), he has a single xterm window appear with the mwm window manager running.  In this configuration, X windows applications (particularly xdvi) work fine.  However, if he opens up a second xterm application, suddenly xdvi cannot start in either window, giving the error: Unable to load ISO 8859-1 font.     The only difference between the two xterm windows is that the initial one references a different name in the Xsession file, with prettier colours and other slight changes.  Further investigation shows that only opening a default xterm causes this behaviour, and more significant, ALL X applications can no longer load any fonts if they are invoked from the command line in either window.  If I start the xterm with a different font (using the -fn option), no problems.  It would seem that the default xterm is loading a font which somehow causes the server to lose all of its fonts.  Note: xlsfonts in either window shows all of the fonts available, so there doesn't appear to be a problem in the font directories/hash-tables.     Other than rewriting the XTerm app-defaults file to use a different font and hope for the best, does anyone have any ideas?\",\"  Troglodytism does not necessarily imply a low cultural level. The image-conscious Armenians sorely feel a missing glory in  their background. Armenians have never achieved statehood and  independence, they have always been subservient, and engaged  in undermining schemes against their rulers. They committed  genocide against the Muslim populations of Eastern Anatolia  and Armenian Dictatorship before and during World War I and  fully participated in the extermination of the European Jewry  during World War II. Belligerence, genocide, back-stabbing,  rebelliousness and disloyalty have been the hallmarks of the  Armenian history. To obliterate these episodes the Armenians  engaged in tailoring history to suit their whims. In this zeal  they tried to cover up the cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million  Turks and Kurds before and during World War I.  And, you don't pull nations out of a hat.

(Of course these could all be wrong.....)   from                        THE CLIPPER CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY                                Dorothy Denning                            Revised, April 21, 1993  . . .  The Clipper Chip contains a classified single-key 64-bit block encryption algorithm called \\\"Skipjack.\\\"  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys (compared with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling (compared with 16 for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  The algorithm takes 32 clock ticks, and in Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode runs at 12 Mbits per second.  Each chip includes the following components:     the Skipjack encryption algorithm    F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips    N, a 30-bit serial number (this length is subject to change)    U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip  . . .  ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP  To see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T telephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and we both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure conversation, my security device will negotiate an 80-bit session key K with the device at the other end.  This key negotiation takes place without the Clipper Chip.  In general, any method of key exchange can be used such as the Diffie-Hellman public-key distribution method.  Once the session key K is established, the Clipper Chip is used to encrypt the conversation or message stream M (digitized voice).  The telephone security device feeds K and M into the chip to produce two values:     E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and     E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement field ,   which are transmitted over the telephone line.  The law enforcement field thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U concatenated with the serial number N, all encrypted under the family key F.  The law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after an authorized wiretap has been installed.  ------------------  suppose i knew how the algorithm worked and knew the N for my chip, but did not know F, then by cryptanalysis i might be able to determine F from if law enforcement field     E[E[K; U] + N; F] not knowing N would might make this much harder.  Now suppose that I know F, (either legitimately or not), If I know K (either because I am involved in the conversation, or I know U for a party in the conversation), I may now be able to determine U for the other party.  If I know F I can also defeat the law enforcement field, since I could make my own, with a different K then the one I am using. Knowing F also allows traffic analysis to be performed. So I might not know what you are saying but I could know who you are saying it too.  Now I admit that someone trying to compute U will not have lots of messages to work from, but since we have no way of knowing that the key generation method does not (deliberately?) generate weak keys, or for that matter that the published method is in fact used, perhaps the U's will be chosen from know weak keys for the system.  Obviously the compromise of F would be a disaster, both to law enforcement for whom this whole thing is designed, and for the people who believe that it is giving them security. F is but one number, and I sure that alot of people (more then 1) know what it is (and if some \\\"panel of experts\\\" is going to check it over for flaws then many more will know F, forget grinding chips, bribery and blackmail work just fine.

So I decided to check it out, on my own.  But, then, that was in BN times (Before Net).  So, here are some  references.  See Robin Lane Fox's _The unauthorized version_, (p.284) where  Lane Fox writes, \\\"... the one passage which appears to [comment on Jesus'  career] is agreed to be a Christian addition.\\\"  In my Re:Albert Sabin response (C5u7sJ.391@sunfish.usd.edu) to Jim Lippard (21 April 93), I noted that consensus is typically indicated subtly as in Elaine  Pagel's _The gnostic gospels_ (p.85), to wit:  \\\"A comment *attributed* to Josephus reports ... [emphasis mine]\\\".  Scholars sometimes do not even mention the two Josephus entries, another subtlety reflecting consensus.  So far as I can deduce, today's consensus is built on at least three things:  1) the long passage is way out of context, 2) Origen did not know about the long passage, and 3) the short and long passages are contradictory.  I don't know the references wherein the arguments which led to consensus are orginally developed (does anyone?).  Biblical scholars as I defined them include theologians and historians.  The former, like the latter, incorporate historical, social, technological and ideological contexts as well as theology.  So the distinction is blurred.  I  didn't elaborate on that.  Sorry.  (In turn, historians are compelled to incorporate theology).  Can't say about the number of copies.  These were, however, BG times (Before  Gutenburg).  A hundred first editions seems exceedingly high; counting on one  hand seems more reasonable.  Perhaps those mss. without the long insert (if any, because anything is possible) have been destroyed.  Such a practice is  certainly not foreign to religions.  Anyway, all we have are mss. which have  the two entries.  Lippart (in the message noted above) talks about an Arabic  ms.

If they would of had the proper equipment and personal then they could of captured the compound on the initial assault and none of this would of happened.   If they'd gone to the door and knocked on it to serve the  warrant, like the Sheriff had done 3 other times, they  wouldn't have needed to HAVE an initial assault.  But then,  Herr Klinton and Attorney Gen'l Reno wouldn't have been  able to have told such heroic stories about how they  \\\"protected\\\" the rest of us from a group of people who  kept to themselves, miles out in the prairie.  The BATF needs more people, better weapons and more armored transports. When they meet hostile fire they should be able to use more force instead of retreating to a stand off. If you are going to do a job then do it right. The BATF is there to protect us and they must have the proper equipment and people to do the job.   The BATF needs to be disbanded.  This out of control group  of Rambo wannabees is a danger to the Republic.  With the WoD and the increased crime in the streets the BATF is needed more now then ever.

I've just finished reading S414, and have several questions about the Brady bills (S414 and HR1025).  1. _Are_ these the current versions of the Brady bill?      What is the status of these bills?  I've heard they're \\\"in committee\\\".      How close is that to being made law?  2. S414 and HR1025 seem fairly similar.  Are there any important    differences I missed?  3. S414 seems to have some serious loopholes:   A. S414 doesn't specify an \\\"appeals\\\" process to wrongful denial during      the waiting period, other than a civil lawsuit(?)  (S414 has an appeals      process once the required instant background check system is established,      but not before).   B. the police are explicitly NOT liable for mistakes in denying/approving      using existing records (so who would I sue in \\\"A\\\" above to have an      inaccurate record corrected?)   C. S414 includes an exception-to-waiting-period clause for if a person      can convince the local Chief Law-Enforcement Officer (CLEO) of an      immediate threat to his or her life, or life of a household member.      But S414 doesn't say exactly what is considered a \\\"threat\\\", nor does      it place a limit on how long the CLEO takes to issue an exception      statement. True?  Have I misunderstood?  Any other 'holes?  4. With just S414, what's to stop a person with a \\\"clean\\\" record from    buying guns, grinding off the serial numbers, and selling them to crooks?    At minimum, what additional laws are needed to prevent this?     'Seems at min. a \\\"gun counting\\\" scheme would be needed    (e.g., \\\"John Doe owns N guns\\\").  So, if S414 passes, I wouldn't be surprised    to see legislation for stricter, harder-to-forge I.D.'s plus national gun    registration, justified by a need to make the Brady bill work.  Please comment.  I'm mainly interested in specific problems with the current legislation--I don't mean to start a general discussion of the merits of any/all waiting-period bills ever proposed.\",\"    >It seems that conservatives are putting a lot of effort into     >showing up the 10% figure, but that really doesn't make a     >difference.

Helsingfors IFK have been around since 1897 but fans only started taking hockey seriously in the 1960s so I think you're exagerating here.   That's a rather bold claim, in the light of how successful the Canadian & American Olympic teams have been . . . and they've had to play according to our set of rules and on international ice. The 1992 Olympic teams contained about as much talent as your average expansion team. Canada had Eric Lindros, Sean Burke, Joe Juneau and Chris Kontos. Another four or five have been deep subs in the NHL. As for the Yanks, Keith Tkachuk, Scott Lachance, Bret Hedican, Shawn  McEachern, Steve Heintze, Ted Donato, Joe Sacco and Bill Guerin have been  3rd/4th line players in the NHL, while Robb Stauber has done well for the  Kings in goal. Nothing more. In fact, I'm sure that an All-Star team assembled from the best Finnish League teams would do no better in the NHL than Hartford  or Tampa Bay currently are doing. --- But what happens if _all_ top-class Finnish & Swedish players gradually end up with Helsinki & Stockholm as the North American-based ones gradually retire and no Canadian/American team is allowed to draft new players from Scandinavia?  Here is what THE HOCKEY NEWS scouts think of our NHL-based players:  (28-30=superstar) (23-27=star) (18-22=NHL regular+) (13-17=NHL regular) ( 8-12=role player)  FINLAND:    D-Jyrki Lumme.......20 D-Teppo Numminen....20 D-Peter Ahola.......13  C-Jari Kurri........25 C-Christian Ruuttu..16  R-Teemu Selanne.....27  L-Esa Tikkanen......20 (Obviously, Selanne's ratings would be higher today than they were in January)  SWEDEN: D-Ulf Samuelsson....21 D-Fredrik Olausson..20 D-Niklas Lidstrom...18 D-Calle Johansson...18 D-Kjell Samuelsson..17 D-Tommy Sjodin......13 D-Tommy Albelin......7  C-Mats Sundin.......26 C-Thomas Steen......18  R-Thomas Sandstrom..22 R-Ulf Dahlen........18 R-Michael Nylander..13  L-Per-Erik Eklund...18 L-Johan Garpenlov...16 L-Mikael Andersson..15 L-Jan Erixon........14  This would be interesting. Clearly, Finland's top five players (Winnipeg's Selanne & Numminen, Vancouver's Lumme, Los Angeles' Jari Kurri and New York's Tikkanen) are right up there with any five-man unit Pittsburgh & co. have. But I have my doubts about the home-based Finnish players - the national team did well in the Canada Cup and World Championships largely due to the efforts of Markus Ketterer (the goalie), 3-4 or the players listed above and luck. There's presumably a lot of decent players in Finland that wouldn't be superstars at the highest level but still valuable role players, however. My guess would be that the Finnish Canada Cup team would be a .500 team in the NHL. --- Sweden is easier to judge because they have more players in North America. Their points total (16 players) is 274 - seven more than Ottawa's 22 top players combined! If we estimate there are six more NHL regulars back home in  Sweden, an all-Swedish team would assemble about 350-360 skill points. Deducting some points from Pittsburgh, NY Rangers and other teams that rely on Swedish players, the Swedish team would finish in sixth place - about as high as Boston, Vancouver, Calgary and Montreal on paper! So, the \\\"dynasty\\\" talk isn't completely unfounded here. An all-Finnish/all-Swedish team might have an advantage because the players would be playing at home half of the time, won't have to adapt to a foreign country and a foreign language, and presumably play the wide-open European variant of hockey rather than have to learn the North American checking game. However, if free agency becomes a factor the top  Scandinavian players still might end up playing for large-market teams after a  couple of years the same way Edmonton's \\\"dynasty\\\" crumbled in the late '80s.  Some fringe players likely will be drafted by other NHL teams as having an  exclusive talent pool might be a bit unfair after all. I'd settle for a  compromise, prohibit all European teams from signing a North American during  the first two rounds but allow them to keep their top two players. After this,  the amateur draft should be open to anyone.  \",\"GB> From: geb@cs.pitt.edu (Gordon Banks) GB> The HMO would stop the over-ordering, but in HMOs, tests are GB> under-ordered.

I grant you that when Joseph Smith was still alive, plenty of \\\"accusations\\\" were filed, most of which had little bearing with reality, as evidenced by various verdicts. I have studied lds history for 15 years now, and I have yet to see prove that the lds leadership was involved, in quote: \\\"illegal activities.\\\" Plural marriage, yes, but your charge of \\\"underage\\\" wives sounds like it could have originated from a tabloid, and discredits the high moral standards which characterized these leaders and families, unlike, as it appears, those of David Koresh.  #        Joseph Smith started the sect.  After he and his brother Hyram #were murdered in a Nauvoo, Il. jail cell, church membership split over #who to follow.  Initially, Smith was considered a prophet (just like #Mohammed, a rather interesting parallel considering Muslims consider #Christ to be a prophet the same as Jews, I'm led to understand.  Make #no mistake, this was no messiah we're talking about in Smith).  The  And neither did he claim he was.  As the church reflects the moral aptitude of its leaders (and especially those of Joseph Smith), I have nothing but the highest respect for this inspired man, whose only \\\"crime\\\" was that he refused to deny that he had seen a vision...  Many have tried to explain the \\\"Smith phenomenon\\\" away, but the bold presence of an 8.5 million member strong church stands as a witness that Joseph Smith's testimony had enough resilience and power to carry on the message.  #thought at the time was that the gift of prophecy was to be handed #down father to son.  After Joseph Smith died, his son was only #entering his teens.  Brigham Young and a few others claimed to have #been bequeathed the gift and leadership prior to his death.  The #Council of Twelve, the Church governing body, wasn't of much help #here, and this basic conflict is still a wedge between the sects. #Brigham Young took his followers to Salt Lake.  The rest waited #for Smith Jr. to grow up enough to assume leadership.  The other #claimants to the leadership were soon ignored, like Mike Dukakis. ;-)  \\\"The rest\\\" were apostates and excommunicated members of the Church, while the great majority of the membership, the Twelve, and the various auxiliary organizations, chose to accept Brigham Young as the new prophet and leader of the Church.  If you knew your lds scriptures and doctrine, you would have known that Brigham Young was the FIRST in line to fill the prophet Joseph Smith's vacancy: he was the senior apostle in the Quorum, and various comments made by Joseph indicated that it was Brigham who would lead the latter-day exodus to the West.  Other rightful \\\"heirs\\\" were either dead (Hyrum Smith) or excommunicated (Oliver Cowdery), and while persecutions abounded and intensified, Joseph Smith had already given orders to look for a new place, an empty land beyond the boundaries of the United States (at that time).  This \\\"Rekhabite\\\" principle (pseudographia) was well understood and antipated by the great majority of lds faithful, and was not questioned by them.  Granted, a couple of \\\"do-it-yourselfers\\\" stayed behind, unwilling to sacrifice and to undertake the perilous journey to the unknown, but this also was necessary to separate the tares from the wheat.  The church benefitted from this purification process: they became even more unified and willing to carry out their mission to the world.  #        Both sects practiced the \\\"1-year food stockpile\\\" doctrine, #and this being frontier and farming country most carried or at #least owned weapons.  There is little evidence that they were a #militaristic sect, given that they tended to move on rather than #face large-scale opposition.  Brigham Young, having suffered a #great deal getting to Salt Lake, seems to have been quite #justified in making military training a good thing.  Remember, #this was far beyond where even the US Army went, and these people #had nobody to turn to save themselves. # #        Just a little context to put this all in perspective.  BTW, since when is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (one of the largest denominations in the country) a \\\"sect\\\"???

Even if this were true (reliable data, please), I am convinced that those officers would perform to the highest codes of honor and conduct (that's why they were selected for in the first place, remember?).  Besides, one of our Articles of Faith STRONGLY states the principle of freedom of religion, and that all people are free to worship \\\"*how*, *where*, or *what* they may.\\\"  #        If it's true, there would be little affect.  LDS and RLDS #philosophy is that all other religions have strayed from the true #Church as set down by Jesus, but that God will judge each on his #own merits.  In addition, the RLDS also contend (and the LDS may #as well) that ignorance of the True Way (tm) is an excuse.  You #can only be condemned if you had been tought the way and rejected #it.  In short, LDS and RLDS suffer everybody from Lutherans to #Buddhists, secure in the knowledge that though they are wrong they #will not be penalized for ignorance.  It is more likely that Hoover #liked them because of their rather strict upbringings which forbade #alcohol, tobacco, hot drink (like coffee or tea), and the like. #These people are the \\\"salt of the Earth\\\" and as such are more #easily made to follow orders and have few vices to be used against them.

But assuming that the Pope has universal jurisdiction    and authority, what authority do you rely upon for your decisions?    What prevents me from choosing ANY doctrine I like and saying that    Papal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time?    This is especially true, since Councils of Bishops have basically    stood by the Pope.  The ultimate question is the traditional theology of the Church.  This is the *only* thing that it is possible to resist a Pope for: his departure from the traditional doctrine of the Church.  If commands from *any* authority conflict with Tradition, the commands must be disobeyed.  My own view on this is that this conflict could only happen in a major way.  God would never allow a hair-splitting situation to develop; it would be too complex for people to figure out.  I don't view the present situation in the Church as anything extremely complicated. Run through a list of what has happened in the last 30 years in the Catholic Church, and any impartial observer will be aghast.     It appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter is    disagreements over what is tradition and Tradition, and also over    authority and discipline.    The problems stem from a general widespread ignorance of the Catholic Faith, in my opinion.  Most Catholics know about zilch about the Catholic Faith; this leaves them wide open for destruction by erring bishops.  It's basically the Reformation part II.  There is not even a question in my mind that in some respects the shards of the Catholic Church are currently being trampled upon by the Catholic hierarchy.  I could go on listing shocking things for an hour, probably.  Take the situation in Campos, Brazil, for example.  I'm reading a book on what happened there after Vatican Council II.  The bishop, Antonio de Castro-Mayer, never introduced all the changes that followed in the wake of Vatican II.  He kept the traditional Mass, the same old catechisms, etc.  He made sure the people knew their faith, the Catholic theology of obedience, what Modernism was, etc.  He innoculated the people against what was coming.  Well, one day the order came from Rome for his retirement.  It came when the Pope was sick.  Bishop de Castro-Mayer waited until the Pope recovered, then inquired whether this command was what the Pope really wanted, or something that some Liberal had commanded in his absence. The Pope confirmed the decision.  So the good bishop retired.  The injustice that followed was completely incredible.  A new bishop was installed.  He proceeded to expel most of bishop de Castro-Mayer's clergy from their churches, because they refused to celebrate the New Mass.  The new bishop would visit a parish, and celebrate a New Mass. The people would promptly walk out of the church en masse.  The bishop was *enraged* by this.  He usually resorted to enlisting the help of the secular authorities to eject the priest from the church.  The priests would just start building new churches; the people were completely behind them.  The old parishes had the New Mass, as the bishop desired -- and virtually no parishioners.  The prime motivation for all this was completely illegal, according to canon law.  No priest can be penalized in any way for saying the traditional Mass, because of legislation enacted by Pope Saint Pius V. Nor is there any obligation to say the New Mass.  During all this process, the people of Campos, not just private individuals, but including civil authorities, were constantly sending petitions and letters to Rome to do something about the new Modernist bishop.  NOTHING was ever done; no help ever arrived from Rome. Eventually 37 priests were kicked out, and about 40,000 people.     My question to the supporters of SSPX is this:    Is there ANY way that your positions with respect to church reforms   could change and be conformed to those of the Pope? (assuming that   the Pope's position does not change and that the leaders of SSPX   don't jointly make such  choice.)     If not, this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority.    If I adopt the view that \\\"I'm NOT wrong, I CAN'T be wrong, and    there's NO WAY I'll change my mind, YOU must change yours\\\", that    I've either left the Catholic Church or it has left me.  If the Pope defines certain things ex cathedra, that would be the end of the controversy.  That process is all very well understood in Catholic theology, and anyone who doesn't go along with it is an instant non-Catholic.  The problem here is that people do not appreciate what is going on in the Catholic world.  If they knew the Faith, and what our bishops are doing, they would be shocked!     We sould argue from now until the Second Coming about what the \\\"real\\\"    traditional teaching of the Church is.  If this were a simple matter    East and West would not have been separated for over 900 years.  This isn't the case in the Catholic Church.  There is a massive body of traditional teaching.  The Popes of the last 150 years are especially relevant.  There is no question at all what the traditional doctrine is.     I thought that the teaching magisterieum of the church did not allow    error in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term.`    I may be wrong here, I'm not Roman Catholic. :-)  That's heresy, more or less.  Although they have done a great job since the Reformation, the last 30 years have seen so many errors spread that it's pitiful.  Infallibility rests in the Pope, and in the Church as a whole.  In the short term, a Pope, or large sections of the Church can go astray.  In fact, that's what usually happens during a major heresy: large sections of the Church go astray.  (The Pope historically has been much more reliable.)  Everything will always come back in the long run.     What would be the effect of a Pope making an ex cathedra statement    regarding the SSPX situation?  Would it be honored?  If not, how    do you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility?    Again, I'm not trying to be contentions, I'm trying to understand.    Since I'm Orthodox, I've got no real vested interest in the outcome,    one way or the other.  Yes, it would be honored.  Infallibility is infallibility.  But what is he going to define?  That the New Mass is a better expression of the Catholic Faith than the old?  That sex education in the Catholic schools is wonderful?  That all religions are wonderful except for that professed by the Popes prior to Vatican II?     It does if the command was legitimate.  SSPX does not view the    Pope's commands as legitimate.  Why?  This is a VERY slippery slope.\",\"One not-so-quick question to throw out there for you guys...  For our class project, we need to design and build a power supply to the following specs:  Voltatge:  adjustable from 1-12V Current:   *limited* at 1A  Voltage must stay within 2% of designated value for I from 0-1A AC ripple less than 5 mV (rms)  Of course, we can't just use an adjustable voltage, current-limiting regulator chip ;^)  Our problem is with the current limiting (i.e. we've found stuff to do the rest of the parts of the circuit).  What the supply must do, if presented with a load which would draw more than 1A, given the supply voltage, is reduce the voltage so that the current will equal one amp.  Thus, if we were to short the thing with the ammeter, we should read one amp.  If we measure the current through a 1 ohm  resistor at 12V, we should read one amp (and the output voltage, by necessity, must be 1V.  The only basic idea we have seen for the current limiter involves a circuit which will pull current off of the base of the output  power transistor, and therefore reduce the output.  So, does anybody have any ideas we could work from?  Thanks in advance.  Andy Collins, KC6YEY acollins@uclink.berkeley.edu\",\"        Hmmm... people in the americas before the time of Christ, children who die young, etc. ?        But of course, the popular conception of hell (correct or incorrect) is something akin to eternal perpetuation of consciousness, at the very least.       I think a good number of atheists believe there is nothing beyond  bodily death, but it is simply an abuse of language to say they believe they're going to hell. They believe they're going to _die_. Understand that you've turned Hell into a verb. Using the same logic, it also follows that all animals are 'going to Hell.' Are you sure this is what you want to say? (presumably animals don't have the opportunity to get to heaven, but this still doesn't change the fact that they're going to Hell (die a final death))     I don't claim to know whether or not there is an afterlife of _some_ sort, but if Hell is as you described (final death, and not eternal perpetuation of consciousness) it will be true that there will never be a moment when I am aware of my non-existence.  (assuming I 'go to Hell' and not to Heaven) In other words, I'll never know I'm dead. Hmmm...         Ever hear people say of a loved one who was ill, and has died:  \\\"At least she's not suffering any more; She's in Heaven now.\\\" ?      Consider the following statement:  \\\"At least she's not suffering any more; She's in Hell now.\\\"      The above statement sounds odd, but according to your definition of Hell,  it would be a true statement. The person in Hell would not be suffering.  Granted, they wouldn't be *anything* (wouldn't be having any conscious experience whatsoever).       You say Hell (death) is eternal. However, this loses its meaning  to a dead person. And to me, it seems that the threat of some sort  of eternal punishment only makes sense/has force if one expects to be conscious throughout this eternity.       Many atheists believe that the thirst for an afterlife is simply the product of propaganda (\\\"Friend, do you want the FREE gift of e-ternal life?\\\" It's my understanding that the early jews did not believe in an afterlife. Can anyone back me up on this?) combined with the survival instinct all animals share. The difference is we have consciousness, and once we get the idea of eternal life drilled into our brains, we then desire a sort of super-survival.          That would depend on what Heaven is like. If God is a King, and  an eternity in heaven consists of giving thanks and praise to the King, I might opt for Hell. I read a lovely account of a missionary trying to convert Eskimos to Christianity in the book _The Illusion of Immortality_ by Corliss Lamont. The missionary started to speak about Heaven.  \\\"Are there seals in heaven? Will we be able to go hunting?\\\" asked an Eskimo. The missionary said no. The group of Eskimos then said something to the effect of, \\\"Well what good is your Heaven if there's no hunting? Scram.\\\" I highly recommend the above book (IOI) to anyone who wants an account of the other side of the immortality coin (that there is no  immortality).

I don't know how much the teaching of countersteering in the beginner course really helps the tuchus steerers. I was one, I guess that I always steered a bicycle that way, and I only got the hang of countersteering in normal riding *after* the course. I could do the countersteering swerves in the course no problem, but I only started using it in my normal riding when I decided that my turning at speed (off-ramps and the like) was a lot more difficult that it should have been. I knew how it works (although that's currently up for debate) definitely knew *that* it works, as I could do it in swerves, but only figured it out later in my normal riding. Just a data point. I think that it's not a bad idea to bring the idea up, but it's best to let everyone tuchus-steer for the first lesson or two, so they can learn to shift gears before they have to worry about proper handlebar technique.   I have. In our beginner course we had passenger training. Sometime during the lesson the instructor would hop on the back of the bike, and the student would take him for a ride.

This is the first in a series of regular postings aimed at new readers of the newsgroups.  Many groups of a 'controversial' nature have noticed that new readers often come up with the same questions, mis-statements or misconceptions and post them to the net.  In addition, people often request information which has been posted time and time again.  In order to try and cut down on this, the alt.atheism groups have a series of five regular postings under the following titles:     1.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Overview for New Readers    2.

However, please send any changes or corrections to the author, and please do not re-post copies of the articles to alt.atheism; it does nobody any good to have multiple versions of the same document floating around the network.                                   Finding Stuff  All of the FAQ files *should* be somewhere on your news system.  Here are some suggestions on what to do if you can't find them:  1. Check the newsgroup alt.atheism.  Look for subject lines starting with    \\\"Alt.Atheism FAQ:\\\".  2. Check the newsgroup news.answers for the same subject lines.     If you don't find anything in steps 1 or 2, your news system isn't set up    correctly, and you may wish to tell your system administrator about the    problem.  3. If you have anonymous FTP access, connect to rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27].    Go to the directory /pub/usenet/alt.atheism, and you'll find the latest    versions of the FAQ files there.     FTP is a a way of copying files between networked computers.  If you    need help in using or getting started with FTP, send e-mail to    mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with        send usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq     in the body.  4. There are other sites which also carry news.answers postings.  The article    \\\"Introduction to the news.answers newsgroup\\\" carries a list of these    sites; the article is posted regularly to news.answers.  5. If you don't have FTP, send mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu    consisting of the following lines:        send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources       send usenet/alt.atheism/faq       send usenet/alt.atheism/introduction       send usenet/alt.atheism/logic       send usenet/alt.atheism/resources  5.

There's other stuff, too; interesting commands to try are \\\"help\\\" and    \\\"send atheism/index\\\".  6. (Last resort)  Mail mathew@mantis.co.uk, or post an article to the    newsgroup asking how you can get the FAQ files.  You should only do this    if you've tried the above methods and they've failed; it's not nice to    clutter the newsgroup or people's mailboxes with requests for files.    it's better than posting without reading the FAQ, though!  For instance,    people whose email addresses get mangled in transit and who don't have     FTP will probably need assistance obtaining the FAQ files. \",\"I recently upgraded to System 7.1 and now I also upgraded my DeskWriter drivers from 2.2 to 3.1.

My experience of Christianity (25+ years) is that most Christians seek answers from clergymen who have little or no direct experience of spiritual matters, and that most of these questions can be answered by simple introspection.  Most people suspect that they cannot trust their senses, but few take the next step to figure out that they can trust themselves.  Not to get too esoteric, but it seems that most religions, Christianity included, are founded by particularly intuitive people who understand this.

Co\",\" Actually, jon, that is quite true.  Christian people have caused \\\"objective morality\\\" to look very \\\"relative.\\\"  After all, that was the point of the original question in this thread, i.e. can we toss out Christianity because it is so obviously inconsistent with its own principles?  If you will bear with me, I will attempt to explain this apparent inconsistency from at least one Christian's viewpoint:  If God exists and is the creator of mankind as the Bible claims, then He has a pretty well-defined concept of what makes people tick physically, emotionally, etc.  GOD has an \\\"objective\\\" morality for us. That is to say, He has no trouble understanding what is good for (or detrimental to) the creature He created.    Galatians 2:10-- For we [mankind] are His workmanship, created in  Christ Jesus for good works [a morality], which God prepared  beforehand [a well-defined design], that we might walk in them.  However, contrary to what many people assume (including the Pharasees of the Bible,) God's morality cannot be completely codified in a list of rules and regulations.  To some extent, every activity of a person's life creates a new situation to which morality must be applied.  There never could be enough volumes to codify God's \\\"objective\\\" morality for us.   Throughout history, mankind has tried to reduce morality to a list of rules (objectivity, if you please.)  In the Old Testament, we have both principles and specific rules.  By the time of Jesus, most of the principles were obscured by the emphasis men had placed on the rules. Volumes of additional rules had been made to try to codify the application of the principles.  We [mankind] weren't comfortable with the \\\"subjectivity\\\" of principles.    For reference see Matthew 5 where Jesus explains the difference  between the Law and the principles of the Law.  For example, in  verses 21-22:  \\\"You have heard that the ancients were told,  'You shall not commit murder'...and 'Whoever commits murder shall  be liable to the court.'  But I say to you that everyone who is  angry with his brother shall be liable to the court...\\\"  The \\\"objective morality\\\" of God gets blurred by our inept interpretation of it.  We [Christians] have made our biggest errors when we have allowed any one person or group of people decide EXACTLY what God intended for us.  If we [Christians] would stay committed to seeking God's will instead of trying to prove we already had it all figured out, we might do a better job of allowing others to find God's \\\"objective morality\\\" for themselves.  If Jesus is who he said he was/is (and that's the fundamental question,) then HE IS \\\"objective morality.\\\" \",\"AllThe Devil ReincarnateSWR meter for CB radios  TD>From: ssave@ole.cdac.com (The Devil Reincarnate) TD>Organization: CDAC, WA TD>What TD>is a good choice for a CB? 1/4 or 1/8 wave?

The best is a 1/2 wave antenna, followed by  1/4, then 1/8 etc.  As for SWRing in, what you actually do is trim the antenna to the correct  length for the specific wavelength you will be transmitting on. Since the  wavelength varies with the channel you use, then it's recommended to SWR  in using the middle channel of those you are going to use. Anyway in the beginning of CB's, all new antennas had to be SWR'ed in,  nowdays manufactures trim the antennas almost spot on, so that there's not  much point in SWRing. Then again you may be a fanatic and whish to do it  anyway.\",\"Greetings:  Can someone steer me towards sources of information on vehicle data logging systems?

Seems only the SDCNs realize how much baseball is a *team* game, combining efforts from every player for the win.  Consider the Red Sox game last night.  The Sox won 4-3 in the bottom of the 13th.  Who won the game?  -Clemens pitched a strong nine (?) innings, allowing only two runs. -Ryan pitched a couple shutout innings, though he needed some excellent  defensive plays behind him to do so. -Quantrill pitched a couple of innings, gave up the go-ahead run, and  got credited with the win when the Sox scored two in the bottom of  the inning.  Looks like a team effort to me!  Yet only Quantrill got credit for the win.  How about the offense? -Dawson and Vaughn hit (I think) HRs early in the game.  Without either  one, the Sox would have lost in nine. -Quintana led off the 13th with a solid single. -Zupcic pinch-ran for Quintana, providing the speed to go from first  to third when... -Cooper ripped a *second* single in the inning. -Melvin avoided the DP, getting the run home with a sac fly.  Not much of  a help, but it was something. -Scrub Richardson then hit a double, scoring the speedy Cooper all the  way from first!  (Hill's lack of defense helped.)  Cooper and Zupcic were credited with runs, Melvin and Richardson were credited with RBIs.  But it seems to me that it was Quintana's hit that set up the whole inning!  And did Melvin really contribute as much as Richardson?  Furthermore, people seem to consider RBIs to be more significant than runs.  Did Melvin contribute more than Cooper?  Cooper provided the game-winning baserunner, and moved the tying run to third base with only one out!  Assigning credit based on Runs and RBIs is clearly ridiculous.  You can argue that OBP and SLG don't show you who came through in the clutch, but R&RBI don't do any better.  At least OBP and SLG don't *claim* to try to tell you that.

I bought it in California, and if it'll let me, I'd like to keep it for another year.  The only problem is these Indiana winters--my heater controls don't work.  The car has vacuum operated control switches for the vents.  Right now it is stuck in the \\\"vent\\\" mode.  It will blow warm air, but I can't switch the air flow to either the floor (I can live without this) or the defrost (I can't  live without this).  I probably could just jam the air deflector to the  defrost position, but this blows a lot of air in my face and is, well, kind of like putting a vacuum cleaner in reverse.  I have taken parts of the dash off and looked at the vacuum system and I think the problem (or part of it) is with the two diaphragms which control up/down and outside/inside air flow.  THe diaphragm which controls outside(vent)/in- side(no vent) air is cracked most of the way around, and the other one is probably damaged too, considering the advanced age of the car.  Two questions:   1)  Is there anything I should be aware of about this (other than  the fact that I should move from Indiana) ?   2)  In the event that replacement diaphragms aren't available, is there  a way to \\\"fix\\\" this?

In Britain, where one has/used to pay for a TV licence, there  are/were TV detector vans prowling the streets, looking for people who hadn't  paid their licence fee. They had a couple of long solenoid antennae on the roof, and I believe could triangulate an operating TV from the IF.

OTIS is here for the purpose of distributing original artwork and photographs over the network for public perusal, scrutiny,     and distribution.  Digital immortality.  The basic idea behind \\\"digital immortality\\\" is that computer networks    are here to stay and that anything interesting you deposit on them will be around near-forever.  The GIFs and JPGs of today will be the artifacts of a digital future.  Perhaps they'll be put in different formats, perhaps only surviving on backup tapes....but they'll be there...and someone will dig them up.     If that doesn't interest you... OTIS also offers a forum for critique and exhibition of your works....a virtual art gallery that never closes and exists in an information dimension where your submissions will hang as wallpaper on thousands of glowing monitors.  Suddenly, life is  breathed into your work...and by merit of it's stimulus, it will  travel the globe on pulses of light and electrons.   Spectators are welcome also, feel free to browse the gallery and  let the artists know what you think of their efforts.  Keep your own copies of the images to look at when you've got the gumption... that's what they're here for.  ---------------------------------------------------------------  WHERE?               OTIS currently (as of 4/21/93) has two FTP sites.       141.214.4.135 (projects/otis), the UWI site     sunsite.unc.edu (/pub/multimedia/pictures/OTIS), the SUNsite   (you can also GOPHER to this site for OTIS as well)  Merely \\\"anonymous FTP\\\" to either site on Internet and change to the appropriate directory.  Don't forget to get busy and use the \\\"bin\\\" command to make sure you're in binary.  OTIS has also been spreading to some dial-up BBS systems around North America....the following systems have a substancial supply of OTIStuff...  Underground Cafe (Omaha) (402.339.0179) 2 lines  CyberDen (SanFran?) (415.472.5527)  Usenet Waffle-iron  --------------------------------------------------------------   HOW DO YOU CONTRIBUTE?                What happens is...you draw a pretty picture or take a lovely    photo, get it scanned into an image file, then either FTP-put it in the CONTRIB/Incoming directory or use UUENCODE to send it to me (email addresses at eof) in email.  After the image is received, it will be put into the correct directory.  Computer originated works are also welcome.  OTIS' directories house two types of image files, GIF and JPG.   GIF and JPG files require, oddly enough, a GIF or JPG viewer to  see.  These viewers are available for all types of computers at  most large FTP sites around Internet.  JPG viewers are a bit tougher to find.  If you can't find one, but do have a GIF viewer,   you can obtain a JPG-to-GIF conversion program which will change     JPG files to a standard GIF format.   OTIS also accepts animation files.        When you submit image files, please send me email at the same time stating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to be used (in publications or other projects) or if it is merely for people to view.  Also, include some biographical information on yourself, we'll be having info-files on each contributing artist and their works.  You  can also just upload a text-file of info about yourself (instead of  emailing).  If you have pictures, but no scanner, there is hope.  Merely send copies to:  The OTIS Project c/o Ed Stastny PO BX 241113 Omaha, NE 68124-1113  I will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will   scan them.  Include an ample SASE if you want your stuff back.   Also include information on each image, preferably a 1-3 line  description of the image that we can include in the infofile in the directory where it's finally put.  If you have preferences as to what the images are to be named, include those as well.     Conversely, if you have a scanner and would like to help out, please contact me and we'll arrange things.  If you want to submit your works by disk, peachy.  Merely send a 3.5\\\" disk to the above address (Omaha) and a SASE if you want your disk back. This is good for people who don't have direct access to encoders or FTP, but do have access to a scanner.  We accept disks in either Mac or IBM compatible format.  If possible, please submit image files as GIF or JPG.  If you can't...we can convert from most formats...we'd just rather not have to.  At senders request, we can also fill disks with as much OTIS as they can stand.  Even if you don't have stuff to contribute, you can send a blank disk and an SASE (or $2.50 for disk, postage and packing) to  get a slab-o-OTIS.  As of 04/21/93, we're at about 18 megabytes of files, and growing.   Email me for current archive size and directory.  --------------------------------------------------------------------  DISTRIBUTION?  The images distributed by the OTIS project may be distributed freely    on the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is not altered in any way (save to convert from one image format to another).  In fact, we encourage files to be distributed to local  bulletin boards and such.  If you could, please transport the appropriate text files along with the images.     It would also be nice if you'd send me a note when you did post images from OTIS to your local bbs.  I just want to keep track of them so participants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is.  It's the purpose of OTIS to get these images spread out as much as possible.  If you have the time, please upload a few to your favorite BBS system....or even just post this \\\"info-file\\\" there.  It would be keen of you.  --------------------------------------------------------------------  USE?  If you want to use any of the works you find on the OTIS directory, you'll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the  stipulations of the permission (such as free copy of publication, or full address credit).  You will either find this in the \\\".rm\\\" file for     the image or series of images...or in the \\\"Artists\\\" directory under the  Artists name.  If permission isn't explicitly given, then you'll have  to contact the artist to ask for it.  If no info is available, email me (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu), and I'll get in contact with the artist for  you, or give you their contact information.   When you DO use permitted work, it's always courteous to let the artist know about it, perhaps even send them a free copy or some such compensation for their files.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  NAMING IMAGES?  Please keep the names of your files in \\\"dos\\\" format.  That means, keep the filename (before .jpg or .gif) to eight characters or less.  The way I usually do it is to use the initials of the artist, plus a three or four digit \\\"code\\\" for the series of images, plus the series number. Thus, Leonardo DeVinci's fifth mechanical drawing would be something like:    ldmek5.gif     OR    ldmek5.jpg    OR    ldmech5.gif   ETC  Keeping the names under 8 characters assures that the filename will remain intact on all systems.     ----------------------------------------------------------------------   CREATING IMAGE FILES?  When creating image files, be sure to at least include your name somewhere on or below the picture.  This gives people a reference in case they'd like to contact you.  You may also want to include a title, address or other information you'd like people to know.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  HMMM?!  That's about it for now.  More \\\"guidelines\\\" will be added as needed. Your input is expected.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  DISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project has no connection to the Church of OTIS          (a sumerian deity) or it's followers, be they pope, priest,       or ezine administrator.  We do take sacrifices and donations       however.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  DISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project is here for the distribution of original         image files.  The files will go to the public at large.         It's possible, as with any form of mass-media, that someone       could unscrupulously use your images for financial gain.             Unless you've given permission for that, it's illegal.  OTIS       takes no responsibility for this.  In simple terms, all rights       revert to the author/artist.  To leave an image on OTIS is to        give permission for it to be viewed, copied and distributed        electronically.  If you don't want your images distributed            all-over, don't upload them.  To leave an image on OTIS is       NOT giving permission to have it used in any publication or       broadcast that incurs profit (this includes, but is not        limited to, magazines, newsletters, clip-art software,               screen-printed clothing, etc).

The critical information from the neuron is in the firing frequency (maximum about 100 action potentials per seconds), and not in the amplitude of the signal or in details of the signal shape. So the resolution of about 0.4 % you get with an 8 bit convertor is more then sufficient.  AC coupling does not have to be a problem either, since in many cases you are not interested in the DC level. My pre amplifier is AC coupled also. The critical point is the lowest frequency that will pass. If the cutoff point is to high, the action potentials will be slightly distorted.

Where did _that_ topic come from and what's it got to do with the discussion at hand? :-)  When I was discussing the concept of different criminal laws for crimes against different classes of people (and yes, I do consider laws which allow/mandate enhanced penalties following conviction based upon the convict's attitudes towards the class membership of the victim to fit into that category), the category of classes I had in mind was that of the standard civil rights discussion -- classes based upon race, gender, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, etc.  Having you ask about classes based upon one's _profession_ rather than one's personal characteristics caught me off guard, and I had to think out the question from scratch.  What I finally decided was that the law should not recognize such classes because to do so would be to formally and officially declare some people to be of more worth than others, and that would be anathema to the underlying American concept of equal treatment under the law.  Last year, when a federal crime bill was under consideration which would have expanded the federal death penalty to an additional fifty-plus crimes, including the murder of various federal officers hitherto not protected by that \\\"aura of deterrence,\\\" critics pointed out the absurdity of having laws which made the death penalty available for the murder of a federal postal inspector but not for ther murder of a civilian teacher, when the latter [arguably] provided a much more valueable service and therefore would be the greater loss to society. This was an emotionally compelling argument, but even the proponents of that viewpoint appeared to tacitly assume that the state should judge some lives as being more valuable than others on the basis of their \\\"contribution to society.\\\"  I view that doctrine as being both (a) personally repugnant and (b) repugnant to the Equal Protection clause of the 14th Amendment.  Accordingly, I believe that there should be no laws which give any profession-based class of people special protection (via the mechanism of supplying stronger statutory deterrence of crimes against members of that class), not even police officers, federal officers or high-ranking members of the Executive Branch of the federal government.\",\"[ Article crossposted from misc.forsale.computers.pc-clone ] [ Author was Mark Wilson ] [ Posted on Fri, 16 Apr 1993 13:18:42 GMT ]  UPDATE (\\\"for sale\\\" items): (All plus shipping)  1.

However, although baseball  has adjusted to the presence of black players, many Hispanic  players still labor under the stereotype of being \\\"fireballs,  hot blooded, flashy\\\".  The report also emphasised that despite  the rantings (my word) of Jessie Jackson about baseballs  discrimination against black players in its upper echelons,  baseball has actually done much better by black players than  Hispanic players.   Another interesting point was the language barrier problem.  The  reporter elaborated on an interview with Ruben Sierra which he  gave in Spanish to a Spanish speaking newspaper reporter with  the fact that there are maybe 2 major baseball writers that  speak Spanish, despite the fact that Spanish is one of (if not  the) easiest languages to learn, so easy that the author Cormac  McCarthy learned Spanish at age 50 in order to research his  book, _All The Pretty Horses_.  Yet, few MLB organizations  employ Spanish speaking personel, one of the exceptions being  the Oakland A's.   Another point:   Nearly 90% of Latin American players have some African blood.  Yet, most report that they'd never really felt black until  playing ball in the US.      Ironically enough, it is the early presence of Latin American  baseball players in the Major Leagues that support the idea that  baseball was integrated before the arrival of Jackie Robinson,  as many \\\"light black\\\" or \\\"brown\\\", Latin Americans were  incorporated into baseball.    /S\",\"Okay, I'm trying to install NCSA telnet on a couple (okay, a whole bunch) of machines.

Derek  -----------------------------------------------------------\",\" So in other words, if Roussel shuts out the Sharks and Soderstrom shuts out the Penguins, that's immaterial because it was the coaches decision? Come on, Joe, think about what you're saying! Who they played is VERY significant. Why they played them is what's irrelevent. A low GAA against good teams is better than a low GAA against bad teams in the context of comparing two goaltenders. A low GAA is better then a higher GAA. A low GAA against good teams is much, much better than a higher GAA against bad teams in the context of comparing two goaltenders.   YES IT DOES! Absolutely. **In the context of comparing two goaltenders**. Of course, at the end of the season 2 points is 2 points no matter how you get them. And on the score sheets shutouts are shutouts. But if you're a coach deciding between two goalies, or a GM looking to make a trade, you have got to look deeper than the stat sheets. I didn't see the second Toronto game, but the first one was a defensive masterpiece. There was nothing in that game to judge Tommy Soderstrom on because he wasn't tested. The same for Roussel in the Ranger game. Two real scoring chances, one he made a great play, the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player. If you were judging Roussel on that game alone, you have very little to go by.  But if you were to look at the 0-0 tie against the Habs, you saw a goalie stand on his head to get that shutout. THAT was a #1 goalie in action. Roussel doesn't have a game like that in him.   Don't be so sure of that. FLYERS management never says bad thing about Roussel, but they don't say too much on the good side either. I've seen at least two interviews where every time Farwell was asked how happy he was to have two good goaltenders, it was Tommy this, Tommy that, and oh, yeah, Dom has played well too.   FLYERS in the NHL Hall of Fame. Kinda dull, really. They handed out a team picture to everybody who walked in from Pizza Hut, but it was the same picture they sold in the programs in mid-season. Had names like Benning, Kasper...   Mostly random seat locations, some were given out by having certain autographs on the team photos. I don't like that method since I've seen guards help out people get things like Lindros pictures, surely if they got their hands on an autographed picture they'd hold 'em for their buddies.\",\"  Not necessarily, especially if the rapist is known as such.

But I couldn't resist. A personal weakness of mine. Jerkius Kneeus. Tragically incurable.   Not so; I can prove that the existance of God is disputable by showing that people dispute it; This is easy: I dispute that God exists. Simple.  I missed your \\\"Traditional Proofs\\\" treatise, but the proofs I remember from the Summa Theologic (the 5 ways I think it was) were rather poor stuff. The Ontological argument is about a billion times better, imho.  I would think you'd want non-traditional proofs, considering the general failure of the traditional proofs: at least the ones I know of. (I am thinking of the Ontological Argument, the Cosmological Argument and the Teleological argument. Those are the ones traditional enough to have funny names, anyway.)   This is the real question. So to discuss it, I'll assume God exists. Otherwise, there is no heavenly authority to babble about.   Please show this is the case. I am familiar with the First Cause argument, and I'll accept (for the sake of argument) that there is a First Cause, even though I find some of its premices questionable. The rest you'll have to show. This includes that the First Cause is God.   Got it. I deny that God is all good. So there.   This isn't self-consistent: if humans must renew the relationship, then God (incarnate or not) can't do it. Well, unless you think God is human. Granted, God made himself 'human', but this is nonetheless cheating: The intent of the statement is clearly that man has to fix the problem he caused. God fixing it- even by indirect means- contradicts this.   Why?  Also, why assume said claim is true anyway?  If *I* claim to be Truth, are you bound by reason to follow me?   :)  Undoubtably. Do you mean to imply we should all obey the commands of the Marines without question? You seem to imply this about God, and that the Marines are similar in this respect.. If this is not what you are trying to say, they please explain what it is you are saying, as I have missed it.   Why? Why not question it? Even if it *is* truth, we cannot know this certainly, so why is it so irrational to question? Perhaps we will thus discover that we were wrong.  You assert that God is Truth and we can't question Truth. But I assert that God is not Truth and anyway we can question Truth. How is it my assertion is less good than yours?   Oh?  I hereby deny 1+1=2.  I hope you'll agree 1+1=2 is the truth.  Granted, I look pretty damn silly saying something like that, but I needed something we'd both agree was clearly true.  Now, you'll notice no stormtroopers have marched in to drag me off to the gulag. No heaven lighting bolts either. No mysterious net outages. I seem to be permited to say such things, absurd or not.   They are certainly not true. At least, the ones Newton derived are not true, and are indeed wildly inaccurate at high speeds or small distances. We do not have a set of Laws of Physics that always works in all cases. If we did, Physics would be over already.  Science is all about Questioning this sort of truth. If we didn't, we'd still follow Aristotle. I'd generalize this a little more: If you want to learn anything new, you MUST question the things you Know (tm). Because you can always be wrong.   Even presupposing that Truth may not be Denied, and may not be Questioned, and that God is Truth, it only follows that God may not be Denied or Questioned. NOT that he must be obeyed!  We could unquestioningly DISobey him. How annoying of us. But you have not connected denial with disobedience.  ---    - Dan \\\"No Nickname\\\" Johnson And God said \\\"Jeeze, this is dull\\\"... and it *WAS* dull.

Why do atheists spend so much time paying attention to the bible, anyway?  Face it, there are better things to do with your life!

Heck, the Native Americans have signifigantly more interesting myths.  Also, what about the Egyptians.  I think we pay so much attention to Christianity because we accept it as a _religion_ and not a mythology, which I find more accurate.   I try to be tolerant.

About hard drive companies: the original 160 meg drive that was bad (bad sector or something) was an IBM.  The new one is a Quantum.  Is the LCIII supposed to be shipped with IBMs?  Is there a quality difference?  Apparently! :)  Second, about hard drive position.  I've put the LCIII on its side and the new 160 HD has had no problems at all.  I've even switched back and forth between horizontal and vertical and there are no problems.

Smith came out from behind his own net and fired a breakout pass that hit Fuhr in the back of the leg. Fuhr was backing up at the time and never saw what happened. The puck went straight off Fuhr's leg and into the net. Fuhr never had a chance. There was no play back to the goaltender, in fact Perry Berezan of Calgary had just dumped it in and Smith was retrieving it.   It was unfortunate that it happened; Smith is a nice guy and was only a rookie at the time, and on his birthday too. But all the blame lies with him. Starting in pee-wee coaches tell players never to make a cross-ice pass in front of  their own net. Too much chance of having it intercepted, or hitting the  goaltender, or whatever.  And to the people who say that Smith cost the Oilers the series, I can only say that he certainly didn't cause the team to lose the other three games. There was no reason for a powerhouse team like Edmonton to be tied late in the third period of the 7th game of the second round.

I have a IIsi that came with a Quantum 80 meg drive. When I ran into space problems, I slapped in another 40 meg quantum that I had sitting on a shelf. Here is what I did.   First off, I was concerned about space. Since both drives are Quantum quarter height drives, I finally decided that the logical place for them was stacked one upon the other. Fine, they fit snugly. (I have not had a problem with heat yet, and these drives have been running together for over two months.  The next problem was connecting the drive. If you have a spare internal hard disk power cable as I did, then half of your troubles are over. just splice in the extra cable so that you get one square motherboard connector and two hard disk power connectors. If you don't have a spare cable, you will have to buy the wires and connectors which can be found in any good electronics store for about $10. I would suggest properly soldering/heatshrinking the connections to reduce the possibility of shorts or bad connections.  Next, you need a ribbon cable connection. Again, I had a spare hard disk ribbon cable, and I wanted to be careful in case this didn't word so what I did was purchase a crimp on 50 pin cable connector that gave me another male connector in the middle of my spare cable. The part cost $10 again, and is easily attached with any good wood vice. The theory behind using a crimp on connector is that if this doesn't work, my original cable is not damaged, and I can go back to the original setup.  Having done all that, I couldn't be bothered to check the dev notes for power consumption so I plugged it in and it works like a charm to this day.   In a mac II, everything should work the same. Be careful with the ID's of the drive, and ensure that the terminating resistors on both drives are intact. I did not try this without the terminating resistors but it seemed logical that if I am splitting the SCSI chain, that the signal should be terminated at all the ends.  Let me know if you have any more questions.\",\" Oh great. Wonderful news. Nobody can listen in--except the feds.

One might find oneself, as I did in late 1986, anticipating expenses in the near term that require selling off holdings.  Given the choice between waiting a few weeks (and taking an extra tax hit) or selling in December with preferential tax treatment, only a fool would choose the former.  2) The fact that Brett can now construct _post hoc_ calculations of what would have been more beneficial to investors is in many respects beside the point.  There was plenty of _Money_-style advice given to unsophisticated investors in late 1986 to \\\"sell now and save on taxes.\\\"  In case anyone missed it, there was no shortage of similar advice late last year (in the NYTimes, e.g.), even though that advice was based not on the foregone conclusion of enacted law (as in 1986), but merely on the *assumption* that Clinton would raise tax rates (without capping CG taxes, contrary to the current proposal).  It's nice to think that investors always behave in their optimal economic interest.  Like assuming weightless ropes and frictionless pulleys, though, this sort of thinking often fails to describe accurately what happens in the real world.  \",\"   Not with a hub cap but one of those \\\"Lumber yard delivery trucks\\\" made life interesting when he hit a 'dip' in the road and several sheets of sheetrock and a dozen 5 gallon cans of spackle came off at 70 mph.

Oak Park also has an illegal handgun ban as well, but does allow those with a \\\"collectors FFL\\\" to possess (\\\"collectible?\\\") handguns.   Probably a fine in practical terms.   It wouldn't impede your defense at all. There was an actual incident in Oak Park where a gas station owner engaged in a shootout with a handgun; the grand jury decided not to presecute. On the other hand, a black man used an illegally owned handgun in Oak Park to defend himself, and the Village tried to make an example out of him. An NRA Director who lived there made a stink about this, and it was decided not to charge the guy. Of course, pissing off anti-gun police thugs has it's own drawbacks, like when the Oak Park Police Chief came to his house, and told him: \\\"this is stepping over the line; this could get dangerous for you.\\\" Whereupon the few black Oak Park police officers watched over his house to ensure that the white anti-gun police chief and his anti-gun cronies wouldn't f*ck with him, his home or family.

I have several friends at the Moscow Aviation Institute who have asked me to post this announcement.  (I have done some editing, but the contents is unchanged from the original announcement.)   For those of you not familiar with the Moscow Aviation Institute, it is the leading Russian school of higher education dedicated to the training of aircraft and spacecraft designers.  It specializes in airframe design, powerplant design, control systems, and power systems. Virtually all of the major former Soviet airframe designers (Tupolev, Su, Iluchine, Migoyan, etc.) were schooled at MAI.  I had the opportunity to tour the two museums that are maintained at MAI.  The aircraft include Mig23, Su 27, Yak 38, the cockpit of an F-111(!), among others.  It was a fascinating and eye opening experience, expecially given the fact that the museum was, until a year or so ago, closed to virtually everyone.  I also had the opportunity to see some of the experiments being conducted with plasma drive engines for future space craft use.  If you have any questions about the Institute, or the program, I would be glad to try and answer them.  The institute, and most of it's faculty have e-mail addresses.  However, it takes about a day or so for the receiver to get the message.  They are still a bit antiquated - but they are rapidly changing!

I hope somebody out here can help me.  I am currently working on a project where I am trying to communicate from an IBM 386 with Phoenix BIOS, using C++, to a board that I made with an Intel 8085 CPU with UART chip.  The board works fine with the TRANSMIT command and  Terminal Emulation mode of Kermit, but there seems to be something wrong with the initialization or protocol used when I try C++.  I need to access the unit I built using C, because I have a sizable chunk of C code that I will be using to perform calculations and operations that will be very difficult to code in assembly language for the 8085.  I have included the assembly code that I am running and the C++ code that I am trying to use.  If anyone can show me something that I am doing blatantly incorrectly or that I am missing because of my lack of knowledge about RS-232 serial communications, please e-mail me. I wrote the assembly language to wait for a character to be received and then to check it against the 0x20 character, if a 0x20 is received,  the LEDs will indicate this.  Two C++ programs that I have written do nothing, but set up COM port 2 and send the 0x20 character.  One uses the bioscom() function in bios.h the other uses the software interrupt int86() function in dos.h.

But there would be no _net_ _positive_ effect. You also have to  consider the negative side: Law abiding citizens, armed with  fireamrs (pistols for the most part), prevent between 80,000 (National Crime Survey) and 1,000,000 (Dr. Kleck) crimes each year. (Those are the extremes. Most studies find the number to be 500,000 to 600,000.) About 1% of those crimes are homicides, so private ownership of firearms _saves_ approximately 5,000 lives each year. There are roughly 12,000 criminal homicides and fatal accidents involving guns each year. For there to  be any net benefit, you would have to show that gun control measures would disarm over 40% of the criminals currently using guns. That would be very hard to do: According the the federal BATF, only 8% of criminals buy their guns over the counter. Since gun control laws, by their very nature, only effect legal sales, such a law would remove all the benefits of armed, law-abiding citizens while having only a minimal effect on armed criminals (who, by and large, get their guns illegally.)  That doesn't sound like a net benefit to me.     Since most were with licensed weapons, I assume you are not supporting \\\"reasonable\\\" laws (i.e. waiting periods, background checks, licenses, etc...). Since only a complete ban would  alter the statistic you refer to, I assume that's what you are supporting.  By the way, 1135 people dies in 1986 from falling down stairs. 250 accidental handgun deaths isn't significant next to  other household accidents.   1080 children under the age of 10 died by drowning, 69 from  drinking poisonous household chemicals (like Drano), 139 from falls. If the real goal is to reduce the tragic, accidental deaths of children, wouldn't a ban on drain cleaners be a  better palce to start? (Or, perhaps, restricting ownership to professionals like plumbers?)   While you might call it \\\"emphasis\\\", refering to completely two statistics in the same sentence _implies_ a comparison. If it isn't valid, and you put the numbers together to convince people you are right, the kindest thing I could call it is propaganda.\",\"Reported yesterday in the Washington Post (Kathy Sawyer, writer):  The article plays down the Russian role in US space.  Gibbons (science advisor to Clinton) sent Goldin a letter indicating NASA should not limit redesign options to those compatible with Mir orbit.  The White House thinks expectations for Russian cooperation have been raised too high.  The article reports that some think the spending and schedule limits for space station are so stringent that the redesign is nearly impossible.  That's why some think Goldin has begun looking at  Russian hardware.  Goldin states NASA will present all options to the administration  which will then have decision making power.

Their cheer quickly turned into a roar, and finally, the sellout crowd of 17,816 rose as one to rock the old barn at 5700 Oakland Avenue in a salute to the playoff-bound Blues.  The scoreboard had just flashed the news from Detroit -- Red Wings 5, Stars 3. With the North Stars' loss, the Blues officially clinched fourth place and the final playoff spot in the Norris Division. Good thing, because the Blues quit playing.  They held a 5-1 lead over Tampa Bay when the Detroit-Minnesota final appeared with 3 minutes 52 remaining in the second period. They promptly went to sleep and barely held on for a 6-5 victory that nearly slipped away at the buzzer. Tampa's Bob Beers tipped in a pass from Shawn Chambers, but officiating supervisor John D'Amico and video goal judge Rich Schweigler ruled that the shot had gone into the net after time had expired.  ``I'm glad I didn't see it go in at the end,\\\" Blues coach Bob Berry said.  If the goal had counted, he'd have been more upset than he was by the Blues' disappearance in the final 24 minutes. Holding on for the victory and making the playoffs tempered Berry's anger.  ``It wasn't pretty at the end,\\\" he said. ``We played 36, 37 great minutes, as good as we played all year. It slipped away at the end. It shouldn't have, but it did.\\\"  Still, the Blues won, prompting another ovation from the crowd at game's end. Despite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil this season, the Blues still made the playoffs. They'll meet the Chicago Blackhawks in a best-of-seven Norris Division semifinal, beginning at noon Sunday at Chicago Stadium.  The Blues finished the regular-season with a record of 37-36-11 for 85 points, their fourth consecutive plus-.500 season. Minnesota finished three points behind in fifth place, with a record of 36-38- 10 for 82 points. Tampa Bay, which played spoiler last week by tying the Blues 2-2 at Tampa, ended its first season with a record of 23-54-7 for 53 points.  The poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyous Blues locker room. Instead, the mood was one of relief and some disappointment.  ``It's a shame we let down,\\\" said Kevin Miller, one of three Blues to score two goals. Brendan Shanahan and Bob Bassen were the others. ``There was no need for a letdown. If we'd have kept working, it would have ended 6-2 and everyone would be happy.\\\"  Instead, a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs. ``We won, and that's all that matters,\\\" said Brett Hull, scoreless and minus-3 for the night. ``Once we got up 4-0, it was really tough to play.\\\"  Some players didn't have a problem.  ``Just because the score was announced, our line didn't quit,\\\" said Rich Sutter, who played with Bassen and Miller. ``We still had a game to play. You can't allow five goals like we did, that's not right.  ``It was disappointing to see what was going on.\\\"  Bassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the Blues' effort. Somehow, he missed the announcement of Minnesota's loss.  ``I didn't know it was final,\\\" he said. ``I was kind of looking around on the bench. I didn't realize it was a final for some reason. We're in the playoffs, and that's great, but it's a little disappointing to play like we did at the end.\\\"  The letdown was precisely the reason that Berry had instructed the scoreboard operators to keep the Minnesota-Detroit score off of the board. The score showed 0-0 until it first popped up with Detroit leading 4-2 in the third period. The Blues already led 4-0 at the time.  ``I told them I didn't want to see the score, I didn't want to know the score,\\\" Berry said. ``I felt we had to win the game, and that's the approach we took.\\\"  If Minnesota took a lead, Berry feared, the pressure of having to win might bother the Blues. If Detroit led, he worried, the Blues might quit.  Until the announcement, the Blues played splendidly. Shanahan got the crowd going at 10:44 of the first period, scoring his 50th of the season. Then, Miller and Bassen took charge late in the period.  With the teams playing four on four, Miller broke in on left wing, deked defenseman Roman Hamrlik and beat former Blues goalie Pat Jablonski with the rebound of his own shot with 21.6 seconds remaining in the period.  Then, just 10.5 seconds later, Bassen rifled a long slap shot past Jablonski after defenseman Rick Zombo intercepted a Tampa pass in the neutral zone.  Bassen made it 4-0 just 14 seconds into the second period, scoring on the  rebound of Bret Hedican's shot. The goal gave him his first two-goal game of the season and reminded him of a special friend.  Last year, Bassen befriended young Oliver Mulvihill, who died of a rare form of cancer at age 6 on Feb. 23.  ``I was thinking of my buddy Oliver,\\\" Bassen said. ``He's in heaven now, and I know he was watching. I know he's happy.\\\"  Miller increased the Blues lead to 5-0 on a break-away goal set up by Zombo at 11:09. Then, Steve Maltais broke Curtis Joseph's shutout just 18 seconds later, making it 5-1.  Less than a minute after the North Stars' final was announced, Tim Bergland scored and cut the lead to 5-2. But Shanahan scored his 51st, converting a pass from Nelson Emerson with 21.3 seconds remaining in the  second period.  Then, it was all Lightning. Adam Creighton scored 40 seconds into the third period, prompting Berry to rest the overworked Joseph. Guy Hebert allowed goals to Shawn Chambers and Danton Cole in a span of 1:21 midway through the third period.  The goals by Chambers and Cole made Shanahan's second goal stand up as the winner. ``We were in there,\\\" Shanahan said. ``The game was over. We were in.\\\"\",\" We're probably stuck, as Mike Burger pointed out that the baseball deal was made far in advance of the NHL contract.  WABC did the same thing; they were thankful that the Devils were wiped out by 9:30, because they had to switch over to Yankees baseball.  The proof of  the reasons for this is left to the reader ...  It's too bad, but I wonder if ESPN is stuck with other US local team coverage for their alternate games?  We got NESN's coverage of the Bruins-Sabres with the Boston homers ... they were awful!!!  I've read that Derek Sanderson is the colour analyst ... I wonder if he spent his early years after hockey as an intern at PRAVDA before landing this job?  *Everything* had to be twisted into something good to say about the Bruin(s) involved ... not even Bill Wirtz's shills on SC Chicago (Pat Foley, Dale Tallon) were this bad.  And just to be fair, SC used to take their feed from ESN (Empire Sports Network), the Sabre homers and they were horrible too ... but they were spacy.  From the CNN highlights, I hear Chris Cuthbert's voice from the CBC coverage of the Habs-Nords series.  Too bad that we couldn't get it on ESPN, with all due respect to the Sabres and the Bruins.  Mike Emrick is substituting on the Devils SCNY team for Gary Thorne. Mike was the original Devils TV play-by-play announcer, by the way.  gld\",\" There was an interesting column on the editorial page of the Dallas Morning News on Saturday by Walter Williams, who I believe is a professor at Georgetown (I wonder if he knows of Dorothy \\\"you're not in Kansas anymore\\\" Denning).  The article was titled \\\"Government slowly eroding our liberties\\\", and in it he tells a story attributed to the late Leonard Read who          explained that if you wanted to take liberty away from         Americans, you had to know how to cook a frog.  Mr. Read         said you can't cook a frog by boiling a pot of water and         then throwing the frog in.  His reflexes are so quick that         as soon as his feet touch the water, he will leap away.         You must put the frog in a pot of cold water and heat it         up bit by bit.  By the time the frog realizes he's being         cooked, it is too late.  It is the same with Americans.         If anyone tried to take our freedoms all at once, we         would naturally rebel and suppress the tyrant.  But as         with successful frog cooking, our liberties can be taken         a little bit at a time.  The last line of the article says, \\\"It's not too late for us, but the water is getting pretty warm.\\\"  I'd have toagree that it's warm and the Clipper is keeping the temperature on an upward course.

The amounts of methanol formed from the ingestion of aspartame-containing foods are completely in the metabolic noise, since you're forming equally minute amounts of methanol from other components of food all the time.  In studies involving administration of high doses of the additive, blood methanol levels were undetectable. Methanol is a poison only in quantities seen in human poisonings, say 5ml and above.  This is a consequence of its oxidation to formaldehyde and formic acid, two quite reactive compounds which at high enough levels can damage tissues like the retina and kidney, because at such high doses the body's detoxification system is overwhelmed.  Interestingly, one treatment for early methanol poisoning is to get the person drunk on ethyl alcohol--vodka or an equivalent.  That's because ethanol is metabolized preferentially over methanol by the enzymes in the liver. If the methanol stays as methanol and isn't metabolized to formaldehyde, it is actually relatively non-toxic. \",\" He is probably referring to the DOS version.. the dos versions is up to like version 6 i think.

Biblical teaching expects us to celebrate the resurrection of Christ not once a year but every time someone is baptized.  Col. 2:12-Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead.\\\"  Rom. 6:4-Therefore we are buried with him in baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.\\\" Those really want to celebrate the resurrection should by faith walk in newness of life after baptism.  It is not necessary to celebrate a pagan goddess in the process.  Paul answered your question in Romans 9.  In v. 4 he stated that the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the service of God, and the promises were given to the Israelites.  It is a package deal.  He goes on to identify those who are true Israelites.  Vs 6-8 makes it plain that the true Israelites are not those who are born that way but those who accept the promise of God.  Paul continued to emphasize that he was an Israelite in 2 Cor. 11:22, then in Gal 3:29 he says that all those who belong to Christ are Abraham's seed, and heirs to all the promises given to the Israelites.  The promises come with the law.  It is all or nothing.  Why is it that you only want to discard one part of the law?  Certainly you would want your husband to be faithful to you.  Or do you believe that adultery is no longer forbidden?  Same law.  BTW  please give a reference for your statement that the Gentiles are only required to observe the basis commandmants.  Could you list those please.

James 1:19 \\\"My dear brothers, take note of this:  Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry,\\\"\",\"Two LH Research SM11-1 power supplies (SM10 series).  1000W, 5V, 200A (currently wired for 115VAC)  Control lines: +/- sense, on/off, pwr.fail, high/low margin, and current monitor.

I have an ATI ultra + w/2Meg which I have tried in each of the video modes, I have excluded the region of video memory from A000-C800 segments from the use of emm386, have tried adjusting the swap partion from large to nonexistant (to prevent swapping) and I have REM'd ALL TSR's and utilities in config.syus and autoexec, and even tried using the default program manager, disabling my HP dashboard.  even with a minimal system, no swap, no smartdrv, no TSR's, no windows utilities and exclusion of video regions it still locks up completely (no mouse control, no response to anything except 3finger salute, and even that does not stop by the standard windows screen, but simply does a full reset immediately).  Just about out of ideas, anyone out there have any????  Thanks tom branham branham@binah.cc.brandeis.edu \",\" Jim, please, that's a lame explanation of the trinity that Jesus provides above.

 Not to pick on Mr. May in particular, of course, but isn't this kind of the domino theory? When one little country falls, its neighbor will surely follow, and before you know it, we're all mining salt in Siberia for not turning in our Captain Crunch Secret Decoder Rings.   Surely the hypothesis relying on the least wild assumptions is to take this at face value. Our lads at the fort were asked to cook up something that's pretty secure, with a key that can be escrowed neatly, and they did. The government plans to sell this thing, for the reasons they state. Yes, those evil guys in the FBI can probably, with some effort, abuse the system. I got news for you, if the evil guys in the FBI decide they want to persecute you, they're gonna, and you're gonna hate it. Fact is, the FBI doesn't want to listen to your phone calls, and if they do, and if you're using triple-DES, they'll just get a parabolic microphone and point it at your head.   This is pretty clearly an effort by the government to do exactly what they're saying they're doing. As is typical with governments, it's mismanaged, and full of holes and compromises. As is typical with our government, it's not too bad, could be worse.   My interpretation.

The bars are about 1-inch wide. Other than this, the demo (the   animation part) seems to be running fine.  Second problem: I can't find any graphics program that will open and display   these files.

Any suggestions?\",\" While I don't read normally read this group, I was looking for Valentine radar information (sigh, maybe in the FAQ) and came across your posting..  I bought a '93 Probe GT with the PEP 263A last July (now at 9500 miles) after debating over the Sentra SE-R/NX2000, MX6, MR-2, Stealth, Prelude,  and Celica.  Check this month's Consumer Reports for previous Probe records.    My criteria: a \\\"fun\\\" car with ABS, airbag, over 130hp, and less than $25K. I thought about a turbo, but checking with insurance people ruled that out. The Tri-Star cars (Eclipse/Talon/etc) were out since they don't have an air bag. Ditto for the Mustang(also no ABS). The SE-R/NX2000/M20 fell into the pocket-rocket category.  A good used car buy. The MX-6 was almost there but rolled more than I liked.   I didn't like the Prelude dash/instrumentation at all.  Too weird for me. The MR2 has a much smaller non-passenger space than I needed, so out that went. The Celica was \\\"ok\\\" but underpowered when loaded with options (and somewhat overpriced too) in non-turbo form. I never considered the 240SX since it didn't have an airbag.  I did look at it for its RWD virtues but that's it.  The Corolla never entered my mind. I should have looked at the Mitsubishi VR4/Dodge Stealth more. Since my list was exhausted, I bought the Probe.  :-)  The car design is different than earlier years, so it's too early to see its reliability so far.  For what it's worth, my comments:  My dislikes: Shutting door with windows up from inside rarely makes good wind seal. Headlights have \\\"stuck\\\" up a few times (weather?) air conditioning broke ~4000 miles (pressure cycling switch) condensation around rear washer fluid container doesn't drain completely. crammed engine; little hope for do-it-yourselfers (typical) parts somewhat more expensive than normal Ford parts underside plastic doesn't like sharp driveways and speedbumps (typical). assembly gripes: tape on radiator, screw fell out of dash, seat seams not  stitched properly.  Hopefully just a fluke. Ford only gives 1 key with the car.  C'mon Ford, spend an extra few pennies! Rear hatch has no padding on corners when up.  I'm waiting for the day when I bash my head on the corner. horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center (personal preference) Tires fling dirt/mud onto side of car   My Likes: engine (design/valves/sounds/smoothness/power/mileage/torque) -- definitely #1 handling (very good for FWD; understeer only at limits) transmission (the 5 speed is a must) usable instrumentation (lovely readable analog everywhere) Very little torque steer at full power (much better than the '90 SHO I drive) stability at 100+mph (high gearing though) low cowl (good visibility in front) Heated outside mirrors (nice in fog, never tested in freezing weather) ABS/Air bag (see above) rear seats fold down (I have few rear seat passengers so a trunk not important) No shake/rattle noises when going over bumps/potholes (still!) Tires: 225/55VR16 Goodyear Eagles (70% left; hoping for 30K :-)  As you can see, I'm primarily interested in the engine.  While it doesn't have the uummmph of a big-liter car or the turbo rush, the big selling point for me was the all-aluminum 24 value 2.5 liter engine.    The overall car is a good buy for the money.  That market segment hasn't changed much since July (Prelude VTEC, Honda Del Sol??).  I drive it to and from work each day on relatively smooth roads, and most noticable thing is that the Probe's suspension doesn't like potholes.  When you test drive one, find a  potholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is tolerable. If you have 3+ passengers, by all means bring them along too.  They'll find that they have no room in the back and you'll find that the car rides differently (if that's \\\"better\\\" is up to you).  Also, there's a lot of glass around you which I wasn't expecting; the temperature inside the car gets pretty hot in the summer.  My back seat passengers (now very few) complain about the lack of ventilation; you may want to consider that when combined with the heat.  I've heard that the exhaust system has trouble, but mine works fine. Leather and the keyless entry system weren't available when I got the car so I can't comment on them (I got the car before it was officially announced).   I prefer cloth to leather anyway.    I wouldn't want this car in the snow:  The suspension is too rough for the inevitable surprise potholes, tires aren't meant for snow, and the seats assume that you're not wearing lots of thick clothing.  Rain is much better:  water  generally beads off the windshield at freeway speed, the windshield wiper controls are easy and understandable, and I barely hydroplaned once with the Eagles (and I was really trying).   There is also a definite lack of cup holder/small storage places.  The GT has map holders below the speakers in the door, but they're rigid plastic that could fit two cassettes or CD's max.  The center console/storage bin/arm rest has *1* cup holder and the back of the front seats have a cloth \\\"pouch\\\" but that's it.  No change holders.  Quite a let-down from the SHO. And the Probe is definitely not a people-mover car or an econo-box car!  Lastly, don't store wet car covers in the back.  The foam will soak the  water up and the result will *not* smell pleasant :-(.  Nathan nathan@sco.com   \",\": >Is there an ftp site where I can get the MS speaker sound driver?

These are indeed provocative questions but they are asked time and again by people around me.  1.      Is it true that many arab countries don't recognize Israeli nationality ?  That people with Israeli stamps on their passports can't enter arabic countries?  2.      Is it true that arabic countries such as Jordan and Syria have undefined borders and that arab governments from 1948 until today have refused to state where the ultimate borders of their states should be?  3.      Is it true that arab countires refused to sign the Chemical weapon convention treaty in Paris in 1993?  4.      Is it true that in arab prisons there are a number of individuals which were tried in secret and for which their identities, the date of their trial and their imprisonment are state secrets ?  4a. Is it true that some arab countries, like Syria, harbor Nazi war criminals, and refuse to extradite them?  4b. Is it true that some arab countries, like Saudi Arabia, prohibit women from driving cars?  5.      Is it true that Jews who reside in the Muslim countries are subject to different laws than Muslims?  6.      Is it true that arab countries confiscated the property of entire Jewish communites forced to flee by anti-Jewish riots?  7.      Is it true that Israel's Prime Minister, Y. Rabin, signed a chemical weapons treaty that no arab nation was willing to sign?  8.      Is it true that Syrian Jews are required to leave a $10,000 deposit before leaving the country, and are no longer allowed to emmigrate, despite promises made by Hafez Assad to George Bush?  9.  Is it true that Jews in Muslim lands are required to pay a special tax, for being Jews?  10.     Is it true that Intercontinental Hotel in Jerusalem was built on a Jewish cemetary, with roads being paved over grave sites, and gravestones being used in Jordanian latrines?  11. Is it really cheesy and inappropriate to post lists of biased leading questions?  11a. Is it less appropriate if information implied in Mr. Davidsson's questions is highly misleading?

Also the Mets (my other least  favorite team) loss to the Rockies made this this a great day and a  great start to the weekend as the Cardinals are on the ESPN tonight.  Big Lee Smith is having a great start and the Cardinals seem to be hitting in the clutch even though they have had a few games with lots of hits and not many runs.  Hopefully with the coaches stress on situational hitting in spring training, the runners LOB will be lower this year (probably due to the high strikeout numbers by Jose and Lankford and Zeile's off year).  I don't know why all the fuss about the Fillies.  The media and all the  Filly fans on r.s.b forget who is right behind them in the standings.   Give the Wild Thing a week or two before he starts blowing some games  and we'll see who is in first then.

I've weathered attempted dog attacks before using the approved method: Slow down to screw up dog's triangulation of target, then take off and laugh at the dog, now far behind you. This time, it didn't work because I didn't have time. Riding up the hill leading to my house, I encountered a liver-and-white Springer Spaniel (no relation to the Springer Softail, or the Springer Spagthorpe, a close relation to the Spagthorpe Viking). Actually, the dog encountered me with intent to harm.  But I digress: I was riding near the (unpainted) centerline of the roughly 30-foot wide road, doing between forty and sixty clicks (30 mph for the velocity-impaired). The dog shot at me from behind bushes on the left side of the road at an impossibly high speed. I later learned he had been accelerating from the front porch, about thirty feet away, heading down the very gently sloped approach to the side of the road. I saw the dog, and before you could say SIPDE, he was on me. Boom! I took the dog in the left leg, and from the marks on the bike my leg was driven up the side of the bike with considerable force, making permanent marks on the plastic parts of the bike, and cracking one panel. I think I saw the dog spin around when I looked back, but my memory of this moment is hazy.  I next turned around, and picked the most likely looking house. The apologetic woman explained that the dog was not seriously hurt (cut mouth) and hoped I was not hurt either. I could feel the pain in my shin, and expected a cool purple welt to form soon. Sadly, it has not. So I'm left with a tender shin, and no cool battle scars!  Interestingly, the one thing that never happened was that the bike never moved off course. The not inconsiderable impact did not push the bike off course, nor did it cause me to put the bike out of control from some gut reaction to the sudden impact. Delayed pain may have helped me here, as I didn't feel a sudden sharp pain that I can remember.  What worries me about the accident is this: I don't think I could have prevented it except by traveling much slower than I was. This is not necessarily an unreasonable suggestion for a residential area, but I was riding around the speed limit. I worry about what would have happened if it had been a car instead of a dog, but I console myself with the thought that it would take a truly insane BDI cager to whip out of a blind driveway at 15-30 mph. For that matter, how many driveways are long enough for a car to hit 30 mph by the end?  I eagerly await comment.

I think it's just 12 games into the season myself, so I'm going to wait a bit before calling names.   I expect that Dave Otto will be a really bad pitcher, and I have no idea why Simmons ever wanted him.  On the other hand, I expect him to release Otto if he doesn't turn things around pretty fast.  (BTW, Otto's game score for that 0 IP stinker was only 22, which points out a problem with the method since Otto's performance was infinitely bad, and excruciatingly prolonged.)   I think Merced's rookie year was a bit flukey, but aren't you willing to give him some more at bats (and Tomlin a few more starts) before acting so gloomy?   No he didn't.  Walk is a time bomb.  He has no stuff whatsoever, and when the league finally realizes this, it won't be pretty at all.   Don't be so fast.  Doughty is the guy who signed Steve Buechele, which was a move that threatened to bury Kevin Young in the minors. Meanwhile, I'm not sure whether Doughty or Simmons signed Martin as a six-year free agent before the 1992 season.   Twice through the rotation, and you've given up?  Yikes.   But so has his age, at least in baseball terms.  The useful half-life of a 34- year-old injury-prone catcher can't be much longer than a year.   But he wanted to be a Dodger, and felt he had something to prove after his disastrous 1992.  I don't think there was any chance for the Bucs to sign him.   He certainly wasn't last year.   Hey, that's the \\\"Skates Smith\\\" package deal.  Anybody who acquires Lonnie for his defense or base-running (particularly at this stage) is a real weirdo.   If that's the goal of the team ownership, than I don't see why Sauer gets a zero for making his boss happy.  I don't know what he has or hasn't said about revenue sharing, so I can't comment there.   It's annoying, but since Leyland seems to have been pushing for them to retain Jeff King, it was probably unavoidable.  Meanwhile, I think bigger accomplishments of Simmons' tenure were getting some value for John Smiley, not trading real prospects for veterans down the stretch last year, drafting well in 1992, letting the rookies show something in 1993.  Foley, Smith, and Candelaria were acquired to be replacement parts, which means that even if fail it hasn't done serious damage to the Bucs' future.   Does this mean that the Bucs lost the initial arbitration case?  I never heard the outcome of this.  When will the final verdict be in on this?   I'm not sure who was the idiot in this case, so I don't know who to blame.  It might have been Doug Danforth, after all.  In fact, I *seriously* suspect it was Doug Danforth, who has shown his willingness to call the shots at exactly those moments when the gun is pointed at his feet.

On April 19, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer (MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.  2.  On April 19, a Command Detector Unit Signal-to-Noise Ratio (CDUSNR) test and a Radio Frequency Subsystem Automatic Gain Control (RFSAGC) test were performed using the LGA-1 (Low Gain Antenna #1) over DSS-63 (Madrid 70 meter antenna) and DSS-61 (Madrid 34 meter antenna), respectively.  Data analysis is in process.  These tests are periodically performed to provide detailed information relative to the telecom command hardware integrity.  3.  On April 19, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to 264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.  4.  On April 21, the first of two suppressed carrier/DSN (Deep Space Network) advanced receiver characterization tests was performed over DSS-14 (Goldstone 70 meter antenna).  The spacecraft modulation index was varied from 43 degrees to 90 degrees for a range of ground receiver bandwidth settings.  5.  The AC bus imbalance measurement has not exhibited significant change (greater than 25 DN) throughout this period but the DC bus imbalance measurement has.  The AC measurement reads 20 DN (4.5 volts).  The DC measurement has ranged from 43 DN (4.6 volts) to 138 DN (16.2 volts) and currently reads 138 DN (16.2 volts).  These measurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special anomaly team.  6.  The Spacecraft status as of April 22, 1993, is as follows:         a)  System Power Margin -  68 watts        b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin        c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner        d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 21 degrees            off-sun (lagging) and 5 degrees off-earth (leading)        e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1        f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within            acceptable range        g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range        h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,            EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS        i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within            acceptable range        j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours            Time To Initiation - 184 hours   TRAJECTORY       As of noon Thursday, April 22, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory status was as follows:   Distance from Earth         169,747,800 km (1.14 AU)  Distance from Sun           286,967,900 km (1.92 AU)  Heliocentric Speed          91,200 km per hour  Distance from Jupiter       532,735,900 km  Round Trip Light Time       18 minutes, 58 seconds   SPECIAL TOPIC\",\"As the subject suggests the Flames were not impressive this afternoon, dropping a 6-3 decision to the LA Kings. Most of the Flames neglected to show up, especially in their own zone, as the Kings hit at least five posts! The Flames best line was probably Skrudland-Paslawski-Berube (which tells how bad the Flames were). Gary Suter scored a great goal (in fact all three Flame goals were scored by D-men - Yawney and Dahlquist getting the others), but also made some bonehead plays. For the Kings, Pat Conacher was especially impressive.   The games was VERY chippy, as Dan Mirouelli lost control early and never recovered it; there were high-sticks, cross-checks, punches, hits from behind. Fleury got a game misconduct for rubbing out Warren Rychel from behind. Flames dominated the game physically, but failed to take advantage due to horrendous defensive lapses (I don't think Vernon can be blamed for any of the goals). Calgary went with 7 D-men, as Roger Johansson played LW; he looked lost IMHO - I hope King inserts Chris Lindbergh, Paul Kruse, or Sergei Makarov for Wednesday's game. Gretzky left the game in the 2nd period with a charley-horse; no idea how serious - he didn't return.

A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on      encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify      as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have      briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the      decisions related to this initiative.  Congress??  So we're playing politics before we talk to CPSR, academia, the public, internet users?  I`ve heard of top-down design, but top-down  democracy??

A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be      considered during the broad policy review. [...bs about      the wonderfulness of the key escrow system...]       The Administration is not saying, \\\"since encryption      threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,      we will prohibit it outright\\\" (as some countries have      effectively done);   They'll just provide an easily-compromised version to JQ Public.                           nor is the U.S. saying that \\\"every      American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an      unbreakable commercial encryption product.\\\"    Maybe we need a CRA -- Cryptographic Rights Amendment.

According -> > to the Federalist Paper's, a well regulated militia has a well defined  -> > structure and follows nationally uniform regulations. ->  -> Perhaps you should actually READ the Federalist Papers!!  Perhaps you should, reread Federal 29 which deals exclusively with the \\\"well regulated malitia.\\\"  Here is what is says about its character:    To oblige the great body of the yeomanry, and of the other classes   of the citizens, to be under arms for the purpose of going through   military exercises and evolutions, as often as might be necessary to   acquire the degree of perfection which would entitle them to the   character of a well-regulated militia,   It also talks about the \\\"well regulated militia\\\" having a nationally uniform in structure and disipline.    I will note you did quote the end of this particular paragraph which states:       Little more can reasonably be aimed at, with  respect to the people at large, than to have them properly armed  and equipped; and in order to see that this be not neglected, it  will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of  a year.  But, do you knew how much organization is required to training a large group of poeple twice a year.  Just to try to get the same people every year, provide a basic training to new people so they can be integrated into the force, and find a suitable location, it  requires a continually standing committee of organizers.    Since a well regulate militia is nationally uniform in structure and disipline, and meet once or twice a year to train, how can you claim a \\\"well regulated militia\\\" is not well organized.  But I will concide  a \\\"well organized militia\\\" is not necessarily a \\\"well regulated militia.\\\"   Several people have stated that the \\\"well organized militia\\\" is what is defined under 10 USC 311, which states   The militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied   males at least 17 years of age and, except as provided in   section 313 of title 32, under 45 years of age who are,   or who have made a declaration of intention to become,   citizens of the United States and of female citizents of   the United States who are commissioned officers of the   National Guard.  This deos define the militia, but were is the adjective \\\"well regulated.\\\" 10 USC 311 does not define a \\\"well regualed militia\\\" in any way, shape,  or form.  It only defines who can become part of a well regulated militia The Federalist Papers CLEARLY define the \\\"well regualed militia\\\" as a proper SUBSET of the militia.  In the same paragraph quoted above, it talk above \\\"disciplining all the militia of the United States\\\" so they fit the \\\"character of a well-regulated militia.\\\"  This is what the paragraph states about the associated costs:   It would form an annual deduction from the productive labor   of the country, to an amount which, calculating upon the   present numbers of the people, would not fall far short   of the whole expense of the civil  establishments of all   the States. To attempt a thing which would abridge the   mass of labor and industry to so considerable an extent,  would be unwise: and the experiment, if made, could not   succeed, because it would not long be endured.   Another quote provide by Charles Scripter is: James Madison, Federalist Paper 41 (regarding the \\\"General Welfare\\\" clause):   \\\"Nothing is more natural nor common than first  to use a general phrase, and then to explain and qualify it by a  recital of particulars.\\\"  So the phrase \\\"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall  not be infringed\\\" must either qualify or explain the phrase \\\"a well  regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state.\\\"   The definition of \\\"explain\\\" as stated in \\\"The American Hertitage Dictionary of the Enlish Language\\\" The New College Edition, 1982 is:  1) To make plain or comprehensible; remove obscruity from;     elucidate: \\\"It was the economists who undertook to explain      this puzzle\\\"  2) To define; explicate; expound: He explained his plan.  3) To offer reasons for or a cause of; an answer for' justify:     explain an error The second phrase clearly does not \\\"explain\\\" the first, therefore the second phrase must \\\"qualify\\\" the first.  The definition given for \\\"qualify\\\" is:  1) To describe by enumerating the characteristics or qualities     of; characterize.  2) To make competent or suitable for office, position, or      task.  3) To give legal power to; make legally capable.  4) To modify, limit, or restrict, as giving exceptions.  5) To make less harsh or severe; moderate  6) Grammar: To modify the meaning of (a word or phrase) Since \\\"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed\\\" does not describe, modify or make less harsh anything and it has nothing to do with grammar or some sort of position or task. By process of elimination it must fall into definition #3.  And since #3 deals with legal power, the same thing the Constitution does, it must be the correct definition in this case.  Therefore, \\\"the right  of the people to keep and bear Arms\\\" gives legal power to the \\\"well  regualated militia\\\" and this legal power \\\"shall not be infringed\\\".    I thank you very much Mr Scripter, you have provided me with more  evidence that the Second Amendment only concerns itseft with the  people's right to form well regulate militia, and says very little  about the right of an untrained person to \\\"keep and bear\\\" a .50 caliber machine gun.  And since I, totally untrained in the use of any firearm (something I personly have meant to correct by going to a NRA gun safety course and joining a gun club), cannot legally buy such a machine gun, I conclude the courts and democraticly elected congress agree with me.  -> So now we know which category Mr. Rutledge is in; He means to destroy -> our Liberties and Rights.  I mean \\\"to destory our Liberties and Rights.\\\"  Is that why a participate in the discussion of exactly what \\\"our Libertues and Rights\\\" are?

But Galley thinks he's Paul Coffey (puts scoring ahead of defending) and Fedyk has tailed off big time.  Eklund: Was a big question mark this year and was coming off injuries. 42 points in 49 games is not bad at all, and recently he's been a huge factor in the wins they've gotten. Eklund has never had a point a game season in his career, his production is very typical for him. How does he qualify as a disappointment? If anything he's a surprise.  My choice would be Roussel if I went strictly by what was expected of players, but I never thought that he had what it takes to be a #1 goalie. My biggest disappointment is Bill Dineen.

Give a man a fishing rod, and he'll laze around fishing and never do anything.\\\"  With that in mind, I reprint (without permission, so sue me) relevant information posted some years ago on this very problem.  Note the early use of PostScript technology, predating many of this year's papers listed in the April 1st SIGGRAPH Program Announcement posted here a few days ago.  -- Eric   Intersection Between a Line and a Polygon (UNDECIDABLE??),  by Dave Baraff, Tom Duff   From: deb@charisma.graphics.cornell.edu  Newsgroups: comp.graphics  Keywords: P, NP, Jordan curve separation, Ursyhon Metrization Theorem  Organization: Program of Computer Graphics   I think that this is a very difficult problem.  To start with, lines and polygons are semi-algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of points.  Here are a few off-the-cuff ideas.  First, we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated.  Now, the Jordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into exactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions.  Thus, the line lies completely inside the polygon, the line lies completely outside the polygon, or possibly (but this will rarely happen) the line intersects the polyon.  Now, the phrasing of this question says \\\"if a line intersects a polygon\\\", so this is a decision problem.  One possibility (the decision model approach) is to reduce the question to some other (well known) problem Q, and then try to solve Q.  An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem.  In recent years, many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a new language called PostScript.  (See \\\"PostScript Language\\\", by Adobe Systems Incorporated, ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).  So, given a line L and a polygon P, we can write a PostScript program that draws the line L and the polygon P, and then \\\"outputs\\\" the answer.  By \\\"output\\\", we mean the program executes a command called \\\"showpage\\\", which actually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon.  A quick examination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q, and thus the original problem.  There are two small problems with this approach.    (1) There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into the  reduced problem Q.  So, we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of  Choice (or equivalently, Zorn's Lemma).  But the use of the Axiom of  Choice is not regarded in a very serious light these days.   (2) More importantly, the question arises as to whether or not the  PostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper; or in  other words, will it halt?   Now, PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a  Turing Machine might do; thus the halting problem (for PostScript) is  undecidable.  It is quite possible that the original problem will turn  out to be undecidable.   I won't even begin to go into other difficulties, such as aliasing, finite precision and running out of ink, paper or both.  A couple of references might be:  1. Principia Mathematica.  Newton, I.

Organization: AT&T Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill NJ  The situation is not nearly as bleak as Baraff suggests (he should know better, he's hung around The Labs for long enough).  By the well known Dobbin-Dullman reduction (see J. Dullman & D. Dobbin, J. Comp. Obfusc. 37,ii:  pp. 33-947, lemma 17(a)) line-polygon intersection can be reduced to Hamiltonian Circuit, without(!) the use of Grobner bases, so LPI (to coin an acronym) is probably only NP-complete.  Besides, Turing-completeness will no longer be a problem once our Cray-3 is delivered, since it will be able to complete an infinite loop in 4 milliseconds (with scatter-gather.)  --------  From: deb@svax.cs.cornell.edu (David Baraff)  Well, sure its no worse than NP-complete, but that's ONLY if you restrict yourself to the case where the line satisfies a Lipschitz condition on its second derivative.

[It will encourage the *FBI* to commit (even more) criminal acts, but that's not the point here.]  But this gives another avenue of attack on the Clipper proposal.  When the EFF/ACLU/CPSR FOIA requests are made, they should ask for details on the bureaucratic and equipment infrastructure that is proposed (or  even already budgeted) for the FBI to service tapping requests -- for now and the projected future.   From these figures, estimate the number of Clipper-tap requests the FBI is expecting.  Publish this figure.  Compare it on a per-capita basis with the amount of tapping now known or suspected.  Also estimate how expensive it would be for the FBI to install more Clipper-tapping stations, and how rapidly they could be built and installed ... ie, get the \\\"plus or minus\\\" epsilon for the near future.

(Cocking the gun turns the cylinder so that a loaded cylinder is under the hammer.  In other words, it can be usefully carried in a safe manner.)  Other handgun designs don't have that property; if their trigger isn't pulled, the hammer can't hit the firing pin.   The breakdowns that I do have include the above category.  From them I can safely say that if Davis is right in ALL of his claims, a large negative number of people are killed by animals, because we know that the number of killings by wackos is reasonably large and that the number of accidents due to gun failures (which is a superset of the described circumstance) is near zero.

With I/O overlap, your CPU can continue to \\\"think\\\" while disk operations are underway, whereas without overlap, your CPU sits idly waiting for each disk operation to finish - and disk operations take an *eternity*, compared to a fast CPU.  So, when you've got multi-tasking, you want to increase performance by increasing the amount of overlapping you do.  One way is with DMA or bus mastering.  Either of these make it possible for I/O devices to move their data into and out of memory without interrupting the CPU.  The alternative is for the CPU to move the data.  There are several SCSI interface cards that allow DMA and bus mastering.

I would beg to differ with you here.  The properly-formed conscience can be trusted virtually ALL the time.  I am not so sure, though, about something so materialistic as the human brain.  Does that mass of tissue possess anything trustworthy?  Your observation would probably be valid if we were discussing the \\\"mind\\\" of an animal, but the human being is only half animal, as it were; and half spiritual.   ?At the moment he stops speaking, and people start interpreting, the ?possibility of error appears.  Did he mean that literally or not?  We do ?not have any record that he elaborated on the words.  Was he thinking of ?Tran- or Con- substatiation?   He didn't say.  We interpret this passage ?using our brains; we think and reason and draw conclusions.  But we know ?that our brains are not perfect: our thinking often leads us wrong.  (This ?is something that most of us have direct experience of.  8-)  Now you have hit on the purpose of the Church.  It is by necessity the infallible interpreter of divine revelation.  Without the Church,           Christianity would be nothing more than a bunch of little divisive sects.   ?Unless you are infallible, there are very few things you can be certain ?of.  To the extent that doctrines rely on fallible human thinking, they ?cannot be certain.  This argument of yours regarding the certainty of an observation or a conclusion is not necessarily substantiated by experience.  It reminds me of the theoretical physicist who said that you can never be certain of a measurment because the sensor interferes with the field you are trying to measure.  Now, the experimental physicist will reply that although the measurement can never be made with absolute certainty, he is able to determine the certainty with which the measurement can be made, and this knowledge is often sufficient to render the measurement useful enough to allow evidence of the true condition of the field under observation. Therefore, although our minds are finite and susceptible to error, our competence in arriving at inductive insights gives confidence in our ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true, even in areas not subject to the experimental method.   ?Darren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu ?\\\"If any substantial number of  [ talk.religion.misc ]  readers read some ?

Korea          305-600\",\"For those of you who are thinking about fiamms, you might also want to think about airhorns. I just installed a set of Bosch air horns ordered from  Dennis Kirk (pg. 282 of the latest catalog) on my '85 FJ1100. They are rated at 93db at 7 meters. I installed them using 10 gage wire from the battery to the relay to the compressor to ground. My stock horn connectors fit the relay pins just fine. I soldered the connections to the relay and compressor, and used a crimp type battery connector and an inline 10amp fuse/connector from NAPA.  I installed the compressor just forward of the fuse box in the front fairing by tie wrapping between the steering head frame and the black steel tube frame used to support the front fairing. You have to remove the front fairing to do this, but it fits outside of the frame but inside the fairing on the two vertical supports just in front of the fuses. Depending how tight your fairing follows the frame, you should be able to fit it somewhere in the fairing. The compressor is about 2\\\" in diameter and about 5\\\" long.  The relay mounted on the front of the steering head frame (it is small so there should be plenty of good places for it.  I found a perfect place for the horns that required only tie wraps to mount. The horns fit inside the front fairing/frame and stick out on either side just in front of the air scoops, but behind the turn signals. The back of the horns point back towards the center of the bike and come real close to where the gas tank connects to the front part of the frame. There is just enough room to the outside to allow full lock to lock clearance, and there are nice cut outs in the frame for the back of the horn to go into.  The short horn is even with the fairing, and the long one sticks out about an inch or so, but it is really not that noticable unless you look closely. They end up pointing down slightly and maybe 30 degrees from straight ahead (perfect for those cagers trying to change lanes into you).  If you have any other questions about the mounting, email, and I can try to explain better. If your bike is not red, then you may want to paint them first.  How do they work you ask? They are very, very, very *LOUD*. They sound more like a european sports car than a truck, but a vast improvement over stock. I have used them at least daily since installing them, and the 10 amp fuse has not blown yet (although, the duration of the horn blasts have been short).  I've repeatedly scared the shit out of my friends with them, even though they know that I have the horns, they still jump. They are perfect for keeping the pedestrians on the sidewalk. The bottom line is they work, are loud enough to cause pain and suffering to those stupid lane changing cages (as well as take a few years off their lives) and are relatively easy to install on the FJ.

I believe that automatics should only be manufactured for people with physical disabilities who otherwise would not be able to drive.  Automatic transmissions allow drivers to be lazy. More time is available to fiddle with the radio or to look at the scenery instead of concentrating on the road.  The manual transmission keeps the drive always doing something, granted it isn't a large movement.  Plus, driving should be FUN!  Driving a manual is fun, driving an automatic is a chore.  In the case of shift speed, automatics can be made to shift far faster that any human could move a stick.  If I was racing, I'd want and automatic.  For normal driving go with the manual. \",\"   Back to the F1 stuff for a second, note that the `auto' tranny in F1 _STILL_ shifts at the driver's command, not some preselected schedule.

Such systems do exist, but none are presently installed in production autos that I am aware of.  These are commonly called viscous drive CVTs or fluidic amplifiers.    What the convertor _does_ allow is for the engine to be closer to its torque peak during the launch before a clutched car can fully engage it's driveline.  Chevy proved it many years ago with the '70 Camaro (ETs and terminal 1/4 mile times were close enough tpo be identical for 4 speed and auto cars).  Note that this is also the major reason that an auto car can get away with fewer gears than a manual, the slip in the convertor makes up for the fewer ratios (and before everyone starts yelling about the proposed 5 sspeed autos soon to be out, note that some manufacturers are using 6 speed manulas now).

I played Elvira I & II, and think that Horrorsoft has finally made a very playable game with Waxworks.  The look and feel is roughly the same as in the Elvira games, though the real time fighting is a little easier to survive.  The first two games, especially Elvira II: Jaws of Cerberus made it very tough to stay alive and hit-point restoring was very difficult.  This  is not to say that Waxworks is a walk in the park, but it is quite fair, in that there is always some weapon to be found that is quite effective, or hint given as to the proper fighting strategy.  In one of the four wax works to be explored, there is  no fighting at all (well almost none), though all four contain moderately challanging puzzles.  The really interesting thing about this game is that it is really  broken up into four seperate RPGs, one for each of the four exhibits you must enter.  In starting each one, your character is transported with no objects to use, and experience level 1.  One exhibits traps you inside a multi-level ancient Egyptian pyramid which you must  escape by fighting, mapping and puzzle solving.  Another exhibit traps you in a mine that has been taken over by creeping plant vines and pods, while the local humans have been transformed into plant zombies.  This is a single level maze that requires you to rescue some humans, kill the head plant alien, and figuere out how to kill the very tuff plant zombies that are always showing up.  This is perhaps the most horrifying exhibit.  Another exhibit puts you into Jack The Ripper England where you appear by the corpse of a fresh Ripper victim, and of course the police think you are responsible.  You must avoid police and angry mobs to unravel the mystery of The Ripper and  meet him face to face - but first get a disquise.  The last exhibit pus you in a graveyard where most of the challenge is in learning to  stop the almost indestructible zombies.    Over all the VGA graphics and music are very effective in setting a  creepy tone for the game, as was the case for the Elvira games, though gameplay is much improved and makes for a much more enjoyable game. I heartily recommend it for RPG and Horror fans.     *********************************************************  - All prices include shipping. - All games are in excellent condition unless otherwise stated. - US buyers only please. - All games will be shipped inside a box with packing, insured,   priority USPS. - All games include all original materials including box, manual,   disks, and registration unless otherwise noted.

FACT SHEET        PUBLIC ENCRYPTION MANAGEMENT  The first thing it doesn't say is \\\"We're giving you stronger encryption\\\". what it says is     the U. S. Government has developed a microcircuit that not only    provides privacy through encryption that is substantially more robust    than the current government standard, but also permits escrowing of    the keys needed to unlock the encryption.  The system for the    escrowing of keys will allow the government to gain access to    encrypted information only with appropriate legal authorization. But DES is strong enough that only the government can break it now, so the major effect is to make it EASIER for government to break! *At best* it makes it more difficult for the NSA to break, since they need to get one of the two escrowed keys to do a brute-force search for the other 40-bit key.  Similarly, it didn't say \\\"We're making encryption is commercially available.\\\" because encryption *is* already commercially available, including forms the NSA may not be able to break, like triple-DES or IDEA. And phone companies could offer DES-based systems *now* if they were convinced the government would let them and they could make enough money.  The next thing it didn't say is \\\"We're making encryption legal\\\", because of course encryption *has always been* legal, and the President can't change the First Amendment merely by decree. What it *did* say was:  In making this decision, I do not intend to prevent the  private sector from developing, or the government from approving,  other microcircuits or algorithms that are equally effective in  assuring both privacy and a secure key- escrow system. which clearly means \\\"We're making encryption illegal unless we get your keys. Soon.  Once business buys into this.\\\"  Another thing it didn't say is \\\"We're going to ask Congress for money to do *lots* more wiretapping\\\", because of course, there's a budget crisis, and Congress might debate the policy issues or not give them the cash. What it *did* say was:    The Attorney General will procure and utilize encryption devices to    the extent needed to preserve the government's ability to conduct    lawful electronic surveillance and to fulfill the need for secure    law enforcement communications.  Further, the Attorney General    shall utilize funds from the Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture    Super Surplus Fund to effect this purchase. which means \\\"We've got money Congress can't control and we're going to buy lots of wiretapping equipment with it to detect NON-APPROVED CRYPTO (that's what \\\"preserve the government's ability to conduct ... surveillance\\\"  means.)  \",\"How about this:  The TelCo has your Clipper key.

The bike has about 47,000 miles : and is around $4500. It has had two previous owners, both employees : of the dealership who, I have been told, took very good care of the : bike.  : I have two questions: 1) Is this too many miles for a bike? I know this : would not be many miles for a car but I am unfamiliar with the life : span of bikes. 2) Is this a decent price? I am also unfamilar with : prices for used bikes. Is there a blue book for bikes like there is : for cars?.  : Thanks for any advice you can give.  :                             --Mark --  Mark,    47k is not too many miles on a VFR750.  I sold my (well maintained) '87 VFR700 with 52k miles on it and the engine was in mint condition. All that the bike needed was steering head bearings and fork bushings and seals.  The guy who bought it had a mechanic pull the valve covers to look at the top end, do a compression check etc.  He confirmed it was mint.     As for price, $4500 seems a little steep.  I bought my '90 with 12k miles on it a year ago (and in absolutely cherry condition) for $4800. There is a bluebook, ask your bank or credit union for the going price. I've seen a couple of ads for VFR's in the $4500 dollar range.  They all said low miles & mint condition but I didn't actually go look at them.     A VFR is a very sweet bike and will last you forever if you maintain it at all.  One thing to look for, BTW, is a soft front end.  If my VFR is any indication, at 12k miles the fork springs were totally shot. Progressive springs ($55) fixed it right up.  Good luck,\",\"   That's true.

Richard Hirschhaut, director of the San Francisco branch of the ADL, art dealer Roy Bullock and former policeman Tom Gerard were also named as defendants in the suit, filed in San Francisco County Superior Court.      The 19 accuse the ADL of B'nai B'rith, a group dedicated to fighting anti-Semitism, and the other defendants of secretly gathering information on them, including data from state and federal agencies.      The suit alleges they disclosed the information to others, including the governments of Israel and South Africa, in what it alleges was a \\\"a massive spying operation.\\\"      The action is a class-action suit. It was filed on behalf of about 12,000 anti-apartheid activists or opponents of Israeli policies about whom the plaintiffs believe the ADL, Bullock and Gerard gathered information.      Representatives of the ADL in San Francisco were not immediately available for comment on Wednesday.      The civil suit is the first legal action arising out of allegations that Gerard, a former inspector in the San Francisco police intelligence unit, passed confidential police files on California political activists to a spy ring.      The FBI and San Francisco police are investigating the ADL, Bullock and Gerard over the affair and last week searched the ADL's offices in San Francisco and Los Angeles.      The suit alleges invasion of privacy under the Civil Code of California, which prohibits the publication of information obtained from official sources. It seeks exemplary damages of at least $2,500 per person as well as other unspecified damages.      Lawyer Pete McCloskey, a former Congresmen who is representing the plaintiffs, said the 19 plaintiffs included Arab-Americans and Jews -- and his wife Helen, who also had information gathered about her.      One of the plaintiffs is Yigal Arens, a research scientist at the University of Southern California who is a son of the former Israeli Defence Minister.      Arens told the San Francisco Examiner he had seen a file the ADL kept on him in the 1980s, presumably because of his criticism of the treatment of Palestinians and his position on the Israeli-occupied territories.      According to court documents released last week, Bullock and Gerard both kept information on thousands of California political activists.      In the documents, a police investigator said he believed the ADL paid Bullock for many years to provide information and that both the league and Bullock received confidential information from the authorities.      No criminal charges have yet been filed in the case. The ADL, Bullock and Gerard have all denied any wrongdoing.   REUTER AC KG CM    APn  04/14 2202  ADL Lawsuit  Copyright, 1993. The Associated Press. All rights reserved.  By CATALINA ORTIZ  Associated Press Writer    SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Arab-Americans and critics of Israel sued the Anti-Defamation League on Wednesday, saying it invaded their privacy by illegally gathering information about them through a nationwide spy network.    The ADL, a national group dedicated to fighting anti-Semitism, intended to use the data to discredit them because of their political views, according to the class-action lawsuit filed in San Francisco Superior Court.    \\\"None of us has been guilty of racism or Nazism or anti-Semitism or hate crimes, or any of the other `isms' that the ADL claims to protect against. None of us is violent or criminal in any way,\\\" said Carol El-Shaieb, an education consultant who develops programs on Arab culture.    The 19 plaintiffs include Yigal Arens, son of former Israel Defense Minister Moshe Arens. The younger Arens, a research scientist at the University of Southern California, said the ADL kept a file on him in the 1980s presumably because he has criticized Israel's treatment of Palestinians.    \\\"The ADL believes that anyone who is an Arab American ... or speaks politically against Israel is at least a closet anti-Semite,\\\" Arens said.    The ADL has denied any wrongdoing, but couldn't comment on the lawsuit because it hasn't reviewed it, said a spokesman at the ADL's New York headquarters.    The FBI and local police and prosecutors are investigating allegations that the ADL spied on thousands of individuals and hundreds of groups, including white supremacist and anti-Semitic organizations, Arab-Americans, Greenpeace, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and San Francisco public television station KQED.    Some information allegedly came from confidential police and government records, according to court documents filed in the probe and the civil lawsuit. No charges have been filed in the criminal investigation.    The lawsuit accuses the ADL of violating California's privacy law, which forbids the intentional disclosure of personal information \\\"not otherwise public\\\" from state or federal records.    The lawsuit claims the ADL disclosed the information to \\\"persons and entities\\\" who had no compelling need to receive it. It didn't elaborate.    Defendants include Richard Hirschhaut, director of the ADL's office in San Francisco. He did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment.    Other defendants are San Francisco art dealer Roy Bullock, an alleged ADL informant over the past four decades, and former police officer Tom Gerard. Gerard allegedly tapped into law enforcement and government computers and passed information on to Bullock.    Gerard, who has retired from the police force, has moved to the Philippines. Bullock's lawyer, Richard Breakstone, said he could not comment on the lawsuit because he had not yet studied it.

My daughter's Christian school sends home a weekly update on school related topics. This week they sent something *very* interesting. It was an article written by the leader of a national (US) Christian school organization about a trip he recently made to Jerusalem. While there, he was introduced to one of the rabbis who is working on a project to rebuild the Temple at Jerusalem. The article included photos of the many furnishings that have already been made in preparation for furnishing the rebuilt temple according to the specifications given in the Bible.   What was even more striking is the fact that the plans for the temple are complete and the group is only awaiting permission from the Israeli government before beginning the building. The other startling fact is the very recent archeological discovery that the original site of the temple is unoccupied and available for building. Previously it has been thought that the original site was underneath what is now a mosque, making rebuilding impossible without sparking a holy war.   Now it appears that nothing stands in the way of rebuilding and resuming sacrifices, as the Scriptures indicate will happen in the last days. Although the Israeli government will give the permission to start, I think it is the hand of God holding the project until He is ready to let it happen. Brothers and sisters, the time is at hand.

But the difinition of modify that applies to how \\\"well regulated\\\"  modifies \\\"militia\\\" is:  to qualify or limit the meaning of.  For example, \\\"wet\\\"  modifes \\\"day\\\" in the phrase \\\"a wet day.\\\"  The amendment is similiar to the statement:  A wet day, being annoying, the right of the people to keep  and wear boots, shall not be infringed. So how does a dry day pertain the right to use boots?  Similiar, what does the \\\"unorganized militia\\\" have to due with the right to own guns?  -> The sentence [in the Second Amendment] doesn't restrict the right, or -> state or imply possession of the right by anyone or anything other -> than the people.

No not, unconditional, but \\\"shall not be infringed\\\".  Infringed is defined as:  To break or ignore the terms of or obligations (an oath,   an agreement, law, or the like); to disreguard; violate.  To go beyond the boundaries or limits; tresspass; encroach. This definition implies the following of some form of existing  agreement.  Laws and agreements are made in advance.  Boundaries  or limits of behavior are set by society as a whole.  The word  \\\"unconditional\\\" implies no agreements or all previous agreements  are off, which is the opposite.  The words used in the first amendment are much stronger, i.e., \\\"congress shall make no law,\\\" are much stronger.  They clearly            ^^^^^^^^^^^ imply \\\"unconditional.\\\"  If the writers of the amendment, wanted  unconditional whay didn't they says, \\\"congress shall make no  laws pertaining the the right of the people to keep and bear arms\\\"? The second amendment implies a sort contract between the people the people and the state.  The bigger part of the contract is the people have the right to overthrew the government and its laws at any time.  To guarantee this right, the laws cannot stopped the people from forming a \\\"well regutaled militia.\\\"  The duties of a \\\"well regulated militia\\\" to the government are descussed in  Federalist No. 29.

Gerald Perry of the Cardinals pinch hit in the eighth inning with two on and his club down by a run.  He stroked a line drive into the right field corner.  The ball cleared the three-foot high fence and went into the crowd.  Darryl, racing over from right center, got to the spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence, but he missed the ball.  A fan sitting in the front row, wearing a mitt, reached up and caught the ball.  Home run.  Now I've seen the replay several times and I have concluded that Darryl missed the ball, and that the fan's glove was essentially behind Darryl's.  Several Dodger fans with seats in the immediate vicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with Strawberry.  What cannot be disputed, however, is that the fan who caught the ball never took his eye off it;  he was oblivious to where the fielder was playing.  He was also quite exuberant as soon as he realized he had made the catch.  That exuberance disappeared immediately, however, when Strawberry went into a tirade at the man.  All reports indicate he used a lot of profanity and accused the man of interference, and therefore of costing the Dodgers a game.  Shortly afterwards other fans hurled food and beverages toward the man who made the catch.  Dodger Stadium officials started to remove him from the park, but then relented and just relocated him to another area.  In an interview after the game, Lasorda blamed the fan for the loss.  Strawberry also went into a tirade about how the fans are stupid and they don't care about  winning.  L.A. Times columnists similarly blasted the man who made the catch.  Before each Dodger game the public address announcer makes a speech wherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls that are hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any  that are in the field of play.  Was the fan wrong?  Should he have been more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility of interference?  Or was he human and just reacting?  By the way, he is a season ticket holder and on his request the Dodgers have relocated his seats to another area of the Stadium where future interference is impossible.  Others have questioned why Darryl should be so concerned with what the fan did when he has a grand total of 1 rbi through the first nine games.  I question what he was doing in right center with a left-handed pull hitter up and the game on the line.  Had he been closer to the play, he certainly would have had a much better chance of catching the ball.  But I guess the big debate continues as to what are the responsibilities of the fan.    -- The Beastmaster   \",\" Battery powered devices like the PowerBook are sometimes more sensitive to  serial port weirdness.

And the 'Islamic Holocaust' is much the topic of the day. The historical evidence proves that during  the period of 1914 to 1920, the Armenian Government ordered, incited,  assisted and participated in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people  because of race, religion and national origin. Armenians perpetrated acts  of sabotage, destroyed telephone cables, blew up bridges, blocked passes,  set up ambushes, attacked security stations and small Turkish outposts  behind the Ottoman Army lines on the one hand, and on the other ruthlessly  attacked Turkish and Kurdish villages, slaughtering the Turkish population  indiscriminately, women, children, old and young alike. Innocent  Muslims were one by one cruelly bayonetted to death, or massacred with  axes and swords, or else shut up in mosques or in schools and then burnt alive as can be seen below.  Widespread Armenian massacres of innocent Muslims took place in regions  of Van, Kars, Sivas, Erzurum, Bitlis, Erzincan, Mus, Diyarbakir and  Maras. The Ottoman Army, while fighting to prevent the Russian invasion, also had to deal with Armenian genocide squads who cowardly hit from  behind. The Armenian genocide of the Muslims spread to all parts of  Eastern Anatolia. Starting from late 1914, Armenians committed  widespread massacres and genocide in Eastern Anatolia, because the arena was left to the Armenians. Almost every Turkish town and village from  Erzincan up to Azerbaidjan suffered large scale massacres and genocide  by Armenians and the Turkish genocide has been documented by Armenian,  Russian, American, British, Ottoman, German, Austrian and French  journalists and officers who observed the first genocide of this century committed by the blood-thirsty Armenian genocide squads.  The Ottoman Army, liberating Trabzon, Bayburt, Erzincan, Erzurum,  Kars and other regions from the Russians, saw that the cities and their  villages had been destroyed and burnt, people slaughtered, massacred. The massacres conducted by Armenians, which became a black stain for humanity, shocked and disgusted even the Russian, British, German, Austrian, French and American authorities.  Almost every Ottoman document is related to Armenian massacres and  cruelties. The inhuman treatment, cruelties, atrocities, genocide by  Armenian genocide squads perpetrated against innocent Moslem Turkish  and Kurdish people, are sufficiently reflected in historical documents.  Even today over seventy-five years later, the terrifying screams of  the victims of these cruelties can be heard.

(4) Is memory still availabe for the Portable? There are several vendors  that still make RAM for the Portable. There are two options: Some vendors  sell memory that plugs into the RAM Slot inside the portable. Others sell  memory that plugs into the Processor Direct Slot. Either way, the most  memory you can address is either 8 or 9 megabytes, depending on whether  the Portable is Backlit or not. King Memory and Peripherials in Irvine  California is the cheapest place I know of for Portable memory. 2MB -  $140, 4 MB, $250, and 7 MB $415.

Its a Conner CP-3045 40 MB HD with an  average access time of about 25 ms. (6) Is the screen better that the PB 100? Heavens yes! The PB 100 is a  backlit PASSIVE matrix screen which means it fades out on you if you move  your head a few degrees left or right. The Portable has a backlit or  non-backlit ACTIVE Matrix screen which I think is a joy to read.  Other things to consider - Where to get the portable and how much to pay  for it?

I'd like to expand our show automation a bit- namely add the capability to use cue tapes to bring the houselights up.  Our current automation consoles date from the early 60's and don't provide this function.  We already have the combo failsafe/contact rollers to read the cuetapes, and our dimmer system will raise the houselights when its fade-up control circuit (120 VAC) is momentarily closed, for at least 0.5 second.  I've tried wiring the dimmer control to a 12V relay, activated when the cue tape completes the circuit.  Low tech and simple, but there's one problem:  In order to get the 1/2 second pulse, there needs to be a sh**load of cuetape on the film.  (35mm runs at 90 feet per minute, so to get a 1/2 second pulse, there needs to be at least 9 inches of solid cuetape!)  Ideally, I would like to use a single cross-cue to accomplish this function. (A single strip of cuetape perpendicular to the length of the film) This would give a pulse of approximately 1/100 of a second. What I need is a circuit to detect the short cue and activate the relay for around 1/2 second.  The ability to adjust how long the relay is activated would be nice.  I figure this would require an RC circuit of some sort.  I'm sure some of you already have the solution figured out in your heads.  Any suggestions and schematics would be appreciated!

An Appeal to Mankind  During the last three years Azerbaijan and its multinational population are vainly fighting for justice within the limits of the Soviet Union. All humanitarian, constitutional human rights guaranteed by the UN Charter, Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Helsinki Agreements, Human Problems International Forums, documents signed by the Soviet Union - all of them are violated.  The USSR's President, government bodies do not defend Azerbaijan though they are all empowered to take necessary measures to guarantee life and peace.  The 140,000 strong army of Armenian terrorists with Moscow's tacit consent wages an undeclared war of annihilation against Azerbaijan. As a result, a part of Azerbaijan has been occupied and annexed, hundreds of people killed, thousands wounded.  Some 200,000 Azerbaijanis have been brutally and inhumanly deported from the Armenian SSR, their historical homeland. Together with them 64,000 Russians and 22,000 Kurds have also been driven out, a part of them now settled in Azerbaijan. Some 40,000 Turkish-Meskhetians, Lezghins and representatives  of other Caucasian nationalities who escaped from the Central Asia where the President and government bodies did not guarantee them the life and peace also suffered from these deportations.  One of the scandalous vandalisms directed not only against Azerbaijan science but the world civilization as well is the Armenian extremists' destruction of the Karabakh scientific experimental base of The Institute of Genetics and Selection  of the Academy of Sciences of the Azerbaijan SSR.  We beg you for humanitarian help and political assistance, for the honour and dignity of 7 million Azerbaijanis are violated, its territory, culture  and history are trampled, its people are shot. There is persistent negative image of Azerbaijanians abroad, and this defamation is spread over  the whole world by Soviet mass media, Armenian lobby in the USSR and the United States.   One of the myths is that all events allegedly involves and generated by interethnic collisions and religious intolerance while the truth is that all these shootings and recent  events stem from the territorial claims of Armenia on Azerbaijan.  It is a well documented fact that before the conflict there were no frictions between Armenians and Azerbaijanis on the issue of Karabakh. Hundreds and thousands Armenians placidly and calmly lived and worked in Azerbaijan land, had their representatives in all government bodies of the Azerbaijan SSR.  We are for a united, indivisible, sovereign Azerbaijan, we  are for a common Caucasian home proclaimed in 1918 by one of the founding fathers of the Azerbaijan Democratic  Republic - Muhammed Emin Rasulzade.  But all these goals and expectations are trampled upon the Soviet leadership in favour of the Armenian expansionists encouraged by Moscow and intended to create a new '1,000 Year Reich' - the 'Great Armenia' - by annexing the  neighboring lands.  The world public opinion shed tears to save the whales, suffers for penguins dying out in the Antarctic Continent.  But what about the lives of seven million human beings? If these people are Muslims, does it mean that they are less valuable? Can people be discriminated by their  colour of skin or religion, by their residence or other attributes?  All people are brothers, and we appeal to our brothers for help and understanding. This is not the first appeal of Azerbaijan to the world public opinion. Our previous appeals were unheard. However, we still carry the hope that the truth beyond the Russian and Armenian propaganda will one day reveal the extent of our suffering and stimulate at least as much help and compassion for Azerbaijan as tendered to whales and penguins.

Besides, at the root of this conflict lie the territorial claims on Azerbaijan, a consequence of which were the blood and suffering of innocent Azeri people, hundreds of thousands of refugees, and gross violations of human rights.   Recently Armenians attacked the Azeri town of Khojaly and massacred thousands of Azeris. The Paris-based 'Association for Democracy and Human Rights in Azerbaijan' puts the number of Khojali victims at 3,145. Some of the dead were scalped and mutilated. This whole thing has now gone entirely too far.   They already did. The scenario and genocide staged by the Armenians  78 years ago in the Ottoman Empire is being reenacted again - this  time in Azerbaijan. There are remarkable similarities between the  plots, the perpetrators, and the underdogs.   Report taken from The New York Times, Tuesday, March 3, 1992                      MASSACRE BY ARMENIANS BEING REPORTED       Agdam,Azerbaijan,March 2 (Reuters) - Fresh evidence emerged today  of a massacre of civilians by Armenian militants in Nagorno-Karabakh,  a predominantly Armenian enclave of Azerbaijan.      The republic of Armenia reiterated denials that its militants had killed 1,000 people in the Azerbaijani populated town of Khojaly last week and  massacred men, women and children fleeing the carnage across snow-covered mountain passes.      But dozen of bodies scattered over the area lent credence to Azerbaijani reports of a massacre.                           Scalping Reported      Azerbaijani officials and journalists who flew briefly to the region by helicopter brought back three dead children with the back of their heads blown off. They said shooting by Armenians has prevented them  from retrieving more bodies.      \\\"Women and children have been scalped,\\\" said Assad Faradshev, an aide to Nagorno-Karabakh's Azerbaijani Governor. \\\"When we began to pick up bodies, they began firing at us.\\\" are lying there like flocks of sheep.

The  Alexandria bookstore (that's the name of the book store operated  by AMORC) should have a selection that should provide the interested reader more insight).   Cheers, Kent\",\"A listmember (D Andrew Killie, I think) wrote, in response to the suggestion that genocide may sometimes be the will of God:   > Any God who works that way is indescribably evil,  > and unworthy of my worship or faith.  Nobuya \\\"Higgy\\\" Higashiyama replied (as, in substance, did others):   > Where is your source of moral standards by which you judge God's  > behavior?  It is often argued that we have no standing by which to judge God's actions.  Who is the clay to talk back to the potter? But we find a contrary view in Scripture. When God proposes to destroy the city of   + Suppose that there are some good men in the city.  + Will you destroy the righteous along with the wicked?  + Far be it from you, Lord, to do such a thing!  + Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?  I am told that the Hebrew is actually a bit stronger than this, and can perhaps be better rendered (dynamic equivalence) as   + Shame on you, Lord, if you do such a thing!  There are those who say that the definition of \\\"good\\\" is \\\"whatever God happens to want.\\\" But if that is so, then the statement that God is good has no meaning.  It simply says that God does what He wants. That being the case, no one can either love or obey God because He is good. The only motive left for obeying Him is that He is powerful. Just as it makes sense to obey a dictator, even when he tells you to round up all Jews and exterminate them, because if you defy him you might end up in the gas chamber yourself, so it makes sense to obey God, because He has the power to punish you if you don't. This ethical theory I take to be in radical contradiction to Genesis 18 and to Christianity in general.  Any theory that makes our moral judgements worthless makes any further discussion of morality (or of the goodness of God) meaningless. However, it does not follow that our moral judgements are always infallible in particular cases, still less our judgements in particular cases about the course of action most likely to achieve a good result.  When I read the Scriptural accounts of the actions of God in history, those actions often seem to me very different from what I might expect of a God who loves us and desires what is best for us. Moreover, leaving the Scriptures aside, and considering the natural world, I find that Nature is often very different from what I might \\\"Those who believe that the Author of Nature is also the Author of the Scriptures must expect to find in the Scriptures the same sort of difficulties that they find in Nature.\\\")  Now, that some such difficulties should exist is not in itself an argument against the existence, power, wisdom, and goodness of God. On the contrary, their ABSENCE would be such an argument. Suppose that I am watching Bobby Fisher play chess, and suppose that every time he makes a move, I find myself nodding and saying: \\\"Good move! Just what I was expecting him to do.  Same move I would have made if I were playing.\\\" That would be a sign that Fisher is no better a chess player than myself. Given that he is better, I expect that at least some of his moves will have me thinking, \\\"Now, what do suppose induced him to do that?\\\" or even, \\\"Boy, that was a real slip -- he's just thrown the game away!\\\" Similarly, if God understands the workings of the universe better than I do, it is to be expected that sometimes it will look to me as if He has made a mistake.  One difference between Fisher at the chessboard and God at the controls of the universe is that I can see the end of the chess game. If Fisher wins, I revise my earlier inference that it was carelessness that made him lose his queen 23 moves earlier. However, if he loses, and particularly if I can see that there was a time when he had an opportunity for a checkmate in two moves and did not take it, then I know that he is not as good a player as I had thought.  With God, on the other hand, I shall not in this life see the total result of some of His actions. Therefore, my grounds for judging that I have seen a bad move on His part must always be far shakier than my grounds for making a similar judgement about Fisher.       *****     *****     *****     *****     *****  In the book of Genesis, we read that Joseph's ten older brothers, who (with good reason) found  him insufferable, conspired to sell him into slavery in Egypt. There he eventually became Viceroy, and when there was a famine in Canaan, he was able to provide for his family. When his brothers nervously apologized, he told them: \\\"Do not worry. You meant to do me evil, but God turned it into good.\\\"           The history of the Jews is largely a history of events    that look like catastrophes that threaten the continued    survival of the religion, or the people, or both. But,    amazingly, those events turn out to be the saving of the Jews    and of Judaism.         The sale of Joseph by his brothers looked like the breakup    of the family.  But in fact, it ended with a reconciliation of    the quarrel between them. The famine that drove the family out    of Canaan looked like a misfortune for them.  But in fact, if    they had stayed in Canaan, they would almost certainly have    intermarried with the Canaanites and been assimilated into    their culture.  Their oppression by the Egyptians a few    generations after their arrival in Egypt again looked like a    disaster. But God used it to bring them out of Egypt, and into    the Promised Land.         Here the people built a Temple, and regularly offered    sacrifices. But the Babylonians captured Jerusalem and Judea,    destroyed Temple and city and countryside, and deported most of    the people to Babylon. You might have thought that that would    be the end of the people and the religion. But it was not.    Living in Canaan, the people had been under constant danger of    assimilation.  Again and again, they had turned from the    worship of the LORD to the worship of the Canaanite fertility    cults, with their ritual prostitution and ritual human    sacrifice. The Babylonian captivity put a stop to that. Never    again did the Jews show any interest in polytheism or idolatry.    Neither the worship of the Canaanites mor that of the    Babylonians ever again had a foothold among them.         Nor is that all. Judaism had been in danger of becoming    simply a system of sacrifices and Temple observances. The only    prescribed acts of worship consisted of coming to Jerusalem    every so often and offering a sacrifice. During the Captivity,    with the Temple gone, the Jews invented the synagogue, a place    of meeting for reading and study and discussion of the    Scriptures. They came to realize clearly, what they were in    danger of forgetting while they continued to live in Judea,    that God is not simply a local or tribal deity, not just the    controller of the land of Canaan, or the patron of the Jewish    people, but the Creator of the world, and the Ruler and Judge    of all humans everywhere.         Time passed, and the Babylonian Empire was replaced by    that of the Persians, and then that of the Greeks, or rather    the Macedonians. The ruler, Antiochus Epiphanes, was determined    to stamp out Judaism, and to this end he made the reading and    the study of the Torah punishable by death. Again, one might    think that this would be the end of Judaism. But it was not.    The people met for worship, and instead of reading the Torah    portion appointed for the day, they would read some passage    from the prophets that had a similar theme, and then discuss    that.  Before this time, the Torah, the so-called Five Books of    Moses (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy)    were the only books read and studied in the synagogue.  If it    had not been for Antiochus, the books of the prophets would    probably have been forgotten altogether. His hatred for Judaism    saved them.          [Other examples here omitted for brevity's sake.]          Some of you may remember that Julie Andrews first became    famous as Eliza Doolittle in the stage production of MY FAIR    LADY. When Warner Brothers undertook to make a movie of it,    everyone expected that Julie, who had been so magnificent on    stage, would play the same role in the movie. Instead, the    studio decided to go with an established screen star, and cast    Audrey Hepburn.  Julie Andrews was naturally crushed. But she    later realized that if she had played the screen role, she    would have been type-cast for life as an Elize Doolittle type.    It would have been a disaster for her. As it was, Walt Disney    offered her the role of Mary Poppins, and she won an Oscar for    it.  At the presentation, she stood there, smiling, and looking    at Walt Disney, she said, \\\"And now, my special thanks to the    man who made all this possible -- JACK WARNER!\\\" It was the most    memorable line of the evening.         In a similar spirit, we Jews might thank the men who in    the providence of God have preserved Judaism, and kept it alive    to this day, beginning with Joseph's brothers, and continuing    with two Pharaohs, with Nebuchadnezzar, with Antiochus    Epiphanes....  After the formal meeting had broken up, one woman came up to him privately and said, \\\"You were talking about the Holocaust, weren't you?\\\" He answered, \\\"If that is an example that came to your mind, then you are right, I was talking about it to you. But I would not talk about it to everyone, for not everyone can bear it.\\\" I assume that he meant that, without the Holocaust, there would have been no state of Israel.  Someone hearing the rabbi's lecture might leap to the conclusion that God is dependent on the wickedness of men to accomplish His purposes -- or at least that the rabbi thought so. He might then  go on to suppose that the wickedness is in fact God's doing -- that He stirred up Joseph's brothers to a murderous hate against him, and that when the Israelites were in Egypt, God hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he oppressed the people, and would not let them go. And this raises questions about how an action can be considered wicked and at the same time be considered something that God has brought about.  I suggest another way of looking at it. Consider a sculptor who has a log of wood from which he proposes to carve a statue. But the log, instead of having a smooth even grain throughout, has a large knot that spoils the appearance of the surface. The sculptor considers the wood for a while, and then carves a statue that features the knot, that makes that particular interruption in the grain and color of the wood correspond to some feature of the statue, so that observers will say: \\\"How fortunate the sculptor was in finding a piece of wood with a knot like that in just the right place. Its presence is the crowning touch, the thing that makes the statue a great work of art.\\\" In reality, the knot, far from being what the sculptor was looking for, was a challenge to his skill. If the wood had not contained that flaw, he would still have made a great work of art, but a different one. So, if Joseph's brothers had not sold him, God would still have brought about His purposes for the Jewish people, but He would have done so in another manner. If Judas had not betrayed Jesus, if Caiaphas and his fellow leaders had not rejected Jesus, but had rather acknowledged Him as the Annointed of God, if Pilate had followed his conscience rather than his fears and had set Jesus free, it might appear that there would have been no Crucifixion, and therefore no Redemption, and therefore no Salvation. Not so. God did not need Judas' sin to redeem us. If Judas had done right, then God in Christ would still have reconciled the world to Himself.  We do not know how, just as we do not know how Michelangelo would have painted the Sistine Chapel if its interior had instead been shaped like Grand Central Station, and just as we do not know how Bobby Fisher would have won his fourth game agianst Spassky if Spassky had refused the exchange of bishops and had attacked Fisher's knight instead (don't bother to look up the game in question--I am making up this example, but the point is none the less valid).  Thus, we may say both (1) that God used, say, the cowardice of Pilate to accomplish His purposes, and (2) that the said cowardice was not God's doing, and that Pilate would not have thwarted God's plans by behaving justly and courageously.  What, then, are we to make of the place where God says to Moses, \\\"I will harden Pharaoh's heart, so that he will not let the people go\\\"? Some Christians have taken this to mean that Pharaoh was a puppet with God pulling the strings, and that his stubbornness and cruelty were not his own work, but the work of God in him. I suppose rather that what God was telling Moses was something like this: \\\"If you see that Pharaoh is not willing to let the people go, do not be discouraged, or suppose that the situation is out of my control. My purposes will not be thwarted. If Pharaoh chooses to hear you and let the people go, well and good. If he does not, I will fit his resistance into my plans, and fit it so perfectly that future historians and theologians will suppose that I would have been thrown for a loss if Pharaoh had obeyed me.\\\"  To return to the question that started this all off. Is it possible that the Serbs, in slaughtering the Moslems of Bosnia, are instruments of God's will?      First point. What they are doing is wrong, just as what Joseph's brothers did was wrong, just as what Judas did was wrong. They intend it for evil. If God somehow brings good out of it, that does not make them any less subject to just condemnation and punishment.      Second point. Of course, God will bring good out of it. But not the same good that He would have brought if the Serbians had refrained from the sins of robbery and rape and murder. Nor does the good He purposes excuse us from the duty of doing what is right.\",\" Here's the scoop.  When you get your home brew receiver working, would you be willing to share it with the rest of us?  I always wanted to build my own but never have the time to fool around and design it.  pin 1:  signal ground pin 2:  signal pin 3:  always hot +6 volts pin 4:  +6 volts, hot only when preamp is turned on pin 5:  infrared repeater connectors  The infrared repeater jacks on the back of the preamp are not connected to anything inside the preamp except the 5 pin connector pin #5.  There is a 150 ohm resistor between the two jacks, with a 1.5K from pin 5 to ground.  The signal pin #2 in the preamp is summed with the built in IR receiver. They use a chip called CX20106A and a BJT to amplify the signal.  I would imagine the logical way would be to duplicate this circuit and use it as the external receiver.  If you need more info, let me know.\",\" Because Greyhound has apparently gotten around to installing their RADAR collision-prevention system. They use RADAR to monitor how close other vehicles are and how fast their relative speeds are, and signals a warning to the driver if they're coming up on something too fast or are getting too close.  This is all I remember from the news reports a few months back; at the time, they were only talking about the possibility of installing the system. (They didn't mention how it worked in bumper-to-bumper traffic, or how it discriminated between a Camaro approaching at 120mph and ye olde bridge support in the median being approached  at 60mph on a curve.)  I do recall something about progressive stages of warnings, from flashing lights to audible warnings--ie, it goes from a red \\\"Too close\\\" light to hysterically screaming \\\"WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE!!!!\\\"  :-)      James\",\" I tend to agree.  I came here when it first started and watched it grow from the roots on talk.religion.misc.  It seemed to take a while for enough atheists to come forward to get past the \\\"Let's trash Xians\\\" and such. Now there's a stable core, and frankly there's a feeling that this is _our_ group.  If we go mainstream, we're going to be in a lot more places.  And every fucking fundy loonie freshman will be dumping on us to find Jeesus! and warn us that we're all going to Hell.  Want to see what we'll get?  Go real alt.fan.brother-jed and imagine that those imbecilic tirades will be here.  All the time.  Every other post.  I'm being selfish.  I find I really learn a lot here and the S/N isn't too bad.  The Browns and the Boobys are a distraction, but they are few enough that they even bring in some of the leavening needed to offset them.  But I greatly fear that mainstreaming would basically put us at the swamping level of the Conners of the world.  Regards, Dew\",\"I produced an error last week about CHORION:   I abhor publishing trash (I abhor it of myself even more than I do from others, but since I do not present myself as an authority on the subject, I do not feel dishonest, though I do openly admit ignorance and incompetence in this example).  Thus I felt honor bound to do a better set of research specifically on the word.  First it should be noted that Greek grammar is not as tough as I first assumed (it is not nontrivial by any means, and I still am not competent with it, but it is not as opaque as I had thought).  It turns out that while the Index for the Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich \\\"Greek Lexicon\\\" renders each verse in order, each word within a verse is put in greek alphabetical order.  Thus while the the meaning of the verse is decipherable, the syntax is far from clear.  On the other hand, a Greek-English Intralinear Bible makes things a lot more comprehendable.  And yes, the word for field in Acts 1:18 is indeed \\\"chorion.\\\"   Now I've checked several Greek-English lexicons:   \\\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\\\" Louw and Nida  \\\"Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament\\\"  \\\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\\\" Grimm  \\\"Word study Concordance,\\\" Tynsdale  \\\"A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other    early Christian Writings,\\\" Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich  \\\"The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,\\\" Perschbacher  In each case the meaning of the word Chorion was given variously as:   A space, place, region, district, field, area, \\\"country place,\\\"   land, farm, estate, \\\"a bit of tillage\\\", and similar meanings.  Nowhere do any of these books mention anything about \\\"grave.\\\" As some of these  books go into great detail, I would be very surprised to find that these books  are all inadequate and Mr Archer is the only competent scholar in Greek.  I  think it more likely that Mr Archer's investigations into \\\"contradictions\\\" to  be once again, as your friend said it, \\\"lacking in substance,\\\" and thus Archer  is again shown worthless as an expert witness (By the way Mr DeCenso, I would  have honorably presented my results on this matter, even if I had found them to support Mr Archer's contentions).   By the way, among these lexicons, (eg: Robinson's) is the definition of \\\"agros,\\\" the word used in Matthew 27 to describe the field bought.  The word \\\"agros\\\" is defined as \\\"a field in the country.\\\" Chorion is specifically noted as a synonym to agros.  This is significant, as it is evidence of how silly Bullinger's exegisis was, which stated that the word for \\\"field\\\" in Matthew (ie: agros) is different from the word for \\\"field\\\" in Acts (ie: chorion), and thus we must be talking about two different fields (Of course you already admit how stupid Bullinger's exegisis is, but this was a small serendipity which drives the point home).   So as of now, unless Mr DeCenso show compelling reasons to believe otherwise (eg: a reputable scholar with reputable references), I consider this  particular issue closed.  See Mr DeCenso, now you can go on to answer questions about the denials of Peter, the day of the Crucifixion, Tyre, and  the fact that the author of Matthew quoted from the wrong prophet in discussing the \\\"Potter's Field.\\\"       Later,      Dave Butler\",\" I don't know where you live, but I couldn't get out of my driveway at night without reverse lights. As someone said, out in the country you notice neat little things like stars and the difference between day and night. At night around my house (which is amongst a forest of rather tall oaks) it is DARK, except for nights with full moons. Reverse lights illuminate my path very well when backing up; I greatly prefer cars with them to cars without operational reverse lights.

Hell, they probably based the encoder on the  chip that cracks it, that way it's easier to break the code, but since it is a  classified algorythm, no one knows that they can crack it so easily.  I, for one, and quite scared of this kind of thing, and plan to support  organizations (and even disorganizations) who are fighting against this Clipper Chip in any way that I can.

However, when politicians say a solution, they donot mean a just solution but  just a solution.  \",\"I went to Staples in Framingham, MA, today, and grabbed the info-sheet on the 450 bundle.

EDT               THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  The speech that  Octavius gave says more than anything I will be able to say today  about why it's important to give all of our young people a chance to  get a work experience and to continue to learn, to merge the nature  of learning and work; why it's important to honor the efforts of  people like Jerry Levin and Nancye Combs and Pat Irving and all of  those who are here.                I want to thank the Secretaries of Labor and Education  and all the people who work with them for sponsoring this; and my  good friend, Governor Wilder, for being here and for speaking; and  all of the business and local community leaders from the city and  county and state level from around America who are here.               This has been a pretty fun day.  (Laughter.)  I loved  hearing the young people sing.  It was music to my ears because it is  their future that we are really struggling about.  (Applause.)  A  year and a half ago I began the quest to seek the presidency because  I was concerned about their future.  Because I believe that our  country, which had always been a beacon of hope for the young, had  too little opportunity, was too divided among ourselves across lines  of income and race and region and other ways, without a vision to  take us into the future.                I entered with the hope that together we could create  more opportunity and insist on much more responsibility from all of  our people.  But in the process we might recreate the best of  America's community, knowing that together we could always to more  than we could individually and that we might secure our future.              All of you here today are committed to that.  The 1,000  jobs that Jerry Levin has committed Time-Warner to is symbolic of the  commitments made by many of the private sector people who are here,  and those who are around the country.  The work that Nancye Combs  does, and the successes of all the young people like those on this  stage, and especially the eloquent statement Octavius Jeffers -- all  those things show that together we know what we need to do, and we're  on the right track.              Last July when I was traveling across America's  heartland in my luxurious bus, I visited Seneca High School in  Louisville, Kentucky.  And there I met young people and business  people who were participating in the Louisville Education and  Employment Partnership.  I saw what Nancye Combs talked about today.   I saw how the young people were making an extra effort to succeed  both in school and at work.  I saw, as I have seen many times in my  own state, the principle illustrated that Octavius has talked about  -- that for millions of American young people it is really an  impediment to both their learning and their ability to be good  workers to draw a sharp dividing line between what is work and what  is learning.              In the world in which we are living, the average young  person will change the nature of work seven or eight times in a  lifetime.  We must learn to merge the work world and the learning  world much better.  And we must determine that all of our young  people see the opportunities that some of them have had showcased  here today.                Whether you're in business or in government or in  education, you know that we have a big job to do when it comes to  building a future that really, honestly includes opportunity for all  of our people.  There are still a lot of people who say, well, things  are pretty good here in Washington and everything's fine; the best  thing we can do about this whole thing is nothing.  They all have  jobs.  (Laughter.)  All the people who say that.  (Applause.)                They all have health insurance.  They all have a pretty  good education.  And they all have a pretty secure knowledge that  they'll be okay no matter what happens.  I say that not to be either  political or unduly critical, but to point out that one of the great  challenges of this age for every advanced nation -- everyone -- is to  fully develop the capacities of all of its people, and then find work  for them to do.              All the European countries have higher unemployment  rates than we do, but also stronger support systems for the  unemployed.  The Japanese unemployment rate has been going up.   They're going to adopt a stimulus that, even if you count it in its  most rigorous terms, is three or four times bigger than the one that  I have proposed to create jobs.               In West Germany alone, the unemployment rate is now  about as high as ours.  This is a big problem for advanced nations.   It costs a lot of money to add an extra employee, with a lot of  pressure from low-wage producers in other countries that are growing  their own economies and trying to provide new opportunity for their  people.                But it is especially important for America for two  reasons:  One is, we have a whole lot of folks who, unless we move  aggressively, will not have the education and skills we need to be  competitive and productive in a nation like this.  The second is,  even if we educate them all, if there aren't jobs they will be robbed  of the fruits of their educational labors.  People need to be able to  work in this country.  (Applause.)              We have always had some unemployment; and, indeed, some  of it is normal.  You've always got some people leaving jobs and  moving around the country and doing first one thing and another.  We  have now, at this moment in our history, the necessity for all big  organizations, including the government, to reexamine the way they  are organized and who ask whether there are too many people working  at some kinds of jobs.  But in the whole, we must still be able to  create jobs in a country like America, to provide people with the  chance to work.                It's going to be difficult for me to make the welfare  reform proposals that I will make to Congress in the next couple of  months -- it's going to be hard for me to make those work if, at the  end of all this work, to get off welfare there isn't a job.   (Applause.)              So we have two tasks.  One is to develop the capacity of  the American people to perform without regard to race or income or  the circumstances of their birth.  The other is to make sure that  there are some opportunities for them to bring to bear for their  talent and to be rewarded with a paycheck.  It is a great challenge.   I do not pretend that all of the answers are simple.  But I know if  you want to ask the American people, all of them, to be more  responsible, if you want to recreate a sense of community in this  country that bridges the lines of race and income and region, you  have got to have opportunity in that mix.               A part of our vision for America has to be a future for  every young person in this country who's willing to play by the rules  and work hard and strive for the end of the rainbow.  There has to be  something at the end of that rainbow.  And that is what we are  basically here to talk about today:  What can we all do as partners,  recognizing none of us can do it alone, to develop the capacities of  our people to succeed wherever they live and whatever their  background.  And then, what can we do to make sure that there's  something there for them to do?        The summer jobs program we're discussing today is an  integral part of that plan, because it will promote the values of  work and opportunity and fairness, community.  It will put the people  first, and it does have a partnership between the public and private  sector.              I said when I addressed the United States Congress in  February on this program that I would seek to create about 700,000  extra summer jobs from government sources and then challenge the  American business community to meet that target so that we can create   more than a million new summer jobs over and above what had been  created before.              Many, many people have responded to that challenge.  And  Jerry is just a shining example of that which has been replicated in  this room and around the country -- people who are going to do more  than they otherwise would in the private sector to give young people  a work experience.  And it is terribly important.              I want to emphasize that this summer jobs program is  part of an overall commitment to increase the capacity of the  American people -- from retraining defense workers who lose their  jobs and other adults who need to acquire new skills; to improving  the transition from school to work for young people who don't go to  college but do need at least two years of post-high school training  either on the job or in a community college or a vocational setting,  so that they can be competitive workers, making it possible for more  people to go on to college who do want to go.              All these things are part and parcel of a comprehensive  plan.  It's also important, as I said, that we create more jobs.  The  emergency jobs program that I asked the Congress to adopt would  create a half a million extra jobs over the next year and a half, and  that would reduce the unemployment rate by a half a percent.  It  would also enable us to absorb more young people coming into the work  force in jobs that otherwise will not be created.               It also will help a lot of cities and counties to  invest in things that need to be done at the grass-roots level -- projects long delayed, water projects, sewer projects, park projects,  new industries and particularly in small and medium-size communities  -- a whole range of things that will improve the economy and improve  the environment.                The summer jobs program is an important part of that  because we have tried for the first time, through the work of the  Labor Department and the Education Department and through reaching  out to people like you, to make this more than just a one-shot summer  jobs program; to integrate it with private sector efforts; to  hopefully replicate it in each coming summer; to move these young  people into further educational opportunities and to further job  opportunities; and to have a strong, meaningful education component  to these summer jobs -- something that the United States government  has never fully emphasized before.                A lot of these young people, as you well know, because  they come from difficult backgrounds, because they go to school in  difficult and challenging circumstances, need extra help in building  their basic skills in math and language, reasoning and in other  areas.  And a lot of educational studies show that young people who  have difficulty in school often forget as much as 30 percent of what  they learn over the summer and then that has to be repeated the next  year.                What we are trying to do here is to give people the  opportunity to learn good work habits and to reinforce their learning  skills and to put them together; and then, hopefully, over the next  couple of years, if our entire program passes, to give every school  in this country the opportunity to have a good work and learning  environment.                There will be more applied academics, more opportunities  for people to learn and work during the school year, so that this  will not simply be an isolated moment for these young folks, but will  be a part of building a whole new educational experience, a whole new  work experience, and moving on a pathway to a better future.              The summer jobs programs are not designed to be make- work jobs.  They're designed to make a future for the people holding  the job.  And that's what they will do.  In the process, they'll help  to build local communities, to strengthen local economies, to solve  local problems.  Real jobs -- renovating housing, repairing public  buildings, doing clerical work, providing nursing assistance in  hospitals, supervising and training children at child care centers,  and learning all the way.  Challenging young people to learn while  they earn, but letting them earn.              You know, it's very difficult to make a case to people  who have never seen opportunity on their own street that they should  do this, that, or the other thing if there's no evidence of the  opportunity that's at the end of the effort.  I have not been sparing  in going for the last year-and-a-half into places where it isn't  exactly popular to say it, and say I wanted to reform the welfare  system; I wanted to toughen child support; I wanted to require people  to work; I was sick and tired of people being irresponsible in the  use of guns on the streets, and I wanted to change all that.  But if  you're going to summon people to greater responsibility, you have to  reward them when they do the right thing with opportunity.   (Applause.)              The young people we propose to put to work under our  program will spend 90 hours learning basic skills, such as math,  reading, writing -- either on the job in the classroom.  They will  stretch their minds as well as work up a sweat.  They will have a  sense of accomplishment.  It will literally be a summer challenge,  but a challenge that will take them into a different life.              So I want to ask all of you to support this effort even  as I, as your President, support your effort.  At the end of the  summer we will evaluate all the young people who participate.  We'll  see whether they, instead of falling behind over the summer  academically as too many young people do, they stayed even or moved  ahead.  I suspect that they will.                This summer, Secretary Reich and Secretary Riley and I  will be visiting many of your communities.  We'll really try to learn  from you which of these efforts are working, what we should do next  summer, how we can build it in to what goes on during the school  year, how we can build in our job training efforts and the works that  we do with your companies to make sense of this whole thing -- so  that we maximize the impact of the taxpayer dollar and your private  investments as well.               We want to honor the companies and the communities, the  business leaders and the young people who do the very best jobs this  summer.  And, again, I want to say to all of you in private business  who have matched our effort, I thank you.  And to all of you who  haven't, and those across the country who may listen or learn about  this event today, I want to implore other private employers to  stretch a little bit to give other young people a chance to work this  summer.  I'm telling you, we cannot go through another 10 years when  we don't give these children anything to say yes to.  If we exhort  them to do right, we've got to be able to reward them.  (Applause.)              When the other speakers were talking, I was sitting up  here on the platform, listening and reveling.  And they got talking  about work, and I got to thinking about all the different things I've  done to make a living in my life.  When I was 13, I made a very  foolish short-term business investment:  I set up a comic book stand  and sold two trunks full of comic books.  Made more money than I had  ever had in my life.  But if I had saved those trunks, they'd be  worth $100,000 today.  (Laughter.)              That does not mean young people should not be  entrepreneurial.  It just means that you can't foresee a generation  ahead.  I have mowed yards and cleared land and built houses and  worked in body shops and the parts departments of a car dealership.   And I've done a lot of different things for a living.  Some  people say I got into politics to escape work.  (Laughter.)                I learned something from every job I ever had.  But I  grew up in a generation where I literally did not know a living soul  without regard to race or income who wanted to work who didn't have a  job.  I grew up in a generation when all you had to really say to  people is, get an education and you'll be all right.  You'll get a  job and you'll make more money next year than you did this year.  Now  I live in a generation full of people, most of whom don't make any  more money in real dollars than they did 10 years ago and they're  working longer hours and they're paying more for the basics of life.   And we are now wondering whether we can create the jobs that these  young people want.              Now, I want to close by reemphasizing these two things:   It doesn't matter what kind of economic policies this administration  pursues, or how much productivity increases there are in the private  sector, if young Americans don't get a good education, don't learn  how to work and can't be productive, those jobs will not be created  in this country.  Machines will do the work or the work will be done  off-shore by people who have the same skill levels and can work for a  third or a fourth or a fifth the wages.  So nothing we can do  economically will matter unless we build the skills and capacities of  America's work force.  And anybody that pretends otherwise is just  kidding.                On the other hand, we need to be honest.  Every wealthy  country in the world, including the United States, is having  difficulty creating jobs.  If I knew everything that needs to be done  I'd be glad to tell you and we   could just call off the whole  deliberations of Congress and everything else.  I don't have all the  answers.  But I know this:  Doing nothing is not the answer.   (Applause.)              And so the jobs program that I have presented to  Congress, with the summer jobs, with the money for the cities and the  counties, through the Community Development Program, with the  infrastructure money, is a small part of a big budget.  It is an  attempt to engage in an experiment to see whether or not, with the  economy recovering in terms of corporate profit, we can give a little  boost to it, give opportunities to young people, create a half a  million jobs and maybe get the engine going again.              Most of the jobs in this program are going to be jobs in  the private sector, not government jobs, even though it's government  money.  And the lion's share of the work in rebuilding the American  economy obviously will come from the private sector.  That's the kind  of system we have and it works pretty well.                But this is the challenge we have.  So I ask all of you  here today to support the summer jobs program, to ask your friends  and neighbors to support it, to go back home and ask your employers  to make a little extra effort; to do what you can to help me pass the  funds to create the 700,000 jobs that the United States government  should create this summer, so that together we can have this  partnership.  Because more than anything else, we have to give a  future -- a future that our young people can believe in.                We need to send them a message that here in America if  you study hard and work hard, if you obey the law and contribute  something to your community, you will be rewarded by your country.   You can build a future from you own dreams.               That has always been the promise of America.  Together  that's what this summer of challenge needs to be:  a reaffirmation of  the promise of America for so many young people to whom that promise  has been an illusion.  We can make it a reality.              Thank you very much.  (Applause.)\",\" I would hardly consider the BD's to be Christian.  They were acting in direct contradiction to scripture.  Jesus' Second Coming is something that everyone will know of.  Jesus also predicted that there will be false Messiahs who will use His name.  His prophecy has been fulfilled.   I agree with you there.    Me too.  I have already given my life to God.  If God tells me to lay down my life, it will be to save another life.    Do you judge all Christians by the acts of those who would call themselves Christian and yet are not?  The BD's contradicted scripture in their actions.  They were NOT Christian.  Simple as that.  Perhaps you have read too much into what the media has portrayed.  Ask any true-believing Christian and you will find that they will deny any association with the BD's.  Even the 7th Day Adventists have denied any further ties with this cult, which was what they were.  Do you judge all Muslims by the acts committed by Saddam Hussein, a  supposedly devout Muslim?  I don't.  Saddam is just a dictator using the religious beliefs of his people to further his own ends.

My sister's ex-boyfriend was such an incessant pain in the ass about wanting to ride my bikes (no way, Jose) that I finally took him to Lindner's BMW in New Canaan, CT last fall where I had seen a nice, used K100RS in perfect condition.  After telling everyone in the shop his Norton war stories from fifteen years ago, signing the liability waiver, and getting his pre-flight, off he went...  Well, not quite.  I walked out of a pizza shop up the street, feeling good about myself (made my sister's boyfriend happy and got the persistent wanker off my ass for good), heard the horrendous racket of an engine tortured to its red line and then a crash.  I saw people running towards the obvious source of the disturbance... Jeff laying under the BMW with the rear wheel spinning wildly and someone groping for the kill switch.  I stared in disbelief with a slice hanging out of my mouth as Matty, the shop manager, slid up beside me and asked, \\\"Friend of yours, Steve?\\\".  \\\"Shit, Matty, it could have been worse.  That could been my FLHS!\\\"  Jeff hadn't made it 10 inches.  Witnesses said he lifted his feet before letting out the clutch and gravity got the best of him. Jeff claimed that the clutch didn't engage.  Matty was quick. While Jeff was still stuttering in embarrassed shock he managed to snatch Jeff's credit card for a quick imprint and signature.  Twenty minutes later, when Jeff's color had paled to a flush, Matty presented him with an estimate of $580 for a busted right mirror and a hairline crack in the fairing.  That was for fixing the crack and masking the damaged area, not a new fairing.  Or he could buy the bike.  I'm not sure what happened later as my sister split up with Jeff shortly afterwards (to hook up with another piece of work) except that Matty told me he ran the charge through in December and that it went uncontested.  \",\"Is anyone reading this message involved with the new BMW plant?

The material in John (I'm not sure exactly what is referred to here, but I'll take for granted the similarity to the Matt./Luke \\\"Q\\\" material) IS different; hence, one could have almost any relationship between the two, right up to John getting it straight from Jesus' mouth.   The version of the \\\"usual theory\\\" I have heard has Matthew and Luke independently relying on Mark and \\\"Q\\\".  One would think that if Luke relied on Matthew, we wouldn't have the grating inconsistencies in the geneologies, for one thing.   This is the part that is particularly new to me.  If it were possible that you could point me to a reference, I'd be grateful.    Because it closes up the gap between (supposed) writing and the existing copy quit a bit.  The further away from the original, the more copies can be written, and therefore survival becomes more probable.     I'm not really impressed with the \\\"theology\\\" argument.  But I'm really pointing this out as an \\\"if\\\".  And as I pointed out earlier, one cannot make these arguments about I Peter; I see no reason not to accept it as an authentic letter.    The best analogy would be reporters talking to the participants, which is not so bad.

I am not sure where OBs stand in this regard, but I suspect that they are at least as good as the radioligists (flame-retardant suit ready).                       \",\" This probably only tells you that the DC blocking capacitor that's in series between the one-chip, single-ended audio amp and the speaker terminal is there.   Open it up and look for the power amp \\\"ICs\\\".  They'll be fairly obvious.  Replace the one connected to the dead output.    Well, one thing you should do is poke around the terminals of the power amp chips.  Use a probe with a 10M resistor (like a scope probe) connected to the input of a small audio amp w/speaker.  If you find line-level input to both chips, one of the chips is bad and can probably replaced pretty easily.    If you want to pick off a near-line-level signal, suitable for feeding to an outboard amp, the outer legs of the volume control pot will often be good enough.  This is *before* the volume control (and usually before the tone and balance controls too).  If you take off from the center and ground legs of the volume pot, this will be after the volume control (but again, probably  before the other controls).    If the unit is a modern type with an electronic volume control chip, you should probably forget the whole thing. \",\"I keep finding these programmers in local junk shops.

If the gospels are the least bit accurate, then there can be little doubt that Jesus belived hell was a reality.  As a teacher, what would be the wise and loving thing to do if people in your audience were headed there?  To warn them!  It would, however,  be rather cruel and/or sadistic to believe that such a place exists  and then remain quiet about it.    The only scenario I can envision in which dimished respect would be justified is if Jesus knew there was no such place as hell, and spoke about it anyway, just to scare people.

In fact, of all the people I know who have migraines, none have been so similar.  There is such a wide variation between people with respect to what causes their headaches, that I generally don't bother sharing what I've learned about mine, but since ours seem to be alike, here are my observations.  I don't think it's heat, per se (I've had more in winter than summer). Dehydration could conceivably figure, though.  Try tanking up before playing rather than after.  Being in shape doesn't seem to help me much, either.  I've identified four factors that do make a difference (listed in  descending order of importance):  1) Heavy exercise 2) Sleep deprivation 3) Fasting  (e.g., skipped breakfast) 4) Physical trauma (e.g., head bonk)  Heavy exercise has preceded all of my post-adolescent migraines, but I  don't get migraines after every heavy exercise session.  One or more of  the other factors *must* be present (usually #2).  Since I discovered  this, I've been nearly migraine-free -- relapsing only once every two  or three years when I get cocky (\\\"It's been so long, maybe I just don't  get them anymore\\\") and stop being careful.

Q. How do I become an astronaut?      A. We will assume you mean a NASA astronaut, since it's probably     impossible for a non-Russian to get into the cosmonaut corps (paying     passengers are not professional cosmonauts), and the other nations have     so few astronauts (and fly even fewer) that you're better off hoping to     win a lottery. Becoming a shuttle pilot requires lots of fast-jet     experience, which means a military flying career; forget that unless you     want to do it anyway. So you want to become a shuttle \\\"mission     specialist\\\".      If you aren't a US citizen, become one; that is a must.  After that,     the crucial thing to remember is that the demand for such jobs vastly     exceeds the supply.  NASA's problem is not finding qualified people,     but thinning the lineup down to manageable length. It is not enough     to be qualified; you must avoid being *dis*qualified for any reason,     many of them in principle quite irrelevant to the job.      Get a Ph.D.  Specialize in something that involves getting your hands     dirty with equipment, not just paper and pencil.  Forget computer     programming entirely; it will be done from the ground for the fore-     seeable future.  Degree(s) in one field plus work experience in     another seems to be a frequent winner.      Be in good physical condition, with good eyesight. (DO NOT get a     radial keratomy or similar hack to improve your vision; nobody knows     what sudden pressure changes would do to RKed eyes, and long-term     effects are poorly understood.  For that matter, avoid any other     significant medical unknowns.)  If you can pass a jet-pilot physical,     you should be okay; if you can't, your chances are poor.      Practise public speaking, and be conservative and conformist in     appearance and actions; you've got a tough selling job ahead, trying     to convince a cautious, conservative selection committee that you     are better than hundreds of other applicants.  (And, also, that you     will be a credit to NASA after you are hired:  public relations is     a significant part of the job, and NASA's image is very prim and     proper.)  The image you want is squeaky-clean workaholic yuppie.     Remember also that you will need a security clearance at some point,     and Security considers everybody guilty until proven innocent.     Keep your nose clean.      Get a pilot's license and make flying your number one hobby;     experienced pilots are known to be favored even for non-pilot jobs.      Work for NASA; of 45 astronauts selected between 1984 and 1988,     43 were military or NASA employees, and the remaining two were     a NASA consultant and Mae Jemison (the first black female astronaut).     If you apply from outside NASA and miss, but they offer you a job     at NASA, ***TAKE IT***; sometimes in the past this has meant \\\"you     do look interesting but we want to know you a bit better first\\\".      Think space:  they want highly motivated people, so lose no chance     to demonstrate motivation.      Keep trying.  Many astronauts didn't make it the first time.         NASA     National Aeronautics and Space Administration     Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center     Houston, Texas      Announcement for Mission Specialist and Pilot Astronaut Candidates     ==================================================================      Astronaut Candidate Program     ---------------------------      The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has a need for     Pilot Astronaut Candidates and Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidates     to support the Space Shuttle Program. NASA is now accepting on a     continuous basis and plans to select astronaut candidates as needed.      Persons from both the civilian sector and the military services will be     considered.      All positions are located at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in     Houston, Texas, and will involved a 1-year training and evaluation     program.      Space Shuttle Program Description     ---------------------------------      The numerous successful flights of the Space Shuttle have demonstrated     that operation and experimental investigations in space are becoming     routine. The Space Shuttle Orbiter is launched into, and maneuvers in     the Earth orbit performing missions lastling up to 30 days. It then     returns to earth and is ready for another flight with payloads and     flight crew.      The Orbiter performs a variety of orbital missions including deployment     and retrieval of satellites, service of existing satellites, operation     of specialized laboratories (astronomy, earth sciences, materials     processing, manufacturing), and other operations. These missions will     eventually include the development and servicing of a permanent space     station. The Orbiter also provides a staging capability for using higher     orbits than can be achieved by the Orbiter itself. Users of the Space     Shuttle's capabilities are both domestic and foreign and include     government agencies and private industries.      The crew normally consists of five people - the commander, the pilot,     and three mission specialists. On occasion additional crew members are     assigned. The commander, pilot, and mission specialists are NASA     astronauts.      Pilot Astronaut      Pilot astronauts server as both Space Shuttle commanders and pilots.     During flight the commander has onboard responsibility for the vehicle,     crew, mission success and safety in flight. The pilot assists the     commander in controlling and operating the vehicle. In addition, the     pilot may assist in the deployment and retrieval of satellites utilizing     the remote manipulator system, in extra-vehicular activities, and other     payload operations.      Mission Specialist Astronaut      Mission specialist astronauts, working with the commander and pilot,     have overall responsibility for the coordination of Shuttle operations     in the areas of crew activity planning, consumables usage, and     experiment and payload operations. Mission specialists are required to     have a detailed knowledge of Shuttle systems, as well as detailed     knowledge of the operational characteristics, mission requirements and     objectives, and supporting systems and equipment for each of the     experiments to be conducted on their assigned missions. Mission     specialists will perform extra-vehicular activities, payload handling     using the remote manipulator system, and perform or assist in specific     experimental operations.

Ability to pass a NASA Class I space physical which is similar to a     military or civilian Class I flight physical and includes the following     specific standards:    Distant visual acuity:        20/50 or better uncorrected        correctable to 20/20, each eye.    Blood pressure:        140/90 measured in sitting position.      4. Height between 64 and 76 inches.      Citizenship Requirements      Applications for the Astronaut Candidate Program must be citizens of     the United States.      Note on Academic Requirements      Applicants for the Astronaut Candidate Program must meet the basic     education requirements for NASA engineering and scientific positions --     specifically: successful completion of standard professional curriculum     in an accredited college or university leading to at least a bachelor's     degree with major study in an appropriate field of engineering,     biological science, physical science, or mathematics.        The following degree fields, while related to engineering and the     sciences, are not considered qualifying:       - Degrees in technology (Engineering Technology, Aviation Technology,  Medical Technology, etc.)       - Degrees in Psychology (except for Clinical Psychology, Physiological  Psychology, or Experimental Psychology which are qualifying).       - Degrees in Nursing.       - Degrees in social sciences (Geography, Anthropology, Archaeology, etc.)       - Degrees in Aviation, Aviation Management or similar fields.      Application Procedures     ----------------------      Civilian      The application package may be obtained by writing to:   NASA Johnson Space Center  Astronaut Selection Office  ATTN: AHX  Houston, TX 77058      Civilian applications will be accepted on a continuous basis. When NASA     decides to select additional astronaut candidates, consideration will be     given only to those applications on hand on the date of decision is     made. Applications received after that date will be retained and     considered for the next selection. Applicants will be notified annually     of the opportunity to update their applications and to indicate     continued interest in being considered for the program. Those applicants     who do not update their applications annually will be dropped from     consideration, and their applications will not be retained. After the     preliminary screening of applications, additional information may be     requested for some applicants, and person listed on the application as     supervisors and references may be contacted.      Active Duty Military      Active duty military personnel must submit applications to their     respective military service and not directly to NASA. Application     procedures will be disseminated by each service.      Selection     ---------      Personal interviews and thorough medical evaluations will be required     for both civilian and military applicants under final consideration.     Once final selections have been made, all applicants who were considered     will be notified of the outcome of the process.      Selection rosters established through this process may be used for the     selection of additional candidates during a one year period following     their establishment.      General Program Requirements      Selected applicants will be designated Astronaut Candidates and will be     assigned to the Astronaut Office at the Johnson Space Center, Houston,     Texas. The astronaut candidates will undergo a 1 year training and     evaluation period during which time they will be assigned technical or     scientific responsibilities allowing them to contribute substantially to     ongoing programs. They will also participate in the basic astronaut     training program which is designed to develop the knowledge and skills     required for formal mission training upon selection for a flight. Pilot     astronaut candidates will maintain proficiency in NASA aircraft during     their candidate period.      Applicants should be aware that selection as an astronaut candidate does     not insure selection as an astronaut. Final selection as an astronaut     will depend on satisfactory completion of the 1 year training and     evaluation period. Civilian candidates who successfully complete the     training and evaluation and are selected as astronauts will become     permanent Federal employees and will be expected to remain with NASA for     a period of at least five years. Civilian candidates who are not     selected as astronauts may be placed in other positions within NASA     depending upon Agency requirements and manpower constraints at that     time. Successful military candidates will be detailed to NASA for a     specified tour of duty.      NASA has an affirmative action program goal of having qualified     minorities and women among those qualified as astronaut candidates.     Therefore, qualified minorities and women are encouraged to apply.      Pay and Benefits     ----------------      Civilians      Salaries for civilian astronaut candidates are based on the Federal     Governments General Schedule pay scales for grades GS-11 through GS-14,     and are set in accordance with each individuals academic achievements     and experience.      Other benefits include vacation and sick leave, a retirement plan, and     participation in group health and life insurance plans.      Military      Selected military personnel will be detailed to the Johnson Space Center     but will remain in an active duty status for pay, benefits, leave, and     other similar military matters. \",\"According to BBC Radio this morning, UK, Denmark, Portugal & a few others have vetoed a proposal to limit EC-sold bikes to 100 BHP.

This day marked the first testimony of the trial.  Deputy U.S. Marshal Larry Cooper took the stand for the prosecution.  The short version is that his testimony was consistent with the opening statements for the prosecution.  Cooper testified that he had arrived in Spokane (Washington) on August 17, 1992 to participate in a surveillance operation with five other deputies near the Weaver cabin.  The team was using night vision equipment for surveillance, and split up into two teams of three people.  The six later met at an observation point above the cabin.  After this, deputies Cooper, William Degan, and Arthur Roderick began a descent to scout further possible surveillance sites.  Cooper told the court that Roderick threw two large rocks into a gully to see, \\\"whether the [Weaver family] dogs would respond.\\\" Striker, the Weaver's yellow lab, started toward them barking loudly.  Roderick led the three in a run from the area.  They ran through some dense woods into an open area [called the \\\"fern field\\\"] with the dog in pursuit.  By this time, Kevin Harris and Samuel Weaver had joined the chase.  The surveillance team had reached a Y in the road: Cooper decided that they should take cover in the woods because otherwise they would be an easy target and might be \\\"shot in the back.\\\"  As Degan reached the Y, he spotted Randy Weaver coming down the road from the cabin ahead.  Weaver was startled but did not fire.  At this moment, Striker reached Degan, and Cooper had to \\\"fend him off with his gun.\\\"  [It is unclear whether this means he clubbed the dog or shot the dog].  Both Cooper and Degan then took cover in the woods.  According to Cooper, Kevin Harris and Samuel Weaver continued walking down the road, apparently not noticing the two.  After they had passed by on the road, Degan got up on one knee, raised his gun, and shouted, \\\"Stop!  U.S. Marshal!\\\"  Harris then \\\"...brought the weapon around at hip level and fired.  He didn't bring the weapon up to eye level.  I saw Bill's arm going back, and I knew he had been hit.\\\"  Cooper fired at Harris, and Harris went down.  Cooper then brought his weapon to bear on Samuel, but did not fire.  At this point, Cooper then heard two shots to his right.  Samuel Weaver looked in the direction of the shots, yelled, \\\"You son of a bitch!\\\" and ran toward them.  Cooper then realized that shots were coming at him from directly ahead, so he fired a three-round burst at the cabin.  At this point he then saw Samuel Weaver running toward the cabin.  When Cooper reached Degan, he placed his first two fingers on Degan carotid artery, counted two or three beats, and then his heart stopped.  Shortly thereafter, Roderick and the other three marshals joined him.  They then all heard a large burst of gunfire from the area around the cabin.  On cross-examination, David Nevin questioned the point of throwing rocks into the gulley, asking, \\\"You wanted to lure that dog out so you could shoot that dog, didn't you?\\\"  Nevin also pointed out that in last September's testimony, Cooper had claimed that he spotted Weaver after the dog had left him. Cooper claimed that he had gone over the events in his head and decided that Thursday's account was correct.  Nevin continued the cross-examination by asking what Cooper would have done had an armed man dressed in full camouflage jumped out of the woods at him [no answer was available].  Friday, April 16 marks continued cross-examination of Cooper.  Notes: There was no coverage of protestors.  Drew ============================================================== \",\" That's nothing.

The original documentation for the sound hardware (IM-3) documents how to make sound by directly accessing hardware.  Basically, you jam values into all the even bytes from SoundBase to SoundBase+0x170. This was because of how the Mac 128 (and some later machines) generated sound was by scanning this block and D/Aing every even byte (the odd bytes went to the floppy on some machines).  When the Mac II (and Apple Sound Chip) was invented, it was designed to generate stereo sound. It was also designed to be compatible with we had once documented. So storing bytes at the even values at SoundBase meant \\\"I want to play a mono sound\\\" and so it was emulated. But Apple had since retracted the documentation on SoundBase and decided not to document the lowest layers of sound generation. So apple never explained where to stuff bytes if you want to make stereo sound.  Enter game developers. The sound driver and current sound manager are inconveniently lame for making games. Furthermore, people who port from the IBM don't want to learn more APIs. So, it has become popular for game writers to write to SoundBase to make sound, since it is very easy.  Since the Mac II, Apple has had many different kind of sound output hardware, and the only things they have in common are that writing to SoundBase works. On some hardware, (Mac II, IIx, IIcx, IIci at least), writing to SoundBase gets you mono sound through both speakers. On some Macs (Quadra 700/900/950 at least) writing to SoundBase gets you mono sound on the left channel only. Both are technically correct interpretations of the original specification, but one is obviously preferable for asthetic reasons.  If developers use the Sound Manager (and I think the sound driver), mono sounds will (typically) come out through both channels regardless of the underlying hardware. It is possible to specify you want to generate left channel only, but no one does. If developers write to sound base, their games will only come out the left on some games.  The other problem, the original Mac II only producing left channel sound on the internal speaker, while the SE/30 mixes both, isn't really related. It is due to the post generation amplification used on the motherboards of the different machines. It only affects true stereo sounds. Sounds which are actually mono, will play on the internal speaker, no matter what machine you have.  Now, to more directly address the question, the games you list: and also Hellcats, Super Tetris Oxyd (and many more, these are just what I've tested)  Cheat and write to SoundBase and so are only left channel on Quadras.   Other games you list: and also PGA Tour Golf Civilization (and more, these are again only from personal experience)  Use the sound manager and work fine on all machines.  The more of the story is to developers: DON'T CHEAT! Really, I am absolutely, positively not allowed to do what I am about to do, but I'm going say it anyway. Stop cheating on sound! Really soon, you will be sorry, as even those without external speakers will be disappointed with your sound on future hardware. The grace period is about to end. The Sound Manager is understandable now, and works pretty well and will work even better soon, so use it.  In conclusion: To Doug, it isn't a hardware problem, at least, not a bug. To Jon, it isn't a choice to developers as to whether they want to send sound to both channels. If they do it the right way, it is taken care of automatically. If you cheat, there is not way to make it work on all hardware.   Have fun.  Disclaimer number 1: I don't work on sound here at Apple, I'm just pretty well informed. So don't write me with sound questions.  Disclaimer number 2: If it says up above that I wrote anything like \\\"the grace period is about to end\\\" then it is a bug in your news feed, since I am catagorically not allowed to say anything like that. You know what I mean.

Most of my friends are anti-gun, and without exception NONE of them bases his/her opinions on facts. They would rather believe (despite all evidence to the contrary) that disarming law-abiding citizens would make the world more civilized, when all it really does is make us all sheep. They  would rather wallow in their pitiful liberal white guilt about how society has driven the criminal to rob, rape, and murder. They  support spending millions of public dollars protecting the rights of scum who have already demonstrated that they have no regard for society or its laws. They ignore the fact that areas with the strictest gun control (NYC,DC) have the worst crime and areas with little gun control (VT,NH,ID) have very little crime in comparison. But they have to ignore this because otherwise they would need to confront the fact that law-abiding citizens who own guns are not the ones that are causing most of the trouble in society. Oh no, we certainly can't accept that!

Anthony Fauci, director of the  U.S.  National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID),  said,  \\\"We must address the question of how to treat people as  early as we possibly  can with drugs that are safe enough to give  people for years and that will  get around microbial resistance.\\\"  He said any delay would signify questions  over safety and  resistance rather than a lack of funds.

This finding  supports previous conclusions by health  experts that the chance of  contracting HIV from a health care  worker is remote.  Three studies in the  JAMA demonstrate that  thousands of patients were treated by two HIV-positive  surgeons  and dentists without becoming infected with the virus.  The  studies  were conducted by separate research teams in New  Hampshire, Maryland, and  Florida.  Each study started with an  HIV-positive doctor or dentist and  tested all patients willing to participate.  The New Hampshire study found  that none of the  1,174 patients who had undergone invasive procedures by an   HIV-positive orthopedic surgeon contracted HIV.

The OAM is a small division of  the NIH, with its budget only at $2  million dollars compared to more than $10  billion for the NIH as  a whole.  In addition, the money for available  research grants is even smaller.  About $500,000 to $600,000 total will be  available this year for 10 or 20 grants.  Kaiya Montaocean, of the Center  for  Natural and Traditional Medicine in Washington, D.C., says  the OAM is afraid  to become involved in AIDS.  \\\"They have to look successful and there is no  easy answer in AIDS,\\\" she said.    There is also a common perception that the  OAM will focus on  fields the NIH establishment will find non-threatening,  such as  relaxation techniques and acupuncture.  When the OAM called for  an  advisory committee conference of about 120 people last year,  the AIDS  community was largely missing from the meeting.  In  addition, activists'  general lack of contact with the Office has  added suspicion that the epidemic  will be ignored.  Jon  Greenberg, of ACT-UP/New York, said, \\\"The OAM advisory  panel is  composed of practitioners without real research experience.

Scientists conducting test tube experiments have found that  herpesvirus- 6 can attack the human immune system's natural killer cells.  This attack  causes the killer cells to malfunction,  diminishing an important component in  the immune system's fight  against diseases.  Also, the herpesvirus-6 may be a  factor in  immune diseases, such as AIDS.  In 1989, Paolo Lusso's research   found that herpesvirus-6 attacks another white cell, the CD4  T-lymphocyte,  which is the primary target of HIV.  Lusso also  found that herpesvirus-6 can   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 44 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  kill natural killer cells.   Scientists previously knew that the natural  killer cells of  patients infected with HIV do not work correctly.  Lusso's   research represents the first time scientists have indicated that natural  killer cells are vulnerable to any kind of viral attack,  according to Anthony  L. Komaroff, a researcher with Harvard  Medical School.  Despite the test-tube  findings, scientists are  uncertain whether the same result occurs in the  body.  Lusso's  team also found that herpesvirus-6 produces the CD4 receptor   molecule that provides access for HIV.  CD4 T-lymphocytes express this surface  receptor, making them vulnerable to HIV's attack.   Researchers concluded that  herpesvirus-6 cells can exacerbate the affects of HIV.       ======================================================================                                    April 15, 1993       ====================================================================     \\\"AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village: To the Editor\\\" Journal of the  American Medical Association (04/07/93) Vol. 269,  No. 13, P. 1636  (Gellert,  George and Nordenberg, Dale F.)        All health-care workers are obligated and responsible for not  only  ensuring that politicians understand the dimensions of  certain health  problems, but also to be committed to related  policies, write George Gellert  and Dale F. Nordenberg of the  Orange County Health Care Agency, Santa Ana,  Calif., and the  Emory University School of Public Health in Atlanta, Ga.,   respectively.  Dr. Berkley's editorial on why American doctors  should care  about the AIDS epidemic beyond the United States  details several reasons for  the concerted interest that all  countries share in combating AIDS.  It should  be noted that while AIDS leads in hastening global health interdependence, it  is not  the only illness doing so.  Diseases such as malaria and many   respiratory and intestinal pathogens have similarly inhibited the economic  development of most of humanity and acted to marginalize large populations.   Berkley mentions the enormous social and  economic impact that AIDS will have  on many developing countries, and the increased need for international  assistance that will  result.  Berkley also cites the lack of political  aggressiveness  toward the AIDS epidemic in its first decade.  But now there  is a new administration with a promise of substantial differences in  approach  to international health and development in general, and  HIV/AIDS in  particular.  Vice President Al Gore proposes in his  book \\\"Earth in the  Balance\\\" a major environmental initiative that includes sustainable  international development, with programs to  promote literacy, improve child  survival, and disseminate  contraceptive technology and access throughout the  developing  world.  If enacted, this change in policy could drastically   change the future of worldwide health.  ====================================================================    \\\"AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village: In Reply\\\" Journal of the American   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 45 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  Medical Association (04/07/93) Vol. 269,  No. 13, P. 1636  (Berkley, Seth)        Every nation should tackle HIV as early and aggressively as    possible  before the disease reaches an endemic state, even at a  cost of diverting less  attention to some other illnesses, writes  Seth Berkley of the Rockefeller  Foundation in New York, N.Y., in  reply to a letter by Drs. Gellert and  Nordenberg.  Although it is true that diseases other than AIDS, such as  malaria and  respiratory and intestinal illnesses, have similarly inhibited   economic development in developing countries and deserve much  more attention  than they are getting, Berkley disagrees with the  contention that AIDS is  receiving too much attention.  HIV  differs from other diseases, in most  developing countries because it is continuing to spread.  For most endemic  diseases, the  outcome of neglecting interventions for one year is another  year  of about the same level of needless disease and death.  But with  AIDS  and its increasing spread, the cost of neglect, not only in  disease burden  but financially, is much greater.  Interventions  in the early part of a  rampantly spreading epidemic like HIV are  highly cost-effective because each  individual infection prevented significantly interrupts transmission.  Berkley  says he agrees  with Gellert and Nordenberg about the gigantic social and   economic effects of AIDS and about the need for political  leadership.  But he  concludes that not only is assertive  political leadership needed in the  United States for the AIDS  epidemic, but even more so in developing countries  with high  rates of HIV infection and where complacency about the epidemic   has been the rule.

The trial will compare the safety of three HIV experimental vaccines in 90  children recruited from at least 12 sites nationwide. Volunteers must be HIV- infected but have no symptoms of HIV disease.   HHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala said this initial study can be seen as \\\"a  hopeful milestone in our efforts to ameliorate the tragedy of HIV-infected  children who now face the certainty they will develop AIDS.\\\"   Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., director of the National Institute of Allergy and  Infectious Diseases and of the NIH Office of AIDS Research, said the trial \\\"is  the first step in finding out whether vaccines can help prevent or delay  disease progression in children with HIV who are not yet sick.\\\"  If these  vaccines prove to be safe, more sophisticated questions about their  therapeutic potential will be assessed in Phase II trials.   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 10,000 children in  the United States have HIV.  By the end of the decade, the World Health  Organization projects 10 million children will be infected worldwide.   The study will enroll children ages 1 month to 12 years old.  NIAID, which  funds the AIDS Clinical Trials Group network, anticipates conducting the trial  at nine ACTG sites around  the country and three sites participating in the  ACTG but funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human  Development.   Preliminary evidence from similar studies under way in infected adults shows  that certain vaccines can boost existing HIV-specific immune responses and   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 47 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  stimulate new ones.  It will be several years, however, before researchers  know how these responses affect the clinical course of the disease.   The results from the pediatric trial, known as ACTG 218, will be examined  closely for other reasons as well.  \\\"This trial will provide the first insight  into how the immature immune system responds to candidate HIV vaccines,\\\" said  Daniel Hoth, M.D., director of NIAID's division of AIDS.  \\\"We need this  information to design trials to test whether experimental vaccines can prevent  HIV infection in children.\\\"   In the United States, most HIV-infected children live in poor inner-city  areas, and more than 80 percent are minorities, mainly black or Hispanic.   Nearly all HIV-infected children acquire the virus from their mothers during  pregnancy  or at birth.  An infected mother in the United States has more than  a one in four chance of transmitting the virus to her baby.  As growing  numbers of women of childbearing age become exposed to HIV through injection  drug use or infected sexual partners, researchers expect a corresponding  increase in the numbers of infected children.   HIV disease progresses more rapidly in infants and children than in adults.   The most recent information suggests that 50 percent of infants born with HIV  develop a serious AIDS-related infection by 3 to 6 years of age.  These  infections include severe or frequent bouts of common bacterial illnesses of  childhood that can result in seizures, pneumonia, diarrhea and other symptoms  leading to nutritional problems and long hospital stays.   At least half of the children in the trial will be 2 years of age or younger  to enable comparison of the immune responses of the younger and older  participants.  All volunteers must have well-documented HIV infection but no  symptoms of HIV disease other than swollen lymph glands or a mildly swollen  liver or spleen.  They cannot have received any anti-retroviral or immune- regulating drugs within one month prior to their entry into the study.   Study chair John S. Lambert, M.D., of the University of Rochester Medical  School, and co- chair Samuel Katz, M.D., of Duke University School of  Medicine, will coordinate the trial assisted by James McNamara, M.D., medical  officer in the pediatric medicine branch of NIAID's division of AIDS.   \\\"We will compare the safety of the vaccines by closely monitoring the children  for any side effects, to see if one vaccine produces more swollen arms or  fevers, for example, than another,\\\" said Dr. McNamara.  \\\"We'll also look at  whether low or high doses of the vaccines stimulate immune responses or other  significant laboratory or clinical effects.\\\"   He emphasized that the small  study size precludes comparing these responses or effects among the three   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 48 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  products.   The trial will test two doses each of three experimental vaccines made from  recombinant HIV proteins.  These so-called subunit vaccines, each genetically  engineered to contain only a piece of the virus, have so far proved well- tolerated in ongoing trials in HIV-infected adults.   One vaccine made by MicroGeneSys Inc. of Meriden, Conn., contains gp160--a  protein  that gives rise to HIV's surface proteins--plus alum adjuvant.   Adjuvants boost specific immune responses to a vaccine.  Presently, alum is  the only adjuvant used in human vaccines licensed by the Food and Drug  Administration.   Both of the other vaccines--one made by Genentech Inc. of South San Francisco  and the other by Biocine, a joint venture of Chiron and CIBA-Geigy, in  Emeryville, Calif.--contain the major HIV surface protein, gp120, plus  adjuvant.  The Genentech vaccine contains alum, while the Biocine vaccine  contains MF59, an experimental adjuvant that has proved safe and effective in  other Phase I vaccine trials in adults.   A low dose of each product will be tested first against a placebo in 15  children.  Twelve children will be assigned at random to be immunized with the  experimental vaccine, and three children will be given adjuvant alone,  considered the placebo.  Neither the health care workers nor the children will  be told what they receive.   If the low dose is well-tolerated, controlled testing of a higher dose of the  experimental vaccine and adjuvant placebo in another group of 15 children will  begin.   Each child will receive six immunizations--one every four weeks for six  months--and be followed-up for 24 weeks after the last immunization.

They report that HIV itself, not an opportunistic infection, caused scaling  skin conditions to develop in mice carrying the genes for HIV.  Although the  HIV genes were active in the mice, they did not compromise the animals'  immunity, the researchers found.  This led them to conclude that the HIV  itself caused the skin disease.   Our findings support a growing body of evidence that HIV can cause disease  without affecting the immune system, said lead author Dr. Jeffrey Kopp of the  National Institute of Dental Research (NIDR).  Dr. Kopp and his colleagues  described their study in the March issue of AIDS Research and Human  Retroviruses.   Developing animal models of HIV infection has been difficult, since most  animals, including mice, cannot be infected by the virus.  To bypass this  problem, scientists have developed HIV-transgenic mice, which carry genes for  HIV as well as their own genetic material.   NIDR scientists created the transgenic mice by injecting HIV genes into mouse  eggs and then implanting the eggs into female mice.  The resulting litters  contained both normal and transgenic animals.   Institute scientists had created mice that carried a complete copy of HIV  genetic material in l988.  Those mice, however, became sick and died too soon  after birth to study in depth.  In the present study, the scientists used an  incomplete copy of HIV, which allowed the animals to live longer.   Some of the transgenic animals developed scaling, wart-like tumors on their  necks and backs.  Other transgenic mice developed thickened, crusting skin  lesions that covered most of their bodies, resembling psoriasis in humans.  No  skin lesions developed in their normal, non-transgenic littermates.   Studies of tissue taken from the wart-like skin tumors showed that they were a  type of noncancerous tumor called papilloma. Although the papillomavirus can  cause these skin lesions, laboratory tests showed no sign of that virus in the  animals.   Tissue samples taken from the sick mice throughout the study revealed the  presence of a protein-producing molecule made by the HIV genetic material.    HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 50 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  Evidence of HIV protein production proved that the viral genes were \\\"turned  on,\\\" or active, said Dr. Kopp.   The scientists found no evidence, however, of compromised immunity in the  mice:  no increase in their white blood cell count and no signs of common  infections.  The fact that HIV genes were active but the animals' immune  systems were not suppressed confirms that the virus itself was causing the  skin lesions, Dr. Kopp said.   Further proof of HIV gene involvement came from a test in which the scientists  exposed the transgenic animals to ultraviolet light.  The light increased HIV  genetic activity causing papillomas to develop on formerly healthy skin.   Papilloma formation in response to increased HIV genetic activity proved the  genes were responsible for the skin condition, the scientists said.  No  lesions appeared on normal mice exposed to the UV light.   The transgenic mice used in this study were developed at NIDR by Dr. Peter  Dickie, who is now with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious  Diseases.   Collaborating on the study with Dr. Kopp were Mr. Charles Wohlenberg, Drs.  Nickolas Dorfman, Joseph Bryant, Abner Notkins, and Paul Klotman, all of NIDR;  Dr. Stephen Katz of the National Cancer Institute; and Dr. James Rooney,  formerly with NIDR and now with Burroughs Wellcome.

Shalala today announced the first nationwide  clinical consultation telephone service for doctors and other health care  professionals who have questions about providing care to people with HIV  infection or AIDS.       The toll-free National HIV Telephone Consulting Service is staffed by a  physician, a nurse practitioner and a pharmacist. It provides information on  drugs, clinical trials and the latest treatment methods.  The service is  funded by the Health Resources and Services Administration and operates out of  San Francisco General Hospital.       Secretary Shalala said, \\\"One goal of this project is to share expertise  so patients get the best care.  A second goal is to get more primary health  care providers involved in care for people with HIV or AIDS, which reduces  treatment cost by allowing patients to remain with their medical providers and  community social support networks.  Currently, many providers refer patients  with HIV or AIDS to specialists or other providers who have more experience.\\\"       Secretary Shalala said, \\\"This clinical expertise should be especially  helpful for physicians and providers who treat people with HIV or AIDS in  communities and clinical sites where HIV expertise is not readily available.\\\"       The telephone number for health care professionals is 1-800-933-3413, and  it is accessible from 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. EST (7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. PST)  Monday through Friday.  During these times, consultants will try to answer  questions immediately, or within an hour.  At other times, physicians and  health care providers can leave an electronic message, and questions will be  answered as quickly as possible.       Health care professionals may call the service to ask any question  related to providing HIV care, including the latest HIV/AIDS drug treatment  information, clinical trials information, subspecialty case referral,  literature searches and other information.  The service is designed for health  care professionals rather than patients, families or others who have alternate  sources of information or materials.       When a health care professional calls the new service, the call is taken  by either a clinical pharmacist, primary care physician or family nurse  practitioner.  All staff members have extensive experience in outpatient and  inpatient primary care for people with HIV-related diseases.  The consultant  asks for patient-specific information, including CD4 cell count, current  medications, sex, age and the patient's HIV history.       This national service has grown out of a 16-month local effort that   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 52 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  responded to nearly 1,000 calls from health care providers in northern  California.  The initial project was funded by HRSA's Bureau of Health  Professions, through its Community Provider AIDS Training (CPAT) project, and  by the American Academy of Family Physicians.       \\\"When providers expand their knowledge, they also improve the quality of  care they are able to provide to their patients,\\\" said HRSA Administrator  Robert G.

And   for hours the old Molokan scout and I plodded north across parching plains.   Like Lot's wife I looked back once to see smoke bathing all, doubtless in   a sack of other Moslem villages up to the line of snow that was Iran.'\\\"  p. 354.  \\\"At morning tea, Dro and his officers spread out a map of this whole  high region called the Karabakh. Deep in tactics, they spoke Russian,  but I got their contempt for Allied 'neutral' zones and their distrust  of promises made by tribal chiefs. A campaign shaped; more raids on  Moslem villages.\\\"  p. 358.  \\\"It will be three hours to take,\\\" Dro told me. We'd close in on three  sides. \\\"The men on foot will not shoot, but use only the bayonets,\\\" Merrimanov said, jabbing a rifle in dumbshow. \\\"That is for morale,\\\" Dro put in. \\\"We must keep the Moslems in terror.\\\" \\\"Soldiers or civilians?\\\" I asked. \\\"There is no difference,\\\" said Dro. \\\"All are armed, in uniform or not.\\\" \\\"But the women and children?\\\" \\\"Will fly with the others as best they may.\\\"  p. 360.  \\\"The ridges circled a wide expanse, its floors still. Hundreds of feet   down, the fog held, solid as cotton flock. 'Djul lies under that,' said   Dro, pointing. 'Our men also attack from the other sides.'   Then, 'Whee-ee!' - his whistle lined up all at the rock edge. Bayonets  clicked upon carbines. Over plunged Archo, his black haunches rippling;  then followed the staff, the horde - nose to tail, bellies taking the  spur. Armenia in action seemed more like a pageant than war, even though   I heard our Utica brass roar.   As I watched from the height, it took ages for Djul to show clear. A tsing  of machine-gun fire took over from the thumping batteries; cattle lowed,  dogs barked, invisible, while I ate a hunk of cheese and drank from a snow  puddle. Mist at last folded upward as men shouted, at first heard faintly.  The came a shrill wailing.   Now among the cloud-streaks rose darker wisps - smoke. Red glimmered about  house walls of stone or wattle, into dry weeds on roofs. A mosque stood in  clump of trees, thick and green. Through crooked alleys on fire, horsemen  were galloping after figures both mounted and on foot.   'Tartarski!' shouted the gunner by me. Others pantomimed them in escape  over the rocks, while one twisted a bronze shell-nose, loaded, and yanked  breech-cord, firing again and again. Shots wasted, I thought, when by  afternoon I looked in vain for fallen branch or body. But these shots and  the white bursts of shrapnel in the gullies drowned the women's cries.   At length all shooting petered out. I got on my horse and rode down toward  Djul. It burned still but little flame showed now. The way was steep and   tough, through dense scrub. Finally on flatter ground I came out suddenly,  through alders, on smoldering houses. Across trampled wheat my brothers-in-  arms were leading off animals, several calves and a lamb.\\\"  p. 361 (fourth paragraph).  \\\"Corpses came next, the first a pretty child with straight black hair,   large eyes. She looked about twelve years old. She lay in some stubble   where meal lay scattered from the sack she'd been toting. The bayonet   had gone through her back, I judged, for blood around was scant. Between   the breasts one clot, too small for a bullet wound, crusted her homespun   dress.   The next was a boy of ten or less, in rawhide jacket and knee-pants. He   lay face down in the path by several huts. One arm reached out to the   pewter bowl he'd carried, now upset upon its dough. Steel had jabbed   just below his neck, into the spine.    There were grownups, too, I saw as I led the sorrel around. Djul was   empty of the living till I looked up to see beside me Dro's German-speaking   colonel.

In     general, however, systems connected to 'the net' fall in one of three     categories: Internet, Usenet, or BITNET. Electronic mail may be sent     between these networks, and other resources available on one of these     networks are sometimes accessible from other networks by email sent to     special 'servers'.      The space and astronomy discussion groups actually are composed of     several mechanisms with (mostly) transparent connections between them.      One mechanism is the mailing list, in which mail is sent to a central     distribution point which relays it to all recipients of the list. In     addition to the general lists for space (called SPACE Digest for     Internet users, and SPACE on BITNET), there are a number of more     specialized mailing lists described below.      A second mechanism is Usenet 'netnews'. This is somewhat like a bulletin     board operating on each system which is a part of the net. Netnews     separates contributions into hundreds of different categories based on a     'group name'. The groups dealing most closely with space topics are     called 'sci.space.news', 'sci.space', 'sci.space.shuttle', 'sci.astro',     and 'talk.politics.space'. Contributors 'post' submissions (called     'articles' in netnews terminology) on their local machine, which sends     it to other nearby machines. Similarly, articles sent from nearby     machines are stored locally and may be forwarded to other systems, so     that an article is posted locally and eventually reaches all the Usenet     sites interested in receiving the news group to which the article was     posted.      Gateway machines redirect the Usenet sci.space group into Internet and     BITNET mailing lists and vice versa; the other Usenet groups are not     accessible as mailing lists. If you can receive netnews, its more     flexible interface and access to a wider range of material usually make     it the preferred option.  MAILING LISTS      SPACE Digest is the main Internet list, and is now being run by the     International Space University (in only its second change of management     in over a decade). Email space-request@isu.isunet.edu (message body     should be in the format 'subscribe space John Public') to join. Note     that the moderated SPACE Magazine list is defunct at present for lack of     a moderator. Old copies of SPACE Digest since its inception in 1981 are     available by anonymous FTP. Retrieve  julius.cs.qub.ac.uk:pub/SpaceDigestArchive/README     for further details.      Elements is a moderated list for fast distribution of Space Shuttle     Keplerian Elements before and during Shuttle flights. NASA two line     elements are sent out on the list from Dr. Kelso, JSC, and other sources     as they are released. Email to elements-request@telesoft.com to join.      GPS Digest is a moderated list for discussion of the Global Positioning     System and other satellite navigation positioning systems. Email to     gps-request@esseye.si.com to join.      Space-investors is a list for information relevant to investing in     space-related companies. Email Vincent Cate (vac@cs.cmu.edu) to join.      Space-tech is a list for more technical discussion of space topics;     discussion has included esoteric propulsion technologies, asteroid     capture, starflight, orbital debris removal, etc. Email to     space-tech-request@cs.cmu.edu to join. Archives of old digests and     selected excerpts are available by anonymous FTP from     gs80.sp.cs.cmu.edu (128.2.205.90) in /usr/anon/public/space-tech,     or by email to space-tech-request if you don't have FTP access.      SEDS-L is a BITNET list for members of Students for the Exploration and     Development of Space and other interested parties. Email     LISTSERV@TAMVM1.BITNET with a message saying \\\"SUBSCRIBE SEDS-L your     name\\\". Email saying \\\"INDEX SEDS-L\\\" to list the archive contents.      SEDSNEWS is a BITNET list for news items, press releases, shuttle status     reports, and the like. This duplicates material which is also found in     Space Digest, sci.space, sci.space.shuttle, and sci.astro. Email     LISTSERV@TAMVM1.BITNET saying \\\"SUBSCRIBE SEDSNEWS your name\\\" to join.     Email saying \\\"INDEX SEDSNEWS\\\" to list the archive contents.      Ron Baalke (baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov) runs a mailing list which     carries the contents of the sci.space.news Usenet group. Email him     to join the list.      As a general note, please mail to the *request* address to get off a     mailing list. SPACE Digest, for example, relays many inappropriate     'please remove me from this list' messages which are sent to the list     address rather than the request address.  PERIODICALLY UPDATED INFORMATION      In addition to this FAQ list, a broad variety of topical information is     posted to the net (unless otherwise noted, in the new group     sci.space.news created for this purpose). Please remember that the     individuals posting this information are performing a service for all     net readers, and don't take up their time with frivolous requests.

It takes *more* than a great GM to win a stanley cup, even once.  Some of the guys on the list you gave earlier never won one.  I agree that you and I could probably argue back and forth for days to no avail about who is the best GM in hockey- that is a matter of opinion, and who is to say my opinion is any better  than yours or yours than mine?  But the point of my *original* original post (if not well stated) was that Murray has the GM abilities but not the coaching abilities.  Which leads to below:   I think at this point there's a personal, emotional element involved here which transcends Murray's logical thought.  As outsiders, it's fine for  us to say, \\\"He should hire a different coach.\\\"  In fact, he has talked about doing so in the past.  But, the press (here in Detroit, at least) has so built up this business about Murray never getting past the second round of the playoffs as a coach, that I think he has taken it upon himself to  prove to the world that he *is* capable of coaching a team past the second round.  He needs to, as the papers say, \\\"get that monkey off his back.\\\" So it becomes a matter not of intelligence, but of pride.  Is it foolish to let pride stand in the way of sound logic?  Perhaps, but we're all a little that way from time to time.  I think eventually he'll step down from behind the bench and concentrate on his GM duties, and the team will improve as a result.  I think his coaching duties take away time he might have otherwise spent on GM work.  In that sense, once he steps down as coach, we'll see how good of a GM he really is.   I may not agree with everything you've said, but it's been fun discussing it with you. \",\"# # Unfortunately, homosexuals don't believe in this concept of freedom. # # They believe that they have a right to FORCE people to hire them, # # rent to them, and do business with them, regardless of the feelings # # or beliefs of the other person. #  # <ha ha ha#, oh, Clayton, you're so good, so consistent, so predictable, # yup, that's right, they, these homosexual people want to FORCE you to # ignore what's none of your fucking business.

Yet, when a law was proposed for Virginia that extended this  philosophy to cigarette smokers (so that people who smoked away from the work couldn't be discriminated against by employers), the liberal Gov.

Yes, on the showroom floor, the cars have this deep, lustrous shine that just can't be found on paint jobs that aren't clear coated.  On the other hand, it seems that every clear coated car that I've seen on the road (in a parking lot, etc.) has fine scratches throughout the paint job.  As does, alas, my 1992 Laser.  Several weeks ago I had my car professionally polished and waxed. When I picked it up, it had that same showroom shine that I remember from a year ago when I bought it.  Several days ago I took my car to the dealership for some work.  As an added bonus, they washed my car.  Unfortunately, whoever washed it either didn't get the roof (which is black, the rest of the car is red) completely clean before he dried it, or he used a dirty towel.  Now my showroom shine is a haze of fine scratches that aren't really visible until the light hits the roof at a particular angle.  I am, to put it mildy, somewhat peeved about this.  Do I have any  chance of getting the dealership to do something about this? My guess is 'no'.  Is there any product on the market that provides a solution to this problem?  Or am I faced with the prospect of having the car professionally polished again to hide the scratches?

The fact that this is precisely what the US was up to of course is not mentioned. It is a fact that Regan and Bush sold arms to Iran, it is also a fact that they supported and armed Iraq.  Still this is state dept propaganda so none too surprizing.   In the case of Lybia there is the problem that the US only decided that Gadffii ordered the bombing after it needed to make peace with damascus during the gulf war. One day the US is certain that its Syria, the next Lybia. For a strange reason the US will not provide evidence to Lybian courts for extradition proceedings. Faced with similar demands the USA would reject them as would any other country.    The word is \\\"terrorism\\\".

The people there are rather pissed off because the USA first supported the Shah who they loathed and then supported Saddam when he mounted an unprovoked attack.  Hardly surprizing after the embassy hostage crisis but Iran is meant to be the country run by unreasonable bigots not the USA so if there is to be movement it would be easier for the USA to move.  First off they could recognise Iraqu's responsibility in initiating the Iran/Iraq war. Providing technical assistance to Iran to get it's oil production back up to capacity would also be a smart move, at the moment  Iran is above it's OPEC ceiling. If they had extra capacity they would use it and bring down the oild price further which is in our interests.  The Iranian clerics would have an interest in seeking a raprochment  simply because a permanent war footing is debilitating. They also need western technology.  \",\"there is a file out there (look for it with archie) that is called 'theref22.zip' which has lots of info on various PC things, amongst which is also a detailed description of all Floppy controller commands, I think hard drive controller commands are not there.  it is possible to read an entire track including all gaps, sector headers etc.   by setting sector size to something very large (like 8K).\",\"I have the EuroWiper boots in White and had to throw away the first pair since I found no way of cleaning them after they looked almost black.

I believe I discussed countersteering a horse before.  Basically, there are two ways to steer a horse, plow-rein and neck-rein.  Plow-reining steers him by keeping the reins separate, and you pull in the direction you wish to go.  Neck-reining steers a horse by holding the reins together in one hand, and pulling against the horse's neck in the direction you wish to go.  When training a plow-steering horse to neck-rein, one technique is to cross the reins under his necks.  Thus, when neck-reining to the left, the right rein pulls against the right side of the neck, but the left side of the bit (which the horse is used to from his plow-reining days).  Are you sorry you asked yet? \",\"  Nonsense.  I quite clearly state that it was Greg that made the claim that Gainey never made an error.  And he made the claim. Read below.  From rec.sport.hockey Thu Apr 15 21:22:49 1993 From: gballent@hudson.UVic.CA (Greg  Ballentine) Message-ID: <1993Apr15.160450.27799@sol.UVic.CA>  [nonsense deleted]  Gainey is the best defensive forward ever.  I stand by that assessment. He was a very good player who belongs in the hall of fame.  Did you ever watch him play? He never made a technical error.  [more nonsense deleted]   To knowledgeable observers of the game my meaning is obvious.  Your hockey education is not my responsibility.    He was just another player.  To laud him as anything more I find bothersome.  I hated the Habs.  I hated Lafleur until I realized that he was likely the most aesthetically pleasing player to ever  skate in my lifetime.  Why would anyone talk about Gainey?      Did he play hockey at a high level?  Was he any good?  If not, why would you bother to bring JC up?  I am talking about hockey players here.  If you can't follow the conversation don't follow up.  As I said previously, it is not my responsibility to educate you.   Sure.  Two journeymen.  Big deal.  Neither one of them is worth discussing.     That is an excellent idea and if I decide to waste any more time responding to any of your, or Greg's, postings then I will be sure to implement that very macro.    Tarasov claimed that Gainey was a \\\"hockey god.\\\"  And Greg ate it up. And that is what this thread is all about.  If you didn't know  that then why are you responding?  And as for \\\"blanket disregard for these individuals\\\", I can remember  Leaf teams, purely populated by such \\\"individuals\\\", winning four  Stanley Cups.  Teams.  No one ran around telling us that George Armstrong was the best hockey player in the world.   Right.  I had to get to the end of your posting before I realized you were  a complete joke.  In the future, if you are going to respond to my postings I would appreciate it if you could present a cogent argument supported by facts gleaned from a version of reality that most of the rest of us would recognize.  cordially, as always,   rm \",\"What resources and services are available on Internet/BITNET which would be of interest to hospitals and other medical care providers?

We have too many people with their heads in the sand saying it cannot happen here, as our Constitutional Rights are being trashed every day because the government justifies doing some end-run around the protections by a 'crisis' requiring 'drastic action'.   It is most likely that in the future possession of secure encryption tools will be regarded as possession of 'terrorist and drug dealers tools', and be some serious Fedaral Felony. Just like common tools are 'burgular tools' if the police say so, common computer programs (even computers themselves) are now 'hackers tools', and will become 'terrorist tools'.  BET ON IT.  The insights of someone who has lived throught this are very important. If the US goes the way of the old Soviet Union and its client states as far as individual rights, privacy and overall freedom are concerned, the rest of the world (remember 'New World Order'?) will not be far behind - only a few years.  Please keep posting anything you find that is deficient or that threatens ones rights in this thing.  For example, a conversation between a suspect and a lawyer will no longer be private from Big Brother eavesdropping.  Political dissent allready is very dangerous in this country, all it takes is the government to decide that enough people will take one seriously, then one becomes guilty of 'plotting to overthrow the government by illegal means'.  The phrase 'illegal means' is defined as whatever the government wants it to be defined as.  Couple this with Clinton's pressing for a 'smart' National ID card (an 'Internal passport'?), with the added wrinkle that anything about you and your past can be put on it, and you can only take the government's word as to what is really on it (since they will be the only ones with the means to completely read and reprogram the thing).  Isn't that nice?  While the Feds can bust into one's safe without the keys, the owner knows his safe has been broken into.  When they break into your 'secure' phone conversations (or other stored/transmitted data in the near future) you have no way of knowing, so accountability as to the legalities has gone out the window.  Just like a safe, if they have a legal cause, they can get the keys from the suspect, just like they can get the keys to a safe or the combination from the suspect.  Same with encryption: Record everything, get the warrants, THEN decode it with the keys obtained from the suspect.  This Clinton Cripple, along with its natural extensions, will make any priviliged communications between client and lawyer, and any meaningful political dissent virtually impossible.  Which is the general idea. Any propeganda about its being secure, and the safeguards, and all of that are just that - propeganda to reassure people so they will by into this monstrosity.

And, just for the record, rarely do you shift gears when merging into traffic..that is what 5 speeds are good for..4th is good up through around 80-90, most of the time, so you can just wind it out.. it's not going to hurt anything, and keeps it in the powerband anyway.. only shift into top gear when you are exceeding redline in 4th(fairly rare, unless you drive a ferrari or some such, i'd bet) or when you hit cruising  speed where you feel comfortable(or when my mother is sitting in the  passanger seat complaining about how you wind her \\\"poor little engine\\\" way too hi :-) Just my HO's..\",\" YOUR sex life, maybe....\",\"[why are atheists atheists/ believes it could be the result of \\\"brokenness\\\"]   i agree -- if you are going to find out anything from people who don't share your beliefs, do not attack them or condescend to them and hope to get a neutral picture of them.  come to them with an open mind.   well, you do believe in something, as i see it, even if it is a sort of \\\"anti-belief\\\" (no negative connotation meant; i mean simply that you believe that God _does not_ exist).  christians can also feel that sense of \\\"difference\\\", however, when they are associated with \\\"those weird televangelists who always talk about satan\\\".  if you'll excuse the cliched sound of this, everyone has to deal with his/ her differences from other people.  i can understand how being an atheist could be hard for you; being a christian is sometimes hard for me.   you should not have to repress how you feel -- you should be able to discuss it without fear.  i think there are admirable things to learn from any belief, which can enrich your own -- by asking myself the questions that atheists may ask me, i can learn the answers and become stronger in my faith.  if my faith can't support knowing the answers to those questions, it is weak and untrue.    in some way the pressures were different, of course, because you \\\"chose\\\" your beliefs -- or are you saying that they were not your choice, but born of necessity?  [please, no flames about whether or not gay people \\\"choose\\\" their lifestyle -- that's elsewhere in this newsgroup]   i'm not sure i understand this sentence -- could you explain?  [moderator points out that many/ most atheists aren't \\\"hostile\\\", they just cease believiing in xiantiy/ religion]   ouch, yes.  part of being a christian is accepting _everyone_ with an open heart -- including people of \\\"our own camp\\\" with whom we completely disagree.  by the same token, i believe that accusation and suspicion are not the best way to reach out to those not of our faith, nor is it effective to try to browbeat people into accepting our religion.  i have a different idea of mission: be what i am, a christian who is happy in her faith, and if others see that and want to know about either the happiness or the religion, i'll share what i know without pressure and let them make their own decisions.  at some point you just have to agree to disagree -- acceptance of diversity, not uniformity, is the way to sow peace....   vera noyes\",\"    > If the  new  Kuiper belt object *is*  called 'Karla', the next    >one  should be called 'Smiley'.

Sincerely, Nathaniel\",\"  just to satiate my curiosity, why would this make you the stupid one?  It seems to me, everybody SHOULD be aware enough of what is going on.  You do not need to calculate the future position.  You need to look at your mirrors a little more.  If you glance around, you will be able to tell how much faster than you the car is going.  Maybe not precisely, but well enough to know if you should let him around before you try to pass.  I know what you are talking about, about the other driver being startled, because i myself have been startled by drivers cruising by at around 90-100mph when i'm doin 55-65.  The problem, though, as i saw it, was not their fault for barreling around me, but my fault for not paying the attention to my task-at-hand that i should have been. Oddly enough, since the 2nd time(happened 2x in around 4 mo. when i'd had my liscence for around 6 mo), i haven't been startled..and i've been passed by cars doing roughly twice the speed of my car.  Another odd occurance is the fact that this only seems to happen on LONG trips...and if i drive along with them, it doesn't happen at all :-) even on the long trips! :-)  (adrenaline will do that to you...i've had bad cop experiences with speeding, so anything over the limit is adrenalizing for me...scared i'll get caught :-)  Maybe they should raise the limit, so we can pay better attention.....  just curious, and my .otwo\",\" Someone else said something similar.  I will not comment on the value or lack of value of Elias's \\\"proposal\\\".  I just want to say that it is very distressing that at least two people here are profoundly ignorant of Nazi racial doctrine.  They were NOT like Elias's idea, they were more like the opposite.    Nazis believed in racial purity, not racial assimilation.  An  instructive example is the Nazi attitude to Gypsies.  According to  Nazi theoreticians, Gypsies were an Aryan race.  They were persecuted, and in huge numbers murdered, because most European Gypies were considered not pure Gypsies but \\\"mongrels\\\" formed from the pure Gypsy  race and other undesirable races.  This was the key difference between  the theoretical approach to Jews and Gypsies, by the way.  It is also  true that towards the end of WWII even the \\\"purist\\\" Gypsies were  hunted down as the theory was forgotten.\",\"DH>>Does anyone out their have a mountain tape backup that I could compare DH>>notes with, (jumper settings, software, ect...)

Are you saying they thought the effort was profitable or that the money was efficiently spent (providing max value per money spent)?  I think they would answer yes on ballance to both questions. Exceptions would be places like the US from the French Indian War to the end of the US Revolution.   But even after the colonies revolted or where given independance the British engaged in very lucrative trading with the former colonies. Five years after the American Revolution England was still the largest US trading partner.

Hams are unlikely to have an illegal amp,  and are also unlikely to have a \\\"dirty\\\" amp.     Hams can legally run up to 1500 watts.  It is very unlikely, however,    that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car.  Ham rigs  Not possible either.  You'd need about a 300 amp alternator for just the amplifier.  I can just see it.  You need to slow down on a downgrade,  so you hit the push to talk button.     for cars put out around 100 watts.  It is possible that a 100 watt    radio would cause interference to consumer electronic 100 feet     away.  Most TVs, stereos, and VCRs have very poor RF shielding.    If you experience the problem frequently, it may be     caused by a ham, CBer, or other radio operator in a base station    nearby.    The interference may have been caused by a radio     transmitter used for other purposes, such as police, fire,    etc.  If you heard voices over your stereo, I think you are    correct in assuming that the source is an RF transmitter.     If you have frequent trouble, you may want to try the RF ferrite    chokes available at Radio Shack.  The interference is probably    being picked up by your speaker wires, and those chokes can    be installed on the wires very easily (without cutting them).    Good instructions are included with the chokes.    If that does not solve the problem, you may want to search your    neighborhood for a radio operator.  Look for antennas on the roof    or car.  Talk to him/her about your problem.  There are things    a radio operator can do to reduce interference.  And please remember to be friendly when approaching your local radio operator.  This person may or may not be the  cause of your troubles,  and you'll get better cooperation and help if you assume that he is going to be helpful (most are).  It was amazing the accusations that we sometimes dealt with as I grew up.  We were blamed for skip (ghost pictures on the TV that occur at sunspot peaks),  c.b. interferance,  dead grass :),  you name it.    BTW, the local operator should try and help you whether or not he or she is directly responsible.  It is part of being a good neighbor and that is how the FCC views it. Too bad they don't require the consumer equipment makers to take any precautions.  Last, you can usually tell ham radio vs. CB.  Ham operators are required to declare their call (sign) every so many minutes (no more than 10).  So if you hear \\\"This is WA1QT\\\" or some other call starting with A, W or K and no more than 6 total characters, you heard a ham. CB'ers probably won't sign (I don't know that they're even required to) and fire/police have other private ids.      \",\"Has anyone noticed or commented on the fact that so many of those who were willing, nay demanding, that we wait forever for Mr Hussein and Iraq, that we use tremendously costly \\\"sanctions\\\", to avoid a loss of life, are now at the fore front of those clammoring that we should have smashed those \\\"religious radicals\\\" and we were wasting money allowing this stand off to go on  ?

for not posting to alt.clipper, or whatever, but it seems it may not be in the newsfeed here.]  There may be another reason (good from NSA's point of view, horrible from everyone else's) why the algorithm/chip design might be secret.  First, note that the \\\"experts\\\" will only look at \\\"details\\\", and of just  the algorithm:      In addition, respected experts from outside the     government will be offered access to the confidential details of     the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report     their findings.  Why not the chip design?  Well, here's the possiblity:  in addition to encryption, the chip pre-processes voice signals to make them easier to analyze/transcribe electronically.  The chip, once widespread, might effectively be part of a massively parallel computer for \\\"voice- grepping\\\" the US phone network (or the criminal & wrong-thinking patrons thereof).  I wouldn't put it past the NSA.  Think how much easier it would make life for them.  And if this is indeed the case, think of the possible public outcry should it become widely known.  Thus the secrecy.  It might be a good idea to have experts in DSP, voice recognition, and AI conversation-understanding to be on that panel, and insist they be given (authenticatable) design specs and implementation documentation.\",\"Forty-two is six times nine. \",\" Actually, the story goes that Lucifer refused to bow before MAN as  God commanded him to.  Lucifer was devoted to God.  Oh yeah, there is nothing in Genesis that says the snake was anything more than a snake (well, a talking one...had legs at the time, too).  I don't think pointing out contradictions in STORIES is the best way to show the error in theology:  if they think a supernatural entity kicked the first humans out of paradise because they bit into a fruit that gave them special powers...well, they might not respond well to reason and logic.  :^)\",\"  There is a rite like this described in Joseph Campbell's _Occidental_Mythology_.

If you haven't read Campbell, give him a try.   \",\"In this giant bally-ho over this Clipper chip I noticed a rather disturbing trend in some of the E-mail and posts I've tossing back and forth.    Somebody asked me what was wrong about overreacting in cases such as this.  The reason is very simple:  How many people do you want to die in a riot?  In a new Civil War?   Everybody is jumping up and down and screaming about it, and I'm worried that people are going to reach for their hammers and rifles before their pens and paper.    Can people work within the system before trying to break it?  Examine your history books, and find out how many armed revolutions led to Democratic (or Democratic style) governments.  I think you'll only find one in over five thousand years of written history.  That's not very good odds.    Somebody once said something like: \\\"Armed Violence is meant only to be used in response to an armed attack.  It is not meant to be used in agression.  This is the difference between self-defence and murder.\\\"  Let's try to avoid killing things, eh?  There's enough blood shed in the world, without adding a couple of riots, Civil Wars, etc.  I'm probably overreacting.  But what I've read scared me a lot.

The graphics capabilities of the computers were very faked for movie  audiences who have not ability or patience with numbers.  The book was more  realistic in that respect.  In all respects, actually.  The robotics are  still out of range, but not impossible.   SF (and I\\\"ve always wondered how Crichton escapes this classification) is  usually ahead of science in both prediction and precaution.  NASA's  decontaimination processes were supposedly taken to prevent SF story  disasters.  I mean, NASA scientists were often SF readers (and  sometimes writers) and felt pre-warned by their reading.   I think the film still holds up among the best of SF films, but that isn't  saying a whole lot. \",\"  When someone starts criticizing the Leftists for not being Leftist enough, we get a pretty clear idea of what they believe to be normal.

On the non-pacifist side:]  (1) Killing to defend the innocent may be, if anything, _more_ justifiable than killing in self-defense.  I can turn my _own_ other cheek, but I have no right to turn someone else's.  (2) It seems to me that if Jesus had meant to teach pacifism, He would have made His position more explicit.  He didn't tell the centurion to leave the army, for instance; and the NT is full of military metaphors.  [B. On the pacifist side:]  (1) Apparently many early Christians refused to fight in the Roman army, or stated that one should refuse if given a choice.  But it's not clear whether they were objecting to war _per se_, or objecting to Roman policies.  (2) In modern warfare, it seems to be impossible to direct attacks only at combatants.  Bombing, both conventional and nuclear, kills lots of civilians.  (3) It's hard to tell whether any _particular_ war is justified at the time.

There will be no product called C 8.0 (although the command-line compiler of VC++ lists its version as 8.00).  C7 is not a \\\"DOS\\\"-only product -- it is a C/C++ compiler capable of producing executables for DOS or Windows, as is VC++ (Pro. Ed.).  The (significant) difference is that VC++ comes with many Windows-hosted tools (ide, etc) which assist developers in creating Windows executables much more quickly (basically by automating the thousands of lines of boilerplate code).  Initial impressions have been very favorable.  Everyone who is a registered user of C7 should have received a considerable amount of info regarding the specifics of C7.

Basically the Glock is great but I have heard/read that it is a lot harder to learn proper handling because of the type of safety that it has.  I was looking at a Glock .40S&W and the S&W 4006 a couple of weeks ago and the safties on the guns were very different.  The saftey on the 4006 seemed a lot more \\\"safe\\\"  (for lack of a better word) than the one on the Glock.  Of course this could also be a bad thing if you were to pull the gun on somebody.  You would spend more time fiddling around turning the safety off.  Personally I like the Glocks because they are very light and I think they look really cool (guess that's why they use them in so many movies) but I wouldn't get one as my first semi-auto because of the safety.  I would prefer more training with a \\\"traditional\\\" semi-auto (ala Colt .45) but of course that's just my opinion.\",\"  One can't.

Some (but not all) X terminal emulators provide environment variables giving a window ID.  Even if such a thing is present in the environment, it may not be what you want; it may correspond to a window on a different server, for example.       der Mouse\",\" Insofar as several \\\"liberal\\\" jurisdictions are concerned, the essential elements of rape are gender neutral. Nonetheless, I decided to provide a number of references to support my original argument. Black's Law Dictionary (every law student/lawyer's friend) defines rape as: Unlawful sexual intercourse with a female without her consent. The unlawful knowledge of a woman by a man forcibly and against her will. The Model Penal Code (the statute proposed by the National Conference of Commissioners of Uniform State Laws or other organization for adoption by state legislatures) defines rape as: A male who has sexual intercourse with a female not his wife is guilty of rape if he (a) compels her to submit by force or by threat of imminent death....

The 'little thing in the trigger' has to be depressed before the trigger can move.  What this means is the damned thing won't go off until the trigger is pulled.  This makes it just about (there HAVE been some problems, but we're assuming the gun is functioning correctly..) as safe as a revolver.  The gun when working correctly is totally drop safe.  Now, in police work this is a consideration.  There is not a single documented case I'm aware of where a police officer was killed because he failed to operate the safety on his firearm.  There are quite a few documented cases where criminals got hold of the cops gun and couldn't figure out how to get the safety off in time to use the gun, thus the proprietary nature of the safety (to the criminal at least) very likely prevented the office from getting shot.  The purpose of a safety is to make the gun safe from unintentional fire. This does not mean it should be so complicated as to slow down intentional use!  Thus the Glock safety is perfectly adequate from a 'safety' standpoint, but not necessarily the most desirable from the standpoint of open carry where it is easily grabbed by somebody else. By this criteria it DOES make a lot of sense as a concealed carry piece. From the standpoint of police use, it is no better (or worse) than a revolver as far as being 'proprietary' to the officer in the method of firing it.  The ideal solution may someday be biometric sensing of the user so that the firearm can't be used by anybody but it's owner, but for now the wide variety of safety systems helps, unless the criminal happens to be familiar with that particular type of firearm.\",\"Hi,  I found what I believe is an undocumented feature in my windows directory, Microsoft Diagnostics, ver 2.00.

While I can't offer such a proof, it seems pretty damn plausible that if the government does not regulate a particular area, it cannot become a tool of private interests to pursue their own agendas in that area. I rather suspect that it's the sort of government we have NOW that is more likely to become such a tool, and that it IS such a tool in many instances.

The primary reason, and the essence of the details that you are seeking, is that the Grahm-Rudman budget controls were working.  In fact, they were working so well that unless the feds did something, they were going to have to start cutting pork. So Bush and the Democrats got together in a Budget Summit and replaced Grahm-Rudman with the now historic Grand Compromise in which Bush \\\"consented\\\" to raise taxes in exchange for certain caps on spending increases.  As it turned out, the taxes killed the Reagan expansion and the caps on spending increases were dispelled by Clinton in his first act as President (so that he could create his own new plan with more tax increases).

Thanks for your assistance.\",\"Being a parent in need of some help, I ask that you bear with me while I describe the situation which plagues me...  I am a divorced father. Chance would have it that \\\"my weekend\\\" with my  daughter has fallen upon Easter Weekend this year.  Although I am Presbyterian, I had married a Catholic woman. We decided that the Catholic moray of indoctrination of the spouse into the faith was too confining (and restrictive due to time as we had already set a date), and we were married in a Christian Church which was non-denominational.  During the years of our marriage, we did not often attend church.   When our daughter was born, some years later, my wife insisted that she  be baptised as Catholic. This wasn't a problem with me.  During a separation of five years, my ex-wife was taken ill with a disease that affected her mental capacities. She was confined to a mental ward for two months before it was diagnosed. It has since been treated \\\"effectively\\\".  In other words, professionals have deemed her a functioning member of society.  During the recuperation, my ex-wife has embraced Buddism. Her influence over my daughter has been substantial, and has primarily allowed me only Saturday visitation for a number of years. During this period I have read Bible study books to my daughter, and tried to keep her aware of her Christian heritage.  Last fall, our divorce was finalized after a year of viscious divorce hearings. At that time I was awarded visitation rights every other weekend. At that time, I started taking my daughter to church quite often, although not every weekend. I did this to attempt to strengthen the Christian ethic and expose her to a religious community.  Today, Easter Sunday, I took my daughter to church. When it came time for  Communion, my daughter took the bread (The body of Christ) but left the wine (The blood of Christ) professing that she was too young for wine. She then balled the bread up in her hand and tried to descretely throw it under the pew in front of us.  I feel this was a slap in the face to me, my religion, and an afront to her religious heritage. It can be construed as breaking several of the commandments if you try. I really felt dishonored by the action.  My daughter is only nine years old, but I think she should have been old and mature enough to realize her actions. I have difficulty blaming her directly for religious teachings her mother swears to, but when I discussed this with my daughter she made it clear she believed in Buddhism and not Christianity.  My initial response of anger (moderated) was to suggest if there is no faith in Christ then why does she celebrate Easter, or Christmas? I suggested I would never force her to practice my religious beliefs by celebrating holidays with her again.  I do not want to \\\"drive her from the fold\\\", and would be willing to allow her to continue practicing Buddhism (as though I had a choice seeing her only for two days out of fourteen) but I want her to want to embrace Christianity.  Any suggestions?  If you have a response, please e-mail me a copy. (I'm not a regular reader of this newsgroup.) (Naturally, feel free to post too!)  Thanks, and I hope you've had a happy Easter.

If the gift of tounges were the ability to be understood by everyone, no matter what languages they know, there would be no need for the gift of interpretation, and I Corinthians 14 would not have had to have been written.     That's a pretty harsh assumption to make about a several million Christians world wide.  Sure, there are some who want glory for themselves who speak in tounges, just as there are among those who do not have this gift.  There were people like this in the Corinthian church also.  that does not mean that there is no true gift or that all who speak in tounges do it for their own glory in the sight of men.   I would venture to say that a large percentage of those who do speak in tounges  do so more often in private prayer than in public.

How do you avoid situations which encourage criminals?  I'd really like to know.  Would you, say, prohibit female college students from riding their bicycles near the university during the daytime?    Sounds a bit drastic, doesn't it?  Especially when the university is locatd in a nice residential area.  A friend of mine was attacked and nearly raped in just this situation.  The police didn't feel she was in a situation which 'encouraged criminals'.  What do you think?  Should we just tell her, that it was her fault for daring to ride a bicycle in the middle of the day?  That she didn't avoid a situation that encouraged criminals?  If that's the case, then we'd all better put bars on our doors and windows and pray for a police state to keep us all safe.  Crime happens in all situations - there are no defined areas that criminals avoid.  \",\"Sterrenkundig symposium 'Compacte Objecten'                                              op 26 april 1993   In het jaar 1643, zeven jaar na de oprichting van de Universiteit van Utrecht, benoemde de universiteit haar eerste sterrenkundige waarnemer. Hiermee ontstond de tweede universiteitssterrenwacht ter wereld. Aert Jansz, de eerste waarnemer, en zijn opvolgers voerden de Utrechtse sterrenkunde in de daaropvolgende jaren, decennia en eeuwen naar de voorhoede van het astronomisch onderzoek. Dit jaar is het 350 jaar geleden dat deze historische benoeming plaatsvond.  De huidige generatie Utrechtse sterrenkundigen en studenten sterrenkunde, verenigd in het Sterrekundig Instituut Utrecht, vieren de benoeming van hun 'oervader' middels een breed scala aan feestelijke activiteiten. Zo is er voor scholieren een planetenproject, programmeert de Studium Generale een aantal voordrachten met een sterrenkundig thema en wordt op de Dies Natalis aan een astronoom een eredoctoraat uitgereikt. Er staat echter meer op stapel.  Studenten natuur- en sterrenkunde kunnen op 26 april aan een sterrenkundesymposium deelnemen. De onderwerpen van het symposium zijn opgebouwd rond een van de zwaartepunten van het huidige Utrechtse onderzoek: het onderzoek aan de zogeheten 'compacte objecten', de eindstadia in de evolutie van sterren. Bij de samenstelling van het programma is getracht de deelnemer een zo aktueel en breed mogelijk beeld te geven van de stand van zaken in het onderzoek aan deze eindstadia. In de eerste, inleidende lezing zal dagvoorzitter prof. Lamers een beknopt overzicht geven van de evolutie van zware sterren, waarna de zeven overige sprekers in lezingen van telkens een half uur nader op de specifieke evolutionaire eindprodukten zullen ingaan. Na afloop van elke lezing is er gelegenheid tot het stellen van vragen. Het dagprogramma staat afgedrukt op een apart vel. Het niveau van de lezingen is afgestemd op tweedejaars studenten natuur- en sterrenkunde. OOK ANDERE BELANGSTELLENDEN ZIJN VAN HARTE WELKOM!  Tijdens de lezing van prof. Kuijpers zullen, als alles goed gaat, de veertien radioteleskopen van de Radiosterrenwacht Westerbork worden ingezet om via een directe verbinding tussen het heelal, Westerbork en Utrecht het zwakke radiosignaal van een snel roterende kosmische vuurtoren, een zogeheten pulsar, in de symposiumzaal door te geven en te audiovisualiseren. Prof. Kuijpers zal de binnenkomende signalen (elkaar snel opvolgende scherp gepiekte pulsen radiostraling) bespreken en trachten te verklaren. Het slagen van dit unieke experiment staat en valt met de technische haalbaarheid ervan. De op te vangen signalen zijn namelijk zo zwak, dat pas na een waarnemingsperiode van 10 miljoen jaar genoeg energie is opgevangen om een lamp van 30 Watt een seconde te laten branden! Tijdens het symposium zal er niet zo lang gewacht hoeven te worden: de hedendaagse technologie stelt ons in staat live het heelal te beluisteren.  Deelname aan het symposium kost f 4,- (exclusief lunch) en f 16,- (inclusief lunch). Inschrijving geschiedt door het verschuldigde bedrag over te maken op ABN-AMRO rekening 44.46.97.713 t.n.v. stichting 350 JUS. Het gironummer van de ABN-AMRO bank Utrecht is 2900. Bij de inschrijving dient te worden aangegeven of men lid is van de NNV. Na inschrijving wordt de symposiummap toegestuurd. Bij inschrijving na 31 maart vervalt de mogelijkheid een lunch te reserveren.  Het symposium vindt plaats in Transitorium I, Universiteit Utrecht.

I've already pointed out how we aren't nailing DUI's hard enough...  Comparing the US with other countries seldom works, but the European attitude towards alchohol and DUI seems to work.. Their attitude towards weapons isn't really a valid comparison because they've historically done their best to keep the populace disarmed and submissive, while our country was founded by a bunch of rugged individualists who told the European monarchies (for the most part) to take a flying leap (used more polite language though).  We even weaseled out of our first international treaty, and then convinced the French that it was in their best interests not to complain.. But first we had to overcome the fact that the Brits were doing their best to  restrict us to squirrel guns and such, so we'd be properly submissive while they forced us to pay for their wars.  Of course, most American history classes these days tend to gloss over facts that do not fit the image they wish to  convey... I'm glad my Amer.

CIA World Map II ---------------- [  NOTE: this database is quite out of date, and not topologically structured.   If you need a standard for world cartographic data, wait for the   Digital Chart of the World. This 1:1M database has been produced from   the Defense Mapping Agency's ONCs and will be available, together with   searching and viewing software, on a number of CD-ROMs later this summer. ]    Check into HANAUMA.STANFORD.EDU and UCSD.EDU (see ftp list above)   The CIA database consists of coastlines, rivers and political boundaries   in the form of line strokes. Also on hanauma.stanford.edu is a 720x360   array of elevation data, containing one ieee floating point number for   every half degree longitude and latitude.     A program for decoding the database, mfil, can be found on the machine   pi1.arc.umn.edu (137.66.130.11).   There's another program, which reads a compressed CIA Data Bank file and   builds a PHIGS hierachical structure. It uses a PHIGS extension known as   polyline sets for performance, but you can use regular polylines. Ask   Joe Stewart <joes@lpi.liant.com>.   The raw data at Stanford require the vplot package to be able to view it.   (was posted in comp.sources.unix). To be more exact, you'll have to   compile just the libvplot routines, not the whole package.  NCAR data ---------   NCAR (National Center for Atmospheric Research) has many types of   terrain  data, ranging from elevation datasets at   various resolutions, to information about soil types, vegetation, etc.   This data is not free -- they charge from $40 to $90 or more, depending   on the data volume and media (exabyte tape, 3480 cartridge, 9-track tape,   IBM PC floppy, and FTP transfer are all available).  Their data archive   is mostly research oriented, not hobbyist oriented.  For more information,   email to ilana@ncar.ucar.edu.  UNC data tapes with voxel data --------------   There are 2 \\\"public domain\\\" tapes with data for the comparison and   testing of various volume rendering algorithms (mainly MRI and CT   scans). These tapes are distributed by the SoftLab of UNC @ Chapel Hill.   (softlab@cs.unc.edu)    The data sets (volume I and II) are also available via anonymous FTP from   omicron.cs.unc.edu [128.109.136.159] in pub/softlab/CHVRTD  NASA ----   Many US agencies such as NASA publish CD-ROMs with many altimetry data   from various space missions, eg.

Background imagery/textures/datafiles =========================================   First, check in the FTP places that are mentioned in the FAQ or in the FTP list above.  24-bit scanning: ----------------   Get a good 24-bit scanner, like Epson's. Suggested is an SCSI port for   speed. Eric Haines had a suggestion in RT News, Volume 4, #3 :   scan textures for wallpapers and floor coverings, etc. from doll   house supplies.   So you have a rather cheap way to scan patterns that don't have   scaling troubles associated with real materials and scanning area.  Books with textures: --------------------   Find some houses/books/magazines that carry photographic material.   Educorp, 1-619-536-9999, sells CD-ROMS with various imagery - also   a wide variety of stock art is available.   Stock art from big-name stock art houses, such as Comstock,   UNIPHOTO, and Metro Image Base, is available.    In Italy, there's a company called Belvedere that makes such books   for the purpose of clipping their pages for inclusion in your   graphics work. Their address is:  Edition Belvedere Co. Ltd.,  00196 Rome Italy,  Piazzale Flaminio, 19  Tel. (06) 360-44-88, Fax (06)  360-29-60  Texture Libraries: ------------------ a. Mannikin Sceptre Graphics announced TexTiles, a set of 256x256 24-bit    textures. Initial shipments in 24-bit IFF (for Amigas), soon in 24-bit    TIFF format. Algorithmically built for tiled surfaces. SRP is $40 / volume    (each volume = 40 images @ 10 disks). Demo disks for $5 are available.

ESSENCE is a library of 65 (sixty-five) new algoritmic textures for Imagine    by Impulse, Inc. These textures are FULLY compatible with the floating point    versions of Imagine 2.0, Imagine 1.1, and even Turbo Silver.    Written by Steve Worley.

Introduction to rendering algorithms ========================================  a. Ray-Tracing: ---------------    I assume you have a general understanding of Computer Graphics. No? Then read   some of the books that the FAQ contains. For Ray-Tracing, I would   suggest:    An Introduction to Ray Tracing, Andrew Glassner (ed.), Academic Press      1989, ISBN 0-12-286160-4   Note that I have not read the book, but I feel that you can't be wrong   using his book. An errata list was posted in comp.graphics by Eric Haines   (erich@eye.com)  There's a more concise reference also:    Roman Kuchkuda , UNC @ Chapel Hill: \\\"An Introduction to Ray Tracing\\\", in   \\\"Theoretical Foundations for Computer Graphics and CAD\\\", ed. R.A.E.Earnshaw,   NATO AS, Vol. F-40., pp. 1039-1060. Printed by Springer-Verlag, 1988.  It contains code for a small, but fundamentally complete ray-tracer.  b. Z-buffer (depth-buffer) --------------------------  A good reference is:          _Procedural Elements for Computer Graphics_, David F. Rogers,         McGraw-Hill, New York, 1985, pages 265-272 and 280-284.  c. Others: ---------- ??? [ More info is needed -- nfotis ]  ========================================================================  15. Where can I find the geometric data for the: ================================================  a. Teapot ? -----------  \\\"Displays on Display\\\" column of IEEE CG&A Jan '87 has the whole story about origin of the Martin Newell's teapot. The article also has the bezier patch model and a Pascal program to display the wireframe model of the teapot.  IEEE CG&A Sep '87 in Jim Blinn's column \\\"Jim Blinn's Corner\\\" describes an another way to model the teapot; Bezier curves with rotations for example are used.  The OFF and SPD packages have these objects, so you're advised to get them to avoid typing the data yourself.  The OFF data is triangles at a specific resolution (around 8x8[x4 triangles] meshing per patch). The SPD package provides the spline patch descriptions and performs a tessellation at any specified resolution.  b. Space Shuttle ? ------------------  Tolis Lerios <tolis@nova.stanford.edu> has built a list of Space Shuttle datafiles. Here's a summary (From his sci.space list):  model1: A modified version of the newsgroup model (model2)  406 vertices (296 useful, i.e. referred to in the polygon descriptions.) 389 polygons (233 3-vertex, 146 4-vertex, 7 5-vertex, 3 6-vertex). Payload doors non-existent. Units: unknown.  Simon Marshall (S.Marshall@sequent.cc.hull.ac.uk) has a copy. He said there is no proprietary information associated with it.  model2: The newsgroup model, in OFF format. You can find it in  gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au , file pub/off/objects/shuttle.geo hanauma.stanford.edu ,  /pub/graphics/Comp.graphics/objects/shuttle.data  model3: The triangles' model.  This model is stored in several files, each defining portions of the model.  Greg Henderson (henders@infonode.ingr.com) has a copy.  He did not mention any restriction on the model's distribution.  model4: The NASA model.  The file starts off with a header line containing three real numbers, defining the offsets used by Lockheed in their simulations:  <x offset> <y offset> <z offset>  From then on, the file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions  3473 vertices. 2748 polygons (407 3-vertex, 2268 4-vertex, 33 5-vertex, 14 6-vertex,  10 7-vertex, 8 8-vertex, 8 12-vertex, 2 13-vertex, 2 15-vertex,  17 16-vertex, 2 17-vertex, 2 18-vertex, 3 19-vertex, 8 24-vertex). Payload doors closed. Units: inches.  Jon Berndt (jon@l14h11.jsc.nasa.gov) seems to be responsible for the model Proprietary info: unknown  model5: The old shuttle model.  The file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions.  104 vertices. 452 polygons (11 3-vertex, 41 4-vertex). Payload doors open. Units: meters.  We have been using this model at STAR Labs, Stanford University, for some years now. Contact me (tolis@nova.stanford.edu) or my supervisor Scott Williams (scott@star5.stanford.edu) if you want a copy.  ========================================================================  16. Image annotation software =============================  a. Touchup runs in Sunview and is pretty good.  It reads in   rasterfiles, but even if your image isn't normally stored   in rasterfile format you could use screendump to make it a   rasterfile.  b. Idraw (part of Stanford's InterViews distribution) can handle some   image formats in addition to being a MacDraw like tool.  I'm not   sure exactly what they are.   You can ftp the idraw's binary from interviews.stanford.edu.  c. Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)   and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats   other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert   things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.   Tgif's sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu   (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)  d. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).   This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all   your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.  e. You might be able to get by with PBMPlus.  pbmtext gives you text output   bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image.  f. 'ice' requires Sun hardware running OpenWindows 3.It's a PostScript-based   graphical editor,and it's available for anonymous ftp from Internet host   eo.soest.hawaii.edu (128.171.151.12). Requires Sun C++ 2.0 and   two other locally developed packages, the LXT library (an Xlib-based   toolkit) and a small C++ class library. All files (pub/ice.tar.Z,   pub/lxt.tar.Z and pub/ldgoc++.tar.Z) are available in compressed   tar format. pub/ice.tar.Z contains a README that gives installation   instructions, as well as an extensive man page (ice.1).   A statically-linked compressed executable pub/ice-sun4.Z for   SPARC systems is also available for ftp.    All software is the property of Columbia University and may not   be redistributed without permission.    ice means Image Composition Environment and it's an imaging tool that   allows raster images to be combined with a wide variety of   PostScript annotations in WYSIWYG fashion via X11 imaging   routines and NeWS PostScript rasterizing.  g. Use ImageMagick to annotate an image from your X server.  Pick the    position of your text with the cursor and choose your font and pen    color from a pull-down menu.  ImageMagick can read and write many   of the more popular image formats.  ImageMagick is available as   export.lcs.mit.edu: contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z or at your nearest   X11 archive.  ========================================================================  17.

A flow library allows graphs to employ broadcast, merge,   synchronization, conditional, and sequencing control strategies.    WIT delivers an object-oriented, distributed, visual programming   environment which allows users to rapidly design solutions to their   imaging problems. Users can consolidate both software and hardware   developments within a complete CAD-like workspace by adding their   own operators (C functions), objects (data structures), and servers   (specialized hardware). WIT runs on Sun, HP9000/7xx, SGI and supports   Datacube MV-20/200 hardware allowing you to run your graphs in real-time.

This was   developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working   for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL   or would be willing to buy it.  It's a few thousand dollars (American) I   expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general   purpose packages I've heard of, besides what TerraMar has.   SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I'm not sure how general purpose   it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I   have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh   transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image   modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I've   used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best   speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large   images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That's a   freebie if you want it\\\"    \\\"My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,   Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its   programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It   handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing   the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even   Excel on the Mac if it's not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH   Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which   that combination couldn't handle, and the speed and ease of use   (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it's mostly astronomical   image processing which I've been doing. This means image enhancement,   cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image   processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity   versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve   fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.) \\\"  [ For IDL call Research Systems , for PV-WAVE call Precision Visuals and  for SIPS call University of Colorado @ Boulder .

The system can be distri-  buted among workstations, between supercomputers and  works-  tations,  and between supercomputers, workstations and video  animation controllers.  The system is most commonly used  to  produce  video based movie displays of images resulting from  visualization of time dependent data, complex 3D data  sets,  and  image  processing  operations.

SVLIB widgets are macro-widgets    comprising lower level Motif widgets such as buttons, scrollbars,    menus, and drawing areas. It is designed to address the reusability    of 2D visualization routines and each widget in the library is an    encapsulation of a specific visualization technique such as colormap    manipulation, image display, and contour plotting. It is targetted   to run on UNIX workstations supporting OSF/Motif. Currently, only    color monitors are supported. Since SVLIB is a collection of widgets    developed in the same spirit as the OSF/Motif user interface widget    set, it integrates seamlessly with the Motif widgets. Programmers    using SVLIB widgets see the same interface and design as other    Motif widgets.    FVS is a visualization software for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)    simulations.  FVS is designed to accept data generated from these   simulations and apply various visualization techniques to present these   data graphically.

In the Graphics and Visualization Lab (GVL) we are using these tools along side standard packages, such as SGI Explorer and the Utah Raster Toolkit, to render 3D volumes and create digital movies. A couple of the more general purpose programs have been bundled into a package called \\\"GVLware\\\".  GVLware, currently consisting of Bob, Raz and Icol, is now available via ftp.  The most interesting program is probably Bob, an interactive volume renderer for the SGI.  Raz streams raster images from disk to an SGI screen, enabling movies larger than memory to be played.

GIS (Geographical Information Systems software) ===================================================  GRASS -----   (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army   Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and   remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a   Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,   although it is reported to have significant image processing   capabilities.    Feature Descriptions    I use GRASS  because it's public domain and can be obtained through the   internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source   code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass   Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using   scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who   already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very   user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software.\\\" A first review  of   overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel   resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose   image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in   Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the   GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric   rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective   interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus   and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them   at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68    Host Configuration Requirements    If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh   which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for   satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC   under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,   and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster   environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it   easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented   in raster (grid-cell) form.    Availability    CERL's Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:   moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).    Mail regarding this site should be addressed to   grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.    This location will be the new \\\"canonical\\\" source for GRASS software, as   well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.   This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and   \\\"tar\\\" archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John   Parks' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,   John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review   it and mail him comments/corrections. The OGI is not currently   maintaining this document, so all correspondence about it should be   directed to grassx@tang.uark.edu    Support    Listserv mailing lists:    grassu-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS users; application-level   questions, support concerns, miscellaneous questions, etc) Send   subscribe commands to grassu-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.    grassp-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS programmers; system-level   questions and tips, tricks, and techniques of design and implementation   of GRASS applications) Send subscribe commands to   grassp-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.    Both lists are maintained by the Office of Grass Integration (subset of   the Army Corps of Engineers Construction Engineering Research Lab in   Champaign, IL). The OGI is providing the lists as a service to the   community; while OGI and CERL employees will participate in the lists,   we can make no claim as to content or veracity of messages that pass   through the list.

Microstation Imager -------------------   Intergraph (based in Huntsville Alabama) sells a wide range of GIS   software/hardware. Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager   sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a   heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.    Feature Description    Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.   Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a   projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).   RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.   Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering   and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,   generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages   up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band   image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.    The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle   VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available   for GIS applications.   Host Configuration Requirements    It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)   though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software   would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.  PCI ---   A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes   an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of   remote sensing data in eight or ten different \\\"industry standard\\\"   formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I   forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix   workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly   other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.    The \\\"PCI software\\\" consists of several classes/groups/packages of   utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common \\\"PCI   database\\\" disk file.  The \\\"Tape I/O\\\" package is a set of utility   programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape   formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the \\\"PCI database\\\" file;   this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can   display data from the PCI database to one or another of several   PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap   representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type   dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically   interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and   Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.   \\\"multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5\\\"), and   God only knows what all else -- there's a LOT.  I don't have and don't   use these, so can't say much about them; you only buy the packages your   particular application/interest calls for.    Each utility is controlled by from one to eight \\\"parameters,\\\" read from   a common \\\"parameter file\\\" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your \\\"default   directory.\\\"  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same   parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting   up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a   scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to   automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,   lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also   invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There's   also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled   language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI   data structures (database file, parameter file).    The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but   requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the   level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle   a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a   utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the   Macintosh calls \\\"raw\\\") data from tape, in a number of different   \\\"interleave\\\" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the   graphic-arts industry's \\\"CT2T\\\" format, would probably (I haven't tried)   handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT   YOU'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start   over.  It's worth noting that the PCI \\\"database\\\" file is designed to   contain not only \\\"raster\\\" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map   information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of   other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often   contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,   longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this   can go into the PCI \\\"database\\\").    I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX   systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific   third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to   mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would   display directly from a PCI \\\"database\\\" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus   24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be \\\"overkill\\\"   in your case; it seems designed for the very \\\"high end\\\"   applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn't suffice   (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It's   probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which   does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe   the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these   areas.  SPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager) --------------------------------   Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis   Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed   for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels   across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since   been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging   Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.    Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and   IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).   Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement   (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.    The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may   require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame   buffer.  I can refer you to people if you're interested.  PCW requires X   for display.  MAP II ------   Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.  CLRview -------   CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit   the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.    This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the   visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.  It supports   the integration of many common but disperate data sources such as DXF,   TIN, DEM, Lattices, and Arc/Info Coverages among others.    CLRview can be obtained from explorer.dgp.utoronto.ca (128.100.1.129)    in the directory pub/sgi/clrview.

And when controlled for usage of oil, gas, etc. energy efficiency in all countries turns out to be identical :-)  To take population density as an example, one way to reduce energy used in transportation is surely to concentrate the population in dense urban areas (though this might, of course, have other disadvantages, possibly even relating to energy use).

The one line description is: Afflict Your Icons with \\\"Cursorphobia\\\"\",\"  Note that I said the fall of Rome, not of the Empire.  The Roman Empire lasted until 1453, with its transfered capital in Constantinople.  The main reason for it's fall was not so much the sack of Constantinople by the men of the 4th Crusade (who were not Christians - they had been excommunicated down to the last man after attacking the Christian city of Zara in Croatia), but rather the disastorous defeat in the battle of Mazinkert.  After the Turks breached the frontier, it was only a matter of time before the Empire fell, the inability of the Empire to hold onto the rim of Anatolia, with the Ottomans and Rum Seljuks in the middle should be quite obvious to any student of history.  The sack of Constantinople only hastened the inevitable along.  For if the Greeks had wanted to save their empire, why would they not cooperate with the Crusaders when they came to do battle with the Saracens in the 1st-3rd Crusades?  Because of their obstinacy over cooperating with people they considered heretics, even though those \\\"heretics\\\" were fighting for the cause of the Empire and Christendom in doing battle with the Turkish hordes in Anatolia, Edessa, Lebanon, Palastine, and Syria, the some hordes who were to later sack Constantinople, and overrun a third of Europe (the Balkans, Hungary, the Ukraine, the Caucasus, etc.)\",\" no, sheesh, didn't you know 666 is the beast's apartment?  667 is across the hall from the beast, and is his neighbor along with the rest of the 6th floor.

For those who have not heard of this effect, you put a current through one of these devices, and it pumps heat from one side to the other.  Reverse the current and you reverse the effect.  I think a temperature difference can give you an EMF as well.  Anyway, it struck me that you could make a nice cool/hot box for picnics with one of these, a power regulator, a thermostat and a couple of heat sinks.  The biggest device can shift 60W with an efficiency of 80-90%, which ain't bad (although it would flatten my car battery in about half an hour).  Unfortunately the catalogue didn't list anything more than the basic specs as a heat pump.  I imagine that you would get a back-EMF as the temperature gradient across the device increases.  If so, presumably its power decreases as the back-EMF increases, until eventually we have a steady state with no current being consumed (assuming no leakage).  If so, then the final temperature difference between the two sides could be set by the supply voltage and nothing more (although that would be a lousy way to control it).  What I would like to know is:  1: Are the above guesses correct?  2: What is the open-circuit thermal resistance of a typical device?    (I just want to be sure that my coolbox is not going to get warm    too fast when I unplug it)  3: How does a Peltier Effect heat pump actually work?

Presumably the protocol can be recovered (if by nothing else, differential analysis).  Postulate if you will, a chip (or logic) sitting between the clipper chip and its communications channel.  The purpose of this chip is twofold:       1) Transmit Channel       The spoof chip XORs the 30 bit encrypted serial number with      a secondary keying variable.  This renders the serial number      unrecoverable with just the system key   2) Recieve Channel       The spoof chip XORs the incoming encrypted serial number      with a secondary keying variable (assuming the serial number      is necessary for local operation).  This has the net result of hiding the serial number.  This gets more interesting when the number of serial numbers issued becomes large, making it difficult to distinguish between valid serial numbers and a spoofed serial number.  Without knowing the system key, you could lie about the serial number, but risk detection of the lie.  IF you had the system key and the encryption algorithm you could successfully lie with a lower probability of detection by emulating the format of your own serial number.\",\"Hello.

I have got that wrong. My apology.     (Deletion)     So? No fun, but I must have met the minority then. And \\\"given by god\\\" refers to any action whereby a god god causes or better effects something.     Rob, I am not intimate with Jewish theology, but I understand that you are a Messianic Jew. Correct me if I am wrong, but it appears that the views of Messianic Jews on metaphysics is different to that of the majority of Jews. While Jewish theology overall is quite distinct from the Christianic god views, I have heard that it is possible for Jews to attribute evil to their god, an no-no for Christians, the Bible is still seen as effect of the interaction of some god with man.     (Deletion)   The context was metaphysics, even when the process of adapting the commandments is not transcendent, the justification of the process lie in metaphysic specualtion. I wonder how you break out of the shackles of having metaphysics in your system.     (Deletion)   Is is in a book that commands to commit genocide among other reprehensible deeds. The context is repulsive, and it is foul play, IMO, to invoke some relatively enlightened passages as an example for the content of the whole book.     (Big deletion)   No, not the interpretation of some laws, but the interpretation of the bible. As in the example that Sodom and Gomorrha mean argue with god. The whole idea that it is metaphorically and yet allows you to argue with a god (whatever that means, that alone is a theo- logic question) is proof of a theology used.       It is an important question in the light of what for instance the passage witrh Sodom and Gomorrha means. Either there is some connection between the text, the fact that it exists, and your interpretation of it, or it is purely arbitrary.. Further, the question is why is has one to carry the burden of Biblical texts when one could simply write other books that convey the message better. You might answer that one can't becuase  some peculiar Biblical information might be lost, but that holds true of every other book, and the question remains why has the Bible still a special place? Can't it be replaced somehow? Is it ok to bargain the dangerous content of the Bible against some other message that is included as well?     (Deletion)   Sorry, but there are worse systems does not say anything about if one could not have a better system.   (Deletion)   If we read two stories in the Bible, one that god commands people to kill children for being idolaters and another where god kills children directly, what is more important to resolve, the message that children are to be killed or if it has  to be done by god?     And the argument you have given is a fallacy, while it may not be important in the context you have given to find out if god is corporeal or not, it can be crucial in other questions. Religious believers resolve contradictions with that they choose one of the possibilities given in an arbitrary way, and have the advantage of being able to attribute their decision to some god.\",\" The computer, err, government, is your friend.  Have a nice day (under penalty of law).\",\"I just installed a Motorola XC68882RC50 FPU in an Amiga A2630 board (25 MHz 68030 + 68882 with capability to clock the FPU separately).  Previously a MC68882RC25 was installed and everything was working perfectly.  Now the systems displays a yellow screen (indicating a exception) when it check for the presence/type of FPU.  When I reinstall an MC68882RC25 the system works fine, but with the XC68882 even at 25 MHz it does not work.  The designer of the board mentioned that putting a pullup resistor on data_strobe (470 Ohm) might help, but that didn't change anything.  Does anybody have some suggestions what I could do?  Does this look like a CPU-FPU communications problem or is the particular chip dead (it is a pull, not new)? Moreover, the place I bought it from is sending me an XC68882RC33.  I thought that the 68882RC33 were labeled MC not XC (for not finalized mask design).

Only TV could transmit the full sadness of his face. \\\"You say that we teach our children to hate you, but what do you expect to happen to a child who sees this ?\\\" And once again he wraps himself in a lengthy silence, his face crumbling into weeping. Mahmoud stood in the field of rubble that was once his home. The term 'dispossession' has an absolute meaning here. Nothing is left of what he accumulated during his entire life, only the rubble of a house and shreds of belongings.  Once again Khan Yunis. Once again demolished homes. Last Thursday there was a search for wanted people here. Once again the IDF forces employed the new method, fired and bombed and shot missiles and placed explosives. Already three times during the past weeks I have gone out to see the destruction and each time I was more horrifying scenes. This time they hit the largest number of houses, 17 according to the IDF estimate, ten of them completely demolished. But not only that:  the method has also become more brutal. Three weeks ago, in Tufah neighborhood in Gaza, the residents were still told to remove their valuables from their homes.  This time the army skipped that part; three weeks ago the handcuffed men, inhabitants of the demolished homes, were supplied with some water and one apple during the 12 hours they had to stand. This time there was only water. Three weeks ago they were even allowed to go out to the toilet. This time the soldier just gold them: Piss and shit in your pants. And thus, last Thursday, some 45 men stood for about 12 hours, their hands bound behind their backs, their eyes blindfolded, without food, with wet pants on their legs and a terrible feeling of humiliation in their hearts, listening to the sounds of the explosions destroying their homes, one after the other.  (...)\",\"  Uh Oh!  The first sign of an argument without merit--the stating of one's  \\\"qualifications\\\" in an area.  If you know something about Nazi Germany,  show it.  If you don't, shut up.  Simple as that. \",\"    Each chip includes the following components:        the Skipjack encryption algorithm       F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips       N, a 30-bit serial number       U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip  Hmmm. A thirty bit serial number. And, we are told, the unit key U is derived deterministically from this serial number. That means that there are only one billion possible unit keys.     To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is    first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.    S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a    64-bit block R1:      R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .     Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and    N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:        R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1]      R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .     R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The    first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The    rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2    are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow    agencies.  Hmmm. We must assume that generating the unit key U from the serial number N rather than generating it from a randomly selected U1 and U2 is an intentional way of assuring a \\\"fail safe\\\" for the government -- U is completedly determined given S1, S2 and N. If S1 and S2 do not change they constitute effective \\\"master keys\\\" (along with F), the theft of which (or the possession of which by various authorities) completely obviates the security of the system. However, more interestingly, we know, for a fact that if S1 and S2 are fixed no matter what the keyspace for U is no more than 2^30. Why not pick U1 and U2 at random? Why this interesting restriction of they key space if it NOT to provide an additional back door?  I find it disturbing that at the very best my security is dependant on approximately 30 bytes worth of information that could be written on the back of a napkin.  Even if S1 and S2 change periodically, the rationale behind this restriction in the size of the keyspace seems strange if one is assuming that the goal is security -- and makes perfect sense if the goal is an illusion of security.  If S1 and S2 do not change, even if they remain secret I wonder if they can somehow be back-derived given enough unit key/serial number pairs. We are assured that this cannot happen -- but no one understands how Skipjack works outside of government officials and, soon, foreign intelligence services that gain the information via espionage. Presumably we will eventually have the information as well -- reverse engineering gets more and more advanced every year -- but by the time we know it may be too late.     As a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are    written onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a    file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part    U1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third    disk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent    2 takes the second disk.  The third disk is used to program the chips.    After the chips are programmed, all information is discarded from the    vault and the agents leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional    assurance that no information is left behind.  None of this makes me feel the least bit secure. The silly notion of \\\"destroying the laptop\\\" appears to be yet another bizarre distraction. We all know that you can't read data from DRAM that has been turned off for more than a few moments. On the other hand, what we don't know is why there is a need to generate the unit keys from S1 and S2 in the first place other than to weaken the system. We don't know if the agents in question would resist a million in cash a piece for their information -- its probably worth hundreds of million, so you can make the bribe arbitrarily hard to resist. And to tell you the truth, doing this in a \\\"vault\\\" rather than in Joe Random Tempest-shielded Room with a laptop computer seems like melodrama designed to make high-school dropouts from Peoria impressed -- but it does very little for most of the rest of us.     The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the    room instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2,    and the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to    the escrow agencies.  What would this provide? Lets say the escrow agencies are the ACLU and the NRA and their agents personally take back the disks and are always honest. Who cares? The NSA must be laughing out loud, because they have the algorithm to regenerate U given N and likely don't need to steal they keys as they effectively already have them.  -- Perry Metzger  pmetzger@shearson.com\",\"I'd like to add a second S3 based video card to my system.

Pat LaFontaine was awarded the Captaincy when Mike Ramsey was forced to give it up (Ramsey's now a Penguin).  Ramsey inherited it from Mike Foligno (who's now a leaf).  He in turn had inherited it from Lindy Ruff, who went I forget where.  Ruff had it from Perreault, who retired, so I guess that's where the streak started.  Or did it? After all, Danny Gare was captain before him, and he went to Detroit. Jim Scoenfeld, Gerry Meehan, and Floyd Smith are the others, in reverse order, last to first.  I was a bit young at the time, so I'm not sure of the fate of Schoenfeld, but he ultimately went to Detroit and Boston.  Meehan went to Vancouver, Atlanta and Washington.  Smith seems to have hung up his skates after Buffalo, but I don't know if the captaincy was removed before or after that, or how many games he played for Buffalo.  This is actually getting fascinating.  :-)  Captaincy in Buffalo is a sure sign you're to be traded, almost, unless you're a franchise player. \",\"I don't know if you could call him rushed, but \\\"Big\\\" Ben McDonald didn't much time at all in the minors.

In the NT, it is expected that when believers gather,   - people will prophesy   - the prophecy must be judged (1 Cor 14:29) There is nothing about killing someone who makes a mistake.   Scripture is scripture; there is no \\\"gift of scripture\\\".  And I don't know about you, but I know that _I_ have made mistakes while filled with the spirit.  If you don't give grace to allow people to make mistakes, they will never grow in the use of the spiritual gifts!  When we minister in my small group, I encourage people to speak out any impressions or images they think might be from the Lord.  Only by trying will they know whether they were right or wrong -- and in either case, they'll have a better handle on it the next time.  Didn't you fall when you were learning to ride a bicycle?  But you kept on trying, and you learned both from your failures and your successes. Spiritual gifts are no different -- you get better with experience.   The canon of Scripture is complete.  Does this mean that God no longer speaks?  I have heard his voice -- not audibly (though some have), but clearly nonetheless.  Is what I heard equivalent to Scripture?  No.  I have never heard contemporary prophets claim that what they receive from the Lord is on the same level as Scripture; on the contrary, those who are mature obey the Scriptures by submitting their prophecies to fellow believers for judgement.  And the most reliable yardstick for judging prophecies is, certainly, the Scriptures themselves.  The canon is closed -- but God is not silent!   Does it matter what it is called?  The question is not how to label it, but how to receive it.  Words of knowledge, incidentally, are similar to prophecy (and sometimes the two overlap), but generally it is supernatural knowledge of some fact that could not be known otherwise.\",\"I need to write an application which does annotation notes on existing documents.

As I couldn't find anything on it on the news server, I have posted this. However, if it is old information, tell me, and ill sue the TV station for saying they are  'Up to date' ;-)  (Also, my news server could be slow. . so . . .!!!  I only caught the end of the article, so all the information on the topic is not known to me at the moment.

It was meant to be about 150miles in diamater, and a faily large distance  from the plutos orbit.  (it had a computer drawing, and the orbit distance from pluto was about the same as neptune to pluto when they are furthest apart.  This is all I found out about it. OH it is called Karna.

Sun, IBM, HP and DEC must make up the **VAST** majority of all hardware).     Ports of Motif to both 386BSD and Linux are available for a fee of about $100.  This is cost recovery for the person who bought the rights to redistribute.  The activity in both the BSD and Linux news groups pertaining to Motif has been high.     I can't see why.  If just about every workstation will come with Motif by default and you can buy it for under $100 for the \\\"free\\\" UNIX platforms, I can't see this causing major problems.

[I'm not enforcing the inclusion limits on this FAQ because most of our readers probably haven't seen it.  --clh]  Christ warns that anyone who \\\"breaks one of the least of these commandments *and* teaches otheres to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven\\\" (Matt. 5:19.  This FAQ is so full of error that I must respond to it.  I hope that whoever maintains will remove from it the partisan theology.   1.  The law was known to man before it was revealed on Mount Sinai.  Rom 4:15 notes that \\\"where no law is, there is no transgression.\\\"  Not only did sin exist before Sinai (Eden), but the Sabbath was kept before it was revealed on Sinai (Ex 16).  2.  The problem with the first covenant was not the law, but the promise which undergirded it.  God wanted to perform his will in the lives of the people, but in their ignorance after 400 years of slavery, they promised \\\"what ever He says to do we will do.\\\"  That is why the new covenant is based on \\\"better promises\\\" (Heb. 8:6).  Rather than do away with the law God promised to \\\"put my laws in their minds and write them on their hearts\\\" (Heb. 8:10).  3.  Including the Sabbath in the Acts 15 is selective inclusion.  The Sabbath was more important to the Jews than circumcision.  If any attempt had been made to do away with the Sabbath the reaction would have been even more strident than is recorded in Acts 15.  Do not confuse the weekly Sabbath of the Decalogue with the ceremonial sabbaths which could occur at any time of the week and were part of the law (ceremonial) which was *added* because of transgression (of the moral law) (Gal 3:19).  4.  Israel stands for God's people of all time.  That is why God *grafted* the Gentiles in.  Roma 9:4 says that the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the service of God and the promises belong to Israelites.   In explanation Paul makes it clear that being born into Israel is not enough \\\"For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel\\\" v 6.  Then in Gal 3:19 he says \\\"if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.\\\"  All Christians are Abraham's seed, Jews, Israelites.  Not physically, for that is not the criterion, but spiritually.  We are joint heirs with Jesus based on the promise God made to all his people the Israelites.   People would probably agree but they are wrong.  How can the Sabbath commandment be ceremonial when it is part of a law which predates the ceremonial laws?  You are not free to choose your time of worship.  Even if you were why do you follow a day of worship which has its origins in pagan sun worship.  Would you rather give up a day which God blessed, sanctified, and hallowed in exchange for one which all church leaders agree has not biblical foundation (see Sabbath Admissions in soc.religion.christian.bible-study). I do not care what Calvin or any theologian says.  My guide is what God says.  If being not under the law means we do not have to keep the law, why is it that the only section of the law we have trouble with is the Sabbath commandment, which is the only one God thought was important enough to say *REMEMBER*?  If you study the word deeply you will note that the message is that we are no longer under the condemnation of the law but freed by the grace of God.  If a cop pulls me over for speeding, then in court I ask for mercy and the judge does not throw the book at me but gives me grace, do I walk out of the court saying \\\"I can now go on speeding, for I am now under grace?\\\"  Being under grace I now drive within the speed limit.  Paul adds to it in Rom. 3:31 \\\"Di we then make void the law through faith?  God forbid: yea, we establish the law.\\\"  \\\"Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good\\\" (Rom. 7:12).   Do you prefer implication to fact?  A careful study of the Acts 20 shows that the meeting was on Saturday night and that on Sunday morning Paul did not go to a worship service, but set off on a long journey by foot to Assos.  In ICor 16 there is no way you can equate \\\"lay by him in store\\\" with \\\"go to a worship service.\\\"  Wrong.  These are the sabbath days of the ceremonial law, not the Sabbath day of the moral law. Why would you prefer to twist and turn, relying on different arguments which conflict with each other, rather than obey a simple request from a God who loved you enough to die for you.  Jesus died because the law could not be changed.  Why bother to die in order to meet the demands of a broken law if all you need to do is change the law.  Penalties for law breaking means the law is immutable.  That is why it is no sin not to follow the demands of the ceremonial laws.  It will always be a sin to make false gods, to violate God's name, to break the Sabbath, to steal, to kill, etc.  Except it you disagree.  But then your opinion has no weight when placed next to the word of God.  Darius  [It's not clear how much more needs to be said other than the FAQ.  I think Paul's comments on esteeming one day over another (Rom 14) is probably all that needs to be said.  I accept that Darius is doing what he does in honor of the Lord.  I just wish he might equally accept that those who \\\"esteem all days alike\\\" are similarly doing their best to honor the Lord.  However I'd like to be clear that I do not think there's unambiguous proof that regular Christian worship was on the first day.  As I indicated, there are responses on both of the passages cited.  The difficulty with both of these passages is that they are actually about something else.  They both look like they are talking about nnregular Christian meetings, but neither explicitly says \\\"and they gathered every Sunday for worship\\\".  We get various pieces of information, but nothing aimed at answering this question.    Act 2:26 describes Christians as participating both in Jewish temple worship and in Christian communion services in homes.  Obviously the temple worship is on the Sabbath.  Acts 13:44 is an example of Christians participating in them.  Unfortunately it doesn't tell us what day Christians met in their houses.  Acts 20:7, despite Darius' confusion, is described by Acts as occuring on Sunday.  (I see no reason to impose modern definitions of when days start, when the Biblical text is clear about what was meant.)  The wording implies to me that this was a normal meeting.  It doesn't say they gathered to see Paul off, but that when they were gathered for breaking bread, Paul talked about his upcoming travel.  But that's just not explicit enough to be really convincing.  Similarly with 1 Cor 16:2.  It says that on the first day they should set aside money for Paul's collection.  Now if you want to believe that they gathered specially to do this, or that they did it in their homes, I can't disprove it, but the obvious time for a congregation to take an offering would be when they normally gather for worship, and if they were expected to do it in their homes there would be no reason to mention a specific day. So I think the most obvious reading of this is that \\\"on the first day of every week\\\" simply means every time they gather for worship.    I think the reason we have only implications and not clear statements is that the NT authors assumed that their readers knew when Christian worship was.\",\" From: \\\"Preston K. Covey\\\" <covey+@andrew.cmu.edu> Subject: Gun Stats & Mortal Risks Date: Mon, 15 Feb 1993 18:35:05 -0500 (EST)   Folks,  Hail from the nether world.  On February 4th, the Wall Street Journal carried a front-page article by Erik Larson entitled \\\"Armed Force.\\\"  I felt a reply was in order to his citation of the notorious scare stat that \\\"A Gun is 43 times more likely to kill than to protect.\\\"  I sent the following to the WSJ.  -----  Gun Stats & Mortal Risks  Preston K. Covey    Erik Larson~s even-handed article on Paxton Quigley (~Armed Force,~ 2/4/93, WSJ) cites the world~s most notorious ~statistic~ regarding guns in the home:  ~A pioneering study of residential gunshot deaths in King County, Washington, found that a gun in the home was 43 times more likely to be used to kill its owner, spouse, a friend or child than to kill an intruder.~  The ~43 times~ stat is everywhere these days;  it has grown in media lore like the proverbial urban myth: it was inflated by one pugilistic talk-show pundit to ~93.~  Given the shock value of the finding, the conclusion of the 1986 New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) study is remarkably understated:  ~The advisability of keeping firearms in the home for protection must be questioned.~     Responsible people should indeed question the risks and benefits of bringing a firearm into their home.   But what we need to know is this:  What exactly are the risks and benefits?  The NEJM testimony is neither the whole truth about the benefits nor nothing but the truth about the risks.  Further, as with motor vehicles, we want to know:  What control do we have over the risks and benefits?  And, as with the risks of cancer or heart disease or auto accidents:  How can we minimize the risks?  Like raw highway death tolls, the NEJM stat is not very helpful here.    The NEJM finding purports to inform us, but it is framed to warn us off.  It is widely promulgated in the media as a ~scare stat,~ a misleading half-truth whose very formulation is calculated to prejudice and terrify.  The frightful statistic screams for itself:  The risks far outweigh the benefits, yes?   What fool would run these risks?   If your car were 43 times more likely to kill you, a loved one, a dear friend or an innocent child than to get you to your destination,  should you not take the bus?     Uncritical citation puts the good name of statistics in the bad company of lies and damned lies.   Surely, we can do better where lives are at stake.   Let~s take a closer look at this risky business:   The ~43 times~ stat of the NEJM study is the product of dividing the number of home intruders/aggressors justifiably killed in self-defense (the divisor) into the number of family members or acquaintances  killed by a gun in the home (the dividend).  The divisor of this risk equation is 9: in the study~s five-year sample there were 2 intruders and 7 other cases of self-defense.  The dividend is 387:  in the study there were 12 accidental deaths, 42 criminal homicides, and 333 suicides.  387 divided by 9 yields 43.  There were a total of 743 gun-related deaths in King County between 1978 and 1983,  so the study leaves 347 deaths outside of homes unaccounted.   The NEJM~s notorious ~43 times~ statistic is seriously misleading on six counts:   1.  The dividend is misleadingly characterized in the media:  the ~or acquaintances~ of the study (who include your friendly drug dealers and neighborhood gang members) is equated to ~friends.~  The implication is that the offending guns target and kill only beloved family members, dear friends, and innocent children.  Deaths may all be equally tragic, but the character and circumstance of both victims and killers are relevant to the risk.  These crucial risk factors are masked by the calculated impression that the death toll is generated by witless Waltons shooting dear friends and friendly neighbors.  This is criminological hogwash.   2.   The study itself does not distinguish households or environs populated by people with violent, criminal, or substance-abuse histories -- where the risk of death is very high -- versus households inhabited by more civil folk (for example, people who avoid high-risk activities like drug dealing, gang banging and wife beating) -- where the risk is very low indeed.  In actuality, negligent adults allow fatal but avoidable accidents; and homicides are perpetrated mostly by people with histories of violence or abuse, people who are identifiably and certifiably at ~high risk~ for misadventure.  To ignore these obvious risk factors in firearm accidents and homicides is as misleading as ignoring the role of alcohol in vehicular deaths: by tautology, neither gun deaths nor vehicular deaths would occur without firearms or vehicles; but the person and circumstance of the gun owner or driver crucially affect the risk.    3.  One misleading implication of the way the NEJM stat is framed is that the mere presence of a gun in the home is much more likely to kill than to protect, and this obscures -- indeed, disregards -- the role of personal responsibility.  The typical quotation of this study (unlike Larson~s) attributes fatal agency to the gun:  ~A gun in the home is 43 times as likely to kill . . . .~  (The Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, a major promulgator of the NEJM statistic, uses this particular formulation.)  We can dispense with the silly debate about whether it~s people or guns that accomplish the killing:  again, by tautology, gun  deaths would not occur without the guns.  The question begged is how many deaths would occur anyway, without the guns.  In any case, people are the death-dealing agents, the guns are their lethal instruments.  The moral core of the personal  risk factors in gun deaths are personal responsibility and choice.  Due care and responsibility obviate gun accidents; human choice mediates homicide and suicide (by gun or otherwise).  The choice to own a gun need not condemn a person to NEJM~s high-risk pool.  The gun does not create this risk by itself.  People have a lot to say about what risk they run with guns in their homes.  For example, graduates of Paxton Quigley~s personal protection course do not run the touted ~43 times~ risk any more than skilled and sober drivers run the same risks of causing or suffering vehicular death as do reckless or drunk drivers.  Undiscriminating actuarials disregard and obscure the role of personal responsibility and choice, just as they disregard and obscure the role of socio-economic, criminological and other risk-relevant factors in firearm-related death.  This is why we resent insurance premiums and actuarial consigment to risk pools whose norms disregard our individualities.  Fortunately, nothing can consign us to the NEJM risk pool but our own lack of choice or responsibility in the matter.   4.  Suicide accounts for 84% of the deaths by gun in the home in the NEJM study.  As against the total deaths by gun in King County, including those outside the home, in-house suicides are 44% of the total death toll, which is closer to the roughly 50% proportion found by other studies.  Suicide is a social problem of a very different order from homicide or accidents.  The implication of the NEJM study is that these suicides might not occur without readily available guns.  It is true that attempted suicide by gun is likely to succeed.  It is not obviously true that the absence of a gun would prevent any or all of these suicides.  This is widely assumed or alleged, but the preponderance of research on guns and suicide actually shows otherwise, that this is wishful thinking in all but a few truly impulsive cases.  (See:  Bruce L. Danto et al., The Human Side of Homicide,  Columbia University Press, 1982;  Charles Rich et al.,  ~Guns and Suicide,~  American Journal of Psychiatry,  March 1990.)  If suicides were removed from the dividend of the NEJM study~s risk equation, the ~43 times~ stat would deflate to ~six.~  The inclusion of suicides in the NEJM risk equation -- like the causes, durability, or interdiction of suicidal intent itself -- is a profoundly debatable matter.  Quotations of the NEJM study totally disregard this issue.   5.  Citations of the NEJM study also mislead regarding the estimable rate of justifiable and excusable homicide.  Most measures, like the NEJM homicide rate, are based on the immediate disposition of cases.  But many homicides initially ruled criminal are appealed and later ruled self-defense.  In the literature on battered women, immediate case dispositions are notorious for under-representing the rate of justifiable or excusable homicide. Time~s January 18, 1993, cover story on women ~Fighting Back~ reported one study~s finding that 40% of women who appeal have their murder convictions thrown out.  Time~s July 17, 1989, cover story on a week of gun deaths reported 51% of the domestic cases as shootings by abuse victims; but only 3% of the homicides were reported as self-defense.  In a May 14, 1990, update, Time  reported that 12% of the homicides had eventually been ruled self-defense. In Time~s sample, the originally reported rate of self-defense was in error by a factor of four.  The possibility of such error is not acknowledged by promulgators of the NEJM statistic.    6.  While both the dividend and the product of the NEJM risk equation are arguably inflated, the divisor is unconscionably misleading.  The divisor of this equation counts only aggressors who are killed,  not aggressors who are successfully thwarted without being killed or even shot at.   The utility of armed self-defense is the other side of the coin from the harms done with guns in homes.  What kind of moral idiocy is it to measure this utility only in terms of killings ?  Do we measure the utility of our police solely in terms of felons killed  -- as opposed to the many many more who are otherwise foiled, apprehended, or deterred?  Should we not celebrate (let alone count ) those cases where no human life is lost as successful armed defenses?  The question posed to media that cite the NEJM scare stat is this:  Why neglect the compendious research on successful armed defense, notably by criminologist Gary Kleck (Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America , Aldine de Gruyter, 1992)?  Kleck~s estimations of the rate and risk of defensive firearm use are based on victimization surveys as well as other studies:  the rate is high (about one million a year) and the risk is good (gun defenders fare better than anyone, either those who resort to other forms of resistance or those who do not resist).  Dividing one million gun defenses a year by 30,000 annual gun deaths (from self-defense, homicides, suicides, and accidents) yields 33.  Thus, we can construct a much more favorable statistic than the NEJM scare stat:    A gun is 33 times more likely to be used to defend against assault or other crime than to kill anybody.      Of course, Kleck~s critics belittle the dividend of this calculation; what is good news for gun defenders is bad news for gun control.  We should indeed question the basis and method of Kleck~s high estimation of defensive firearm use, as I have questioned the NEJM statistic.  Clearly, the issue of how to manage mortal risks is not settled by uncritical citation of statistics.   One thing troubles me still:  we can hardly escape the unquestioned NEJM scare stat in our media,  but we hardly ever find Kleck~s good work mentioned,  even critically. \",\"Having read the various \\\"Clipper\\\" announcements on the net over the last few  days and a LOT of uninformed speculation about the chip, its uses, government plots, etc, I have the following questions.    1) What does the \\\"Clipper chip\\\" actually implement? Just the Skipjack  cryptographic algorithm? Or does it also implement a \\\"chip to chip\\\"  communications protocol? If it does implement a communications  protocol, can it be used as just a \\\"crypt chip\\\" also.    2) Where can the chip specifications and spec sheets be obtained?    3) Who may purchase them and under what conditions?    4) Are there restrictions as to how the chip may be used in a system?    5) The security of the algorithm and the encrypted communications does  not appear to require that the \\\"Family key\\\" be a secret.

If it's a secret to make traffic analysis more difficult, does  the \\\"Law enforcement message\\\" contain any random information?

They are used in the sweep portion of a TV set. Thanks in advance,\",\"  Any projectile traveling at or near typical bullet speeds is potentially lethal.  Even blanks [which have no projectile] can cause death if the muzzle is in close proximity to the victim.  I have heard of rubber or plastic bullets being used effectively during riot situations [where the intent is crowd control, rather than close range self defense]; i've also seen reports of deaths caused by them [the British in Northern Ireland].  Use of a firearm for self defense is appropriate and lawful only in the gravest of situations; at that point, i consider deadly [lethal] force to  be a proper reaction [and so does the law].    Furthermore, use of less effective [but still potentially lethal] force has its own set of problems.  It may well take more applications of the less effective force to stop the incident; this places all parties at some risk; the victim because the attack has not stopped, and the assailent  since the aggregate damage done by the multiple applications may well be more deadly. \",\"This may be the dumbest question of the year, but is there a way to 'piggyback' or expand a 6-slot motherboard (all 16-bit) to get the usual 8?

In one of Jesus' revelation in this century, \\\"...same thing as in the old days.  People refuse to believe my messengers.  Even when I was alive here on earth, they refuse Me.  What more when I am just talking through somebody else?\\\" (paraphrased).  With all the knowledge believers accumulated, He would think that we would be 'enlightened' enough to detect which ones are  'authentic and divine' as opposed to 'evil or man-made'.  These signs, these miracles, are you afraid that they are not from God? That these are the signs we should not open our hearts and mind to for thinking   they are evil? Well, is faith in God evil? Is true peace evil?  Is true love that is divine and pure evil?  Why can't someone accept that God can do what He wants in fulfillment of His   generous love and Jesus' never ending forgiveness to those who turn back to   Him for salvation? Why are we refusing God's messenger of this truth?  The mother to all who are   in Christ? What brings us these:     fears of being shamed by what others will think or say about us?         which, in contrary, could be pleasing to God?     fears of being humbled?     fears of being judged as wrong (wrt mainstream standard of what is right)? Why can't we tolerate non-believers' mockery or ridicule of us for the   sake of peace, love and obedience to God?  The humbling lessons left to us   by martyrs and saints? We'd rather engage in never-ending bickering and disproof of each other's   opinion - looking at each other's mistakes - for the sake of arguments,   instead of having communion in one body with Christ. What makes us go blind to the truth that God is All Powerful and that He can   not be binded by what people wrote and have written about Him in all ages? Why is our faith in God limited?  By all the words and literature we muster? What prevents us from going *beyond* being saved and extend God's rich love   to others who are not?  Why are our eyes not wide open to see that He continuously sees our faith, hope   and love which glorify Him and so He gives us indications of His    acknowledgements with signs/miracles (ordinary/common or divinely inspired)    everywhere?  Isn't that like an atheist/agnostic's view that all these   are just ordinary here on earth and not caused by anything supernatural?  Why then does the Holy Mother comes back to remind us:   \\\"We must really __accept that prayer__ changes the course of things and that   with prayers __even wars can be prevented__.\\\" but then she continues:   \\\"You often have an egotistic attitude.  Dear children, in these days you   have prayed very much, __but your hands have remained empty__.\\\" Why hesitate in proclaiming what needs to be done:   \\\"prayer, conversion, peace, penance, fasting, the Holy Mass, living life   as what the Gospel brings.\\\"? Why not do so?  How?  To the world?   \\\"Start in your family.  Be a good example.  Live the Word.\\\" Why worry if it is going to be of good use to many?   \\\"The fruits, __leave them to the Lord__, do not worry about anything or    anyone but entrust yourself to the Lord.\\\"  Although the Holy Mother does not insist because:   \\\"You are free; I bow before the freedom which God gives you.\\\" but she follows this with:   \\\"You are surprised because I say to you: Decide for God and yet, see how   you have lived this day.\\\" Why does she constantly conveys:   \\\"Take this life toward God in the way as to __experience__ the Lord Himself   in your __behavior__ and __not only__ when you pray\\\" or one time when we    decide that we are saved, or talk/write about God, etc. The Holy Mother warns:   \\\"Satan (the serpent) is always trying to dissuade you to turn you away from   my peace plan and prayer.\\\"  (Rev 12:17, the dragon became angry with the woman   and went off to wage war against the rest of her offsprings, those who keep   God's commandments, and bear witness to Jesus.)  Do you have fear or hate for God's current messenger of true peace, love and   our motherly protector from the anti-Christ? The one who is being apprehensive of communism, wars, famine and other evils   that the serpent brings upon us?  This obedient and blessed new Eve? The mother who warns us so we can be prepared and be strong against Satan? Haven't there been renewed faith, hope, love, peace and obedience wherever   this messenger has shared her blessings and graces that God has given her   in good purpose? Why do we choose to be blind? Why fear the truth that God has been giving us a chance and sharing Christ's   ever-forgetting forgiveness to us through the obedient mother? The mother who has been consecrated the task __to reverse__ the disobedient   harm and example done by the ancient Eve. She has been preparing the new Eden with her Immaculate Heart. The new Eden as sanctuary (the womb) for the next coming and judgement of the    righteous by our Lord, Jesus Christ; when The Lamb marries His bride. Shouldn't we give her a hand in her exhaustive job of preparing us for the   second coming of her Son as she has been conceived without sin to bear   the Son of God in her womb? Why fear true peace, love and renewed faith and obedience to God that Mary   faithfully brings to God's children?  She has been protecting the flock   (the rest of the offsprings) from the greedy dragon so as to present more    righteous members for her Son's coming. Not all apparitions and miracles that resulted from them are worthy   of belief.  With prayer and guidance from the Holy Spirit and, of course,   approval of our Church authorities, we should be aware of the true and   divinely inspired ones; specifically, the ones which aligns with the   Scripture.     Also, our Lady reminds us of recommendation of __silence__ in our prayers:   \\\"If you speak unceasingly in your prayers, how will you be able to hear   God?  Allow Him room to answer you, to speak to you.\\\"   She encourages us (with motherly nurturing) to continue in exuberant  faith, hope and love to Jesus, constantly.  NOT with mere emotions,  but with deep, constant obedience to Jesus, her Beloved Son and acknowledgement of our need to have Him as part of our lives.  Let's not wait to the last minute to renew our faith and the life that God wants us to live; when there won't be enough time or when it will be late.                                                        Nowadays, Mary says,  \\\"Pray, pray, pray for peace...reconciliation, my children.\\\" Have peace within yourself first before you can promote peace to others.  For without peace, you can not fully accept my Son.\\\"                                                                          And you think she's just an ordinary lady.  Not to me.  She's our good Mother/messenger from God and she is so nice enough to share God's kingdom to us through her Son and experience it.  With Mary, we are assured that The Lamb always succeeds.  ----- Note:  All enclosed in quotes are from \\\"Latest News of Medjugorje\\\"        Number 10, June, 1991 by Fr.

Hrudey made 21 saves in Sundays 6-3 opening victory.  But Stauber clearly is upset with his sudden status as the No. 3 man behind Rick Knickle.  Stauber had a 4-1-2 record and 2.98 goals-against average down the stretch in the regular season and nearly wrestled the No. 1 job from Hrudey.  Knickle?  He won 2 of 3 decisions but had a bloated 5.26 average, twice was  yanked from games (once for stomach cramps) and hasn't played since March 29.  Yet, when the series resumes Wednesday, Knickle will serve as Hrudey's backup again and Stauber will have to satisfy his playoff hunger by munching on Olympic Saddledome popcorn.  \\\"If I'm supposedly close to being the starter or could have been the starter...I dropped too. 3.  What happened to No. 2?\\\"  Stauber wondered.  \\\"Not that I'd be happy with No. 2, but I feel I should at least be a part of this team in the playoffs.\\\"  Perhaps Stauber eventually will get his chance, but Melrose apparently is not convinced the 25-year old is capable of handling playoff pressure.  While insisting he is the Kings' \\\"goalie of the future,\\\" Melrose said Stauber flubbed all four of the big games he was asked to win this season.  They were, according to Melrose: a 7-2 loss to San Jose on Dec. 26; An 8-3 loss to the New York Rangers on Jan. 23; a 6-6 tie with Detroit on Feb. 11; an 8-6 loss to  Vancouver on Thursday.  \\\"Four times this season Robb could have emerged as the elite goalie, he could have taken it away from Kelly Hrudey, and he didn't do it,\\\" Melrose said.  \\\"An elite goaltender has to carry the ball when you give it to him.  The mark of a great goalie is that he isn't satisfied to be a backup.\\\"  \\\"I'm not blaming Robb for the losses, but if you're going to be No. 1, you've got to be able to walk your talk.  You've got to be able to play when everything is on the line.  Robb Stauber has a great deal of ability, but maybe I expect more from him than he does.\\\"  Ouch.  That remark stung Stauber.  He began the season 9-0-1, struggled when the team hit a mid-season slump, didn't play for a month after Knickle was signed off the San Diego Gulls roster, then came on at the end.  \\\"I expect more from myself than anybody, including Barry Melrose,\\\" said Stauber, a three-year star at the University of Minnesota who left school in 1989, only  to have his development hampered by a string of serious injuries.  \\\"What I've been through the last four years - two knee operations, a herniated disk in my back, shoulder surgery - what more can I go through?  I obviously do expect a lot from myself, otherwise I wouldn't be here.\\\"  \\\"Anybody who would disagree with that doesn't know me.  I'm not saying Barry  doesn't know me, but don't say I've been without expectations.  If anything, I'm a perfectionist.\\\"  Stauber acknowledged he played poorly in the four games Melrose mentioned. \\\"But  even though I didn't play well, I get knocked down from maybe on to three? It's  a bit of a jump,\\\" he said.  \\\"You're almost No. 1, or if you play a good game  you're No. 1 and if you don't you're No. 3?  Why does Jack Nicklaus shoot a 67  and then a 75?  Can you explain that?  That's what barry wanted me to explain  to him, why I didn't come through when he counted on me.  I don't know. What I  do know is, it's a sport.  I'll be there.\\\"  Melrose's \\\"goalie of the future\\\" statement doesn't mean much to Stauber. \\\"Before you know it, I'll be 30 and there will be no future,\\\" he said.  ------  *Game 1 of the Kings @ Flames playoff series drew a 4.2 Nielsen rating on ABC  Channel 7 here in LA.

How long are you going to keep repeating this utterly idiotic [and increasingly saddening] drivel?  oz\",\"  At the cost of repudiating the FAQ, I think too much is made of the strong vs weak atheism issue, although in the context of alt.atheism, where we're continually attacked on the basis that strong atheists \\\"believe\\\" in the non-existence of god, I think the separation is a valid one.  To cover my arse, what I'm trying to say is that there is an infinitely grey area between weak and strong, as well as between strong and the unattainable mathematical atheism (I wish!).  Whereas I _logically_ can only support the weak atheist position, in effect I am a strong atheist (and wish I could be a mathematical one).  To justify my strong atheist position I believe I need only show that the evidence presented in favour of any of the gods under scrutiny is faulty.  If I read the FAQ correctly, no argument for the existence of god (generic, as represented by mainstream theologians) has ever been found to be unassailable.  To me this is adequate evidence that the _real_god_ is undefinable (or at least no definition has yet been found to be watertight), which in turn I accept as sufficient to base a disbelief in each and every conceivable god.  I'm a little fuzzy on the edges, though, so opinions are welcome (but perhaps we should change the thread subject).\",\"I have two questions:  1) What would be required to create a Macintosh PC network    including laser printers, line printers, etc.?\",\"   [More stuff deleted]  This seems to be a pretty arogant definition of belief.  My beliefs are those things which I find to be true based on my experience of the world.  This experience includes study of things that I may not have experienced directly.  But even then, I can only understand the studies to the extent to which I can relate what I study back to what I have experienced.  Which means that by beliefs about God are directly related to my experience of God.  Having experienced God, I try to make sense of that experience.  I study religion and read the Bible.  I find things that echo what I have already experienced.  Out of this I build my beliefs.  I also find things that don't match my experience.  That doesn't make them false.  They just don't match my experience.  Maybe I will understand that stuff later.  I don't know.  Maybe all of my beliefs are wrong.  I can change my beliefs.  If someone else has beliefs that are different from mine, so what. Neither of us are necessarily wrong.  Someone else is making sense out of a different set of experiences.  Even though we have different explanations and beliefs, if we talk we might even discover that the underlying experiences are similar.  Some people approach religion as a truth that can only exist in one form, and usually has a single revelation.  The more dogmatic and inflexible the belief system, the more arrogant it will appear to an outsider.  There is another approach possible, however.  God is a mystery.  I am trying to solve the mystery, so I look at the evidence available to me.  I try to arrive at the best understanding that I can based on the evidence.  New evidence may cause me to change my understanding.  When I encounter someone with a different belief than my own, it isn't a threat, it is an opportunity to perhaps discover something new about this mystery I can never fully comprehend.

Typical posting:  Why have a newsgroup about atheism?  Why do atheists organize in groups?   What is there to discuss?  Response:  Many things are discussed here, including:  * Whether it is reasonable to feign theism in order to avoid upsetting one's   family * Prayer in schools * Discrimination against atheists * Sunday trading laws * The Satanic Child Abuse myth * Whether one should be an overt atheist or 'stay in the closet' * How religious societies prey (sic) on new college students * How to get rid of unwanted proselytizers * Whether religion is a danger to society and/or the individual * Why people become atheists  Of course, inevitably alt.atheism tends to attract evangelical Christians looking for someone to convert.  Most readers of the newsgroup don't  want to be preached to, although a few seem to derive perverse pleasure  from tearing apart particularly ill-considered or uninformed postings.  ------------------------------  Subject: Hitler was an atheist!  Typical posting:  Hitler was an atheist, and look at what he did!  Response:  Adolf Hitler was emphatically not an atheist.  As he said himself:     The folkish-minded man, in particular, has the sacred duty, each in    his own denomination, of making _people_stop_just_talking_    superficially_of_God's_will,_and_actually_fulfill_God's_will,_and_    not_let_God's_word_be_desecrated._[orig. ital.]     For God's will gave men their form, their essence, and their    abilities.  Anyone who destroys His work is declaring war on the    Lord's creation, the divine will.  Therefore, let every man be    active, each in his own denomination if you please, and let every    man take it as his first and most sacred duty to oppose anyone who    in his activity by word or deed steps outside the confines of his    religious community and tries to butt into the other.     [...]     Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will    of the Almighty Creator: _by_defending_myself_against_the_Jew,_I_am_    fighting_for_the_work_of_the_Lord._[orig. ital.]            -- Adolf Hitler, from \\\"Mein Kampf\\\", trans. Ralph Mannheim.  Of course, someone bad believing something does not make that belief wrong.  It's also entirely possible that Hitler was lying when he claimed  to believe in God.  We certainly can't conclude that he's an atheist,  though.  ------------------------------  Subject: The Bible proves it  Typical posting:  In the Bible it says that...  Response:  Most of the readers of alt.atheism feel that the Bible is of questionable accuracy, as it was written thousands of years ago by many authors who were recording oral tradition that existed many years before.  Thus, any claimed 'truth' in it is of questionable legitimacy.  This isn't to say that The Bible has no truth in it; simply that any truth must be examined before being accepted.  Many of the readers of this group also feel that because any passage is subject to \\\"interpretation\\\", any claim that a passage 'means' one thing and one thing only is not legitimate.  Note that this feeling tends to extend to other books.  It is also remarkable to many atheists that theists tend to ignore other equally plausible religious books in favour of those of their own religion.  ------------------------------  Subject: Pascal's Wager  Typical posting:  If you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing -- but if you don't believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you will go to hell. Therefore it is foolish to be an atheist.  Response:  This argument is known as Pascal's Wager.  It has several flaws.  Firstly, it does not indicate which religion to follow.  Indeed, there are many mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out there.  This is often described as the \\\"avoiding the wrong hell\\\" problem.  If a person is a follower of religion X, he may end up in religion Y's version of hell.  Secondly, the statement that \\\"If you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing\\\" is not true.  Suppose you're believing in the wrong God -- the true God might punish you for your foolishness. Consider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine in favour of prayer.  Another flaw in the argument is that it is based on the assumption that  the two possibilities are equally likely -- or at least, that they are of  comparable likelihood.  If, in fact, the possibility of there being a God  is close to zero, the argument becomes much less persuasive.  So sadly the argument is only likely to convince those who believe already.  Also, many feel that for intellectually honest people, belief is based on  evidence, with some amount of intuition.  It is not a matter of will or  cost-benefit analysis.  Formally speaking, the argument consists of four statements:    1. One does not know whether God exists.   2. Not believing in God is bad for one's eternal soul if God does      exist.   3. Believing in God is of no consequence if God does not exist.   4. Therefore it is in one's interest to believe in God.  There are two approaches to the argument.  The first is to view 1 as an assumption, and 2 as a consequence of it.  One problem with this approach, in the abstract, is that it creates information from no information.  This is considered invalid in information theory.  Statement 1 indicates one has no information about God -- but statement 2 indicates that beneficial information can be gained from the absolute lack of information about God.  This violates information entropy -- information has been extracted from no information, at no \\\"cost\\\".  The alternative approach is to claim that 1 and 2 are both assumptions.  The problem with this is that 2 is then basically an assumption which states the Christian position, and only a Christian will agree with that assumption. The argument thus collapses to \\\"If you are a Christian, it is in your interests to believe in God\\\" -- a rather vacuous tautology, and not the way Pascal intended the argument to be viewed.  The biggest reason why Pascal's wager is a failure is that if God is omniscient he will certainly know who really believes and who believes as a wager.  He will spurn the latter... assuming he actually cares at all whether people believe in him.  ------------------------------  Subject: What is Occam's Razor?  Typical posting:  People keep talking about Occam's Razor.  What is it?  Response:  William of Occam formulated a principle which has become known as Occam's  Razor.  In its original form, it said \\\"Do not multiply entities  unnecessarily.\\\"  That is, if you can explain something without supposing the existence of some entity, then do so.  Nowadays when people refer to Occam's Razor, they generally express it  more generally, for example as \\\"Take the simplest solution\\\".  The relevance to atheism is that we can look at two possible explanations  for what we see around us:  1. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, which came into being as a result of natural processes.  2. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, and  there is also a God who created the universe.  Clearly this God must be  of non-zero complexity.  Given that both explanations fit the facts, Occam's Razor might suggest  that we should take the simpler of the two -- solution number one. Unfortunately, some argue that there is a third even more simple solution:  3. There isn't an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there.   We just imagine that there is.  This third option leads us logically towards solipsism, which many people  find unacceptable.   ------------------------------  Subject: Why it's good to believe in Jesus  Typical posting:  I want to tell people about the virtues and benefits of my religion.  Response:  Preaching is not appreciated.  Feel free to talk about your religion, but please do not write postings that are on a \\\"conversion\\\" theme.  Such postings do not belong on alt.atheism and will be rejected from alt.atheism.moderated (try the newsgroup talk.religion.misc).  You would doubtless not welcome postings from atheists to your favourite newsgroup in an attempt to convert you; please do unto others as you would have them do unto you!  Often theists make their basic claims about God in the form of lengthy analogies or parables.  Be aware that atheists have heard of God and know the basic claims about him; if the sole purpose of your parable is to tell atheists that God exists and brings salvation, you may as well not post it, since it tells us nothing we have not been told before.  ------------------------------  Subject: Why I know that God exists  Typical posting:  I *know* from personal experience and prayer that God exists.  Response:  Just as many theists have personal evidence that the being they worship exists, so many atheists have personal evidence that such beings do not exist.  That evidence varies from person to person.  Furthermore, without wishing to dismiss your evidence out of hand, many people have claimed all kinds of unlikely things -- that they have been abducted by UFOs, visited by the ghost of Elvis, and so on.  ------------------------------  Subject: Einstein and \\\"God does not play dice\\\"  Typical posting:  Albert Einstein believed in God.  Do you think you're cleverer than him?  Response:  Einstein did once comment that \\\"God does not play dice [with the universe]\\\".  This quotation is commonly mentioned to show that Einstein believed in the Christian God.  Used this way, it is out of context; it refers to Einstein's refusal to accept the uncertainties indicated by quantum theory. Furthermore, Einstein's religious background was Jewish rather than Christian.  A better quotation showing what Einstein thought about God is the following: \\\"I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists, not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings.\\\"  Einstein was unable to accept Quantum Theory because of his belief in an objective, orderly reality; a reality which would not be subject to random events and which would not be dependent upon the observer.  He believed that QM was incomplete, and that a better theory would have no need for statistical interpretations.  So far no such better theory has been found, and much evidence suggests that it never will be.  A longer quote from Einstein appears in \\\"Science, Philosophy, and Religion, A Symposium\\\", published by the Conference on Science, Philosophy and Religion in Their Relation to the Democratic Way of Life, Inc., New York, 1941.  In    \\\"The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events    the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side    of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature.  For him    neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an    independent cause of natural events.  To be sure, the doctrine of a    personal God interfering with natural events could never be    *refuted* [italics his], in the real sense, by science, for this    doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific    knowledge has not yet been able to set foot.     But I am convinced that such behavior on the part of representatives    of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal.  For a doctrine    which is to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark,    will of necessity lose its effect on mankind, with incalculable harm    to human progress.  In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers    of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal    God, that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past    placed such vast power in the hands of priests.  In their labors they    will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable    of cultivating the Good, the True, and the Beautiful in humanity    itself.  This is, to be sure, a more difficult but an incomparably    more worthy task...\\\"     \\\"It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religous convictions,    a lie which is being systematically repeated.  I do not believe in a    personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly.    If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the    unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our    science can reveal it.\\\"  The latter quote is from \\\"Albert Einstein: The Human Side\\\", edited by Helen  Dukas and Banesh Hoffman, and published by Princeton University Press.   Also from the same book:    \\\"I do not believe in immortality of the individual, and I consider ethics    to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind     it.\\\"  Of course, the fact that Einstein chose not to believe in Christianity does  not in itself imply that Christianity is false.  ------------------------------  Subject: Everyone worships something  Typical posting:  Everyone worships something, whether it's money, power or God.  Response:  If that is true, everyone is a polytheist.  Theists care just as much about those things that atheists care about.  If the atheists' reactions to (for example) their families amount to worship then so do the theists'.  ------------------------------  Subject: Why there must be a causeless cause  Typical posting:  Sets of integers that have a lower bound each have a smallest member, so chains of causes must all have a first element, a causeless cause.  Response:  The set of real numbers greater than zero has a definite lower bound, but has no smallest member.  Further, even if it is true that there must be a causeless cause, that does not imply that that cause must be a conscious supernatural entity, and especially not that any such entity must match the description favoured by any particular religion.  ------------------------------  Subject: The universe is so complex it must have been designed  Typical posting:  The presence of design in the universe proves there is a God.  Surely you don't think all this appeared here just by chance?  Response:  This is known as the Argument From Design.  It is a matter of dispute whether there is any element of design in the universe. Those who believe that the complexity and diversity of living creatures on the earth is evidence of a creator are best advised to read the newsgroup talk.origins for a while.  There is insufficient space to summarize both sides of that debate here. However, the conclusion is that there is no scientific evidence in favour of so-called Scientific Creationism. Furthermore, there is much evidence, observation and theory that can explain many of the complexities of the universe and life on earth.  The origin of the Argument by Design is a feeling that the existence of something as incredibly intricate as, say, a human is so improbable that surely it can't have come about by chance; that surely there must be some  external intelligence directing things so that humans come from the chaos deliberately.  But if human intelligence is so improbable, surely the existence of a mind capable of fashioning an entire universe complete with conscious beings must be immeasurably more unlikely?  The approach used to argue in favour of the existence of a creator can be turned around and applied to the Creationist position.  This leads us to the familiar theme of \\\"If a creator created the universe, what created the creator?\\\", but with the addition of spiralling  improbability.  The only way out is to declare that the creator was not created and just \\\"is\\\" (or \\\"was\\\").  From here we might as well ask what is wrong with saying that the universe just \\\"is\\\" without introducing a creator?  Indeed Stephen Hawking, in his book \\\"A Brief History of Time\\\", explains his theory that the universe is closed and finite in extent, with no beginning or end.  The Argument From Design is often stated by analogy, in the so-called  Watchmaker Argument.  One is asked to imagine that one has found a watch on the beach.  Does one assume that it was created by a watchmaker, or that it evolved naturally?  Of course one assumes a watchmaker.  Yet like the  watch, the universe is intricate and complex; so, the argument goes, the  universe too must have a creator.  The Watchmaker analogy suffers from three particular flaws, over and above  those common to all Arguments By Design.  Firstly, a watchmaker creates  watches from pre-existing materials, whereas God is claimed to have  created the universe from nothing.  These two sorts of creation are  clearly fundamentally different, and the analogy is therefore rather weak.  Secondly, a watchmaker makes watches, but there are many other things in  the world.  If we walked further along the beach and found a nuclear  reactor, we wouldn't assume it was created by the watchmaker.  The argument  would therefore suggest a multitude of creators, each responsible for a  different part of creation.  Finally, in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that  the watch is not part of nature because it is ordered, and therefore  stands out from the randomness of nature.  Yet in the second part of the  argument, we start from the position that the universe is obviously not  random, but shows elements of order.  The Watchmaker argument is thus  internally inconsistent.  ------------------------------  Subject: Independent evidence that the Bible is true  Typical posting:  The events of the New Testament are confirmed by independent documentary evidence.  For example...  Response:  The writings of Josephus are often mentioned as independent documentary evidence.  Early versions of Josephus's work are thought not to have mentioned Jesus or James; the extant version discusses John in a non-Christian context.  Many scholars believe that the original mentioned Jesus and James in passing, but that this was expanded by Christian copyists.  Several \\\"reconstructions\\\" of the original text have been published to this effect.  Much information appears in the Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius (about 320 C.E.).  It is worthless as historical material because of the deliberate falsification of the wily Eusebius who is generally acknowledged as 'the first thoroughly dishonest historian of antiquity.' It is Eusebius who is generally given the title of authorship for this material.  Aside from the New Testament, the biographical information about Jesus is more well-documented.  For further information, please consult the Frequently Asked Questions file for the newsgroup soc.religion.christian.  ------------------------------  Subject: Godel's Incompleteness Theorem  Typical posting:  Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible for the Bible to be both true and complete.  Response:  Godel's First Incompleteness Theorem says that in any consistent formal  system which is sufficiently expressive that it can model ordinary  arithmetic, one can formulate expressions which can never be proven to be  valid or invalid ('true' or 'false') within that formal system.  (Technically speaking, the system must also be recursive; that is, there must be a decision procedure for determining whether a given string is an axiom within the formal  system.)  Essentially, all such systems can formulate what is known as a \\\"Liar  Paradox.\\\"  The classic Liar Paradox sentence in ordinary English is \\\"This  sentence is false.\\\"  Note that if a proposition is undecidable, the formal  system cannot even deduce that it is undecidable.  The logic used in theological discussions is rarely well defined, so claims that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible to prove or disprove) the existence of God are worthless in isolation.  One can trivially define a formal system in which it is possible to prove the existence of God, simply by having the existence of God stated as an axiom.  This is unlikely to be viewed by atheists as a convincing proof, however.  It may be possible to succeed in producing a formal system built on axioms that both atheists and theists agree with.  It may then be possible to show that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem holds for that system.  However, that would still not demonstrate that it is impossible to prove that God exists within the system.  Furthermore, it certainly wouldn't tell us anything about whether it is possible to prove the existence of God generally.  Note also that all of these hypothetical formal systems tell us nothing about the actual existence of God; the formal systems are just abstractions.  Another frequent claim is that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that a religious text (the Bible, the Book of Mormon or whatever) cannot be both consistent and universally applicable. Religious texts are not formal systems, so such claims are nonsense.  ------------------------------  Subject: George Bush on atheism and patriotism  Typical posting:  Did George Bush really say that atheists should not be considered citizens?  Response:  The following exchange took place at the Chicago airport between Robert I. Sherman of American Atheist Press and George Bush, on August 27 1988. Sherman is a fully accredited reporter, and was present by invitation as a member of the press corps.  The Republican presidential nominee was there to announce federal disaster relief for Illinois.  The discussion turned to the presidential primary:   RS: \\\"What will you do to win the votes of Americans who are atheists?\\\"   GB: \\\"I guess I'm pretty weak in the atheist community.  Faith in       God is important to me.\\\"   RS: \\\"Surely you recognize the equal citizenship and patriotism of       Americans who are atheists?\\\"   GB: \\\"No, I don't know that atheists should be considered as citizens,       nor should they be considered patriots.  This is one nation under       God.\\\"   RS: \\\"Do you support as a sound constitutional principle the separation       of state and church?\\\"   GB: \\\"Yes, I support the separation of church and state.  I'm just not       very high on atheists.\\\"  UPI reported on May 8, 1989, that various atheist organizations were still angry over the remarks.  The exchange appeared in the Boulder Daily Camera on Monday February 27, 1989.  It can also be found in \\\"Free Enquiry\\\" magazine, Fall 1988 issue, Volume 8, Number 4, page 16.  On October 29, 1988, Mr. Sherman had a confrontation with Ed Murnane, cochairman of the Bush-Quayle '88 Illinois campaign.  This concerned a lawsuit Mr. Sherman had filed to stop the Community Consolidated School District 21 (Chicago, Illinois) from forcing his first-grade Atheist son to pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States as \\\"one nation under God\\\" (Bush's phrase).  The following conversation took place:    RS: \\\"American Atheists filed the Pledge of Allegiance lawsuit yesterday.       Does the Bush campaign have an official response to this filing?\\\"    EM: \\\"It's bullshit.\\\"    RS: \\\"What is bullshit?\\\"    EM: \\\"Everything that American Atheists does, Rob, is bullshit.\\\"    RS: \\\"Thank you for telling me what the official position of the Bush       campaign is on this issue.\\\"   EM: \\\"You're welcome.\\\"  After Bush's election, American Atheists wrote to Bush asking him to retract his statement.  On February 21st 1989, C. Boyden Gray, Counsel to the President, replied on White House stationery that Bush substantively stood by    \\\"As you are aware, the President is a religious man who neither supports    atheism nor believes that atheism should be unnecessarily encouraged or    supported by the government.\\\"  For further information, contact American Atheist Veterans at the American Atheist Press's Cameron Road address.  ------------------------------  Subject: I know where hell is!  Typical posting:  I know where Hell is!  Hell is in Norway!  Response:  There are several towns called \\\"Hell\\\" in various countries around the world, including Norway and the USA.  Whilst this information is mildly amusing the first time one hears it, readers of alt.atheism are now  getting pretty fed up with hearing it every week.  ------------------------------  Subject: Biblical contradictions wanted  Typical posting:  Does anyone have a list of Biblical contradictions?  Response:   American Atheist Press publish an atheist's handbook detailing Biblical contradictions. See the accompanying posting on Atheist Resources for details.  There is a file containing some Biblical contradictions available from the archive-server@mantis.co.uk. See the contacts file for more information.  ------------------------------  Subject: The USA is a Christian nation  Typical posting:  Because of the religious beliefs of the founding fathers, shouldn't the United States be considered a Christian nation?  Response:  Based upon the writings of several important founding fathers, it is clear that they never intended the US to be a Christian nation.  Here are some quotes; there are many more.    \\\"What influence, in fact, have ecclesiastical establishments had on society?    In some instances they have been seen to erect a spiritual tyranny on the    ruins of the civil authority; on many instances they have been seen    upholding the thrones of political tyranny; in no instance have they been    the guardians of the liberties of the people.  Rulers who wish to subvert    the public liberty may have found an established clergy convenient    auxiliaries. A just government, instituted to secure and perpetuate it,    needs them not.\\\"       - James Madison, \\\"A Memorial and Remonstrance\\\", 1785    \\\"I almost shudder at the thought of alluding to the most fatal example of    the abuses of grief which the history of mankind has preserved--the Cross.    Consider what calamities that engine of grief has produced!\\\"       - John Adams, in a letter to Thomas Jefferson    \\\"History I believe furnishes no example of a priest-ridden people    maintaining a free civil government.  This marks the lowest grade of    ignorance, of which their political as well as religious leaders will    always avail themselves for their own purpose.\\\"        - Thomas Jefferson to Baron von Humboldt, 1813    \\\"I cannot conceive otherwise than that He, the Infinite Father, expects or    requires no worship or praise from us, but that He is even infinitely    above it.\\\"        - Benjamin Franklin, from \\\"Articles of Belief and Acts of Religion\\\",         Nov. 20, 1728  ------------------------------  Subject: The USA is not a Christian nation  Typical posting:  Is it true that George Washington said that the United States is not in any sense founded upon the Christian religion?  Response:  No.  The quotation often given is in fact from Article XI of the 1797 Treaty of Tripoli (8 Stat 154, Treaty Series 358):     Article 11     As the government of the United States of America is not in any sense    founded on the Christian Religion, -- as it has in itself no character of    enmity against the laws, religion or tranquility of Musselmen, -- and as    the said States never have entered into any war or act of hostility    against any Mehomitan nation, it is declared by the parties that no    pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption    of the harmony existing between the two countries.  The text may be found in the Congressional Record or in treaty collections such as Charles Bevans' \\\"Treaties and Other International Agreements of the United States of America 1776-1949\\\", vol. 11 (pp. 1070-1080).  The English text of the Treaty of Tripoli was approved by the U.S. Senate on June 7, 1797 and ratified by President John Adams on June 10, 1797.  It was recently discovered that the Arabic version of the treaty not only lacks the quotation, it lacks Article XI altogether.  The person who translated the Arabic to English was Joel Barlow, Consul General at Algiers, a close friend of Thomas Paine -- and an opponent of Christianity.  It is possible that Barlow made up Article XI, but since there is no Arabic version of that article to be found, it's hard to say.  In 1806 a new Treaty of Tripoli was ratified which no longer contained the quotation. \",\"(note: this is not about the L.A. or NY Times)  A few times a year, a funny thing happens: the bike engine runs perfectly.  Completely smooth.  Not that it runs poorly normally, but on these days, it is exceptional.  My theory is that the air density and moisture content of the air are such that I get complete combustion.  Needless to say, it puts me in a great mood.  The mood lasted for about 20 miles.  Heading north on the 405 freeway, about a mile or two south of the 10, my throttle stopped responding.... and I was between lanes.  Nothing to do but make  my way over 4 lanes to the shoulder... initially by gliding, then by pushing.  At least traffic was heavy enough so that cars did not mind stopping for me.  Turned out to be a screw unscrewed inside my Mikuni HS40  carb.  I keep hearing that one should keep all of the screws tight on a bike, but I never thought that I had to do that on the screws inside of a carb.

Helsingius?   * * *  _____ <8.1> What are some known anonymous remailing and posting sites?    Currently the most stable of anonymous remailing and posting sites   is anon.penet.fi operated by julf@penet.fi for several months, who   has system adminstrator privileges and owns the equipment.    Including anonymized mail, Usenet posting, and return addresses    (no encryption).  Send mail to help@penet.fi for information.     Hal Finney has contributed an instruction manual for the cypherpunk   remailers on the ftp site soda.berkeley.edu (128.32.149.19):   pub/cypherpunks/hal's.instructions. See also scripts.tar.Z (UNIX   scripts to aid remailer use) and anonmail.arj (MSDOS batch files to   aid remailer use).    ebrandt@jarthur.claremont.edu   -----------------------------     Anonymized mail.  Request information from above address.        elee7h5@rosebud.ee.uh.edu   -------------------------     Experimental anonymous remailer run Karl Barrus     <elee9sf@Menudo.UH.EDU>, with encryption to the server.

Request information from above address.    phantom@mead.u.washington.edu    -----------------------------     Experimental remailer with encryption to server.  `finger' site     address for information.    Notes   =====      - Cypherpunk remailers tend to be unstable because they are often     running without site administrator knowledge. Liability issues     are wholly unresolved.      - So far, all encryption is based on public-key cryptography and PGP     software (see the question on cryptography).     - Encryption aspects (message text, destination address, replies)     vary between sites.    - Multiple chaining, alias unlinking, and address encryption are     mostly untested, problematic, or unsupported at this time.  _____ <8.2> What are the responsibilities associated with anonymity?       Users   -----    - Use anonymity only if you have to. Frivolous uses weaken the     seriousness and usefulness of the capability for others.   - Do not use anonymity to provoke, harass, or threaten others.   - Do not hide behind anonymity to evade established conventions on     Usenet,  such as posting binary pictures to regular newsgroups.   - If posting large files, be attentive to bandwidth considerations.     Remember, simply sending the posting to the service increases     network traffic.   - Avoid posting anonymously to the regular hierarchy of Usenet; this     is the mostly likely place to alienate readers. The `alt'     hierarchy is preferred.   - Give as much information as possible in the posting (i.e.     references, etc.) Remember that content is the only means for     readers to judge the truth of the message, and that any     inaccuracies will tend to discredit the entire message and even     future ones under the same handle.   - Be careful not to include information that will reveal your     identity or enable someone to deduce it.  Test the system by     sending anonymized mail to yourself.   - Be aware of the policies of the anonymous site and respect them.      Be prepared to forfeit your anonymity if you abuse the privilege.   - Be considerate and respectful of other's objections to anonymity.   - ``Hit-and-run'' anonymity should be used with utmost reservation.     Use services that provide anonymous return addresses instead.   - Be courteous to the system operator, who may have invested large     amounts of time, be personally risking his account, or dedicating     his hardware, all for your convenience.    Operators   ---------    - Document thoroughly acceptable and unacceptable uses in an     introductory file that is sent to new users.  Have a coherent and     consistent policy and stick to it. State clearly what logging and     monitoring is occurring. Describe your background, interest, and     security measures. Will the general approach be totalitarian or     lassaiz-faire?   - Formulate a plan for problematic ethical situations and anticipate     potentially intense moral quandaries and dilemmas. What if a user     is blackmailing someone through your service? What if a user     posts suicidal messages through your service? Remember, your     users trust you to protect them.   - In the site introductory note, give clear examples  of situations     where you will take action and what these actions will be (e.g.     warn the user, limit anonymity to email or posting only, revoke     the account, 'out' the user, contact local administrator, etc.)   - Describe exactly the limitations of the software and hardware.     Address the bandwidth limitations of your site. Report candidly     and thoroughly all bugs that have  occurred.  Work closely with     users to isolate and fix bugs. Address all bugs noted below under     ``(in)stability of anonymity''.   - Document the stability of the site---how long has it been running?     What compromises have occured? Why are you running it? What is     your commitment to it?   - Include a disclaimer in outgoing mail and messages.  Include an     address for complaints, ideally appended to every outgoing item.      Consult a lawyer about your liability.   - Be committed to the long-term stability of the site. Be prepared     to deal with complaints and `hate mail' addressed to you.  If you     do not own the hardware the system runs on or are not the system     adminstrator, consult those who do and are.   - Be considerate of providing anonymity to various groups.  If     possible, query group readers.   - Keep a uniformity and simplicity of style in outgoing message     format that can be screened effectively by kill files.  Ensure     the key text `Anon' is  somewhere in every header.   - Take precautions to ensure the security of the server from     physical and  network-based attacks and infiltrations.    Readers   -------      - Do not complain, attack, or discredit a poster for the sole reason     that he is posting anonymously, make blanket condemnations that     equate anonymity with cowardice and criminality, or assail     anonymous traffic in general for mostly neutral reasons (e.g. its     volume is heavy or increasing).   - React to the anonymous information unemotionally.  Abusive posters     will be encouraged further if they get irrationally irate     responses.  Sometimes the most effective response is silence.   - Notify operators if very severe abuses occur, such as piracy,     harassment, extortion, etc.   - Do not complain about postings being inappropriate because they     offend you personally.   - Use kill files to screen anonymous postings if you object to the     idea of anonymity itself.   - Avoid the temptation to proclaim that all anonymous postings     should be barred from particular groups because no `possible' or     `conceivable' need exists.    References   ----------      See e.g. ftp.eff.org:/pub/academic/anonymity:    > This article is an excerpt from an issue of FIDONEWS on individual   > privacy and the use of handles.  It accepts the need of a system   > operator to know the name of a user; but suggests that the use of   > a handle is analogous to a request to withhold the name in a   > letter to the editor. The article concludes with a set of   > guidelines for preserving the right to be anonymous.  _____ <8.3> How do I `kill' anonymous postings?    James Thomas Green <jgreen@zeus.calpoly.edu>:    > Try putting this in your kill file:   >      >   /Anon/h:j   >   /Anonymous/h:j   >    > This will search the headers of the messages and kill any that   > contain `Anon' or `Anonymous' in them.  Not perfect and won't   > kill followups.       Note that anonymous server operators have the capability to mask   anonymous postings under which the above method will not work; so   far this practice is not widespread, but it may become more common   as a countermeasure to widespread anonymous filtering.    _____ <8.4> What is the history behind anonymous posting servers?    Originally anonymous posting services were introduced for   individual, particularly volatile newsgroups, where anonymity is   almost the preferred method of communication, such as talk.abortion   and alt.sex.bondage.  One of the first was one by Dave Mack   started in ~1988 for alt.sex.bondage. Another early one was   wizvax.methuen.ma.us run by Stephanie Gilgut (Gilgut Enterprises)   but was disbanded due to  lack of funds.  The system provided   anonymous return addresses. n7kbt.rain.com (John Opalko) took up   the functions of this server, including reinstating the anonymous   alias file. The group ``alt.personals has been chewing through   servers like there's no tomorrow.''      Spurred by the disappearance of `wizvax' and interested in   researching the idea, Karl Kleinpaste   <Karl_Kleinpaste@godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu> developed his own system   from scratch in six hours. By this time the idea of extending the   server to new, more `mainstream'  groups was starting to emerge,   and he explored the possibility partly at the specific request  by   multiple users for anonymity in other groups. ``The intended   advantage of my system was specifically to allow multiple group   support, with a single anon identifier across all.  This was   arguably the single biggest deficiency of previous anon systems.''    K. Kleinpaste posted a message on rec.nude asking users whether an   anonymous service would be welcome there, and judged a consensus   against it.     K. Kleinpaste introduced what he calls a ``fire extinguisher'' to   `squelch' or `plonk' abusive users in response to complaints, and   used this in three cases. Nevertheless, after a few months of   intense traffic he was eventually overwhelmed by the abuses of his   server. ``Even as restricted as it was, my system was subjected to   abuses to the point where it was ordered dismantled by the   facilities staff here. Such abuses started right after it was   created.''    In ~Nov 1992, Johan Helsingius (julf@penet.FI) set up the most   controversial anonymous site to date. anon.penet.fi is based on   scripts and C code written by K. Kleinpaste and supports anonymized   mail, posting, and return addresses. He initially wanted to confine   the service to Scandinavian users but expanded it to worldwide   accessability in response to 'lots' of international requests.      J. Helsingius policy of allowing anonymous posting to every Usenet   newsgroup has been met with strong and serious ideological   opposition (e.g. by news adminstrators in news.admin.policy).   Because of the relative newness and recent emergence of the medium,   abuses by anonymous posters  tend to have higher visibility than   ``routine'' abuses. His total commitment to preservation of   anonymity is also controversial.    For example, in a highly controversial and publicized case in ~Feb   1993,  an anonymous user posted a supposed transcript of desperate   crew dialogue during the Challenger shuttle disaster via   anon.penet.fi to sci.astro. Despite that the transcript had been   posted in the same place up to a year earlier (then   non-anonymously) and actually originated not with the poster but a   New York news tabloid, subsequent responses consisted largely of   vociferous outrage at the poster's use of anonymity, reverberating   through many newsgroups.       The original poster, using the same anonymous handle, later conceded   that the story ``seemed likely to have been fabricated,''   suggesting the plausible possibility that the original intent was   not to provoke outrage but gauge reactions on the authenticity of   the story (albeit crudely), free of personal risk from perceived   association with the item.  The ensuing commotion generated queries   for the original article by late-entering readers. The anonymous   user later posted deliberately offensive comments at his   detractors.    Despite piercingly irate and outraged complaints, and even the vocal   opposition and verbal abuse of K. Kleinpaste and eminent news   operators, J. Helsingius has largely avoided use of the ``fire   extingisher'' and the ``group bouncer'' mechanisms that limit the   scope of the service. As of ~March 1993 the anon.penet.fi site is   best described as `inundated': it has registered over 13,000 users   in its initial three months of operation, forwards ~3000 messages a   day, and approximately 5% of all Usenet postings are anonymized   through the site. The immense popularity is probably largely due   to the capability for `global' anonymity which has allowed users to   find creative uses in diverse areas not previously envisioned.    Johan Helsingius has been subject to extraordinary pressure to   dismantle his server in ~Feb 1993. At one point K. Kleinpaste   threatened publicly to organize a sort of vigilante group of irate   news operators to  send out revocation commands on all messages   originating from the site.  J. Helsingius has also alluded to   threats of flooding the  server.  The server has crashed several   times, at least once due to a saturation `mailbombing' through it   by an anonymous user.  Mr. Helsingius reports spending up to 5   hours per day  answering email requests alone associated with the   service's administration. In response to the serious threats he   disabled global group access temporarily for one week and   encouraged his users to defend the service publicly.      Based on fast-moving dialogue and creative suggestions by   ``cypherpunks,'' J. Helsingius has identified many security   weaknesses and valuable new features for the service, and is   currently in the process of code development and testing. He is   planning on upgrading the IBM compatible 386 machine to a 486 soon   to handle the voluminous load and is  considering integrating a new   system with very sophisticated functionality, including multiple   email aliases, alias allocation control, public-key encryption,   etc.    A very sophisticated anonymous posting system was set up in Dec.   1992 by D. Clunie <dclunie@pax.tpa.com.au> that used cryptography   in both directions (to/from) the server for the highest degree of   confidentiality seen so far.  However, it was running on a public   access account, and he had to shut it down after only several   weeks, upon receiving requests and conditions apparently ultimately   originating from NSF representatives. D. Clunie has released the   software to the public domain.    Recently the idea of a newsgroup devoted to `whistleblowing' on   government abuses has received wide and focused attention, and   group formation is currently underway.  In the basic scenario the   group would allow people to post pseudonymously using remailers,   and even establish reputations based on their authentifiable   digital signatures. The traffic may eventually reach reporters in   the mainstream news media.  deltorto@aol.com has volunteered to   attack multiple aspects of this project, including distributing   easy-to-read documentation on posting, anonymization, and   encryption.

April 6, 1993  RELEASE:  93-64          Dr.  John H.  Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and Technology Policy, outlined to the members-designate of the Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space Station on April 3, three budget options as guidance to the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the space station.          A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7 billion and a high option of $9 billion will be considered by the committee.  Each option would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal year 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development, operations, utilization, Shuttle integration, facilities, research operations support, transition cost and also must include adequate program reserves to insure program implementation within the available funds.          Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within the NASA budget for the President's new technology investment.  As a result, station options above $7 billion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions in the rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space station option of $9 billion would require $2 billion in offsets from the NASA budget over the next 5 years.          Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of the advisory committee.  Generally, the members-designate focused upon administrative topics and used the session to get acquainted.  They also received a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the Station Redesign Team is following to develop options for the advisory committee to consider.          Gibbons also announced that the United States and its international partners -- the Europeans, Japanese and Canadians -- have decided, after consultation, to give \\\"full consideration\\\" to use of Russian assets in the course of the space station redesign process.          To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate in the redesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis, so that the redesign team can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR and the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems. The U.S. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of the Russian participants in assessing Russian systems and technology.  The overall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing station costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilitiaes. Careful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achieving that goal.          Gibbons reiterated that, \\\"President Clinton is committed to the redesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the science, the technology and the jobs that the space station program represents.  However, he also is committed to a space station that is well managed and one that does not consume the national resources which should be used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation.\\\"          NASA Administrator Daniel S.  Goldin said the Russian participation will be accomplished through the East-West Space Science Center at the University of Maryland under the leadership of Roald Sagdeev.\",\"Thanks for the Update.\",\"Does anybody know anything about the chips D6275A/D6235A/D6205A chips from DSP Telecommunications Inc?

If you don't do this before fixing the alignment problem you have kissd those files goodbye.  (Well, you can -try- to re-misalign the drive back to read your floppies, but don't count on be able to do so!)  Generally, head alignment is something I'd only trust to a good repair shop (though there are/have been DIY guides).\",\"op that worked was the \\\"Macintosh |> >Software\\\" loop (whatever that means). |>  |> I doubt this is a Quadra-specific problem.

We're looking for more than \\\"Well, the 2-pc is more versatile, but the     1-pc is better protection,...\\\"      Thanks in advance,    Nadine   What is best? Books have been written on that! But in regard to AeroStich it really depends on your particular size, shape and needs. If you upper and lower body are not proportional (according to aero dimensions) then it probably is going to be better mixing and matching the 2 piece suit. I have the 2 piece suit and I am very happy with it. Having my life quota of scars from crashing off road, I am very concerned with good protection and I believe that the difference in protection between the 1 and 2 piece suits is almost negligible. I think the optional hip pads and back protector make much more of a difference. One thing that is nice about the 2 piece is if you go somewhere and then want to walk around for a while (still with jacket) you can just detach and stow the pants.   One thing to note is that Goldfine has problems getting a good fit for many women (with standard suits). Supposedly for smaller women (and petite men for that matter) the 1 piece will fit better.   Another recommendation is to pay for mods if you need them. I wish I got 2-3 inches added to my pant legs. I find the Long suits are not really that long (I can't imagine how short the standard suits must be).  \",\"   Did the Russian spacecraft(s) on the ill-fated Phobos mission a few years ago send back any images of the Martian moon?

After a while we got round to filling all the current-input jacks with silicone - electricians have a regrettable habit of not checking where the last guy left the leads before using a 3 1/2 digit 0.5 % autoranging $400 meter to check if a fuse is good or not. Its very hard on meters (and electricians) when you put the milliamp shunt across a 600 volt bus.    But that's not why we stopped buying Beckmans - after a while a  lot of them got \\\"funny\\\" in the LCD display.

Now we buy Flukes, the low-end 20 series mostly ( and we still fill the amp jack with  silicone).    What the world needs is a meter that won't let you change ranges or turn it on/off with a lead stuck in the amps jack - a little bit of clever plastic detailing would take care of this and make the world safer for electricans, anyway.

BACKGROUND  ----------   The racing listserver (boogie.EBay.sun.com) contains discussions   devoted to racing and racing-related topics. This is a pretty broad   interest group. Individuals have a variety of backgrounds: motojournalism,   roadracing from the perspective of pit crew and racers, engineering,  motosports enthusiasts.   The size of the list grows weekly. We are currently at a little  over one hundred and eighty-five members, with contributors from  New Zealand, Australia, Germany, France, England, Canada  Finland, Switzerland, and the United States.   The list was formed (October 1991) in response to a perceived need   to both provide technical discussion of riding at the edge of   performance (roadracing) and to improve on the very low signal-to-noise   ratio found in rec.motorcycles. Anyone is free to join.   Discussion is necessarily limited by the rules of the list to   issues related to racing motorcycles and is to be \\\"flame-free\\\".     HOW TO GET THE DAILY DISTRIBUTION  ---------------------------------   You are welcome to subscribe. To subscribe send your request to:           race-request@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM    Traffic currently runs between five and twenty-five messages per day  (depending on the topic).      NB: Please do _not_ send your subscription request to the        list directly.    After you have contacted the list administrator, you will receive  an RSVP request. Please respond to this request in a timely manner  so that you can be added to the list. The request is generated in  order to insure that there is a valid mail pathway to your site.    Upon receipt of your RSVP, you will be added to either the daily  or digest distribution (as per your initial request).   HOW TO GET THE DIGEST DISTRIBUTION  ----------------------------------   It is possible to receive the list in 'digest'ed form (ie. a  single email message). The RoadRacing Digest is mailed out   whenever it contains enough interesting content. Given the  frequency of postings this appears to be about every other  day.   Should you wish to receive the list via digest (once every   30-40K or so), please send a subscription request to:           digest-request@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM    HOW TO POST TO THE LIST  -----------------------   This is an open forum. To post an article to the list, send to:           race@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM    Depending on how mail is set up at your site you may or may  not see the mail that you have posted. If you want to see it  (though this isn't necessarily a guarantee that it went out)  you can include a \\\"metoo\\\" line in your .mailrc file (on UNIX  based mail systems).    BOUNCES  -------   Because I haven't had the time (or the inclination to replace  the list distribution mechanism) we still have a problem with  bounces returning to the poster of a message. Occasionally,  sites or users go off-line (either leaving their place of  employment prematurely or hardware problems) and you will receive  bounces from the race list. Check the headers carefully, and  if you find that the bounce originated at Sun (from whence I  administer this list) contact me through my administration  hat (race-request@boogie.EBay.sun.com). If not, ignore the bounce.

Dealer found  quilty, fined and had to take back the car.  I think you have a case if you can get a sworn statement from the previous owner. Take the car back to the dealer and threaten him or something.\",\" John 12:24-26: \\\"Most assuredly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls onto the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it produces much grain.   \\\"He who loves his life will lose it, and he who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life.   \\\"If anyone serves Me, let him follow Me; and where I am, there My servant will be also.  If anyone serves Me, him My Father will honor.\\\"  Why would I want an eternal life if I hate this one?  If we were created by a deity, why would that deity not wish us to enjoy what he has given us?  Why would I want to live forever?  The challenge in my life is that I will die, and that I must give my life the meaning I wish it to have before that happens.  My time is here and will someday pass; I will be content to live on in the memories of my friends, and once they too are dead, then I will no longer have any reason to exist.  In short: even if your deity *does* exist, that doesn't automatically mean that I would worship it.  I am content to live my own life, and fend for myself, so when I die, I can be proud of the fact that no matter where I end up, it will be because of *my* actions and *my* choices.  If your god decides to toss me into a flaming pit for this, then so be it.  I would much rather just cease to exist.  But if your god wants my respect and my obedience, then it had better earn these; and if it does, then they will be very strong and true.   Jesus wasn't the only one who rose from the dead -- I think it was Osiris who did the same, as well as a few characters from Greek or Norse legend, if memory serves.  But still: WHY would I want to rise from the dead?  Why do *you* want to?   If your god wants to win my devotion, then it knows what it can do -- provide some way for me to believe without having to resort to blind faith that could be applied equally well to any religion.   That's precisely it.  I neither see nor know Zeus either, nor Odin. Shall I offer them the same devotion I offer Jesus?   You've got to understand my point-of-view: I see Christians spouting Bible verse all the time as if it were some sort of magic spell that will level all opposition.  Truth is, it's not.  Robert has never demonstrated that he actually understands what the verses imply; he just rattles them off day by day.  Some brazenly fly in the face of common sense and reality, and I point these out where I can.  But even more than that, even when Christians *do* try to explain the verses in their own words, they do so from a Christian point of view, which is that every human being would want to be a Christian if only he or she understood the Christian message properly, and then all strife and suffering on the earth would end.  Here's the problem with that: substitute \\\"Moslem\\\" or \\\"Buddhist\\\" or \\\"Satanist\\\" instead of \\\"Christian\\\", and it means the same thing.  Christanity is a very nice belief set around a very nice book.  But if you want to make me believe that it has any bearing on the REAL WORLD, you've got some convincing to do.   And in my opinion, you're bumbling about blindly making up entities where there aren't any, and depriving yourself of a true understanding and enjoyment of your life.  As long as you keep your beliefs to yourself, I'll keep my beliefs to myself -- but as soon as you start waving them around, expect me to toss in my opinions, too.\",\"(Frank DeCenso)   How incredibly fucking stupid.

Why not just go with the Sunday : following Passover the way the Bible has it?  Why seek after unbiblical : methods? :   In fact, that is the reason Easter \\\"jumps all over the calendar\\\"- Passsover itself is a lunar holiday, not a solar one, and thus falls over a wide possible span of times.  The few times that Easter does not fall during or after Passover are because Easter is further linked to the Vernal Equinox- the beginning of spring.

[more deletions]  Overall, this argument is an illustration of the \\\"etymological fallacy\\\" (see J.P. Louw: _Semantics of NT Greek_).  That is the idea that the true meaning of a word lies in its origins and linguistic form.  In fact, our own experience demonstrates that the meaning of a word is bound up with how it is _used_, not where it came from.  Very few modern people would make any connection whatsoever between \\\"Easter\\\" and \\\"Ishtar.\\\"  If Daniel Seagard does, then for him it has that meaning.  But that is a highly idiosyncratic \\\"meaning,\\\" and not one that needs much refutation.\",\"    Define perfect then.       Take your foot out of your mouth, I wondered about that already when I was a Catholic Christian. The fact that the contradiction is unresolvable is one of the reasons why I am an atheist.   Believe me, I believed similar sentences for a long time. But that shows the power of religion and not anything about its claims.       It follows from a definition of evil as ordinarily used. Letting evil happen or allowing evil to take place, in this place even causing evil, is another evil.       The omniscient attribute of god will know what the creatures will do even before the omnipotent has created them. There is no choice left. All is known, the course of events is fixed.   Not even for the omniscient itself, to extend an argument by James Tims.       And when I am not omnipotent, how can I have free will? You have said something about choices and the scenario gives them. Therefore we have what you define as free will.   Imagine the following. I can do good to other beings, but I cannot harm them. Easily implemented by making everyone appreciate being the object of good deeds, but don't make them long for them, so they can not feel the absence of good as evil.   But whose case am I arguing? It is conceivable, so the omnipotent can do it. Or it would not be omnipotent. If you want logically consistent as well, you have to give up the pet idea of an omnipotent first.   (Deletion)   That the bible describes an omniscient and omnipotent god destroys the credibility of the bible, nothing less.\",\"THE EMPTY TOMB:  CAN WE TRUST IT?                     by the late Wilbur M. Smith, D.D.                               (1894-1977)            When Jesus was on Earth, He made an amazing prediction about      Himself, and frequently repeated it.  Let me quote it for you:                   Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son                of Man shall be betrayed unto the chief                priests and unto the scribes, and they shall                condemn Him to death, and shall deliver Him                to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and                to crucify Him; and the third day He shall                rise again\\\" (Matthew 20:18-19).            Wholly different from the normal experience of men, Jesus,      who had *never* done anything worthy of death, even deserving      reproval, knew He would die before He was 40 years of age.  He      knew the very city where He would die.  He knew that the religious      leaders of His own race would condemn Him to death.  He knew that      one of His own would betray Him.  He knew that before His actual      death took place He would be mocked and scourged.  He knew exactly      how He would die--*by crucifixion.*            All this is in itself remarkable.  But more amazing than the      minute particulars of His foreknowledge was what He predicted      would follow shortly after He was buried--*that He would rise      again.*  He even designated the time--on the third day.            But since it is on this central fact--the death and resurrec-      tion of Jesus Christ--that the whole truth or untruth of Chris-      tianity turns, let us examine it more closely.            The body of Jesus was embalmed in long sheets of cloth      between the layers of which a great abundance of spices and      ointments was distributed.  The body was placed in a tomb which      had never before been used, and a great stone was rolled against      the entrance.  The Jewish authorities, fully aware that Jesus had      predicted He would rise again, had the stone officially sealed and      on Saturday placed a guard before the tomb to prevent the      disciples from carrying away the body.  Early Sunday morning some      of the women who were faithful followers of Christ went out to the      tomb to further anoint the body.  To their utter astonishment,      they found the stone rolled away, the body gone.  They rushed back      to tell the disciples.  Shortly two of Jesus' friends, Peter and      John, utterly skeptical about the whole affair, came and found the      tomb empty, just as the women had said.  Even the guards came      hurrying into the city to tell the Sanhedrin that had hired them      to guard the tomb that the body was gone (Matthew 28:11).            How did this tomb become empty?            One of the most famous New Testament scholars in America--      professor of New Testament literature in a large theological      seminary--wrote to the author in answer to my question of *how*      the tomb became empty, and wrote it in a letter *not* marked by      bitterness or sarcasm, that he could no more explain how the tomb      became empty than he could explain how Santa Claus comes down the      chimney at Christmas time.            But he didn't realize that Santa Clause never did come down      any chimney at Christmas time, *because there never was a Santa      Claus!*  ...And there *is* a Jesus.  He died; He was buried in the      tomb of Joseph of Arimathea, and on Sunday the body was gone.            Those are facts of history.  No one can escape the responsi-      bility of coming to some conclusion about what really happened by      mentioning a myth we all abandoned before we were eight years old.            Another professor, Dr. Kirsopp Lake of Harvard University,      tried to explain the empty tomb by saying (what no other scholar      in the field of New Testament criticism has ventured to adopt)      that the women went to the wrong tomb.            The facts are these:            First, so far as we know, there was no other tomb nearby to      which by mistake they could have gone.            Second, it is contrary to all similar experience for three or      more people to forget the place where they have buried their      dearest loved one within less than three days.  Even if the women      did miss the tomb, when Peter and John came, did they too go to      the wrong tomb?            Third, were the soldiers *guarding* the wrong tomb?            There is, of course, a record of an attempt to escape the      evidence of the empty tomb in the New Testament itself.                    Now when they were going, behold, some                of the watch came into the city and showed                unto the chief priests all the things that                were done.  And when they were assembled                with the leaders and had taken counsel, they                gave large money unto the soldiers, Saying,                Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole                Him away while we slept.  And if this come to                the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and                secure you.  So they took the money, and did                as they were taught:  and this saying is com-                monly reported among the Jews until this day                (Matthew 28:11-15).            This is a good illustration of many later attempts to escape the      fact that the tomb was empty.            You will notice at once that the chief priests and the elders never      questioned but that the tomb *was* empty.  They never even went out to      see if what the guards had reported was true--they *knew* it was true.            Another fact about this story makes it ridiculous to maintain that      the tomb was empty--the soldiers were told to say that Jesus' disciples      came and stole the body away *while they* (the soldiers) *were asleep!*            How could they know what was going on while they were asleep?      Obviously, such testimony would be valueless in any court.            Even aside from the shallowness and sordidness that make us reject      the explanation, the very character and the later history of the      disciples compel us to believe they did not steal and secretly carry away      the body of Jesus.            First, as Professor Heffern points out, the leaders of Judaism in      Jerusalem, who had put the Lord Jesus to death, had nothing to offer to      contradict these disciples as they continued to preach Jesus and His      resurrection--because all Jerusalem knew the tomb was empty.  If there      had been trickery here, sooner or later it would have been suspected,      then proved.            Second, surely *one* of the disciples, even *most* of them, would      have confessed the fraud under the terrific persecution they underwent.      It may be possible to live a lie, but men seldom die for a lie--and most      of these men did.            The result ultimately would have been that the message that Christ      had risen would have suffered the fate of all such unfounded stories--it      would have lost it *power.*  Instead, this truth swept the world, closed      pagan temples, won millions of disciples, brought hope to a despairing      humanity, was the very foundation truth of the early church, and is today      as believable and as freshly glorious as ever.            But not only did Jesus come alive again, He did not disappear to      leave the disciples speculating through all the subsequent days as to      what had happened to Him.            Instead, He appeared to them--literally, visibly, frequently.            He appeared to the women at the tomb on Resurrection morning      (Matthew 28:1-10); later that day to Mary Magdalene alone (John 20:11-      18); and to Simon Peter, also alone (Luke 24:34).  In the afternoon He      walked with two of His followers toward Emmaus (Luke 24:13-35); and that      night He appeared to ten of the apostles gathered together in an upper      room at Jerusalem (Mark 16:14-16; Luke 24:36-40; etc.).            A week later He appeared to all eleven of the apostles, probably at      the same place (John 20:26-28).  Once He was seen by above 500 brethren      on a mountain in Galilee (I Corinthians 15:6); and finally to the      apostles just before His ascension (Mark 16:19; Luke 24:50-52; Acts 1:3-      8).            As with the fact of the empty tomb, so in regard to these histor-      ically recorded appearances, all kinds of theories have been proposed      attempting to deny their literalness.  But these theories are      unreasonable, without supporting evidence.  None has ever won the      unanimous approval of those who refuse to believe in the reality of the      appearances.            Moreover, while it is true we are living in an age when may of our      leading scientists and agnostics and many of our philosophers are      antisuperanaturalistic, let us not forget that some of the greatest      thinkers of the ages have firmly believed in this great miracle.      Increase Mather, president of Harvard; Timothy Dwight, president of Yale;      Nathan Lord, president of Dartmouth; Edward Hitchcock, president of      Amherst; Mark Hopkins, president of Williams; John Witherspoon, president      of Princeton--these men and countless others have believed it.            But suppose Christ *did* rise from the dead, what of it?  What has      it to do with *my* life?  What has it to do with *your* life?  Just this:      it seals with certitude the teachings of Christ.            Jesus taught many great truths--especially many about Himself.  He      claimed to have come down *from* God.            He said He was the way *to* God.            He said He was the Son of God, who alone knew God perfectly.            He said that whoever believed on Him had eternal life, and no one      else had it.            He said that whatever we ask God in His name, He would grant it to      us.            Thus when He did rise from the grave on the third day, He revealed      that in these amazing, unparalleled predictions, *He spoke the truth!*            Do you know any reason, *any good reason,* why we should not believe      that His words are all true?            The point is, does not the truth of the Resurrection convince us      that He is none other than the One He claimed to be--the Son of God?            And then, of course, the fact that Christ rose from the dead      testifies that He has broken the power of death, and that He will some      day raise us also up from the grave, as He promised.            In other words, if this Person, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, in all      this, He should be the cornerstone of the foundation of your life.  For      He said a life built on Him would know forgiveness of sins, His compan-      ionship and help, a joy that no circumstances can ever take away, and a      hope that shineth more and more unto a perfect day.\",\"  I think you need the EMM386.EXE noems This will let the expanded mem be active but not use any, therefore this will give you more extended mem for windows yet have all the bases covered.

Actually, I just finished writing a motif animation program... (take-lots-of-image-data-and-display-it-pretty-darn-fast). When using on-server pixmaps or shared memory, I had to insert a delay loop to keep it from going too quickly :). Testing both methods side by side, they were just about equal.    The advantage of SHM is that your X server doesn't grow to ridiculous sizes; but pixmaps can work over a network and *are* removed if your application dies (one tends to use ipcrm manually quite a bit when debugging SHM apps).    Shared memory also has the problem that some operating systems (e.g. Ultrix) seem to allow only a small number of segments (~6) to be attached to a process at once; consequently, a redraw becomes XShmAttach();XShmPutImage();XShmDetach(); on Dec systems. And Dec's 24 bit displays (like the ones I tend to use most often) don't seem to support the extension (maybe someone compiled them wrong?), and using pixmaps causes the X server to crash (failed mallocs), so one *has* to use the local unix domain socket (which really isn't that bad; one copies the info three times per redraw instead of one).    In short: allowing all three forms of display, within the program is a Good Thing (minus SHM if running over a network), and let the user pick whatever feels fastest.

WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SATURN V PLANS      Despite a widespread belief to the contrary, the Saturn V blueprints     have not been lost. They are kept at Marshall Space Flight Center on     microfilm.      The problem in re-creating the Saturn V is not finding the drawings, it     is finding vendors who can supply mid-1960's vintage hardware (like     guidance system components), and the fact that the launch pads and VAB     have been converted to Space Shuttle use, so you have no place to launch     from.      By the time you redesign to accommodate available hardware and re-modify     the launch pads, you may as well have started from scratch with a clean     sheet design.

However, NASA frequently     releases examples (in non-digital form, e.g. photos) to the public early     in a mission.       RISKS OF NUCLEAR (RTG) POWER SOURCES FOR SPACE PROBES      There has been extensive discussion on this topic sparked by attempts to     block the Galileo and Ulysses launches on grounds of the plutonium     thermal sources being dangerous. Numerous studies claim that even in     worst-case scenarios (shuttle explosion during launch, or accidental     reentry at interplanetary velocities), the risks are extremely small.     Two interesting data points are (1) The May 1968 loss of two SNAP 19B2     RTGs, which landed intact in the Pacific Ocean after a Nimbus B weather     satellite failed to reach orbit. The fuel was recovered after 5 months     with no release of plutonium. (2) In April 1970, the Apollo 13 lunar     module reentered the atmosphere and its SNAP 27 RTG heat source, which     was jettisoned, fell intact into the 20,000 feet deep Tonga Trench in     the Pacific Ocean. The corrosion resistant materials of the RTG are     expected to prevent release of the fuel for a period of time equal to 10     half-lives of the Pu-238 fuel or about 870 years [DOE 1980].

IMPACT OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE ON THE OZONE LAYER      From time to time, claims are made that chemicals released from     the Space Shuttle's Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) are responsible     for a significant amount of damage to the ozone layer. Studies     indicate that they in reality have only a minute impact, both in     absolute terms and relative to other chemical sources. The     remainder of this item is a response from the author of the quoted     study, Charles Jackman.      The atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effects on the     stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups, and was     organized by Dr. Michael Prather, NASA/Goddard Institute for Space     Studies.  The three groups involved Michael Prather and Maria Garcia     (NASA/GISS), Charlie Jackman and Anne Douglass (NASA/Goddard Space     Flight Center), and Malcolm Ko and Dak Sze (Atmospheric and     Environmental Research, Inc.).  The effort was to look at the effects     of the space shuttle and Titan rockets on the stratosphere.      The following are the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine:         Industrial sources:    300,000,000 kilograms/year    Natural sources:     75,000,000 kilograms/year    Shuttle sources:   725,000 kilograms/year      The shuttle source assumes 9 space shuttles and 6 Titan rockets are     launched yearly. Thus the launches would add less than 0.25% to the     total stratospheric chlorine sources.      The effect on ozone is minimal:  global yearly average total ozone would     be decreased by 0.0065%. This is much less than total ozone variability     associated with volcanic activity and solar flares.      The influence of human-made chlorine products on ozone is computed     by atmospheric model calculations to be a 1% decrease in globally     averaged ozone between 1980 and 1990. The influence of the space shuttle and     Titan rockets on the stratosphere is negligible.  The launch     schedule of the Space Shuttle and Titan rockets would need to be     increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about     the same effect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons     do at the present time.      Theoretical results of this study have been published in _The Space     Shuttle's Impact on the Stratosphere_, MJ Prather, MM Garcia, AR     Douglass, CH Jackman, M.K.W. Ko and N.D.

HOW LONG CAN A HUMAN LIVE UNPROTECTED IN SPACE      If you *don't* try to hold your breath, exposure to space for half a     minute or so is unlikely to produce permanent injury. Holding your     breath is likely to damage your lungs, something scuba divers have to     watch out for when ascending, and you'll have eardrum trouble if your     Eustachian tubes are badly plugged up, but theory predicts -- and animal     experiments confirm -- that otherwise, exposure to vacuum causes no     immediate injury. You do not explode. Your blood does not boil. You do     not freeze. You do not instantly lose consciousness.      Various minor problems (sunburn, possibly \\\"the bends\\\", certainly some     [mild, reversible, painless] swelling of skin and underlying tissue)     start after ten seconds or so. At some point you lose consciousness from     lack of oxygen. Injuries accumulate. After perhaps one or two minutes,     you're dying. The limits are not really known.

HOW THE CHALLENGER ASTRONAUTS DIED      The Challenger shuttle launch was not destroyed in an explosion. This is     a well-documented fact; see the Rogers Commission report, for example.     What looked like an explosion was fuel burning after the external tank     came apart. The forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the     astronauts, never mind destroy their bodies, according to the Kerwin     team's medical/forensic report.      The astronauts were killed when the more-or-less intact cabin hit the     water at circa 200MPH, and their bodies then spent several weeks     underwater. Their remains were recovered, and after the Kerwin team     examined them, they were sent off to be buried.       USING THE SHUTTLE BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT      You can't use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low Earth orbit     because it can't get there. It is big and heavy and does not carry     enough fuel, even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tanks.      Furthermore, it is not particularly sensible to do so, because much of     that weight is things like wings, which are totally useless except in     the immediate vicinity of the Earth. The shuttle orbiter is highly     specialized for travel between Earth's surface and low orbit. Taking it     higher is enormously costly and wasteful. A much better approach would     be to use shuttle subsystems to build a specialized high-orbit     spacecraft.      [Yet another concise answer by Henry Spencer.]       THE \\\"FACE ON MARS\\\"      There really is a big rock on Mars that looks remarkably like a humanoid     face. It appears in two different frames of Viking Orbiter imagery:     35A72 (much more facelike in appearance, and the one more often     published, with the Sun 10 degrees above western horizon) and 70A13     (with the Sun 27 degrees from the west).      Science writer Richard Hoagland has championed the idea that the Face is     artificial, intended to resemble a human, and erected by an     extraterrestrial civilization. Most other analysts concede that the     resemblance is most likely accidental. Other Viking images show a     smiley-faced crater and a lava flow resembling Kermit the Frog elsewhere     on Mars. There exists a Mars Anomalies Research Society (sorry, don't     know the address) to study the Face.      The Mars Observer mission will carry an extremely high-resolution     camera, and better images of the formation will hopefully settle this     question in a few years. In the meantime, speculation about the Face is     best carried on in the altnet group alt.alien.visitors, not sci.space or     sci.astro.      V. DiPeitro and G.

All of the analog electronics are working  fine, I have ordered a PIC ICE (not vice versa) since the PICs are so  cheap and low-power, but I am having a devil of a time finding any  LCD displays in the 6-8 digit range that are priced as low as I need.  I  am looking for somthing in the range of $1 in quantities of about  1000-10,000.  Mainstream distributors like Almac cannot help me without a part  number, or when they do look around for something in their line  they find a $15 8-digit LCD.  Even Digikey's cheapest offering is $5 in  quantity.  I know LCD displays like this must exist because I see whole  calculators for sale for $4.99, meaning the retailer probably buys it  for $3.50 and the wholesaler probably gets it for $2.50 or so.  This  $2.50 includes assembly labor, packaging, sales, transportation,  import duties, the case and keyboard, the PC Board, the processor  chip, the solar cell --- and the LCD.  The LCD can't cost much.  If anyone could put me in touch with some manufacturers and/or  distributors that handle such things I would be much obliged.  -Joe Betts betts@netcom.com \",\"   I think I have the same problem.

Koresh and his people were basically minding their own business. 2. Some weapons violations may have been committed and I wouldn't have    disapproved of prosecuting him for those violations.  However, I think    the BATF was criminal for starting negotiations with a military style    assault and for firing into a house where there were children and other    noncombatants. 3. I don't see they couldn't just leave a token guard on the place and wait    the BDs out; I don't approve of the tear gas approach and, if it caused    the fire to be started, I think the FBI agent responsible should spend    10-20 years in jail. 4. However, if Koresh's response to the tear gas was to kill everyone there,    I hold him largely responsible for their deaths.\",\"   Agreed.  --          \\\"Satan and the Angels do not have freewill.

IN fact the Volvo 850 was one of the cars they laid out an example for.   \",\" Yes, but as has been mentioned many times before, the Islanders play at the talent level of their opponent.  Since Hartford is pitiful, the Islanders played pitiful.  Since Pittsburgh is great, the Isles will most likely play great.  This is most likely due to inexperience and very poor shooting.  To Greg: yes, I have noticed that the Islanders couldn't hit the broad side of a barn with the puck if they were two feet in front of it.  Does anyone have shooting percentages?

Jesse  Agreed.\",\" <stuff deleted>   Good gravy! Decibels are all *ratios.* The question that remains in any ratio is the reference unit used. Sometimes, this will be a reference power, such as 1 milliwatt (given a certain circuit impedance which should also be included in the fine print or known, like 50 ohms in an RF circuit of that impedance), leading to an accepted notation of dBm. Maybe it might be dBV, disregarding the impedance of the circuit and power developed, using 1 volt as reference *amplitude* (rather than reference power). Or, it might have an arbitrary or omitted reference that is not included in the notation, leading to just plain dB. So. look at it this way--'dB' has an implied reference while notation such as 'dBm' has an explicit reference.  For power:    dB = 10*log( P(measured)/P(reference) )  For amplitude    dB = 20*log( A(measured)/A(reference) )  'B' is for bel, which is a standard term for a log ratio to the base 10, named after Alexander Graham Bell. A 'deci' Bel is 1/10 of a bel. It has nothing to do with the Bell Telephone company except for the common founder's name. The small 'd'/large 'B' is per SI notation convention. I don't know anyone that's been crucified for messing it up.  Common references for audio are:   0 dBm = 1 milliwatt across 600 ohms  0 dBV = 1 volt   0 VU (a zero on the VU meter) = +4 dBm  (pro gear line level)  0 VU = -10dBV (consumer gear line level)   Often times, a power amp VU meter will be aligned using the rated power of the amp as the 0 dB point. It is all done to whatever reference is reasonable for the application or moment.  Note that in a circuit with a given (and maybe unknown) linear impedance, if the amplitude goes up so many decibels, the power will also increase the same amount. This proof can be done with the above two identities and ohm's law.  --  --------------------------------------------------------------------        Dave Medin   Phone: (205) 730-3169 (w)     SSD--Networking    (205) 837-1174 (h)     Intergraph Corp.

I am in the process of purchasing an EISA/VL Bus 486 DX2-66 computer and I found two places that sell machines that have what I want and have the same price. The first is Ares and they use a Cache motherboard (that's the brand of the motherboard) with OPTI chip set, the other is Micron (formerly Edge Technology) and they use the Micronics EISA/VLB motherboard.  I said that this might be a silly question since I believe that Micronics is a very well known motherboard manufacturer while I never heard of Cache! I am however leaning towards the Ares machine because my impression is that they are known for building good, solid machines and they have good tech support (24 hr, 7 days/wk), and a better warrantee (2 years).  Micron, on the other hand, seems to have recently aquired Edge Technologies and I'm not sure how much I should trust the company.  I would REALLY appreciate any input on this. Is the Micron machine the clear choice?  Does anyone know anything positive or negative about either company? Has anyone ever heard of Cache motherboards? Should I go with Micron just because it has the Micronics motherboard? etc.  Thanks very much in advance for any information. \",\"  Is this a figment of your imagination? Here is another one:    Source: \\\"Mitteilungsblatt, Berlin, December 1939, Nr. 2 and 5-6\\\"   Yet another historical fact: a fact that for years has been deliberately   forgotten, concealed, and wiped from memory - the fact of Armenian-Nazi   collaboration.   A magazine called Mitteilungsblatt der Deutsch-Armenischen Gesselschaft  is the clearest and most definite proof of this collaboration. The   magazine was first published in Berlin in 1938 during Nazi rule of Germany  and continued publication until the end of 1944. Even the name of the  magazine, which implies a declaration of Armenian-Nazi cooperation,  is attention-getting.   This magazine, every issue of which proves the collaboration, is historically  important as documentary evidence. It is a heap of writing that should be  an admonition to world opinion and to all mankind.    In Nazi Germany, Armenians were considered to be an Aryan race and certain  political, economic, and social rights were thus granted to them. They   occupied positions in public service and were partners in Nazi practices.  The whole world of course knows what awaited those who were not considered   \\\"Aryan\\\" and what befell them.

I'd estimate that 5% of the people at my high school couldn't do it.  (I was one of the few who failed shop.)  People who have actually seen me do mechanical work would probably say that 1% is more like it.  Starting with even 90% of the population, you can be sure that \\\"enough\\\" people will be motivated.   How much is \\\"through the nose\\\"?  After all, we know quite a bit about how much a gun is worth to a criminal, so if that is dwarfed by the price demanded by the \\\"bad\\\" part of that 90%....  The relevant economic analysis has been made.  The \\\"profit\\\" of gun crime is high enough that the price required to push criminals out of the market is high enough that everyone will be motivated. That analysis ignored some \\\"improvements\\\" in the criminal gun market that could make them even cheaper.  (They're not efficiently used now, but a \\\"loaner\\\" set up would drive the value still higher without affecting criminal use.)  -andy\",\" However, don't forget that the police in Chicago can carry just about anything they want except for the Glock, which is not approved for carry (Guess they figure all cops are like the Police Chief of Winnetka, who happened to let off a stray round of 9mm.

Perhaps in the judgement of the majority of Chicago's finest, a close-to- 100% reliable weapon like a revolver is preferable to a 99.99% reliable automatic. I note that in Germany, where certainly the 9mm semi-auto handgun is king, some of the more elite police types want revolvers.  I don't think the issue is cost, because Chicago police certainly make on the order of at least $40K/year.   Your presumption of \\\"disadvantage\\\" I think is not borne out by the experiences of New York City's cops; there the cops usually come out on top with their standard .38 Spl revolvers.

And key size is one of the things that can be verified externally.  Feed lots of random key/input pairs into the chip, then try flipping random key bits, and see what happens to the output.  We already know what *should* happen -- about half the output bits should vary, on average, from a 1-bit key change or input change.  If they were out to build a weak cryptosystem, it might be the case that some of the bits are much less powerful than others, in the sense that they only enter into the encryption very late in the game.  By contrast, DES was designed to use each key bit as early as possible; the 50% output change rate appears as early as round 5.  Again, though, I don't think NSA is going to cheat that crudely; they're likely to get caught.  Remember that they've promised to let a committee of outside experts see the cryptosystem design.  If you assume something DES-like, a biased subkey generation schedule will stick out like a sore thumb.  The committee can and should run lots of tests, and retain the output.  This can be verified later against the chip.  And yes, the civilian community has at least some secure storage facilities that I don't think even NSA can get into without it being noticed, until Fort Meade gets its transporter working again. (Oops -- I don't think I was supposed to talk about that...)  The committee members can even retain secure copies of the code -- in two halves, which you have to XOR together to recover the program...  Seriously, there are, I think, problems with this whole scheme.  But the people who invented it aren't stupid, and they've been in the crypto game and the smoke-and-mirrors game far longer than most of us.  They're not going to lie in ways that can be detected easily, since their credibility is the *only* thing they can use to sell this system.  If they've lied about the civilian committee, no one will believe them about the absence of other back doors.  If they've lied about the key size, no one will believe that they haven't copied the programming disk with the U keys. If they've lied about obvious aspects of the strength of the cryptosystem, no one will believe the escrow agencies aren't in cahoots with them.  That isn't to say that they aren't lying about all those other things anyway.  And I'm certainly not claiming that NSA can't build a cryptosystem with a back door that the committee can't find -- look how long it took for folks to believe that the S-boxes weren't sabotaged.  It's entirely possible that the committee will release an ambiguous report, for just such reasons.  But that's a subtle point (i.e., one you can't explain to a Senator...).   I don't like the unit key generation process any better than you do. However -- S1 and S2 are supposed to be under control of the same escrow agents.  If they can't be trusted to keep the seed values secure, they can't be trusted to keep the half-keys secure.  I still don't know if or when S1 and S2 change.  I thought I had seen something about them being constant, but I just reread Denning's technical information post, and it doesn't say anything, one way or the other. \",\"In Texas (Well, Corpus Christi anyway) if you pick up the phone and dial 890 the phone company will read back the number to you.

Randy Weaver/Kevin Harris trial update: Day 4.  Friday, April 16, 1993 was the fourth day of the trial.  Synopsis: Defense attorney Gerry Spence cross-examined agent Cooper under repeated objections from prosecutor Ronald Howen.  Spence moved for a mistrial but was denied.  The day was marked by a caustic cross-examination of Deputy Marshal Larry Cooper by defense attorney Gerry Spence.  Although Spence has not explicitly stated so, one angle of his stategy must involve destroying the credibility of agent Cooper.  Cooper is the government's only eyewitness to the death of agent Degan. Spence attacked Cooper's credibility by pointing out discrepancies between Cooper's statements last September and those made in court. Cooper conceded that, \\\"You have all these things compressed into a few seconds...It's difficult to remember what went on first.\\\"  Cooper acknowledged that he carried a \\\"9mm Colt Commando submachine gun with a silenced barrel.\\\" [I thought a Colt Commando was a revolver!] Cooper continued by stating that the federal agents had no specific plans to use the weapon when they started to kill Weaver's dog.  When Spence asked how seven cartridges could be fired by Degan's M-16 rifle when Degan was apparently dead, Cooper could not say for sure that Degan did not return fire before going down.  Spence continued by asking with how many agents (and to what extent) had Cooper discussed last August's events, Cooper responded, \\\"If you're implying that we got our story together, you're wrong, counselor.\\\"  Spence continued to advance the defense's version of the events: Namely, that a marshal had started the shooting by killing the Weaver's dog.  Cooper disagreed.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Ronald Howen repeatedly objected to Spence's virulent cross-examination of agent Cooper, arguing that the questions were repetitive and Spence was wasting time.  Howen also complained  that Spence was improperly using a cross-examination to advance the defense's version of the events.  U.S. District Judge Edward Lodge sustained many of the objections; however, both lawyers persisted until Judge Lodge had the jury leave the room and proceded to admonish both attorneys.  \\\"I'm not going to play games with either counsel.  This has been a personality problem from day 1, so start acting like professionals.\\\"  Spence told the judge that, \\\"When all the evidence is in, we'll see that ... his [agent Larry Cooper] testimony is not credible, that he was panicked and cannot remember the sequence of events.\\\"  Spence continued, \\\"We're going to find...that there is a very unlikely similarity - almost as if it had come out of a cookie cutter - between the testimony of Mr. Cooper and the other witnesses.\\\"  Spence then moved for a mistrial on the grounds that Howen's repeated objections would prevent a fair trial, \\\"We can't have a fair trial if the jury believes I'm some sort of charlatan, if the jury believes I'm bending the rules or engaging in some delaying tactic or that I'm violating court orders.\\\"  Judge Lodge called the notion that his repeated sustainings of Howen's objections had somehow prejudiced the jury was \\\"preposterous\\\" and denied the motion for a mistrial.  Lodge did tell Howen to restrict his comments when objecting.  The trial resumed with the prosecution calling FBI Special Agent Greg Rampton.  The prosecution's purpose was simply to introduce five weapons found in the cabin as evidence: However, the defense seized on the opportunity to further address Cooper's credibility.  Defense attorney Ellison Matthews (Harris' other attorney) questioned Rampton about the dog.  Rampton stated that there were no specific plans to kill the Weaver's dog without being detected.  Matthews then had Rampton read  a Septtember 15, 1992 transcript in which Rampton had said that Cooper had said that the purpose of the silenced weapon was to kill the dog without being detected, if the dog chased them. Rampton then acknowledged that he believed that Cooper had said that, but he could not remember when.  He then stated that, \\\"I did not conduct the primary interview with Deputy Cooper, but I have had conversations with him since the interview was conducted.\\\"\",\"I have a 42 yr old male friend, misdiagnosed as having  osteopporosis for two years, who recently found out that his  illness is the rare Gaucher's disease.   Gaucher's disease symptoms include: brittle bones (he lost 9   inches off his hieght); enlarged liver and spleen; internal  bleeding; and fatigue (all the time). The problem (in Type 1) is  attributed to a genetic mutation where there is a lack of the  enzyme glucocerebroside in macrophages so the cells swell up.  This will eventually cause death.  Enyzme replacement therapy has been successfully developed and  approved by the FDA in the last few years so that those patients  administered with this drug (called Ceredase) report a remarkable  improvement in their condition.

I recommend that such children shall not be received   into the orphanages, and no attempts are to be made to establish   special orphanages for them.      Minister of the Interior,        Talaat.\\\" [4]   \\\"To the Government of Aleppo.     Collect and keep only those orphans who cannot remember the tortures   to which their parents have been subjected. Send the rest away with   the caravans.      Minister of the Interior,        Talaat\\\" [5]   \\\"From the Ministry of the Interior to the Government of Aleppo.    At a time when there are thousands of Moslem refugees and the widows   of Shekid [fallen soldiers] are in need of food and protection, it is   not expedient to incur extra expenses by feeding the children left by   Armenians, who will serve no purpose except that of giving trouble   in the future. It is necessary that these children should be turned   out of your vilayet and sent with the caravans to the place of   deportation. Those that have been kept till now are also to be sent   away, in compliance with our previous orders, to Sivas.      Minister of the Interior,        Talaat\\\" [6]  In 1926, Halide Edip (a pioneer Turkish nationalist) wrote in her memoirs about a conversation with Talaat Pasha, verifying and \\\"rationalizing\\\" this ultra-national fascist anti-Armenian mentality, the following:   \\\"I have the conviction that as long as a nation does the best for   its own interest, and succeeds, the world admires it and thinks   it moral. I am ready to die for what I have done, and I know I   shall die for it.\\\" [7]   These telegrams were entered as unquestioned evidence during the 1923 trial of Talaat Pasha's, assassin, Soghomon Tehlerian. The Turkish government never questioned these \\\"death march orders\\\" until 1986, during a time when the world was again reminded of the genocide of the Armenians.  For reasons known to those who study the psychology of genocide denial, the Turkish government and their supporters in crime deny that such orders were ever issued, and further claim that these telegrams were forgeries based on a study by S. Orel and S. Yuca of the Turkish Historical Society.  If one were to examine the sample \\\"authentic text\\\" provided in the Turkish  Historical Society study and use their same forgery test on that sample, it  too would be a forgery!. In fact, if any of the tests delineated by the  Turkish Historical Society are performed an any piece of Ottoman Turkish or  Persian/Arabic script, one finds that anything handwritten in such language is a forgery.   Today, the body of Talaat Pasha lies in a tomb on Liberty Hill, Istanbul, Turkey, just next to the Yildiz University campus. The body of this genocide  architect was returned to Turkey from Germany during WW2 when Turkey was in a  heightened state of proto-fascism. Recently, this monument has served as a focal point for anti-Armenianism in Turkey.  This monument represents the epitome of the Turkish government's pathological denial of a clear historical event and is an insult to a people whose only crime was to be born Armenian.     - - - references - - -  [1] _The Memoirs of Naim Bey_, Aram Andonian, 1919, pages 59-60  [2] ibid, page 60  [3] ibid, page 60  [4] ibid, page 61  [5] ibid, page 61  [6] ibid, page 62  [7] _Memoirs of Halide Edip_, Halide Edip, The Century Press, New York (and     London), 1926, page 387  \",\"Reposting and summarizing, for your information or additional comment.  *** THIS IS LONG ***  I have 16MB of memory on my 386SX (25 MHz), an Intel math coprocessor, and a 120MB hard drive with 20MB free (no compression).

It is a bit lengthy for a posting, but I thought I'd share it with all of you anyway. Feel free to pass it along to anyone whom you feel might benefit from what it says. May God richly bless those who read it.   =======================================================================                      D O E S  G O D  L O V E  Y O U ?     Q. What  kind  of  question  is that?   Anyone who can read sees signs,    tracts, books, and bumper stickers that say, \\\"God Loves You.\\\"  Isn't    that true?   A. It  is  true that God offers His love to the whole world, as we read    in one of the most quoted verses in the Bible:         For  God  so  loved  the world, that he gave his only begotten       Son, that whosoever believeth in him should  not  perish,  but       have everlasting life.                               John 3:16           The way of the wicked is an abomination unto the LORD:  but he       loveth him that followeth after righteousness.   Proverbs 15:9         For  the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of       the ungodly shall perish.                            Psalm 1:6     Q. But  I am not wicked.  I am a decent, moral person.  Surely the good    I have done in my life far outweighs whatever bad I have done.   How    can these verses apply to me?   A. By  God's  standard  of  righteousness even the most moral person is    looked upon by God as a desperate sinner on his way to  Hell.    The    Bible teaches that no one is good enough in himself to go to Heaven.    On  the  contrary,  we  are all sinners and we are all guilty before    God.         As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:  There       is  none  that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after       God.                                            Romans 3:10-11         The  heart  is  deceitful  above  all  things, and desperately       wicked: who can know it?                         Jeremiah 17:9     Q. If I am such a wicked person in God's sight, what will God do to me?   A. The  Bible  teaches that at the end of the world all the wicked will    come under eternal punishment in a place called Hell.         For  a  fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the       lowest hell, and shall consume the earth  with  her  increase,       and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.  I will heap       mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them.  They       shall  be  burnt  with hunger, and devoured with burning heat,       and  with  bitter  destruction:  I will also send the teeth of       beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.                                                 Deuteronomy 32:22-24     Q. Oh,  come  on now!   Hell is not real, is it?  Surely things are not    that bad.   A. Indeed,  Hell is very real, and things are that bad for the individ-    ual who does not know the Lord Jesus Christ as Savior.    The  Bible    makes  many  references  to Hell, indicating that it is both eternal    and consists of perpetual suffering.         And  whosoever  was  not found written in the book of life was       cast into the lake of fire.                   Revelation 20:15         So  shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come       forth, and sever the wicked from among  the  just,  And  shall       cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and       gnashing of teeth.                            Matthew 13:49-50         ...    when  the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with       his mighty angels, In flaming fire taking  vengeance  on  them       that  know  not  God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord       Jesus   Christ:    Who  shall  be  punished  with  everlasting       destruction  from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory       of his power;                            2 Thessalonians 1:7-9     Q. That is terrible!  Why would God create a Hell?   A. Hell  is  terrible,  and  it  exists  because  God created man to be    accountable to God for his actions.  God's perfect  justice  demands    payment for sin.         For the wages of sin is death;                     Romans 6:23         For  we  must  all  appear before the judgment seat of Christ;       that every one may  receive  the  things  done  in  his  body,       according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.                                                   2 Corinthians 5:10         But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak,       they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.                                                        Matthew 12:36     Q. Does that mean that at the end of the world everyone will be brought    to life again to be judged and then to be sent to Hell?   A. Indeed  it  does;  that  is,  unless  we  can find someone to be our    substitute in bearing the punishment of eternal  damnation  for  our    sins.    That  someone  is  God  Himself, who came to earth as Jesus    Christ to bear the wrath of God for all who believe in Him.         All  we  like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one       to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity  of       us all.                                            Isaiah 53:6         But  he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for       our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace  was  upon  him;       and with his stripes we are healed.                Isaiah 53:5         For  I  delivered  unto  you  first  of  all that which I also       received, how that Christ died for our sins according  to  the       scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the       third day according to the scriptures:    1 Corinthians 15:3-4         For  he  hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that       we might be made the righteousness of God in him.                                                   2 Corinthians 5:21     Q. Are  you  saying that if I trust in Christ as my substitute, Who was    already punished for my sins, then I will not have  to  worry  about    Hell anymore?   A. Yes, this is so!  If I have believed in Christ as my Savior, then it    is  as  if  I  have already stood before the Judgment Throne of God.    Christ as my substitute has already paid for my sins.         He  that  believeth  on  the Son hath everlasting life: and he       that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but  the  wrath       of God abideth on him.                               John 3:36     Q. But  what  does it mean to believe on Him?  If I agree with all that    the Bible says about Christ as Savior, then am I saved from going to    Hell?   A. Believing  on  Christ  means  a  whole lot more than agreeing in our    minds with the truths of the Bible.  It means that we hang our whole    lives  on Him.   It means that we entrust every part of our lives to    the  truths  of the Bible.  It means that we turn away from our sins    and serve Christ as our Lord.         No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one,       and  love  the  other;  or  else  he will hold to the one, and       despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.                                                         Matthew 6:24         Repent  ye  therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be       blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from  the       presence of the Lord;                                Acts 3:19     Q. Are  you  saying  that  there  is no other way to escape Hell except    through Jesus?   What about all the other  religions?    Will  their    followers also go to Hell?   A. Yes, indeed.  They cannot escape the fact that God holds us account-    able  for  our  sins.   God demands that we pay for our sins.  Other    religions  cannot  provide  a  substitute  to bear the sins of their    followers.  Christ is the only one who is able to bear our guilt and    save us.         Neither  is  there  salvation  in any other: for there is none       other name under heaven given among men, whereby  we  must  be       saved.                                               Acts 4:12           I  am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the       Father, but by me.                                   John 14:6         If  we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us       our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.                                                           1 John 1:9     Q. Now I am desperate.  I do not want to go to Hell.  What can I do?   A. You  must  remember  that God is the only one who can help you.  You    must throw yourself altogether on the mercies of God.   As  you  see    your hopeless condition as a sinner, cry out to God to save you.         And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much       as  his  eyes  unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying,       God be merciful to me a sinner.                     Luke 18:13         ...  Sirs, what must I do to be saved?  And they said, Believe       on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, ...                                                        Acts 16:30-31     Q. But how can I believe on Christ if I know so little about Him?   A. Wonderfully,  God  not  only saves us through the Lord Jesus, but He    also gives us the faith to believe on Him.  You can pray to God that    He will give you faith in Jesus Christ as your Savior.         For  by  grace  are  ye  saved  through faith; and that not of       yourselves: it is the gift of God:               Ephesians 2:8      God works particularly through the Bible to give us that faith.  So,    if  you  really  mean  business  with  God about your salvation, you    should  use  every opportunity to hear and study the Bible, which is    the only Word of God.    In  this  brochure,  all  verses  from the Bible are within indented    paragraphs.  Give heed to them with all your heart.         So  then  faith  cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of       God.                                              Romans 10:17     Q. But does this mean that I have to surrender everything to God?   A. Yes.    God wants us to come to Him in total humility, acknowledging    our sinfulness and our helplessness, trusting totally in Him.         The  sacrifices  of  God  are  a broken spirit: a broken and a       contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.      Psalm 51:17      Because  we  are sinners we love our sins.  Therefore, we must begin    to pray to God for an intense  hatred  of  our  sins.    And  if  we    sincerely desire salvation, we will also begin to turn from our sins    as  God  strengthens  us.    We know that our sins are sending us to    Hell.         Unto  you  first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him       to bless you, in turning  away  every  one  of  you  from  his       iniquities.                                          Acts 3:26     Q. Doesn't  the  Bible teach that I must attend church regularly and be    baptized?  Will these save me?   A. If  possible,  we should do these things, but they will not save us.    No work of any kind can secure our salvation.   Salvation  is  God's    sovereign gift of grace given according to His mercy and good pleas-    ure.  Salvation is         Not of works, lest any man should boast.         Ephesians 2:9     Q. What else will happen at the end of the world?   A. Those  who have trusted in Jesus as their Savior will be transformed    into their glorious eternal bodies and will be with Christ  forever-    more.         For  the  Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout,       with the voice of the archangel, and with the  trump  of  God:       and  the  dead  in Christ shall rise first:  Then we which are       alive  and remain shall be caught up together with them in the       clouds,  to meet the Lord in the air:  and so shall we ever be       with the Lord.                         1 Thessalonians 4:16-17     Q. What will happen to the earth at that time?   A. God  will destroy the entire universe by fire and create new heavens    and a new earth where Christ will reign with His believers  forever-    more.         But  the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in       the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise,  and       the  elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and       the   works  that  are  therein  shall  be  burned  up.    ...       Nevertheless  we,  according  to  his  promise,  look  for new       heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.                                                      2 Peter 3:10,13     Q. Does  the  Bible  give us any idea of when the end of the earth will    come?   A. Yes!    The end will come when Christ has saved all whom He plans to    save.         And  this  gospel  of the kingdom shall be preached in all the       world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall  the  end       come.                                            Matthew 24:14     Q. Can we know how close to the end of the world we might be?   A. Yes!   God gives much information in the Bible concerning the timing    of the history of the world and tells us that while the Day  of  the    Lord  will come as a thief in the night for the unsaved, it will not    come  as  a  thief for the believers.  There is much evidence in the    Bible  that  the  end  of  the world and the return of Christ may be    very, very close.* All the time clues in the Bible point to this.         For  when  they  shall  say,  Peace  and  safety;  then sudden       destruction cometh upon them, as travail  upon  a  woman  with       child; and they shall not escape.          1 Thessalonians 5:3         Surely  the  Lord  GOD  will  do nothing, but he revealeth his       secret unto his servants the prophets.                Amos 3:7     Q. But that means Judgment Day is almost here.   A. Yes,  it  does.    God  warned  ancient Nineveh that He was going to    destroy that great city and He gave them forty days warning.         And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he       cried,  and  said,  Yet  forty  days,  and  Nineveh  shall  be       overthrown.                                          Jonah 3:4     Q. What did the people of Nineveh do?   A. From  the  king on down they humbled themselves before God, repented    of their sins, and cried to God for mercy.         But  let  man  and  beast  be  covered with sackcloth, and cry       mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his  evil       way,  and  from  the violence that is in their hands.  Who can       tell  if  God  will  turn  and  repent, and turn away from his       fierce anger, that we perish not?                  Jonah 3:8-9     Q. Did God hear their prayers?   A. Yes.  God saved a great many people of Nineveh.     Q. Can  I still cry to God for mercy so that I will not come into judg-    ment?   A. Yes.   There is still time to become saved even though that time has    become very short.         How  shall  we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which       at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed       unto us by them that heard him;                    Hebrews 2:3         In  God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength,       and my refuge, is in God.   Trust in  him  at  all  times;  ye       people,  pour  out  your heart before him: God is a refuge for       us.                                               Psalm 62:7-8                     A R E  Y O U  R E A D Y  T O  M E E T  G O D ?       A  book  entitled  1994?,  written by Harold Camping, presents Biblical information that we may be very near the end of time.  For  information on  how to obtain a copy or to receive a free program guide and list of radio  stations on which you can hear our Gospel programs, please write to Family Radio, Oakland, California, 94621 (The United States of Amer- ica), or call 1-800-543-1495.                  ----------------------------------------     The  foregoing  is a copy of the \\\"Does God Love You?\\\" tract printed by, and available free of charge from, Family Radio.   A  number  of  minor changes  have  been  made to its layout to facilitate computer printing and  distribution.  The only change to the text itself is the paragraph which  describes  the  way in which Biblical passages appear within the text.    In  the  original  tract they appear in italic lettering; they appear here as indented paragraphs.     I have read Mr. Camping's book, compared it with what the Bible actual- ly  says, find it to be the most credible research with respect to what the  future holds that I have ever come across, and agree with him that there  is just too much data to ignore.  While none of us is guaranteed one  more  second  of  life, and while we, therefore, should take these matters  very seriously regardless of when Christ will actually return, it  would appear that our natural tendency to postpone caring about our eternal  destiny  until we feel that our death is imminent is even more senseless  now  because,  in  all  likelihood, the law of averages with respect  to life expectancy no longer applies.  If you wish to obtain a copy  of  this book so that you can check out these facts for yourself, you may find the following information helpful:         title:       1994?       author:      Harold Camping       publisher:   Vantage Press       distributor: Baker and Taylor       ISBN:        0-533-10368-1     I  have  chosen  to share this tract with you because I whole-heartedly agree with everything it declares and feel that now, perhaps more  than ever  before,  this information must be made known.  To paraphrase Acts 20:27,  it  does not shun to declare unto us all the counsel of God.  I am  always  willing  to  discuss  the  eternal truths of the Bible with anyone who is interested as I believe them to be the only issues of any real  importance since we will spend, comparatively speaking, so little time  on this side of the grave and so much on the other.

Or, to convert me to ANYTHING.   There are many types of violence, physical murder is only one.  'Trying' to convert is an insult. It's like trying to tell me that me and/or my God/my lack of God are just crap, that I need a new, 'converted' one.  This does not apply for muslims only, of course. Same for jews and for some friendly, nicely dressed neighbours who show on sunday with empty speaches and cheap booklets about some church ....  And when the objective is (I think, however that you are wrong) to convert  everybody, it's just a matter of time when violence will occur.   Aren't we able to learn anything from thouthands of years of 'conversion related violence' ?   Why not let 'the other, more inferiour' people live as they wish and take care  your business?. You do assume that they are inferiour (or their beliefs are) as long as you want to change their thinking.  \",\"Heya all, I've got a pair of Oakley forsale  There are frogskins, with aurborn red.

If this is not obvious, the point is that there should be current flow in the white, i.e. neutral/return wires when things in the house are operating.  There should not be any flow in the ground wires unless there is a fault condition.  Notice also that in the breaker box there is a wire leading from the above-mentioned junction to earth ground, usually a pipe or spike driven into the ground.\",\" Illegal to receive land-mobile telephone service?  Don't you have to have a mobile reciever to even have land-mobile telephone service?  What about ship-to-shore telephone service? \",\" I couldn't have said it better, Mark!\",\" That depends entirely upon the advertiser whose number you circled. Radio Electronics compiles all of the cards, then each advertiser gets a computer printout of the names and addresses of all of the readers who circled their number. Some magazines also provide the data on self-adhesive labels, and the really big magazines provide the data on computer disk.  The advertiser decides what to do with the data they get. You will notice that the Radio Electronics information card (commonly called a \\\"bingo card\\\" in the industry) includes lines for a company name and a business phone number. My guess would be that the big, national advertisers make a distinction between hobbiests and professionals as best they can. For example, if you include Motorola as your company and include a business phone (and a mail stop), Tektronics will probably send you a copy of their hard-bound catalog and have a sales engineer call you about a week later. If you leave it blank, odds are they will send you a slick brochure and direct you to a local retail outlet. Medium and small companies are more likely to send you th e whole catalog. And then some companies, like Digikey or Jameco, have nothing to mail out accept the catalog.  A couple of other interesting points about bingo cards: Free, industry magazines like EDN and such also log your card to their computer. They use the information at least three ways. They note that you really do read the magazine and are more likely to continue your subscription or push you, through repeated mailings, to re-subscribe. They also compile how many people requested which data for their marketing demographics. This way thay can tell a prospective advertiser that \\\"23% of readers requesting data were interested in capacitors.\\\" And finally, some magazines rent lists of readers who request certain information. For example, Tektronics can rent a list of everyone who requested information about test equipment OTHER THAN TEKTRONIC's, in the past 6 months.  The other point, in the data the advertiser receives, many magazines include how many items you circled on the card. If they want, the advertiser can attempt to cull out the \\\"literature collectors\\\" from the serious potential customers.  \\\"Can you say qualified sales leads? I thought you could.\\\"  What's the BEST way for a hobbiest to deal with bingo cards?    Never circle more than 8 number on the card. If you want more   than 8 items, use the second card and mail it a couple of   weeks later.    If you are really, really serious and you really, really want   the information, CALL THE ADVERTISER AND ASK! This will also   cut about 15 days off the the response time. Virtually   everyone takes a voice on the phone more seriously than data   on a computer printout.    To help insure you keep getting a trade magazine that you're   not really \\\"qualified\\\" for, send in a bingo card at least every   other month and circle two or three numbers.    Include a business name and phone number, even if it's your house.   Advertisers almost never call. \",\":  {much deleted] :  :  : The fact that this happened while eating two sugar coated cereals made : by Kellog's makes me think she might be having an allergic reaction to : something in the coating or the cereals.

I have seen it described, and the algiorithm seems a  little bit long.  I developed my own method, which requires that the points be in a counter-clockwise order, and returns whether you are looking at the back or the front, similar to the plane eqn method.  It uses few calculations however, basically it is several comparisons.  The only disadvantage I see is that it must be done after the transformation from view coordinates to coordinates to display on the screen, which means that a little more calculation isneeded beforehand.  My method basically figures out whether the points that will appear on the screen are clockwise or counterclockwise.  When looking at the back of something, the points occur in an opposite direction from the front, so merely by figuring out which way the points go, you can tell whether you are looking at the back or front of a 2d polygon.  Has anyone heard of this method before?  It is so simple, I doubt i am the first to think of it.

Regarding the verses relevant to nature, I prefer to use Dr. Maurice Bucaille's translations (in his book, \\\"The Bible, the Qur'an and Science\\\") for in general his translations are more literal.   Maurice Bucaille translates the portion of the verse you are addressing as   \\\"...Each one is travelling with an orbit in its own motion.\\\"  (Also note that \\\"the celestial bodies\\\" in the first translation quoted by you above is the translator's interpolation -- it is not existent in the original Arabic, which is why it is included in brackets.)    You're right, what the verses _do_ contain isn't all that remarkable.  However, Dr. Bucaille (a surgeon, that's how he's a \\\"Dr.\\\") thinks it is significant that the above verse contains no geocentric ideas, even though geocentrism was all the rage up until the 17th century (?) or so. (And this goes for the rest of the Qur'an as well, which has about 750 verses or so regarding nature, I think I remember reading once.)\",\" You can probably get this information by calling your public health department in your county (in Pittsburgh, they give the shots free, as well).

If the answer is positive, you would know if ms-windows is a \\\"mature\\\" OS.    Days ago people doubted that ms-windows is not a real OS. I can see why they have such question. Ms-windows confuses many people. Microsoft simulated Mac, but it did a lousy job.  For example:  (1) You can not create hierarchy groups. There is no way to create a group     in a group. (If you know how, please tell me.) (2) Too many system parameters to take care of.  (3) uncomplete documentation. It's not easy to find the reason why causes     an unpredictable error. (4) Group deleting/file deleting     After deleting a group, users have to use file manager to delete files.     But if users forget to delete some related files, the disk will be full     of nonsense files. (5) share problem     Once you create two windows doing compilation and editing in some     language (w/o good editor), there will be a sharing problem. You just     can not open or save the program if it is loaded. It makes sense to     prevent from saving, but not opening.  Microsoft try to compromise between DOS and windows, but they just make  ms-windows a graphical DOS with capacity doing mutiple DOS jobs;  the worst thing is they complicate the environment. The orginal purpose of ms-windows should be to simplify the environment, and make PC easier  to use.      It's by no means easy to satisfy everybody, but if Microsoft want to keep their reputations, they should evaluate the user interface more carefully before products distribute.    No flame, please.\",\"I just hooked up my Mac IIsi to a relatively old (1 year?) Asante EN/SC adapter. The 10Base-T connection works like a charm. I installed the newest drivers from Asante's ftp server.  The problem begins when I attach one more device to the SCSI chain - specifically a 50MB drive. I power up the drive, then the Mac. The Mac tests memory, etc. Just before the \\\"happy Mac face\\\" normally shows up, the power light on the EN/SC goes out, and the boot process stops. So I can use the network, or the external drive, but not both at once. This makes the Asante box pretty much unusable.  It doesn't look like a purely electrical SCSI problem, because if I turn on the drive just a second or so too late, so that it doesn't get noticed during the initial SCSI polling, the Mac boots normally and the adapter works, even though the hard disk is powered on and connected. The Mac has *never* once failed to boot from its internal drive up to now (and I've had it for over a year).  Here is what I tried: changing the SCSI ID's of the EN/SC and the disk -- several permutations; changing the order of devices, i.e. the EN/SC at the head or tail of the chain; overterminating with an external terminator (both devices have internal ones); underterminating, i.e. removing internal resistors from the hard disk; trying another EN/SC box; trying another identical drive; trying several different SCSI cables.  Has anybody seen this? More importantly, does anyone have a solution? Thanks a lot.    E. \",\"I once read an article on  Computer technology  which stated that  every new computer technology was actually lower and slower then what it replaced.  Silicon was less  effective then the germanium  products then available.   GaAs  was less capable then Silicon.  Multi-processors were slower then  existent single processors.

Whether that player is in Kindersley, Saskatchewan or Chelyabinsk, Russia, if the GM believes him to be the better player, the GM should be drafting him.  Where do you get off calling the NHL THEIR league, when referring to Canadian players.  It doesn't belong to them, it belongs to the owners.  The owners can do what they want.  While a 'Canadian content' rule might be enforcable here in Canada, there is enough doubt that it would be enforcable in the US that the CFL (sorry for the football reference) didn't even TRY to push their import ratio rule on the Sacromento Goldminers.  Increasing the competition for the 'elite' positions, in most cases, would make players better anyways.  (Oh yeah, and how many Europeans play at the lower levels of professional hockey in North America?  While there are some that play in the AHL, or the IHL where that's an NHL team's primary farm club, you don't hear of many Europeans playing in the CHL, the ECHL, or on the secondary farm teams in the IHL.  (ie. the Jets do have a few Russian players in Moncton, but I don't believe there are any Europeans in Ft. Wayne.)) So with all those teams, there are plenty of positions for hockey players in North America.   I'm in favour of the NHL being the league for the premier players in the world.

When someone claimed that guerillas were manifestations of popular sentiment, the topic arose:\\\"When does a civilian stop becoming a civilian?\\\".  If he houses and shelters guerillas of his own free will, aiding them, has he violated his \\\"civilian\\\" status?   But don't you see that the same statement can be made both ways? If Lebanon was interested in peace then it should accept the word of Israel that the attacks were the cause for war and disarming the Hizbollah will remove the cause for its continued occupancy.  Afterall, Israel has already staged two parts of the withdrawal from areas it occupied in Lebanon during SLG.   That is not exactly true.  The Hizbollah and their affiliated groups have made several attempts to infiltrate the border of Israel.   True, but the Syrians did allow (until at least 1984) guerillas to operate in the areas that were under their control, provided that those guerillas were attacking Israeli lines.  The problem is that Syria is also not as stable a partner for long term peace as others in the area might be. \",\"The internal HD in my LC disappeared for a day last week, and I'd like to hear any (reasonable) theories folks can suggest for what happened.  It is an LC, with 10MB of RAM and an 80MB internal drive, running system 7.1, with a few SCSI devices in a (so far as I know) properly terminated chain.  I had shut down the system for a day-- I was out of town and we sometimes have thunderstorms this time of year-- and upon restarting got a blinking question mark.  I booted from a floppy and saw that my external HD seemed okay, but there was no sign of the internal.  I installed a system folder on the external and was, indeed, able to boot from it.  I tried things like Disk First Aid and Silverlining, to inquire about the internal drive.  They either could not find it or got errors in trying to talk to it.

The BRaves organization is a fertile ground to test this hypothesis, as they had little talent on their roster for some time.  Steve Avery, for example, was rushed to the majors, and he fared very poorly during his initial campaign. His subsequent pitching has not been affected by his 5+ ERA during his rookie year.  Bill James pointed out that it was relatively unusual to struggle so and then rebound.  Bob Horner was also rushed to the majors (out of Arizona State directly) had good numbers immediately.  I am not certain of the ages of people like Pete Smith, Craig McMurty, and Derek Lilliquist.  The Braves pitching staffs were so bad when they came up that they might have been rushed.  Lilliquist and Smith struggled, but it didn't hurt PS and DL may have been overhyped.

When he first logs on (via xdm), he has a single xterm window appear with the mwm window manager running.  In this configuration, X windows applications (particularly xdvi) work fine.  However, if he opens up a second xterm application, suddenly xdvi cannot start in either window, giving the error: Unable to load ISO 8859-1 font.     The only difference between the two xterm windows is that the initial one references a different name in the Xsession file, with prettier colours and other slight changes.  Further investigation shows that only opening a default xterm causes this behaviour, and more significant, ALL X applications can no longer load any fonts if they are invoked from the command line in either window.  If I start the xterm with a different font (using the -fn option), no problems.  It would seem that the default xterm is loading a font which somehow causes the server to lose all of its fonts.  Note: xlsfonts in either window shows all of the fonts available, so there doesn't appear to be a problem in the font directories/hash-tables.     Other than rewriting the XTerm app-defaults file to use a different font and hope for the best, does anyone have any ideas?\",\"  Troglodytism does not necessarily imply a low cultural level. The image-conscious Armenians sorely feel a missing glory in  their background. Armenians have never achieved statehood and  independence, they have always been subservient, and engaged  in undermining schemes against their rulers. They committed  genocide against the Muslim populations of Eastern Anatolia  and Armenian Dictatorship before and during World War I and  fully participated in the extermination of the European Jewry  during World War II. Belligerence, genocide, back-stabbing,  rebelliousness and disloyalty have been the hallmarks of the  Armenian history. To obliterate these episodes the Armenians  engaged in tailoring history to suit their whims. In this zeal  they tried to cover up the cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million  Turks and Kurds before and during World War I.  And, you don't pull nations out of a hat.

(Of course these could all be wrong.....)   from                        THE CLIPPER CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY                                Dorothy Denning                            Revised, April 21, 1993  . . .  The Clipper Chip contains a classified single-key 64-bit block encryption algorithm called \\\"Skipjack.\\\"  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys (compared with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling (compared with 16 for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  The algorithm takes 32 clock ticks, and in Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode runs at 12 Mbits per second.  Each chip includes the following components:     the Skipjack encryption algorithm    F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips    N, a 30-bit serial number (this length is subject to change)    U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip  . . .  ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP  To see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T telephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and we both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure conversation, my security device will negotiate an 80-bit session key K with the device at the other end.  This key negotiation takes place without the Clipper Chip.  In general, any method of key exchange can be used such as the Diffie-Hellman public-key distribution method.  Once the session key K is established, the Clipper Chip is used to encrypt the conversation or message stream M (digitized voice).  The telephone security device feeds K and M into the chip to produce two values:     E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and     E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement field ,   which are transmitted over the telephone line.  The law enforcement field thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U concatenated with the serial number N, all encrypted under the family key F.  The law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after an authorized wiretap has been installed.  ------------------  suppose i knew how the algorithm worked and knew the N for my chip, but did not know F, then by cryptanalysis i might be able to determine F from if law enforcement field     E[E[K; U] + N; F] not knowing N would might make this much harder.  Now suppose that I know F, (either legitimately or not), If I know K (either because I am involved in the conversation, or I know U for a party in the conversation), I may now be able to determine U for the other party.  If I know F I can also defeat the law enforcement field, since I could make my own, with a different K then the one I am using. Knowing F also allows traffic analysis to be performed. So I might not know what you are saying but I could know who you are saying it too.  Now I admit that someone trying to compute U will not have lots of messages to work from, but since we have no way of knowing that the key generation method does not (deliberately?) generate weak keys, or for that matter that the published method is in fact used, perhaps the U's will be chosen from know weak keys for the system.  Obviously the compromise of F would be a disaster, both to law enforcement for whom this whole thing is designed, and for the people who believe that it is giving them security. F is but one number, and I sure that alot of people (more then 1) know what it is (and if some \\\"panel of experts\\\" is going to check it over for flaws then many more will know F, forget grinding chips, bribery and blackmail work just fine.

So I decided to check it out, on my own.  But, then, that was in BN times (Before Net).  So, here are some  references.  See Robin Lane Fox's _The unauthorized version_, (p.284) where  Lane Fox writes, \\\"... the one passage which appears to [comment on Jesus'  career] is agreed to be a Christian addition.\\\"  In my Re:Albert Sabin response (C5u7sJ.391@sunfish.usd.edu) to Jim Lippard (21 April 93), I noted that consensus is typically indicated subtly as in Elaine  Pagel's _The gnostic gospels_ (p.85), to wit:  \\\"A comment *attributed* to Josephus reports ... [emphasis mine]\\\".  Scholars sometimes do not even mention the two Josephus entries, another subtlety reflecting consensus.  So far as I can deduce, today's consensus is built on at least three things:  1) the long passage is way out of context, 2) Origen did not know about the long passage, and 3) the short and long passages are contradictory.  I don't know the references wherein the arguments which led to consensus are orginally developed (does anyone?).  Biblical scholars as I defined them include theologians and historians.  The former, like the latter, incorporate historical, social, technological and ideological contexts as well as theology.  So the distinction is blurred.  I  didn't elaborate on that.  Sorry.  (In turn, historians are compelled to incorporate theology).  Can't say about the number of copies.  These were, however, BG times (Before  Gutenburg).  A hundred first editions seems exceedingly high; counting on one  hand seems more reasonable.  Perhaps those mss. without the long insert (if any, because anything is possible) have been destroyed.  Such a practice is  certainly not foreign to religions.  Anyway, all we have are mss. which have  the two entries.  Lippart (in the message noted above) talks about an Arabic  ms.

If they would of had the proper equipment and personal then they could of captured the compound on the initial assault and none of this would of happened.   If they'd gone to the door and knocked on it to serve the  warrant, like the Sheriff had done 3 other times, they  wouldn't have needed to HAVE an initial assault.  But then,  Herr Klinton and Attorney Gen'l Reno wouldn't have been  able to have told such heroic stories about how they  \\\"protected\\\" the rest of us from a group of people who  kept to themselves, miles out in the prairie.  The BATF needs more people, better weapons and more armored transports. When they meet hostile fire they should be able to use more force instead of retreating to a stand off. If you are going to do a job then do it right. The BATF is there to protect us and they must have the proper equipment and people to do the job.   The BATF needs to be disbanded.  This out of control group  of Rambo wannabees is a danger to the Republic.  With the WoD and the increased crime in the streets the BATF is needed more now then ever.

I've just finished reading S414, and have several questions about the Brady bills (S414 and HR1025).  1. _Are_ these the current versions of the Brady bill?      What is the status of these bills?  I've heard they're \\\"in committee\\\".      How close is that to being made law?  2. S414 and HR1025 seem fairly similar.  Are there any important    differences I missed?  3. S414 seems to have some serious loopholes:   A. S414 doesn't specify an \\\"appeals\\\" process to wrongful denial during      the waiting period, other than a civil lawsuit(?)  (S414 has an appeals      process once the required instant background check system is established,      but not before).   B. the police are explicitly NOT liable for mistakes in denying/approving      using existing records (so who would I sue in \\\"A\\\" above to have an      inaccurate record corrected?)   C. S414 includes an exception-to-waiting-period clause for if a person      can convince the local Chief Law-Enforcement Officer (CLEO) of an      immediate threat to his or her life, or life of a household member.      But S414 doesn't say exactly what is considered a \\\"threat\\\", nor does      it place a limit on how long the CLEO takes to issue an exception      statement. True?  Have I misunderstood?  Any other 'holes?  4. With just S414, what's to stop a person with a \\\"clean\\\" record from    buying guns, grinding off the serial numbers, and selling them to crooks?    At minimum, what additional laws are needed to prevent this?     'Seems at min. a \\\"gun counting\\\" scheme would be needed    (e.g., \\\"John Doe owns N guns\\\").  So, if S414 passes, I wouldn't be surprised    to see legislation for stricter, harder-to-forge I.D.'s plus national gun    registration, justified by a need to make the Brady bill work.  Please comment.  I'm mainly interested in specific problems with the current legislation--I don't mean to start a general discussion of the merits of any/all waiting-period bills ever proposed.\",\"    >It seems that conservatives are putting a lot of effort into     >showing up the 10% figure, but that really doesn't make a     >difference.

Helsingfors IFK have been around since 1897 but fans only started taking hockey seriously in the 1960s so I think you're exagerating here.   That's a rather bold claim, in the light of how successful the Canadian & American Olympic teams have been . . . and they've had to play according to our set of rules and on international ice. The 1992 Olympic teams contained about as much talent as your average expansion team. Canada had Eric Lindros, Sean Burke, Joe Juneau and Chris Kontos. Another four or five have been deep subs in the NHL. As for the Yanks, Keith Tkachuk, Scott Lachance, Bret Hedican, Shawn  McEachern, Steve Heintze, Ted Donato, Joe Sacco and Bill Guerin have been  3rd/4th line players in the NHL, while Robb Stauber has done well for the  Kings in goal. Nothing more. In fact, I'm sure that an All-Star team assembled from the best Finnish League teams would do no better in the NHL than Hartford  or Tampa Bay currently are doing. --- But what happens if _all_ top-class Finnish & Swedish players gradually end up with Helsinki & Stockholm as the North American-based ones gradually retire and no Canadian/American team is allowed to draft new players from Scandinavia?  Here is what THE HOCKEY NEWS scouts think of our NHL-based players:  (28-30=superstar) (23-27=star) (18-22=NHL regular+) (13-17=NHL regular) ( 8-12=role player)  FINLAND:    D-Jyrki Lumme.......20 D-Teppo Numminen....20 D-Peter Ahola.......13  C-Jari Kurri........25 C-Christian Ruuttu..16  R-Teemu Selanne.....27  L-Esa Tikkanen......20 (Obviously, Selanne's ratings would be higher today than they were in January)  SWEDEN: D-Ulf Samuelsson....21 D-Fredrik Olausson..20 D-Niklas Lidstrom...18 D-Calle Johansson...18 D-Kjell Samuelsson..17 D-Tommy Sjodin......13 D-Tommy Albelin......7  C-Mats Sundin.......26 C-Thomas Steen......18  R-Thomas Sandstrom..22 R-Ulf Dahlen........18 R-Michael Nylander..13  L-Per-Erik Eklund...18 L-Johan Garpenlov...16 L-Mikael Andersson..15 L-Jan Erixon........14  This would be interesting. Clearly, Finland's top five players (Winnipeg's Selanne & Numminen, Vancouver's Lumme, Los Angeles' Jari Kurri and New York's Tikkanen) are right up there with any five-man unit Pittsburgh & co. have. But I have my doubts about the home-based Finnish players - the national team did well in the Canada Cup and World Championships largely due to the efforts of Markus Ketterer (the goalie), 3-4 or the players listed above and luck. There's presumably a lot of decent players in Finland that wouldn't be superstars at the highest level but still valuable role players, however. My guess would be that the Finnish Canada Cup team would be a .500 team in the NHL. --- Sweden is easier to judge because they have more players in North America. Their points total (16 players) is 274 - seven more than Ottawa's 22 top players combined! If we estimate there are six more NHL regulars back home in  Sweden, an all-Swedish team would assemble about 350-360 skill points. Deducting some points from Pittsburgh, NY Rangers and other teams that rely on Swedish players, the Swedish team would finish in sixth place - about as high as Boston, Vancouver, Calgary and Montreal on paper! So, the \\\"dynasty\\\" talk isn't completely unfounded here. An all-Finnish/all-Swedish team might have an advantage because the players would be playing at home half of the time, won't have to adapt to a foreign country and a foreign language, and presumably play the wide-open European variant of hockey rather than have to learn the North American checking game. However, if free agency becomes a factor the top  Scandinavian players still might end up playing for large-market teams after a  couple of years the same way Edmonton's \\\"dynasty\\\" crumbled in the late '80s.  Some fringe players likely will be drafted by other NHL teams as having an  exclusive talent pool might be a bit unfair after all. I'd settle for a  compromise, prohibit all European teams from signing a North American during  the first two rounds but allow them to keep their top two players. After this,  the amateur draft should be open to anyone.  \",\"GB> From: geb@cs.pitt.edu (Gordon Banks) GB> The HMO would stop the over-ordering, but in HMOs, tests are GB> under-ordered.

I grant you that when Joseph Smith was still alive, plenty of \\\"accusations\\\" were filed, most of which had little bearing with reality, as evidenced by various verdicts. I have studied lds history for 15 years now, and I have yet to see prove that the lds leadership was involved, in quote: \\\"illegal activities.\\\" Plural marriage, yes, but your charge of \\\"underage\\\" wives sounds like it could have originated from a tabloid, and discredits the high moral standards which characterized these leaders and families, unlike, as it appears, those of David Koresh.  #        Joseph Smith started the sect.  After he and his brother Hyram #were murdered in a Nauvoo, Il. jail cell, church membership split over #who to follow.  Initially, Smith was considered a prophet (just like #Mohammed, a rather interesting parallel considering Muslims consider #Christ to be a prophet the same as Jews, I'm led to understand.  Make #no mistake, this was no messiah we're talking about in Smith).  The  And neither did he claim he was.  As the church reflects the moral aptitude of its leaders (and especially those of Joseph Smith), I have nothing but the highest respect for this inspired man, whose only \\\"crime\\\" was that he refused to deny that he had seen a vision...  Many have tried to explain the \\\"Smith phenomenon\\\" away, but the bold presence of an 8.5 million member strong church stands as a witness that Joseph Smith's testimony had enough resilience and power to carry on the message.  #thought at the time was that the gift of prophecy was to be handed #down father to son.  After Joseph Smith died, his son was only #entering his teens.  Brigham Young and a few others claimed to have #been bequeathed the gift and leadership prior to his death.  The #Council of Twelve, the Church governing body, wasn't of much help #here, and this basic conflict is still a wedge between the sects. #Brigham Young took his followers to Salt Lake.  The rest waited #for Smith Jr. to grow up enough to assume leadership.  The other #claimants to the leadership were soon ignored, like Mike Dukakis. ;-)  \\\"The rest\\\" were apostates and excommunicated members of the Church, while the great majority of the membership, the Twelve, and the various auxiliary organizations, chose to accept Brigham Young as the new prophet and leader of the Church.  If you knew your lds scriptures and doctrine, you would have known that Brigham Young was the FIRST in line to fill the prophet Joseph Smith's vacancy: he was the senior apostle in the Quorum, and various comments made by Joseph indicated that it was Brigham who would lead the latter-day exodus to the West.  Other rightful \\\"heirs\\\" were either dead (Hyrum Smith) or excommunicated (Oliver Cowdery), and while persecutions abounded and intensified, Joseph Smith had already given orders to look for a new place, an empty land beyond the boundaries of the United States (at that time).  This \\\"Rekhabite\\\" principle (pseudographia) was well understood and antipated by the great majority of lds faithful, and was not questioned by them.  Granted, a couple of \\\"do-it-yourselfers\\\" stayed behind, unwilling to sacrifice and to undertake the perilous journey to the unknown, but this also was necessary to separate the tares from the wheat.  The church benefitted from this purification process: they became even more unified and willing to carry out their mission to the world.  #        Both sects practiced the \\\"1-year food stockpile\\\" doctrine, #and this being frontier and farming country most carried or at #least owned weapons.  There is little evidence that they were a #militaristic sect, given that they tended to move on rather than #face large-scale opposition.  Brigham Young, having suffered a #great deal getting to Salt Lake, seems to have been quite #justified in making military training a good thing.  Remember, #this was far beyond where even the US Army went, and these people #had nobody to turn to save themselves. # #        Just a little context to put this all in perspective.  BTW, since when is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (one of the largest denominations in the country) a \\\"sect\\\"???

Even if this were true (reliable data, please), I am convinced that those officers would perform to the highest codes of honor and conduct (that's why they were selected for in the first place, remember?).  Besides, one of our Articles of Faith STRONGLY states the principle of freedom of religion, and that all people are free to worship \\\"*how*, *where*, or *what* they may.\\\"  #        If it's true, there would be little affect.  LDS and RLDS #philosophy is that all other religions have strayed from the true #Church as set down by Jesus, but that God will judge each on his #own merits.  In addition, the RLDS also contend (and the LDS may #as well) that ignorance of the True Way (tm) is an excuse.  You #can only be condemned if you had been tought the way and rejected #it.  In short, LDS and RLDS suffer everybody from Lutherans to #Buddhists, secure in the knowledge that though they are wrong they #will not be penalized for ignorance.  It is more likely that Hoover #liked them because of their rather strict upbringings which forbade #alcohol, tobacco, hot drink (like coffee or tea), and the like. #These people are the \\\"salt of the Earth\\\" and as such are more #easily made to follow orders and have few vices to be used against them.

But assuming that the Pope has universal jurisdiction    and authority, what authority do you rely upon for your decisions?    What prevents me from choosing ANY doctrine I like and saying that    Papal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time?    This is especially true, since Councils of Bishops have basically    stood by the Pope.  The ultimate question is the traditional theology of the Church.  This is the *only* thing that it is possible to resist a Pope for: his departure from the traditional doctrine of the Church.  If commands from *any* authority conflict with Tradition, the commands must be disobeyed.  My own view on this is that this conflict could only happen in a major way.  God would never allow a hair-splitting situation to develop; it would be too complex for people to figure out.  I don't view the present situation in the Church as anything extremely complicated. Run through a list of what has happened in the last 30 years in the Catholic Church, and any impartial observer will be aghast.     It appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter is    disagreements over what is tradition and Tradition, and also over    authority and discipline.    The problems stem from a general widespread ignorance of the Catholic Faith, in my opinion.  Most Catholics know about zilch about the Catholic Faith; this leaves them wide open for destruction by erring bishops.  It's basically the Reformation part II.  There is not even a question in my mind that in some respects the shards of the Catholic Church are currently being trampled upon by the Catholic hierarchy.  I could go on listing shocking things for an hour, probably.  Take the situation in Campos, Brazil, for example.  I'm reading a book on what happened there after Vatican Council II.  The bishop, Antonio de Castro-Mayer, never introduced all the changes that followed in the wake of Vatican II.  He kept the traditional Mass, the same old catechisms, etc.  He made sure the people knew their faith, the Catholic theology of obedience, what Modernism was, etc.  He innoculated the people against what was coming.  Well, one day the order came from Rome for his retirement.  It came when the Pope was sick.  Bishop de Castro-Mayer waited until the Pope recovered, then inquired whether this command was what the Pope really wanted, or something that some Liberal had commanded in his absence. The Pope confirmed the decision.  So the good bishop retired.  The injustice that followed was completely incredible.  A new bishop was installed.  He proceeded to expel most of bishop de Castro-Mayer's clergy from their churches, because they refused to celebrate the New Mass.  The new bishop would visit a parish, and celebrate a New Mass. The people would promptly walk out of the church en masse.  The bishop was *enraged* by this.  He usually resorted to enlisting the help of the secular authorities to eject the priest from the church.  The priests would just start building new churches; the people were completely behind them.  The old parishes had the New Mass, as the bishop desired -- and virtually no parishioners.  The prime motivation for all this was completely illegal, according to canon law.  No priest can be penalized in any way for saying the traditional Mass, because of legislation enacted by Pope Saint Pius V. Nor is there any obligation to say the New Mass.  During all this process, the people of Campos, not just private individuals, but including civil authorities, were constantly sending petitions and letters to Rome to do something about the new Modernist bishop.  NOTHING was ever done; no help ever arrived from Rome. Eventually 37 priests were kicked out, and about 40,000 people.     My question to the supporters of SSPX is this:    Is there ANY way that your positions with respect to church reforms   could change and be conformed to those of the Pope? (assuming that   the Pope's position does not change and that the leaders of SSPX   don't jointly make such  choice.)     If not, this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority.    If I adopt the view that \\\"I'm NOT wrong, I CAN'T be wrong, and    there's NO WAY I'll change my mind, YOU must change yours\\\", that    I've either left the Catholic Church or it has left me.  If the Pope defines certain things ex cathedra, that would be the end of the controversy.  That process is all very well understood in Catholic theology, and anyone who doesn't go along with it is an instant non-Catholic.  The problem here is that people do not appreciate what is going on in the Catholic world.  If they knew the Faith, and what our bishops are doing, they would be shocked!     We sould argue from now until the Second Coming about what the \\\"real\\\"    traditional teaching of the Church is.  If this were a simple matter    East and West would not have been separated for over 900 years.  This isn't the case in the Catholic Church.  There is a massive body of traditional teaching.  The Popes of the last 150 years are especially relevant.  There is no question at all what the traditional doctrine is.     I thought that the teaching magisterieum of the church did not allow    error in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term.`    I may be wrong here, I'm not Roman Catholic. :-)  That's heresy, more or less.  Although they have done a great job since the Reformation, the last 30 years have seen so many errors spread that it's pitiful.  Infallibility rests in the Pope, and in the Church as a whole.  In the short term, a Pope, or large sections of the Church can go astray.  In fact, that's what usually happens during a major heresy: large sections of the Church go astray.  (The Pope historically has been much more reliable.)  Everything will always come back in the long run.     What would be the effect of a Pope making an ex cathedra statement    regarding the SSPX situation?  Would it be honored?  If not, how    do you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility?    Again, I'm not trying to be contentions, I'm trying to understand.    Since I'm Orthodox, I've got no real vested interest in the outcome,    one way or the other.  Yes, it would be honored.  Infallibility is infallibility.  But what is he going to define?  That the New Mass is a better expression of the Catholic Faith than the old?  That sex education in the Catholic schools is wonderful?  That all religions are wonderful except for that professed by the Popes prior to Vatican II?     It does if the command was legitimate.  SSPX does not view the    Pope's commands as legitimate.  Why?  This is a VERY slippery slope.\",\"One not-so-quick question to throw out there for you guys...  For our class project, we need to design and build a power supply to the following specs:  Voltatge:  adjustable from 1-12V Current:   *limited* at 1A  Voltage must stay within 2% of designated value for I from 0-1A AC ripple less than 5 mV (rms)  Of course, we can't just use an adjustable voltage, current-limiting regulator chip ;^)  Our problem is with the current limiting (i.e. we've found stuff to do the rest of the parts of the circuit).  What the supply must do, if presented with a load which would draw more than 1A, given the supply voltage, is reduce the voltage so that the current will equal one amp.  Thus, if we were to short the thing with the ammeter, we should read one amp.  If we measure the current through a 1 ohm  resistor at 12V, we should read one amp (and the output voltage, by necessity, must be 1V.  The only basic idea we have seen for the current limiter involves a circuit which will pull current off of the base of the output  power transistor, and therefore reduce the output.  So, does anybody have any ideas we could work from?  Thanks in advance.  Andy Collins, KC6YEY acollins@uclink.berkeley.edu\",\"        Hmmm... people in the americas before the time of Christ, children who die young, etc. ?        But of course, the popular conception of hell (correct or incorrect) is something akin to eternal perpetuation of consciousness, at the very least.       I think a good number of atheists believe there is nothing beyond  bodily death, but it is simply an abuse of language to say they believe they're going to hell. They believe they're going to _die_. Understand that you've turned Hell into a verb. Using the same logic, it also follows that all animals are 'going to Hell.' Are you sure this is what you want to say? (presumably animals don't have the opportunity to get to heaven, but this still doesn't change the fact that they're going to Hell (die a final death))     I don't claim to know whether or not there is an afterlife of _some_ sort, but if Hell is as you described (final death, and not eternal perpetuation of consciousness) it will be true that there will never be a moment when I am aware of my non-existence.  (assuming I 'go to Hell' and not to Heaven) In other words, I'll never know I'm dead. Hmmm...         Ever hear people say of a loved one who was ill, and has died:  \\\"At least she's not suffering any more; She's in Heaven now.\\\" ?      Consider the following statement:  \\\"At least she's not suffering any more; She's in Hell now.\\\"      The above statement sounds odd, but according to your definition of Hell,  it would be a true statement. The person in Hell would not be suffering.  Granted, they wouldn't be *anything* (wouldn't be having any conscious experience whatsoever).       You say Hell (death) is eternal. However, this loses its meaning  to a dead person. And to me, it seems that the threat of some sort  of eternal punishment only makes sense/has force if one expects to be conscious throughout this eternity.       Many atheists believe that the thirst for an afterlife is simply the product of propaganda (\\\"Friend, do you want the FREE gift of e-ternal life?\\\" It's my understanding that the early jews did not believe in an afterlife. Can anyone back me up on this?) combined with the survival instinct all animals share. The difference is we have consciousness, and once we get the idea of eternal life drilled into our brains, we then desire a sort of super-survival.          That would depend on what Heaven is like. If God is a King, and  an eternity in heaven consists of giving thanks and praise to the King, I might opt for Hell. I read a lovely account of a missionary trying to convert Eskimos to Christianity in the book _The Illusion of Immortality_ by Corliss Lamont. The missionary started to speak about Heaven.  \\\"Are there seals in heaven? Will we be able to go hunting?\\\" asked an Eskimo. The missionary said no. The group of Eskimos then said something to the effect of, \\\"Well what good is your Heaven if there's no hunting? Scram.\\\" I highly recommend the above book (IOI) to anyone who wants an account of the other side of the immortality coin (that there is no  immortality).

I don't know how much the teaching of countersteering in the beginner course really helps the tuchus steerers. I was one, I guess that I always steered a bicycle that way, and I only got the hang of countersteering in normal riding *after* the course. I could do the countersteering swerves in the course no problem, but I only started using it in my normal riding when I decided that my turning at speed (off-ramps and the like) was a lot more difficult that it should have been. I knew how it works (although that's currently up for debate) definitely knew *that* it works, as I could do it in swerves, but only figured it out later in my normal riding. Just a data point. I think that it's not a bad idea to bring the idea up, but it's best to let everyone tuchus-steer for the first lesson or two, so they can learn to shift gears before they have to worry about proper handlebar technique.   I have. In our beginner course we had passenger training. Sometime during the lesson the instructor would hop on the back of the bike, and the student would take him for a ride.

This is the first in a series of regular postings aimed at new readers of the newsgroups.  Many groups of a 'controversial' nature have noticed that new readers often come up with the same questions, mis-statements or misconceptions and post them to the net.  In addition, people often request information which has been posted time and time again.  In order to try and cut down on this, the alt.atheism groups have a series of five regular postings under the following titles:     1.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Overview for New Readers    2.

However, please send any changes or corrections to the author, and please do not re-post copies of the articles to alt.atheism; it does nobody any good to have multiple versions of the same document floating around the network.                                   Finding Stuff  All of the FAQ files *should* be somewhere on your news system.  Here are some suggestions on what to do if you can't find them:  1. Check the newsgroup alt.atheism.  Look for subject lines starting with    \\\"Alt.Atheism FAQ:\\\".  2. Check the newsgroup news.answers for the same subject lines.     If you don't find anything in steps 1 or 2, your news system isn't set up    correctly, and you may wish to tell your system administrator about the    problem.  3. If you have anonymous FTP access, connect to rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27].    Go to the directory /pub/usenet/alt.atheism, and you'll find the latest    versions of the FAQ files there.     FTP is a a way of copying files between networked computers.  If you    need help in using or getting started with FTP, send e-mail to    mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with        send usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq     in the body.  4. There are other sites which also carry news.answers postings.  The article    \\\"Introduction to the news.answers newsgroup\\\" carries a list of these    sites; the article is posted regularly to news.answers.  5. If you don't have FTP, send mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu    consisting of the following lines:        send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources       send usenet/alt.atheism/faq       send usenet/alt.atheism/introduction       send usenet/alt.atheism/logic       send usenet/alt.atheism/resources  5.

There's other stuff, too; interesting commands to try are \\\"help\\\" and    \\\"send atheism/index\\\".  6. (Last resort)  Mail mathew@mantis.co.uk, or post an article to the    newsgroup asking how you can get the FAQ files.  You should only do this    if you've tried the above methods and they've failed; it's not nice to    clutter the newsgroup or people's mailboxes with requests for files.    it's better than posting without reading the FAQ, though!  For instance,    people whose email addresses get mangled in transit and who don't have     FTP will probably need assistance obtaining the FAQ files. \",\"I recently upgraded to System 7.1 and now I also upgraded my DeskWriter drivers from 2.2 to 3.1.

My experience of Christianity (25+ years) is that most Christians seek answers from clergymen who have little or no direct experience of spiritual matters, and that most of these questions can be answered by simple introspection.  Most people suspect that they cannot trust their senses, but few take the next step to figure out that they can trust themselves.  Not to get too esoteric, but it seems that most religions, Christianity included, are founded by particularly intuitive people who understand this.

Co\",\" Actually, jon, that is quite true.  Christian people have caused \\\"objective morality\\\" to look very \\\"relative.\\\"  After all, that was the point of the original question in this thread, i.e. can we toss out Christianity because it is so obviously inconsistent with its own principles?  If you will bear with me, I will attempt to explain this apparent inconsistency from at least one Christian's viewpoint:  If God exists and is the creator of mankind as the Bible claims, then He has a pretty well-defined concept of what makes people tick physically, emotionally, etc.  GOD has an \\\"objective\\\" morality for us. That is to say, He has no trouble understanding what is good for (or detrimental to) the creature He created.    Galatians 2:10-- For we [mankind] are His workmanship, created in  Christ Jesus for good works [a morality], which God prepared  beforehand [a well-defined design], that we might walk in them.  However, contrary to what many people assume (including the Pharasees of the Bible,) God's morality cannot be completely codified in a list of rules and regulations.  To some extent, every activity of a person's life creates a new situation to which morality must be applied.  There never could be enough volumes to codify God's \\\"objective\\\" morality for us.   Throughout history, mankind has tried to reduce morality to a list of rules (objectivity, if you please.)  In the Old Testament, we have both principles and specific rules.  By the time of Jesus, most of the principles were obscured by the emphasis men had placed on the rules. Volumes of additional rules had been made to try to codify the application of the principles.  We [mankind] weren't comfortable with the \\\"subjectivity\\\" of principles.    For reference see Matthew 5 where Jesus explains the difference  between the Law and the principles of the Law.  For example, in  verses 21-22:  \\\"You have heard that the ancients were told,  'You shall not commit murder'...and 'Whoever commits murder shall  be liable to the court.'  But I say to you that everyone who is  angry with his brother shall be liable to the court...\\\"  The \\\"objective morality\\\" of God gets blurred by our inept interpretation of it.  We [Christians] have made our biggest errors when we have allowed any one person or group of people decide EXACTLY what God intended for us.  If we [Christians] would stay committed to seeking God's will instead of trying to prove we already had it all figured out, we might do a better job of allowing others to find God's \\\"objective morality\\\" for themselves.  If Jesus is who he said he was/is (and that's the fundamental question,) then HE IS \\\"objective morality.\\\" \",\"AllThe Devil ReincarnateSWR meter for CB radios  TD>From: ssave@ole.cdac.com (The Devil Reincarnate) TD>Organization: CDAC, WA TD>What TD>is a good choice for a CB? 1/4 or 1/8 wave?

The best is a 1/2 wave antenna, followed by  1/4, then 1/8 etc.  As for SWRing in, what you actually do is trim the antenna to the correct  length for the specific wavelength you will be transmitting on. Since the  wavelength varies with the channel you use, then it's recommended to SWR  in using the middle channel of those you are going to use. Anyway in the beginning of CB's, all new antennas had to be SWR'ed in,  nowdays manufactures trim the antennas almost spot on, so that there's not  much point in SWRing. Then again you may be a fanatic and whish to do it  anyway.\",\"Greetings:  Can someone steer me towards sources of information on vehicle data logging systems?

Seems only the SDCNs realize how much baseball is a *team* game, combining efforts from every player for the win.  Consider the Red Sox game last night.  The Sox won 4-3 in the bottom of the 13th.  Who won the game?  -Clemens pitched a strong nine (?) innings, allowing only two runs. -Ryan pitched a couple shutout innings, though he needed some excellent  defensive plays behind him to do so. -Quantrill pitched a couple of innings, gave up the go-ahead run, and  got credited with the win when the Sox scored two in the bottom of  the inning.  Looks like a team effort to me!  Yet only Quantrill got credit for the win.  How about the offense? -Dawson and Vaughn hit (I think) HRs early in the game.  Without either  one, the Sox would have lost in nine. -Quintana led off the 13th with a solid single. -Zupcic pinch-ran for Quintana, providing the speed to go from first  to third when... -Cooper ripped a *second* single in the inning. -Melvin avoided the DP, getting the run home with a sac fly.  Not much of  a help, but it was something. -Scrub Richardson then hit a double, scoring the speedy Cooper all the  way from first!  (Hill's lack of defense helped.)  Cooper and Zupcic were credited with runs, Melvin and Richardson were credited with RBIs.  But it seems to me that it was Quintana's hit that set up the whole inning!  And did Melvin really contribute as much as Richardson?  Furthermore, people seem to consider RBIs to be more significant than runs.  Did Melvin contribute more than Cooper?  Cooper provided the game-winning baserunner, and moved the tying run to third base with only one out!  Assigning credit based on Runs and RBIs is clearly ridiculous.  You can argue that OBP and SLG don't show you who came through in the clutch, but R&RBI don't do any better.  At least OBP and SLG don't *claim* to try to tell you that.

I bought it in California, and if it'll let me, I'd like to keep it for another year.  The only problem is these Indiana winters--my heater controls don't work.  The car has vacuum operated control switches for the vents.  Right now it is stuck in the \\\"vent\\\" mode.  It will blow warm air, but I can't switch the air flow to either the floor (I can live without this) or the defrost (I can't  live without this).  I probably could just jam the air deflector to the  defrost position, but this blows a lot of air in my face and is, well, kind of like putting a vacuum cleaner in reverse.  I have taken parts of the dash off and looked at the vacuum system and I think the problem (or part of it) is with the two diaphragms which control up/down and outside/inside air flow.  THe diaphragm which controls outside(vent)/in- side(no vent) air is cracked most of the way around, and the other one is probably damaged too, considering the advanced age of the car.  Two questions:   1)  Is there anything I should be aware of about this (other than  the fact that I should move from Indiana) ?   2)  In the event that replacement diaphragms aren't available, is there  a way to \\\"fix\\\" this?

In Britain, where one has/used to pay for a TV licence, there  are/were TV detector vans prowling the streets, looking for people who hadn't  paid their licence fee. They had a couple of long solenoid antennae on the roof, and I believe could triangulate an operating TV from the IF.

OTIS is here for the purpose of distributing original artwork and photographs over the network for public perusal, scrutiny,     and distribution.  Digital immortality.  The basic idea behind \\\"digital immortality\\\" is that computer networks    are here to stay and that anything interesting you deposit on them will be around near-forever.  The GIFs and JPGs of today will be the artifacts of a digital future.  Perhaps they'll be put in different formats, perhaps only surviving on backup tapes....but they'll be there...and someone will dig them up.     If that doesn't interest you... OTIS also offers a forum for critique and exhibition of your works....a virtual art gallery that never closes and exists in an information dimension where your submissions will hang as wallpaper on thousands of glowing monitors.  Suddenly, life is  breathed into your work...and by merit of it's stimulus, it will  travel the globe on pulses of light and electrons.   Spectators are welcome also, feel free to browse the gallery and  let the artists know what you think of their efforts.  Keep your own copies of the images to look at when you've got the gumption... that's what they're here for.  ---------------------------------------------------------------  WHERE?               OTIS currently (as of 4/21/93) has two FTP sites.       141.214.4.135 (projects/otis), the UWI site     sunsite.unc.edu (/pub/multimedia/pictures/OTIS), the SUNsite   (you can also GOPHER to this site for OTIS as well)  Merely \\\"anonymous FTP\\\" to either site on Internet and change to the appropriate directory.  Don't forget to get busy and use the \\\"bin\\\" command to make sure you're in binary.  OTIS has also been spreading to some dial-up BBS systems around North America....the following systems have a substancial supply of OTIStuff...  Underground Cafe (Omaha) (402.339.0179) 2 lines  CyberDen (SanFran?) (415.472.5527)  Usenet Waffle-iron  --------------------------------------------------------------   HOW DO YOU CONTRIBUTE?                What happens is...you draw a pretty picture or take a lovely    photo, get it scanned into an image file, then either FTP-put it in the CONTRIB/Incoming directory or use UUENCODE to send it to me (email addresses at eof) in email.  After the image is received, it will be put into the correct directory.  Computer originated works are also welcome.  OTIS' directories house two types of image files, GIF and JPG.   GIF and JPG files require, oddly enough, a GIF or JPG viewer to  see.  These viewers are available for all types of computers at  most large FTP sites around Internet.  JPG viewers are a bit tougher to find.  If you can't find one, but do have a GIF viewer,   you can obtain a JPG-to-GIF conversion program which will change     JPG files to a standard GIF format.   OTIS also accepts animation files.        When you submit image files, please send me email at the same time stating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to be used (in publications or other projects) or if it is merely for people to view.  Also, include some biographical information on yourself, we'll be having info-files on each contributing artist and their works.  You  can also just upload a text-file of info about yourself (instead of  emailing).  If you have pictures, but no scanner, there is hope.  Merely send copies to:  The OTIS Project c/o Ed Stastny PO BX 241113 Omaha, NE 68124-1113  I will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will   scan them.  Include an ample SASE if you want your stuff back.   Also include information on each image, preferably a 1-3 line  description of the image that we can include in the infofile in the directory where it's finally put.  If you have preferences as to what the images are to be named, include those as well.     Conversely, if you have a scanner and would like to help out, please contact me and we'll arrange things.  If you want to submit your works by disk, peachy.  Merely send a 3.5\\\" disk to the above address (Omaha) and a SASE if you want your disk back. This is good for people who don't have direct access to encoders or FTP, but do have access to a scanner.  We accept disks in either Mac or IBM compatible format.  If possible, please submit image files as GIF or JPG.  If you can't...we can convert from most formats...we'd just rather not have to.  At senders request, we can also fill disks with as much OTIS as they can stand.  Even if you don't have stuff to contribute, you can send a blank disk and an SASE (or $2.50 for disk, postage and packing) to  get a slab-o-OTIS.  As of 04/21/93, we're at about 18 megabytes of files, and growing.   Email me for current archive size and directory.  --------------------------------------------------------------------  DISTRIBUTION?  The images distributed by the OTIS project may be distributed freely    on the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is not altered in any way (save to convert from one image format to another).  In fact, we encourage files to be distributed to local  bulletin boards and such.  If you could, please transport the appropriate text files along with the images.     It would also be nice if you'd send me a note when you did post images from OTIS to your local bbs.  I just want to keep track of them so participants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is.  It's the purpose of OTIS to get these images spread out as much as possible.  If you have the time, please upload a few to your favorite BBS system....or even just post this \\\"info-file\\\" there.  It would be keen of you.  --------------------------------------------------------------------  USE?  If you want to use any of the works you find on the OTIS directory, you'll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the  stipulations of the permission (such as free copy of publication, or full address credit).  You will either find this in the \\\".rm\\\" file for     the image or series of images...or in the \\\"Artists\\\" directory under the  Artists name.  If permission isn't explicitly given, then you'll have  to contact the artist to ask for it.  If no info is available, email me (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu), and I'll get in contact with the artist for  you, or give you their contact information.   When you DO use permitted work, it's always courteous to let the artist know about it, perhaps even send them a free copy or some such compensation for their files.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  NAMING IMAGES?  Please keep the names of your files in \\\"dos\\\" format.  That means, keep the filename (before .jpg or .gif) to eight characters or less.  The way I usually do it is to use the initials of the artist, plus a three or four digit \\\"code\\\" for the series of images, plus the series number. Thus, Leonardo DeVinci's fifth mechanical drawing would be something like:    ldmek5.gif     OR    ldmek5.jpg    OR    ldmech5.gif   ETC  Keeping the names under 8 characters assures that the filename will remain intact on all systems.     ----------------------------------------------------------------------   CREATING IMAGE FILES?  When creating image files, be sure to at least include your name somewhere on or below the picture.  This gives people a reference in case they'd like to contact you.  You may also want to include a title, address or other information you'd like people to know.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  HMMM?!  That's about it for now.  More \\\"guidelines\\\" will be added as needed. Your input is expected.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  DISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project has no connection to the Church of OTIS          (a sumerian deity) or it's followers, be they pope, priest,       or ezine administrator.  We do take sacrifices and donations       however.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  DISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project is here for the distribution of original         image files.  The files will go to the public at large.         It's possible, as with any form of mass-media, that someone       could unscrupulously use your images for financial gain.             Unless you've given permission for that, it's illegal.  OTIS       takes no responsibility for this.  In simple terms, all rights       revert to the author/artist.  To leave an image on OTIS is to        give permission for it to be viewed, copied and distributed        electronically.  If you don't want your images distributed            all-over, don't upload them.  To leave an image on OTIS is       NOT giving permission to have it used in any publication or       broadcast that incurs profit (this includes, but is not        limited to, magazines, newsletters, clip-art software,               screen-printed clothing, etc).

The critical information from the neuron is in the firing frequency (maximum about 100 action potentials per seconds), and not in the amplitude of the signal or in details of the signal shape. So the resolution of about 0.4 % you get with an 8 bit convertor is more then sufficient.  AC coupling does not have to be a problem either, since in many cases you are not interested in the DC level. My pre amplifier is AC coupled also. The critical point is the lowest frequency that will pass. If the cutoff point is to high, the action potentials will be slightly distorted.

Where did _that_ topic come from and what's it got to do with the discussion at hand? :-)  When I was discussing the concept of different criminal laws for crimes against different classes of people (and yes, I do consider laws which allow/mandate enhanced penalties following conviction based upon the convict's attitudes towards the class membership of the victim to fit into that category), the category of classes I had in mind was that of the standard civil rights discussion -- classes based upon race, gender, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, etc.  Having you ask about classes based upon one's _profession_ rather than one's personal characteristics caught me off guard, and I had to think out the question from scratch.  What I finally decided was that the law should not recognize such classes because to do so would be to formally and officially declare some people to be of more worth than others, and that would be anathema to the underlying American concept of equal treatment under the law.  Last year, when a federal crime bill was under consideration which would have expanded the federal death penalty to an additional fifty-plus crimes, including the murder of various federal officers hitherto not protected by that \\\"aura of deterrence,\\\" critics pointed out the absurdity of having laws which made the death penalty available for the murder of a federal postal inspector but not for ther murder of a civilian teacher, when the latter [arguably] provided a much more valueable service and therefore would be the greater loss to society. This was an emotionally compelling argument, but even the proponents of that viewpoint appeared to tacitly assume that the state should judge some lives as being more valuable than others on the basis of their \\\"contribution to society.\\\"  I view that doctrine as being both (a) personally repugnant and (b) repugnant to the Equal Protection clause of the 14th Amendment.  Accordingly, I believe that there should be no laws which give any profession-based class of people special protection (via the mechanism of supplying stronger statutory deterrence of crimes against members of that class), not even police officers, federal officers or high-ranking members of the Executive Branch of the federal government.\",\"[ Article crossposted from misc.forsale.computers.pc-clone ] [ Author was Mark Wilson ] [ Posted on Fri, 16 Apr 1993 13:18:42 GMT ]  UPDATE (\\\"for sale\\\" items): (All plus shipping)  1.

However, although baseball  has adjusted to the presence of black players, many Hispanic  players still labor under the stereotype of being \\\"fireballs,  hot blooded, flashy\\\".  The report also emphasised that despite  the rantings (my word) of Jessie Jackson about baseballs  discrimination against black players in its upper echelons,  baseball has actually done much better by black players than  Hispanic players.   Another interesting point was the language barrier problem.  The  reporter elaborated on an interview with Ruben Sierra which he  gave in Spanish to a Spanish speaking newspaper reporter with  the fact that there are maybe 2 major baseball writers that  speak Spanish, despite the fact that Spanish is one of (if not  the) easiest languages to learn, so easy that the author Cormac  McCarthy learned Spanish at age 50 in order to research his  book, _All The Pretty Horses_.  Yet, few MLB organizations  employ Spanish speaking personel, one of the exceptions being  the Oakland A's.   Another point:   Nearly 90% of Latin American players have some African blood.  Yet, most report that they'd never really felt black until  playing ball in the US.      Ironically enough, it is the early presence of Latin American  baseball players in the Major Leagues that support the idea that  baseball was integrated before the arrival of Jackie Robinson,  as many \\\"light black\\\" or \\\"brown\\\", Latin Americans were  incorporated into baseball.    /S\",\"Okay, I'm trying to install NCSA telnet on a couple (okay, a whole bunch) of machines.

Derek  -----------------------------------------------------------\",\" So in other words, if Roussel shuts out the Sharks and Soderstrom shuts out the Penguins, that's immaterial because it was the coaches decision? Come on, Joe, think about what you're saying! Who they played is VERY significant. Why they played them is what's irrelevent. A low GAA against good teams is better than a low GAA against bad teams in the context of comparing two goaltenders. A low GAA is better then a higher GAA. A low GAA against good teams is much, much better than a higher GAA against bad teams in the context of comparing two goaltenders.   YES IT DOES! Absolutely. **In the context of comparing two goaltenders**. Of course, at the end of the season 2 points is 2 points no matter how you get them. And on the score sheets shutouts are shutouts. But if you're a coach deciding between two goalies, or a GM looking to make a trade, you have got to look deeper than the stat sheets. I didn't see the second Toronto game, but the first one was a defensive masterpiece. There was nothing in that game to judge Tommy Soderstrom on because he wasn't tested. The same for Roussel in the Ranger game. Two real scoring chances, one he made a great play, the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player. If you were judging Roussel on that game alone, you have very little to go by.  But if you were to look at the 0-0 tie against the Habs, you saw a goalie stand on his head to get that shutout. THAT was a #1 goalie in action. Roussel doesn't have a game like that in him.   Don't be so sure of that. FLYERS management never says bad thing about Roussel, but they don't say too much on the good side either. I've seen at least two interviews where every time Farwell was asked how happy he was to have two good goaltenders, it was Tommy this, Tommy that, and oh, yeah, Dom has played well too.   FLYERS in the NHL Hall of Fame. Kinda dull, really. They handed out a team picture to everybody who walked in from Pizza Hut, but it was the same picture they sold in the programs in mid-season. Had names like Benning, Kasper...   Mostly random seat locations, some were given out by having certain autographs on the team photos. I don't like that method since I've seen guards help out people get things like Lindros pictures, surely if they got their hands on an autographed picture they'd hold 'em for their buddies.\",\"  Not necessarily, especially if the rapist is known as such.

But I couldn't resist. A personal weakness of mine. Jerkius Kneeus. Tragically incurable.   Not so; I can prove that the existance of God is disputable by showing that people dispute it; This is easy: I dispute that God exists. Simple.  I missed your \\\"Traditional Proofs\\\" treatise, but the proofs I remember from the Summa Theologic (the 5 ways I think it was) were rather poor stuff. The Ontological argument is about a billion times better, imho.  I would think you'd want non-traditional proofs, considering the general failure of the traditional proofs: at least the ones I know of. (I am thinking of the Ontological Argument, the Cosmological Argument and the Teleological argument. Those are the ones traditional enough to have funny names, anyway.)   This is the real question. So to discuss it, I'll assume God exists. Otherwise, there is no heavenly authority to babble about.   Please show this is the case. I am familiar with the First Cause argument, and I'll accept (for the sake of argument) that there is a First Cause, even though I find some of its premices questionable. The rest you'll have to show. This includes that the First Cause is God.   Got it. I deny that God is all good. So there.   This isn't self-consistent: if humans must renew the relationship, then God (incarnate or not) can't do it. Well, unless you think God is human. Granted, God made himself 'human', but this is nonetheless cheating: The intent of the statement is clearly that man has to fix the problem he caused. God fixing it- even by indirect means- contradicts this.   Why?  Also, why assume said claim is true anyway?  If *I* claim to be Truth, are you bound by reason to follow me?   :)  Undoubtably. Do you mean to imply we should all obey the commands of the Marines without question? You seem to imply this about God, and that the Marines are similar in this respect.. If this is not what you are trying to say, they please explain what it is you are saying, as I have missed it.   Why? Why not question it? Even if it *is* truth, we cannot know this certainly, so why is it so irrational to question? Perhaps we will thus discover that we were wrong.  You assert that God is Truth and we can't question Truth. But I assert that God is not Truth and anyway we can question Truth. How is it my assertion is less good than yours?   Oh?  I hereby deny 1+1=2.  I hope you'll agree 1+1=2 is the truth.  Granted, I look pretty damn silly saying something like that, but I needed something we'd both agree was clearly true.  Now, you'll notice no stormtroopers have marched in to drag me off to the gulag. No heaven lighting bolts either. No mysterious net outages. I seem to be permited to say such things, absurd or not.   They are certainly not true. At least, the ones Newton derived are not true, and are indeed wildly inaccurate at high speeds or small distances. We do not have a set of Laws of Physics that always works in all cases. If we did, Physics would be over already.  Science is all about Questioning this sort of truth. If we didn't, we'd still follow Aristotle. I'd generalize this a little more: If you want to learn anything new, you MUST question the things you Know (tm). Because you can always be wrong.   Even presupposing that Truth may not be Denied, and may not be Questioned, and that God is Truth, it only follows that God may not be Denied or Questioned. NOT that he must be obeyed!  We could unquestioningly DISobey him. How annoying of us. But you have not connected denial with disobedience.  ---    - Dan \\\"No Nickname\\\" Johnson And God said \\\"Jeeze, this is dull\\\"... and it *WAS* dull.

Why do atheists spend so much time paying attention to the bible, anyway?  Face it, there are better things to do with your life!

Heck, the Native Americans have signifigantly more interesting myths.  Also, what about the Egyptians.  I think we pay so much attention to Christianity because we accept it as a _religion_ and not a mythology, which I find more accurate.   I try to be tolerant.

About hard drive companies: the original 160 meg drive that was bad (bad sector or something) was an IBM.  The new one is a Quantum.  Is the LCIII supposed to be shipped with IBMs?  Is there a quality difference?  Apparently! :)  Second, about hard drive position.  I've put the LCIII on its side and the new 160 HD has had no problems at all.  I've even switched back and forth between horizontal and vertical and there are no problems.

Smith came out from behind his own net and fired a breakout pass that hit Fuhr in the back of the leg. Fuhr was backing up at the time and never saw what happened. The puck went straight off Fuhr's leg and into the net. Fuhr never had a chance. There was no play back to the goaltender, in fact Perry Berezan of Calgary had just dumped it in and Smith was retrieving it.   It was unfortunate that it happened; Smith is a nice guy and was only a rookie at the time, and on his birthday too. But all the blame lies with him. Starting in pee-wee coaches tell players never to make a cross-ice pass in front of  their own net. Too much chance of having it intercepted, or hitting the  goaltender, or whatever.  And to the people who say that Smith cost the Oilers the series, I can only say that he certainly didn't cause the team to lose the other three games. There was no reason for a powerhouse team like Edmonton to be tied late in the third period of the 7th game of the second round.

I have a IIsi that came with a Quantum 80 meg drive. When I ran into space problems, I slapped in another 40 meg quantum that I had sitting on a shelf. Here is what I did.   First off, I was concerned about space. Since both drives are Quantum quarter height drives, I finally decided that the logical place for them was stacked one upon the other. Fine, they fit snugly. (I have not had a problem with heat yet, and these drives have been running together for over two months.  The next problem was connecting the drive. If you have a spare internal hard disk power cable as I did, then half of your troubles are over. just splice in the extra cable so that you get one square motherboard connector and two hard disk power connectors. If you don't have a spare cable, you will have to buy the wires and connectors which can be found in any good electronics store for about $10. I would suggest properly soldering/heatshrinking the connections to reduce the possibility of shorts or bad connections.  Next, you need a ribbon cable connection. Again, I had a spare hard disk ribbon cable, and I wanted to be careful in case this didn't word so what I did was purchase a crimp on 50 pin cable connector that gave me another male connector in the middle of my spare cable. The part cost $10 again, and is easily attached with any good wood vice. The theory behind using a crimp on connector is that if this doesn't work, my original cable is not damaged, and I can go back to the original setup.  Having done all that, I couldn't be bothered to check the dev notes for power consumption so I plugged it in and it works like a charm to this day.   In a mac II, everything should work the same. Be careful with the ID's of the drive, and ensure that the terminating resistors on both drives are intact. I did not try this without the terminating resistors but it seemed logical that if I am splitting the SCSI chain, that the signal should be terminated at all the ends.  Let me know if you have any more questions.\",\" Oh great. Wonderful news. Nobody can listen in--except the feds.

One might find oneself, as I did in late 1986, anticipating expenses in the near term that require selling off holdings.  Given the choice between waiting a few weeks (and taking an extra tax hit) or selling in December with preferential tax treatment, only a fool would choose the former.  2) The fact that Brett can now construct _post hoc_ calculations of what would have been more beneficial to investors is in many respects beside the point.  There was plenty of _Money_-style advice given to unsophisticated investors in late 1986 to \\\"sell now and save on taxes.\\\"  In case anyone missed it, there was no shortage of similar advice late last year (in the NYTimes, e.g.), even though that advice was based not on the foregone conclusion of enacted law (as in 1986), but merely on the *assumption* that Clinton would raise tax rates (without capping CG taxes, contrary to the current proposal).  It's nice to think that investors always behave in their optimal economic interest.  Like assuming weightless ropes and frictionless pulleys, though, this sort of thinking often fails to describe accurately what happens in the real world.  \",\"   Not with a hub cap but one of those \\\"Lumber yard delivery trucks\\\" made life interesting when he hit a 'dip' in the road and several sheets of sheetrock and a dozen 5 gallon cans of spackle came off at 70 mph.

Oak Park also has an illegal handgun ban as well, but does allow those with a \\\"collectors FFL\\\" to possess (\\\"collectible?\\\") handguns.   Probably a fine in practical terms.   It wouldn't impede your defense at all. There was an actual incident in Oak Park where a gas station owner engaged in a shootout with a handgun; the grand jury decided not to presecute. On the other hand, a black man used an illegally owned handgun in Oak Park to defend himself, and the Village tried to make an example out of him. An NRA Director who lived there made a stink about this, and it was decided not to charge the guy. Of course, pissing off anti-gun police thugs has it's own drawbacks, like when the Oak Park Police Chief came to his house, and told him: \\\"this is stepping over the line; this could get dangerous for you.\\\" Whereupon the few black Oak Park police officers watched over his house to ensure that the white anti-gun police chief and his anti-gun cronies wouldn't f*ck with him, his home or family.

I have several friends at the Moscow Aviation Institute who have asked me to post this announcement.  (I have done some editing, but the contents is unchanged from the original announcement.)   For those of you not familiar with the Moscow Aviation Institute, it is the leading Russian school of higher education dedicated to the training of aircraft and spacecraft designers.  It specializes in airframe design, powerplant design, control systems, and power systems. Virtually all of the major former Soviet airframe designers (Tupolev, Su, Iluchine, Migoyan, etc.) were schooled at MAI.  I had the opportunity to tour the two museums that are maintained at MAI.  The aircraft include Mig23, Su 27, Yak 38, the cockpit of an F-111(!), among others.  It was a fascinating and eye opening experience, expecially given the fact that the museum was, until a year or so ago, closed to virtually everyone.  I also had the opportunity to see some of the experiments being conducted with plasma drive engines for future space craft use.  If you have any questions about the Institute, or the program, I would be glad to try and answer them.  The institute, and most of it's faculty have e-mail addresses.  However, it takes about a day or so for the receiver to get the message.  They are still a bit antiquated - but they are rapidly changing!

I hope somebody out here can help me.  I am currently working on a project where I am trying to communicate from an IBM 386 with Phoenix BIOS, using C++, to a board that I made with an Intel 8085 CPU with UART chip.  The board works fine with the TRANSMIT command and  Terminal Emulation mode of Kermit, but there seems to be something wrong with the initialization or protocol used when I try C++.  I need to access the unit I built using C, because I have a sizable chunk of C code that I will be using to perform calculations and operations that will be very difficult to code in assembly language for the 8085.  I have included the assembly code that I am running and the C++ code that I am trying to use.  If anyone can show me something that I am doing blatantly incorrectly or that I am missing because of my lack of knowledge about RS-232 serial communications, please e-mail me. I wrote the assembly language to wait for a character to be received and then to check it against the 0x20 character, if a 0x20 is received,  the LEDs will indicate this.  Two C++ programs that I have written do nothing, but set up COM port 2 and send the 0x20 character.  One uses the bioscom() function in bios.h the other uses the software interrupt int86() function in dos.h.

But there would be no _net_ _positive_ effect. You also have to  consider the negative side: Law abiding citizens, armed with  fireamrs (pistols for the most part), prevent between 80,000 (National Crime Survey) and 1,000,000 (Dr. Kleck) crimes each year. (Those are the extremes. Most studies find the number to be 500,000 to 600,000.) About 1% of those crimes are homicides, so private ownership of firearms _saves_ approximately 5,000 lives each year. There are roughly 12,000 criminal homicides and fatal accidents involving guns each year. For there to  be any net benefit, you would have to show that gun control measures would disarm over 40% of the criminals currently using guns. That would be very hard to do: According the the federal BATF, only 8% of criminals buy their guns over the counter. Since gun control laws, by their very nature, only effect legal sales, such a law would remove all the benefits of armed, law-abiding citizens while having only a minimal effect on armed criminals (who, by and large, get their guns illegally.)  That doesn't sound like a net benefit to me.     Since most were with licensed weapons, I assume you are not supporting \\\"reasonable\\\" laws (i.e. waiting periods, background checks, licenses, etc...). Since only a complete ban would  alter the statistic you refer to, I assume that's what you are supporting.  By the way, 1135 people dies in 1986 from falling down stairs. 250 accidental handgun deaths isn't significant next to  other household accidents.   1080 children under the age of 10 died by drowning, 69 from  drinking poisonous household chemicals (like Drano), 139 from falls. If the real goal is to reduce the tragic, accidental deaths of children, wouldn't a ban on drain cleaners be a  better palce to start? (Or, perhaps, restricting ownership to professionals like plumbers?)   While you might call it \\\"emphasis\\\", refering to completely two statistics in the same sentence _implies_ a comparison. If it isn't valid, and you put the numbers together to convince people you are right, the kindest thing I could call it is propaganda.\",\"Reported yesterday in the Washington Post (Kathy Sawyer, writer):  The article plays down the Russian role in US space.  Gibbons (science advisor to Clinton) sent Goldin a letter indicating NASA should not limit redesign options to those compatible with Mir orbit.  The White House thinks expectations for Russian cooperation have been raised too high.  The article reports that some think the spending and schedule limits for space station are so stringent that the redesign is nearly impossible.  That's why some think Goldin has begun looking at  Russian hardware.  Goldin states NASA will present all options to the administration  which will then have decision making power.

Their cheer quickly turned into a roar, and finally, the sellout crowd of 17,816 rose as one to rock the old barn at 5700 Oakland Avenue in a salute to the playoff-bound Blues.  The scoreboard had just flashed the news from Detroit -- Red Wings 5, Stars 3. With the North Stars' loss, the Blues officially clinched fourth place and the final playoff spot in the Norris Division. Good thing, because the Blues quit playing.  They held a 5-1 lead over Tampa Bay when the Detroit-Minnesota final appeared with 3 minutes 52 remaining in the second period. They promptly went to sleep and barely held on for a 6-5 victory that nearly slipped away at the buzzer. Tampa's Bob Beers tipped in a pass from Shawn Chambers, but officiating supervisor John D'Amico and video goal judge Rich Schweigler ruled that the shot had gone into the net after time had expired.  ``I'm glad I didn't see it go in at the end,\\\" Blues coach Bob Berry said.  If the goal had counted, he'd have been more upset than he was by the Blues' disappearance in the final 24 minutes. Holding on for the victory and making the playoffs tempered Berry's anger.  ``It wasn't pretty at the end,\\\" he said. ``We played 36, 37 great minutes, as good as we played all year. It slipped away at the end. It shouldn't have, but it did.\\\"  Still, the Blues won, prompting another ovation from the crowd at game's end. Despite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil this season, the Blues still made the playoffs. They'll meet the Chicago Blackhawks in a best-of-seven Norris Division semifinal, beginning at noon Sunday at Chicago Stadium.  The Blues finished the regular-season with a record of 37-36-11 for 85 points, their fourth consecutive plus-.500 season. Minnesota finished three points behind in fifth place, with a record of 36-38- 10 for 82 points. Tampa Bay, which played spoiler last week by tying the Blues 2-2 at Tampa, ended its first season with a record of 23-54-7 for 53 points.  The poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyous Blues locker room. Instead, the mood was one of relief and some disappointment.  ``It's a shame we let down,\\\" said Kevin Miller, one of three Blues to score two goals. Brendan Shanahan and Bob Bassen were the others. ``There was no need for a letdown. If we'd have kept working, it would have ended 6-2 and everyone would be happy.\\\"  Instead, a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs. ``We won, and that's all that matters,\\\" said Brett Hull, scoreless and minus-3 for the night. ``Once we got up 4-0, it was really tough to play.\\\"  Some players didn't have a problem.  ``Just because the score was announced, our line didn't quit,\\\" said Rich Sutter, who played with Bassen and Miller. ``We still had a game to play. You can't allow five goals like we did, that's not right.  ``It was disappointing to see what was going on.\\\"  Bassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the Blues' effort. Somehow, he missed the announcement of Minnesota's loss.  ``I didn't know it was final,\\\" he said. ``I was kind of looking around on the bench. I didn't realize it was a final for some reason. We're in the playoffs, and that's great, but it's a little disappointing to play like we did at the end.\\\"  The letdown was precisely the reason that Berry had instructed the scoreboard operators to keep the Minnesota-Detroit score off of the board. The score showed 0-0 until it first popped up with Detroit leading 4-2 in the third period. The Blues already led 4-0 at the time.  ``I told them I didn't want to see the score, I didn't want to know the score,\\\" Berry said. ``I felt we had to win the game, and that's the approach we took.\\\"  If Minnesota took a lead, Berry feared, the pressure of having to win might bother the Blues. If Detroit led, he worried, the Blues might quit.  Until the announcement, the Blues played splendidly. Shanahan got the crowd going at 10:44 of the first period, scoring his 50th of the season. Then, Miller and Bassen took charge late in the period.  With the teams playing four on four, Miller broke in on left wing, deked defenseman Roman Hamrlik and beat former Blues goalie Pat Jablonski with the rebound of his own shot with 21.6 seconds remaining in the period.  Then, just 10.5 seconds later, Bassen rifled a long slap shot past Jablonski after defenseman Rick Zombo intercepted a Tampa pass in the neutral zone.  Bassen made it 4-0 just 14 seconds into the second period, scoring on the  rebound of Bret Hedican's shot. The goal gave him his first two-goal game of the season and reminded him of a special friend.  Last year, Bassen befriended young Oliver Mulvihill, who died of a rare form of cancer at age 6 on Feb. 23.  ``I was thinking of my buddy Oliver,\\\" Bassen said. ``He's in heaven now, and I know he was watching. I know he's happy.\\\"  Miller increased the Blues lead to 5-0 on a break-away goal set up by Zombo at 11:09. Then, Steve Maltais broke Curtis Joseph's shutout just 18 seconds later, making it 5-1.  Less than a minute after the North Stars' final was announced, Tim Bergland scored and cut the lead to 5-2. But Shanahan scored his 51st, converting a pass from Nelson Emerson with 21.3 seconds remaining in the  second period.  Then, it was all Lightning. Adam Creighton scored 40 seconds into the third period, prompting Berry to rest the overworked Joseph. Guy Hebert allowed goals to Shawn Chambers and Danton Cole in a span of 1:21 midway through the third period.  The goals by Chambers and Cole made Shanahan's second goal stand up as the winner. ``We were in there,\\\" Shanahan said. ``The game was over. We were in.\\\"\",\" We're probably stuck, as Mike Burger pointed out that the baseball deal was made far in advance of the NHL contract.  WABC did the same thing; they were thankful that the Devils were wiped out by 9:30, because they had to switch over to Yankees baseball.  The proof of  the reasons for this is left to the reader ...  It's too bad, but I wonder if ESPN is stuck with other US local team coverage for their alternate games?  We got NESN's coverage of the Bruins-Sabres with the Boston homers ... they were awful!!!  I've read that Derek Sanderson is the colour analyst ... I wonder if he spent his early years after hockey as an intern at PRAVDA before landing this job?  *Everything* had to be twisted into something good to say about the Bruin(s) involved ... not even Bill Wirtz's shills on SC Chicago (Pat Foley, Dale Tallon) were this bad.  And just to be fair, SC used to take their feed from ESN (Empire Sports Network), the Sabre homers and they were horrible too ... but they were spacy.  From the CNN highlights, I hear Chris Cuthbert's voice from the CBC coverage of the Habs-Nords series.  Too bad that we couldn't get it on ESPN, with all due respect to the Sabres and the Bruins.  Mike Emrick is substituting on the Devils SCNY team for Gary Thorne. Mike was the original Devils TV play-by-play announcer, by the way.  gld\",\" There was an interesting column on the editorial page of the Dallas Morning News on Saturday by Walter Williams, who I believe is a professor at Georgetown (I wonder if he knows of Dorothy \\\"you're not in Kansas anymore\\\" Denning).  The article was titled \\\"Government slowly eroding our liberties\\\", and in it he tells a story attributed to the late Leonard Read who          explained that if you wanted to take liberty away from         Americans, you had to know how to cook a frog.  Mr. Read         said you can't cook a frog by boiling a pot of water and         then throwing the frog in.  His reflexes are so quick that         as soon as his feet touch the water, he will leap away.         You must put the frog in a pot of cold water and heat it         up bit by bit.  By the time the frog realizes he's being         cooked, it is too late.  It is the same with Americans.         If anyone tried to take our freedoms all at once, we         would naturally rebel and suppress the tyrant.  But as         with successful frog cooking, our liberties can be taken         a little bit at a time.  The last line of the article says, \\\"It's not too late for us, but the water is getting pretty warm.\\\"  I'd have toagree that it's warm and the Clipper is keeping the temperature on an upward course.

The amounts of methanol formed from the ingestion of aspartame-containing foods are completely in the metabolic noise, since you're forming equally minute amounts of methanol from other components of food all the time.  In studies involving administration of high doses of the additive, blood methanol levels were undetectable. Methanol is a poison only in quantities seen in human poisonings, say 5ml and above.  This is a consequence of its oxidation to formaldehyde and formic acid, two quite reactive compounds which at high enough levels can damage tissues like the retina and kidney, because at such high doses the body's detoxification system is overwhelmed.  Interestingly, one treatment for early methanol poisoning is to get the person drunk on ethyl alcohol--vodka or an equivalent.  That's because ethanol is metabolized preferentially over methanol by the enzymes in the liver. If the methanol stays as methanol and isn't metabolized to formaldehyde, it is actually relatively non-toxic. \",\" He is probably referring to the DOS version.. the dos versions is up to like version 6 i think.

Biblical teaching expects us to celebrate the resurrection of Christ not once a year but every time someone is baptized.  Col. 2:12-Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead.\\\"  Rom. 6:4-Therefore we are buried with him in baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.\\\" Those really want to celebrate the resurrection should by faith walk in newness of life after baptism.  It is not necessary to celebrate a pagan goddess in the process.  Paul answered your question in Romans 9.  In v. 4 he stated that the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the service of God, and the promises were given to the Israelites.  It is a package deal.  He goes on to identify those who are true Israelites.  Vs 6-8 makes it plain that the true Israelites are not those who are born that way but those who accept the promise of God.  Paul continued to emphasize that he was an Israelite in 2 Cor. 11:22, then in Gal 3:29 he says that all those who belong to Christ are Abraham's seed, and heirs to all the promises given to the Israelites.  The promises come with the law.  It is all or nothing.  Why is it that you only want to discard one part of the law?  Certainly you would want your husband to be faithful to you.  Or do you believe that adultery is no longer forbidden?  Same law.  BTW  please give a reference for your statement that the Gentiles are only required to observe the basis commandmants.  Could you list those please.

James 1:19 \\\"My dear brothers, take note of this:  Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry,\\\"\",\"Two LH Research SM11-1 power supplies (SM10 series).  1000W, 5V, 200A (currently wired for 115VAC)  Control lines: +/- sense, on/off, pwr.fail, high/low margin, and current monitor.

I have an ATI ultra + w/2Meg which I have tried in each of the video modes, I have excluded the region of video memory from A000-C800 segments from the use of emm386, have tried adjusting the swap partion from large to nonexistant (to prevent swapping) and I have REM'd ALL TSR's and utilities in config.syus and autoexec, and even tried using the default program manager, disabling my HP dashboard.  even with a minimal system, no swap, no smartdrv, no TSR's, no windows utilities and exclusion of video regions it still locks up completely (no mouse control, no response to anything except 3finger salute, and even that does not stop by the standard windows screen, but simply does a full reset immediately).  Just about out of ideas, anyone out there have any????  Thanks tom branham branham@binah.cc.brandeis.edu \",\" Jim, please, that's a lame explanation of the trinity that Jesus provides above.

 Not to pick on Mr. May in particular, of course, but isn't this kind of the domino theory?

Any suggestions?\",\" While I don't read normally read this group, I was looking for Valentine radar information (sigh, maybe in the FAQ) and came across your posting..  I bought a '93 Probe GT with the PEP 263A last July (now at 9500 miles) after debating over the Sentra SE-R/NX2000, MX6, MR-2, Stealth, Prelude,  and Celica.  Check this month's Consumer Reports for previous Probe records.    My criteria: a \\\"fun\\\" car with ABS, airbag, over 130hp, and less than $25K. I thought about a turbo, but checking with insurance people ruled that out. The Tri-Star cars (Eclipse/Talon/etc) were out since they don't have an air bag. Ditto for the Mustang(also no ABS). The SE-R/NX2000/M20 fell into the pocket-rocket category.  A good used car buy. The MX-6 was almost there but rolled more than I liked.   I didn't like the Prelude dash/instrumentation at all.  Too weird for me. The MR2 has a much smaller non-passenger space than I needed, so out that went. The Celica was \\\"ok\\\" but underpowered when loaded with options (and somewhat overpriced too) in non-turbo form. I never considered the 240SX since it didn't have an airbag.  I did look at it for its RWD virtues but that's it.  The Corolla never entered my mind. I should have looked at the Mitsubishi VR4/Dodge Stealth more. Since my list was exhausted, I bought the Probe.  :-)  The car design is different than earlier years, so it's too early to see its reliability so far.  For what it's worth, my comments:  My dislikes: Shutting door with windows up from inside rarely makes good wind seal. Headlights have \\\"stuck\\\" up a few times (weather?) air conditioning broke ~4000 miles (pressure cycling switch) condensation around rear washer fluid container doesn't drain completely. crammed engine; little hope for do-it-yourselfers (typical) parts somewhat more expensive than normal Ford parts underside plastic doesn't like sharp driveways and speedbumps (typical). assembly gripes: tape on radiator, screw fell out of dash, seat seams not  stitched properly.  Hopefully just a fluke. Ford only gives 1 key with the car.  C'mon Ford, spend an extra few pennies! Rear hatch has no padding on corners when up.  I'm waiting for the day when I bash my head on the corner. horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center (personal preference) Tires fling dirt/mud onto side of car   My Likes: engine (design/valves/sounds/smoothness/power/mileage/torque) -- definitely #1 handling (very good for FWD; understeer only at limits) transmission (the 5 speed is a must) usable instrumentation (lovely readable analog everywhere) Very little torque steer at full power (much better than the '90 SHO I drive) stability at 100+mph (high gearing though) low cowl (good visibility in front) Heated outside mirrors (nice in fog, never tested in freezing weather) ABS/Air bag (see above) rear seats fold down (I have few rear seat passengers so a trunk not important) No shake/rattle noises when going over bumps/potholes (still!) Tires: 225/55VR16 Goodyear Eagles (70% left; hoping for 30K :-)  As you can see, I'm primarily interested in the engine.  While it doesn't have the uummmph of a big-liter car or the turbo rush, the big selling point for me was the all-aluminum 24 value 2.5 liter engine.    The overall car is a good buy for the money.  That market segment hasn't changed much since July (Prelude VTEC, Honda Del Sol??).  I drive it to and from work each day on relatively smooth roads, and most noticable thing is that the Probe's suspension doesn't like potholes.  When you test drive one, find a  potholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is tolerable. If you have 3+ passengers, by all means bring them along too.  They'll find that they have no room in the back and you'll find that the car rides differently (if that's \\\"better\\\" is up to you).  Also, there's a lot of glass around you which I wasn't expecting; the temperature inside the car gets pretty hot in the summer.  My back seat passengers (now very few) complain about the lack of ventilation; you may want to consider that when combined with the heat.  I've heard that the exhaust system has trouble, but mine works fine. Leather and the keyless entry system weren't available when I got the car so I can't comment on them (I got the car before it was officially announced).   I prefer cloth to leather anyway.    I wouldn't want this car in the snow:  The suspension is too rough for the inevitable surprise potholes, tires aren't meant for snow, and the seats assume that you're not wearing lots of thick clothing.  Rain is much better:  water  generally beads off the windshield at freeway speed, the windshield wiper controls are easy and understandable, and I barely hydroplaned once with the Eagles (and I was really trying).   There is also a definite lack of cup holder/small storage places.  The GT has map holders below the speakers in the door, but they're rigid plastic that could fit two cassettes or CD's max.  The center console/storage bin/arm rest has *1* cup holder and the back of the front seats have a cloth \\\"pouch\\\" but that's it.  No change holders.  Quite a let-down from the SHO. And the Probe is definitely not a people-mover car or an econo-box car!  Lastly, don't store wet car covers in the back.  The foam will soak the  water up and the result will *not* smell pleasant :-(.  Nathan nathan@sco.com   \",\": >Is there an ftp site where I can get the MS speaker sound driver?

These are indeed provocative questions but they are asked time and again by people around me.  1.      Is it true that many arab countries don't recognize Israeli nationality ?  That people with Israeli stamps on their passports can't enter arabic countries?  2.      Is it true that arabic countries such as Jordan and Syria have undefined borders and that arab governments from 1948 until today have refused to state where the ultimate borders of their states should be?  3.      Is it true that arab countires refused to sign the Chemical weapon convention treaty in Paris in 1993?  4.      Is it true that in arab prisons there are a number of individuals which were tried in secret and for which their identities, the date of their trial and their imprisonment are state secrets ?  4a. Is it true that some arab countries, like Syria, harbor Nazi war criminals, and refuse to extradite them?  4b. Is it true that some arab countries, like Saudi Arabia, prohibit women from driving cars?  5.      Is it true that Jews who reside in the Muslim countries are subject to different laws than Muslims?  6.

Also the Mets (my other least  favorite team) loss to the Rockies made this this a great day and a  great start to the weekend as the Cardinals are on the ESPN tonight.  Big Lee Smith is having a great start and the Cardinals seem to be hitting in the clutch even though they have had a few games with lots of hits and not many runs.  Hopefully with the coaches stress on situational hitting in spring training, the runners LOB will be lower this year (probably due to the high strikeout numbers by Jose and Lankford and Zeile's off year).  I don't know why all the fuss about the Fillies.  The media and all the  Filly fans on r.s.b forget who is right behind them in the standings.   Give the Wild Thing a week or two before he starts blowing some games  and we'll see who is in first then.  I believe the Cardinal pitching  staff is more complete than the Filly staff and that will make the difference.  On a side note, a few years ago (5-6), a comment was made by some  baseball player or manager about the Dodger defense.  He was asked  where to hit the ball against the Dodgers and he replied \\\"Fair.\\\"  I  remember it being in the \\\"They Said It\\\" section of Sports Illustrated.

I've weathered attempted dog attacks before using the approved method: Slow down to screw up dog's triangulation of target, then take off and laugh at the dog, now far behind you. This time, it didn't work because I didn't have time. Riding up the hill leading to my house, I encountered a liver-and-white Springer Spaniel (no relation to the Springer Softail, or the Springer Spagthorpe, a close relation to the Spagthorpe Viking). Actually, the dog encountered me with intent to harm.  But I digress: I was riding near the (unpainted) centerline of the roughly 30-foot wide road, doing between forty and sixty clicks (30 mph for the velocity-impaired). The dog shot at me from behind bushes on the left side of the road at an impossibly high speed. I later learned he had been accelerating from the front porch, about thirty feet away, heading down the very gently sloped approach to the side of the road. I saw the dog, and before you could say SIPDE, he was on me. Boom! I took the dog in the left leg, and from the marks on the bike my leg was driven up the side of the bike with considerable force, making permanent marks on the plastic parts of the bike, and cracking one panel. I think I saw the dog spin around when I looked back, but my memory of this moment is hazy.  I next turned around, and picked the most likely looking house. The apologetic woman explained that the dog was not seriously hurt (cut mouth) and hoped I was not hurt either. I could feel the pain in my shin, and expected a cool purple welt to form soon. Sadly, it has not. So I'm left with a tender shin, and no cool battle scars!  Interestingly, the one thing that never happened was that the bike never moved off course. The not inconsiderable impact did not push the bike off course, nor did it cause me to put the bike out of control from some gut reaction to the sudden impact. Delayed pain may have helped me here, as I didn't feel a sudden sharp pain that I can remember.  What worries me about the accident is this: I don't think I could have prevented it except by traveling much slower than I was. This is not necessarily an unreasonable suggestion for a residential area, but I was riding around the speed limit. I worry about what would have happened if it had been a car instead of a dog, but I console myself with the thought that it would take a truly insane BDI cager to whip out of a blind driveway at 15-30 mph. For that matter, how many driveways are long enough for a car to hit 30 mph by the end?  I eagerly await comment.

I think it's just 12 games into the season myself, so I'm going to wait a bit before calling names.   I expect that Dave Otto will be a really bad pitcher, and I have no idea why Simmons ever wanted him.  On the other hand, I expect him to release Otto if he doesn't turn things around pretty fast.  (BTW, Otto's game score for that 0 IP stinker was only 22, which points out a problem with the method since Otto's performance was infinitely bad, and excruciatingly prolonged.)   I think Merced's rookie year was a bit flukey, but aren't you willing to give him some more at bats (and Tomlin a few more starts) before acting so gloomy?   No he didn't.  Walk is a time bomb.  He has no stuff whatsoever, and when the league finally realizes this, it won't be pretty at all.   Don't be so fast.  Doughty is the guy who signed Steve Buechele, which was a move that threatened to bury Kevin Young in the minors. Meanwhile, I'm not sure whether Doughty or Simmons signed Martin as a six-year free agent before the 1992 season.   Twice through the rotation, and you've given up?  Yikes.   But so has his age, at least in baseball terms.  The useful half-life of a 34- year-old injury-prone catcher can't be much longer than a year.   But he wanted to be a Dodger, and felt he had something to prove after his disastrous 1992.  I don't think there was any chance for the Bucs to sign him.   He certainly wasn't last year.   Hey, that's the \\\"Skates Smith\\\" package deal.  Anybody who acquires Lonnie for his defense or base-running (particularly at this stage) is a real weirdo.   If that's the goal of the team ownership, than I don't see why Sauer gets a zero for making his boss happy.  I don't know what he has or hasn't said about revenue sharing, so I can't comment there.   It's annoying, but since Leyland seems to have been pushing for them to retain Jeff King, it was probably unavoidable.  Meanwhile, I think bigger accomplishments of Simmons' tenure were getting some value for John Smiley, not trading real prospects for veterans down the stretch last year, drafting well in 1992, letting the rookies show something in 1993.  Foley, Smith, and Candelaria were acquired to be replacement parts, which means that even if fail it hasn't done serious damage to the Bucs' future.   Does this mean that the Bucs lost the initial arbitration case?  I never heard the outcome of this.  When will the final verdict be in on this?   I'm not sure who was the idiot in this case, so I don't know who to blame.  It might have been Doug Danforth, after all.  In fact, I *seriously* suspect it was Doug Danforth, who has shown his willingness to call the shots at exactly those moments when the gun is pointed at his feet.

On April 19, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer (MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.  2.  On April 19, a Command Detector Unit Signal-to-Noise Ratio (CDUSNR) test and a Radio Frequency Subsystem Automatic Gain Control (RFSAGC) test were performed using the LGA-1 (Low Gain Antenna #1) over DSS-63 (Madrid 70 meter antenna) and DSS-61 (Madrid 34 meter antenna), respectively.  Data analysis is in process.  These tests are periodically performed to provide detailed information relative to the telecom command hardware integrity.  3.  On April 19, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to 264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.  4.  On April 21, the first of two suppressed carrier/DSN (Deep Space Network) advanced receiver characterization tests was performed over DSS-14 (Goldstone 70 meter antenna).  The spacecraft modulation index was varied from 43 degrees to 90 degrees for a range of ground receiver bandwidth settings.  5.  The AC bus imbalance measurement has not exhibited significant change (greater than 25 DN) throughout this period but the DC bus imbalance measurement has.  The AC measurement reads 20 DN (4.5 volts).  The DC measurement has ranged from 43 DN (4.6 volts) to 138 DN (16.2 volts) and currently reads 138 DN (16.2 volts).  These measurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special anomaly team.  6.  The Spacecraft status as of April 22, 1993, is as follows:         a)  System Power Margin -  68 watts        b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin        c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner        d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 21 degrees            off-sun (lagging) and 5 degrees off-earth (leading)        e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1        f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within            acceptable range        g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range        h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,            EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS        i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within            acceptable range        j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours            Time To Initiation - 184 hours   TRAJECTORY       As of noon Thursday, April 22, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory status was as follows:   Distance from Earth         169,747,800 km (1.14 AU)  Distance from Sun           286,967,900 km (1.92 AU)  Heliocentric Speed          91,200 km per hour  Distance from Jupiter       532,735,900 km  Round Trip Light Time       18 minutes, 58 seconds   SPECIAL TOPIC\",\"As the subject suggests the Flames were not impressive this afternoon, dropping a 6-3 decision to the LA Kings. Most of the Flames neglected to show up, especially in their own zone, as the Kings hit at least five posts! The Flames best line was probably Skrudland-Paslawski-Berube (which tells how bad the Flames were). Gary Suter scored a great goal (in fact all three Flame goals were scored by D-men - Yawney and Dahlquist getting the others), but also made some bonehead plays. For the Kings, Pat Conacher was especially impressive.   The games was VERY chippy, as Dan Mirouelli lost control early and never recovered it; there were high-sticks, cross-checks, punches, hits from behind. Fleury got a game misconduct for rubbing out Warren Rychel from behind. Flames dominated the game physically, but failed to take advantage due to horrendous defensive lapses (I don't think Vernon can be blamed for any of the goals). Calgary went with 7 D-men, as Roger Johansson played LW; he looked lost IMHO - I hope King inserts Chris Lindbergh, Paul Kruse, or Sergei Makarov for Wednesday's game. Gretzky left the game in the 2nd period with a charley-horse; no idea how serious - he didn't return.

A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on      encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify      as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have      briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the      decisions related to this initiative.  Congress??  So we're playing politics before we talk to CPSR, academia, the public, internet users?  I`ve heard of top-down design, but top-down  democracy?? [Just whose state/district are the chip manufacturers in?]  Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological      solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be      willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more      powerful encryption devices?  A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be      considered during the broad policy review. [...bs about      the wonderfulness of the key escrow system...]       The Administration is not saying, \\\"since encryption      threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,      we will prohibit it outright\\\" (as some countries have      effectively done);   They'll just provide an easily-compromised version to JQ Public.                           nor is the U.S. saying that \\\"every      American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an      unbreakable commercial encryption product.\\\"    Maybe we need a CRA -- Cryptographic Rights Amendment.

According -> > to the Federalist Paper's, a well regulated militia has a well defined  -> > structure and follows nationally uniform regulations. ->  -> Perhaps you should actually READ the Federalist Papers!!  Perhaps you should, reread Federal 29 which deals exclusively with the \\\"well regulated malitia.\\\"  Here is what is says about its character:    To oblige the great body of the yeomanry, and of the other classes   of the citizens, to be under arms for the purpose of going through   military exercises and evolutions, as often as might be necessary to   acquire the degree of perfection which would entitle them to the   character of a well-regulated militia,   It also talks about the \\\"well regulated militia\\\" having a nationally uniform in structure and disipline.    I will note you did quote the end of this particular paragraph which states:       Little more can reasonably be aimed at, with  respect to the people at large, than to have them properly armed  and equipped; and in order to see that this be not neglected, it  will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of  a year.  But, do you knew how much organization is required to training a large group of poeple twice a year.  Just to try to get the same people every year, provide a basic training to new people so they can be integrated into the force, and find a suitable location, it  requires a continually standing committee of organizers.    Since a well regulate militia is nationally uniform in structure and disipline, and meet once or twice a year to train, how can you claim a \\\"well regulated militia\\\" is not well organized.  But I will concide  a \\\"well organized militia\\\" is not necessarily a \\\"well regulated militia.\\\"   Several people have stated that the \\\"well organized militia\\\" is what is defined under 10 USC 311, which states   The militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied   males at least 17 years of age and, except as provided in   section 313 of title 32, under 45 years of age who are,   or who have made a declaration of intention to become,   citizens of the United States and of female citizents of   the United States who are commissioned officers of the   National Guard.  This deos define the militia, but were is the adjective \\\"well regulated.\\\" 10 USC 311 does not define a \\\"well regualed militia\\\" in any way, shape,  or form.  It only defines who can become part of a well regulated militia The Federalist Papers CLEARLY define the \\\"well regualed militia\\\" as a proper SUBSET of the militia.  In the same paragraph quoted above, it talk above \\\"disciplining all the militia of the United States\\\" so they fit the \\\"character of a well-regulated militia.\\\"  This is what the paragraph states about the associated costs:   It would form an annual deduction from the productive labor   of the country, to an amount which, calculating upon the   present numbers of the people, would not fall far short   of the whole expense of the civil  establishments of all   the States. To attempt a thing which would abridge the   mass of labor and industry to so considerable an extent,  would be unwise: and the experiment, if made, could not   succeed, because it would not long be endured.   Another quote provide by Charles Scripter is: James Madison, Federalist Paper 41 (regarding the \\\"General Welfare\\\" clause):   \\\"Nothing is more natural nor common than first  to use a general phrase, and then to explain and qualify it by a  recital of particulars.\\\"  So the phrase \\\"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall  not be infringed\\\" must either qualify or explain the phrase \\\"a well  regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state.\\\"   The definition of \\\"explain\\\" as stated in \\\"The American Hertitage Dictionary of the Enlish Language\\\" The New College Edition, 1982 is:  1) To make plain or comprehensible; remove obscruity from;     elucidate: \\\"It was the economists who undertook to explain      this puzzle\\\"  2) To define; explicate; expound: He explained his plan.  3) To offer reasons for or a cause of; an answer for' justify:     explain an error The second phrase clearly does not \\\"explain\\\" the first, therefore the second phrase must \\\"qualify\\\" the first.  The definition given for \\\"qualify\\\" is:  1) To describe by enumerating the characteristics or qualities     of; characterize.  2) To make competent or suitable for office, position, or      task.  3) To give legal power to; make legally capable.  4) To modify, limit, or restrict, as giving exceptions.  5) To make less harsh or severe; moderate  6) Grammar: To modify the meaning of (a word or phrase) Since \\\"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed\\\" does not describe, modify or make less harsh anything and it has nothing to do with grammar or some sort of position or task. By process of elimination it must fall into definition #3.  And since #3 deals with legal power, the same thing the Constitution does, it must be the correct definition in this case.  Therefore, \\\"the right  of the people to keep and bear Arms\\\" gives legal power to the \\\"well  regualated militia\\\" and this legal power \\\"shall not be infringed\\\".    I thank you very much Mr Scripter, you have provided me with more  evidence that the Second Amendment only concerns itseft with the  people's right to form well regulate militia, and says very little  about the right of an untrained person to \\\"keep and bear\\\" a .50 caliber machine gun.  And since I, totally untrained in the use of any firearm (something I personly have meant to correct by going to a NRA gun safety course and joining a gun club), cannot legally buy such a machine gun, I conclude the courts and democraticly elected congress agree with me.  -> So now we know which category Mr. Rutledge is in; He means to destroy -> our Liberties and Rights.  I mean \\\"to destory our Liberties and Rights.\\\"  Is that why a participate in the discussion of exactly what \\\"our Libertues and Rights\\\" are?  I  force my version of \\\"our Liberties and Rights\\\" by begining statements of what \\\"our Liberties and Rights\\\" with \\\"All that the Second Amendment  clearly states to me.\\\"   Using expressions, such as \\\"states to me,\\\"  clearly mean I intend to force my views on others?  I don't think so.  So in effort not to force my views and not \\\"to destory our Liberties and Rights,\\\"  I state that nothing I have written, or will write, in the matter of \\\"Liberties and Rights\\\" is the final word.

Soderstrom: Absolutely. 4 shutouts in 39 games for a rookie without a lot of defense in front of him. Runnerups to Galley and Fedyk who are scoring a ton over their career best. But Galley thinks he's Paul Coffey (puts scoring ahead of defending) and Fedyk has tailed off big time.  Eklund: Was a big question mark this year and was coming off injuries. 42 points in 49 games is not bad at all, and recently he's been a huge factor in the wins they've gotten. Eklund has never had a point a game season in his career, his production is very typical for him. How does he qualify as a disappointment? If anything he's a surprise.  My choice would be Roussel if I went strictly by what was expected of players, but I never thought that he had what it takes to be a #1 goalie. My biggest disappointment is Bill Dineen.

Give a man a fishing rod, and he'll laze around fishing and never do anything.\\\"  With that in mind, I reprint (without permission, so sue me) relevant information posted some years ago on this very problem.  Note the early use of PostScript technology, predating many of this year's papers listed in the April 1st SIGGRAPH Program Announcement posted here a few days ago.  -- Eric   Intersection Between a Line and a Polygon (UNDECIDABLE??),  by Dave Baraff, Tom Duff   From: deb@charisma.graphics.cornell.edu  Newsgroups: comp.graphics  Keywords: P, NP, Jordan curve separation, Ursyhon Metrization Theorem  Organization: Program of Computer Graphics   I think that this is a very difficult problem.  To start with, lines and polygons are semi-algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of points.  Here are a few off-the-cuff ideas.  First, we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated.  Now, the Jordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into exactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions.  Thus, the line lies completely inside the polygon, the line lies completely outside the polygon, or possibly (but this will rarely happen) the line intersects the polyon.  Now, the phrasing of this question says \\\"if a line intersects a polygon\\\", so this is a decision problem.  One possibility (the decision model approach) is to reduce the question to some other (well known) problem Q, and then try to solve Q.  An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem.  In recent years, many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a new language called PostScript.  (See \\\"PostScript Language\\\", by Adobe Systems Incorporated, ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).  So, given a line L and a polygon P, we can write a PostScript program that draws the line L and the polygon P, and then \\\"outputs\\\" the answer.  By \\\"output\\\", we mean the program executes a command called \\\"showpage\\\", which actually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon.  A quick examination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q, and thus the original problem.  There are two small problems with this approach.    (1) There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into the  reduced problem Q.  So, we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of  Choice (or equivalently, Zorn's Lemma).  But the use of the Axiom of  Choice is not regarded in a very serious light these days.   (2) More importantly, the question arises as to whether or not the  PostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper; or in  other words, will it halt?   Now, PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a  Turing Machine might do; thus the halting problem (for PostScript) is  undecidable.  It is quite possible that the original problem will turn  out to be undecidable.

By the well known Dobbin-Dullman reduction (see J. Dullman & D. Dobbin, J. Comp. Obfusc. 37,ii:  pp. 33-947, lemma 17(a)) line-polygon intersection can be reduced to Hamiltonian Circuit, without(!) the use of Grobner bases, so LPI (to coin an acronym) is probably only NP-complete.  Besides, Turing-completeness will no longer be a problem once our Cray-3 is delivered, since it will be able to complete an infinite loop in 4 milliseconds (with scatter-gather.)  --------  From: deb@svax.cs.cornell.edu (David Baraff)  Well, sure its no worse than NP-complete, but that's ONLY if you restrict yourself to the case where the line satisfies a Lipschitz condition on its second derivative.

[It will encourage the *FBI* to commit (even more) criminal acts, but that's not the point here.]  But this gives another avenue of attack on the Clipper proposal.  When the EFF/ACLU/CPSR FOIA requests are made, they should ask for details on the bureaucratic and equipment infrastructure that is proposed (or  even already budgeted) for the FBI to service tapping requests -- for now and the projected future.   From these figures, estimate the number of Clipper-tap requests the FBI is expecting.  Publish this figure.  Compare it on a per-capita basis with the amount of tapping now known or suspected.  Also estimate how expensive it would be for the FBI to install more Clipper-tapping stations, and how rapidly they could be built and installed ... ie, get the \\\"plus or minus\\\" epsilon for the near future.  Might be a mite disturbing for J. Q. Public to know these things.  And despite all the technical details [BTW, thanks to those who've been providing them!], we still don't know   1) how the tapping requests will be transmitted and authenticated (though    it isn't too hard to guess a good scheme).  2) how the results will be securely transmitted (Fed Ex the audio tapes?)  3) how privacy will be re-established when an investigation is complete.\",\"I've been offerred an old 4-bits/pixel greyscale Xterminal.

I've never seen one that specifically provides the info that Davis insists that he has, so I'd love to have a cite.   Wrong.  There's one gun design where that can happen, and it is supposed to be carried with the hammer over an unloaded chamber. (Cocking the gun turns the cylinder so that a loaded cylinder is under the hammer.  In other words, it can be usefully carried in a safe manner.)  Other handgun designs don't have that property; if their trigger isn't pulled, the hammer can't hit the firing pin.   The breakdowns that I do have include the above category.  From them I can safely say that if Davis is right in ALL of his claims, a large negative number of people are killed by animals, because we know that the number of killings by wackos is reasonably large and that the number of accidents due to gun failures (which is a superset of the described circumstance) is near zero.

With I/O overlap, your CPU can continue to \\\"think\\\" while disk operations are underway, whereas without overlap, your CPU sits idly waiting for each disk operation to finish - and disk operations take an *eternity*, compared to a fast CPU.  So, when you've got multi-tasking, you want to increase performance by increasing the amount of overlapping you do.  One way is with DMA or bus mastering.  Either of these make it possible for I/O devices to move their data into and out of memory without interrupting the CPU.  The alternative is for the CPU to move the data.  There are several SCSI interface cards that allow DMA and bus mastering.  IDE, however, is defined by the standard AT interface created for the IBM PC AT, which requires the CPU to move all the data bytes, with no DMA.\",\"I am currently writing a paper on computer protocols security.

In re Campbell's Guardianship, 216 Minn. 113, 11 N.W.2d 786, 789.       As ``domicile'' and ``residence'' are usually in the same place, they are frequently used as if they had the same meaning, but they are not identical terms, for a person may have two places of residence, as in the city and country, but only one domicile.  Residence means living in a particular locality, but domicile means living in that locality with intent to make it a fixed and permanent home.  Residence simply requires bodily presence as an inhabitant in a given place, while domicile requires bodily presence in that place and also an intention to make it one's domicile.  In re Riley's Will, 266 N.Y.S. 209, 148 Misc. 588.  ``Residence'' demands less intimate local ties than ``domicile,'' but ``domicile'' allows absence for indefinite period if intent to return remains.

Almost a half million new users joined the Internet last year,     many of them are commercial businesses. The ban on commercial     use of Internet is no more.  Jack, there is a difference between using the network for commercial purposes and advertising in newsgroups.  Business communication is okay.  Advertising to hundreds of thousands of users around the planet who have no desire to receive advertising is not okay.      Those of us who pay for Internet access are constrained only     by our innate good taste and no have no \\\"administrator\\\" to      guide(?) us.

There are Secret Masters here, just like everywhere else.  They're not as obvious as the ones on Prodigy, but they're here.

We interpret this passage ?using our brains; we think and reason and draw conclusions.  But we know ?that our brains are not perfect: our thinking often leads us wrong.  (This ?is something that most of us have direct experience of.  8-)  Now you have hit on the purpose of the Church.  It is by necessity the infallible interpreter of divine revelation.  Without the Church,           Christianity would be nothing more than a bunch of little divisive sects.   ?Unless you are infallible, there are very few things you can be certain ?of.  To the extent that doctrines rely on fallible human thinking, they ?cannot be certain.  This argument of yours regarding the certainty of an observation or a conclusion is not necessarily substantiated by experience.  It reminds me of the theoretical physicist who said that you can never be certain of a measurment because the sensor interferes with the field you are trying to measure.  Now, the experimental physicist will reply that although the measurement can never be made with absolute certainty, he is able to determine the certainty with which the measurement can be made, and this knowledge is often sufficient to render the measurement useful enough to allow evidence of the true condition of the field under observation. Therefore, although our minds are finite and susceptible to error, our competence in arriving at inductive insights gives confidence in our ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true, even in areas not subject to the experimental method.   ?Darren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu ?\\\"If any substantial number of  [ talk.religion.misc ]  readers read some ?

I just installed a set of Bosch air horns ordered from  Dennis Kirk (pg. 282 of the latest catalog) on my '85 FJ1100. They are rated at 93db at 7 meters. I installed them using 10 gage wire from the battery to the relay to the compressor to ground. My stock horn connectors fit the relay pins just fine. I soldered the connections to the relay and compressor, and used a crimp type battery connector and an inline 10amp fuse/connector from NAPA.  I installed the compressor just forward of the fuse box in the front fairing by tie wrapping between the steering head frame and the black steel tube frame used to support the front fairing. You have to remove the front fairing to do this, but it fits outside of the frame but inside the fairing on the two vertical supports just in front of the fuses. Depending how tight your fairing follows the frame, you should be able to fit it somewhere in the fairing. The compressor is about 2\\\" in diameter and about 5\\\" long.  The relay mounted on the front of the steering head frame (it is small so there should be plenty of good places for it.  I found a perfect place for the horns that required only tie wraps to mount. The horns fit inside the front fairing/frame and stick out on either side just in front of the air scoops, but behind the turn signals. The back of the horns point back towards the center of the bike and come real close to where the gas tank connects to the front part of the frame. There is just enough room to the outside to allow full lock to lock clearance, and there are nice cut outs in the frame for the back of the horn to go into.  The short horn is even with the fairing, and the long one sticks out about an inch or so, but it is really not that noticable unless you look closely. They end up pointing down slightly and maybe 30 degrees from straight ahead (perfect for those cagers trying to change lanes into you).  If you have any other questions about the mounting, email, and I can try to explain better. If your bike is not red, then you may want to paint them first.  How do they work you ask? They are very, very, very *LOUD*. They sound more like a european sports car than a truck, but a vast improvement over stock. I have used them at least daily since installing them, and the 10 amp fuse has not blown yet (although, the duration of the horn blasts have been short).  I've repeatedly scared the shit out of my friends with them, even though they know that I have the horns, they still jump. They are perfect for keeping the pedestrians on the sidewalk. The bottom line is they work, are loud enough to cause pain and suffering to those stupid lane changing cages (as well as take a few years off their lives) and are relatively easy to install on the FJ. YMMV.\",\"Anybody know of an IGES Viewer for DOS/Windows? I need to be able to display  ComputerVision IGES files on a PC running Windows 3.1.

I believe that automatics should only be manufactured for people with physical disabilities who otherwise would not be able to drive.  Automatic transmissions allow drivers to be lazy. More time is available to fiddle with the radio or to look at the scenery instead of concentrating on the road.  The manual transmission keeps the drive always doing something, granted it isn't a large movement.  Plus, driving should be FUN!  Driving a manual is fun, driving an automatic is a chore.  In the case of shift speed, automatics can be made to shift far faster that any human could move a stick.  If I was racing, I'd want and automatic.  For normal driving go with the manual. \",\"   Back to the F1 stuff for a second, note that the `auto' tranny in F1 _STILL_ shifts at the driver's command, not some preselected schedule.  The driver still controls the shifting, not the transmission.              ^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^  I have yet to see a torque multiplier installed on a production automobile.  Such systems do exist, but none are presently installed in production autos that I am aware of.  These are commonly called viscous drive CVTs or fluidic amplifiers.    What the convertor _does_ allow is for the engine to be closer to its torque peak during the launch before a clutched car can fully engage it's driveline.  Chevy proved it many years ago with the '70 Camaro (ETs and terminal 1/4 mile times were close enough tpo be identical for 4 speed and auto cars).  Note that this is also the major reason that an auto car can get away with fewer gears than a manual, the slip in the convertor makes up for the fewer ratios (and before everyone starts yelling about the proposed 5 sspeed autos soon to be out, note that some manufacturers are using 6 speed manulas now).    Correct.\",\"I have 2 foot switches for sale.  They're great for guitar amps, and keyboards.  Each is about 1\\\" in diameter with a 6' (or so) cable.

I played Elvira I & II, and think that Horrorsoft has finally made a very playable game with Waxworks.  The look and feel is roughly the same as in the Elvira games, though the real time fighting is a little easier to survive.  The first two games, especially Elvira II: Jaws of Cerberus made it very tough to stay alive and hit-point restoring was very difficult.  This  is not to say that Waxworks is a walk in the park, but it is quite fair, in that there is always some weapon to be found that is quite effective, or hint given as to the proper fighting strategy.  In one of the four wax works to be explored, there is  no fighting at all (well almost none), though all four contain moderately challanging puzzles.  The really interesting thing about this game is that it is really  broken up into four seperate RPGs, one for each of the four exhibits you must enter.  In starting each one, your character is transported with no objects to use, and experience level 1.  One exhibits traps you inside a multi-level ancient Egyptian pyramid which you must  escape by fighting, mapping and puzzle solving.  Another exhibit traps you in a mine that has been taken over by creeping plant vines and pods, while the local humans have been transformed into plant zombies.  This is a single level maze that requires you to rescue some humans, kill the head plant alien, and figuere out how to kill the very tuff plant zombies that are always showing up.  This is perhaps the most horrifying exhibit.  Another exhibit puts you into Jack The Ripper England where you appear by the corpse of a fresh Ripper victim, and of course the police think you are responsible.  You must avoid police and angry mobs to unravel the mystery of The Ripper and  meet him face to face - but first get a disquise.  The last exhibit pus you in a graveyard where most of the challenge is in learning to  stop the almost indestructible zombies.    Over all the VGA graphics and music are very effective in setting a  creepy tone for the game, as was the case for the Elvira games, though gameplay is much improved and makes for a much more enjoyable game. I heartily recommend it for RPG and Horror fans.     *********************************************************  - All prices include shipping. - All games are in excellent condition unless otherwise stated. - US buyers only please. - All games will be shipped inside a box with packing, insured,   priority USPS. - All games include all original materials including box, manual,   disks, and registration unless otherwise noted.

Most of the content of the White House announcements was in what was *not* said.  It gives us almost nothing of value, threatens to take away a lot, and does it with a sincere smile on its face, and the nice friendly word \\\"Management\\\".           FACT SHEET        PUBLIC ENCRYPTION MANAGEMENT  The first thing it doesn't say is \\\"We're giving you stronger encryption\\\". what it says is     the U. S. Government has developed a microcircuit that not only    provides privacy through encryption that is substantially more robust    than the current government standard, but also permits escrowing of    the keys needed to unlock the encryption.  The system for the    escrowing of keys will allow the government to gain access to    encrypted information only with appropriate legal authorization. But DES is strong enough that only the government can break it now, so the major effect is to make it EASIER for government to break! *At best* it makes it more difficult for the NSA to break, since they need to get one of the two escrowed keys to do a brute-force search for the other 40-bit key.  Similarly, it didn't say \\\"We're making encryption is commercially available.\\\" because encryption *is* already commercially available, including forms the NSA may not be able to break, like triple-DES or IDEA. And phone companies could offer DES-based systems *now* if they were convinced the government would let them and they could make enough money.  The next thing it didn't say is \\\"We're making encryption legal\\\", because of course encryption *has always been* legal, and the President can't change the First Amendment merely by decree. What it *did* say was:  In making this decision, I do not intend to prevent the  private sector from developing, or the government from approving,  other microcircuits or algorithms that are equally effective in  assuring both privacy and a secure key- escrow system. which clearly means \\\"We're making encryption illegal unless we get your keys. Soon.  Once business buys into this.\\\"  Another thing it didn't say is \\\"We're going to ask Congress for money to do *lots* more wiretapping\\\", because of course, there's a budget crisis, and Congress might debate the policy issues or not give them the cash. What it *did* say was:    The Attorney General will procure and utilize encryption devices to    the extent needed to preserve the government's ability to conduct    lawful electronic surveillance and to fulfill the need for secure    law enforcement communications.  Further, the Attorney General    shall utilize funds from the Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture    Super Surplus Fund to effect this purchase. which means \\\"We've got money Congress can't control and we're going to buy lots of wiretapping equipment with it to detect NON-APPROVED CRYPTO (that's what \\\"preserve the government's ability to conduct ... surveillance\\\"  means.)  \",\"How about this:  The TelCo has your Clipper key.

About 20 years ago, _National Lampoon_ had some comic strips  in them that were drawn by Neal Adams. They were called \\\"Son o' God\\\" comics.  It was a parody of the Jesus in the Bible. In the comic, there were a  group of thirteen Jewish kids from Brooklyn, and when one of them said  the magic word, he turned into \\\"Son o' God.\\\" He went from a myopic,  curly headed, yarmulke wearing boy to a replica of the stylizied  portraits of Jesus --- with long flowing brown hair and gentile  features.    Now, if someone were to profess faith in this NatLamp Jesus,  and claim that they were a Christian because they believed in this  NatLamp Jesus, we would have to say that this was fallacious since  this Jesus was a fabrication, and did not really exist.   This is the exact same thing that the LDS do when they claim  that they are Christian. They profess faith in Jesus, but the Jesus  that they profess to have faith in is as much a fabrication as the  NatLamp Jesus was. \",\"     I love it, I love it, I love it!!

Richard Hirschhaut, director of the San Francisco branch of the ADL, art dealer Roy Bullock and former policeman Tom Gerard were also named as defendants in the suit, filed in San Francisco County Superior Court.      The 19 accuse the ADL of B'nai B'rith, a group dedicated to fighting anti-Semitism, and the other defendants of secretly gathering information on them, including data from state and federal agencies.      The suit alleges they disclosed the information to others, including the governments of Israel and South Africa, in what it alleges was a \\\"a massive spying operation.\\\"      The action is a class-action suit. It was filed on behalf of about 12,000 anti-apartheid activists or opponents of Israeli policies about whom the plaintiffs believe the ADL, Bullock and Gerard gathered information.      Representatives of the ADL in San Francisco were not immediately available for comment on Wednesday.      The civil suit is the first legal action arising out of allegations that Gerard, a former inspector in the San Francisco police intelligence unit, passed confidential police files on California political activists to a spy ring.      The FBI and San Francisco police are investigating the ADL, Bullock and Gerard over the affair and last week searched the ADL's offices in San Francisco and Los Angeles.      The suit alleges invasion of privacy under the Civil Code of California, which prohibits the publication of information obtained from official sources. It seeks exemplary damages of at least $2,500 per person as well as other unspecified damages.      Lawyer Pete McCloskey, a former Congresmen who is representing the plaintiffs, said the 19 plaintiffs included Arab-Americans and Jews -- and his wife Helen, who also had information gathered about her.      One of the plaintiffs is Yigal Arens, a research scientist at the University of Southern California who is a son of the former Israeli Defence Minister.      Arens told the San Francisco Examiner he had seen a file the ADL kept on him in the 1980s, presumably because of his criticism of the treatment of Palestinians and his position on the Israeli-occupied territories.      According to court documents released last week, Bullock and Gerard both kept information on thousands of California political activists.      In the documents, a police investigator said he believed the ADL paid Bullock for many years to provide information and that both the league and Bullock received confidential information from the authorities.      No criminal charges have yet been filed in the case. The ADL, Bullock and Gerard have all denied any wrongdoing.   REUTER AC KG CM    APn  04/14 2202  ADL Lawsuit  Copyright, 1993. The Associated Press. All rights reserved.  By CATALINA ORTIZ  Associated Press Writer    SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Arab-Americans and critics of Israel sued the Anti-Defamation League on Wednesday, saying it invaded their privacy by illegally gathering information about them through a nationwide spy network.    The ADL, a national group dedicated to fighting anti-Semitism, intended to use the data to discredit them because of their political views, according to the class-action lawsuit filed in San Francisco Superior Court.    \\\"None of us has been guilty of racism or Nazism or anti-Semitism or hate crimes, or any of the other `isms' that the ADL claims to protect against. None of us is violent or criminal in any way,\\\" said Carol El-Shaieb, an education consultant who develops programs on Arab culture.    The 19 plaintiffs include Yigal Arens, son of former Israel Defense Minister Moshe Arens. The younger Arens, a research scientist at the University of Southern California, said the ADL kept a file on him in the 1980s presumably because he has criticized Israel's treatment of Palestinians.    \\\"The ADL believes that anyone who is an Arab American ... or speaks politically against Israel is at least a closet anti-Semite,\\\" Arens said.    The ADL has denied any wrongdoing, but couldn't comment on the lawsuit because it hasn't reviewed it, said a spokesman at the ADL's New York headquarters.    The FBI and local police and prosecutors are investigating allegations that the ADL spied on thousands of individuals and hundreds of groups, including white supremacist and anti-Semitic organizations, Arab-Americans, Greenpeace, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and San Francisco public television station KQED.    Some information allegedly came from confidential police and government records, according to court documents filed in the probe and the civil lawsuit. No charges have been filed in the criminal investigation.    The lawsuit accuses the ADL of violating California's privacy law, which forbids the intentional disclosure of personal information \\\"not otherwise public\\\" from state or federal records.    The lawsuit claims the ADL disclosed the information to \\\"persons and entities\\\" who had no compelling need to receive it. It didn't elaborate.    Defendants include Richard Hirschhaut, director of the ADL's office in San Francisco. He did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment.    Other defendants are San Francisco art dealer Roy Bullock, an alleged ADL informant over the past four decades, and former police officer Tom Gerard. Gerard allegedly tapped into law enforcement and government computers and passed information on to Bullock.    Gerard, who has retired from the police force, has moved to the Philippines. Bullock's lawyer, Richard Breakstone, said he could not comment on the lawsuit because he had not yet studied it.

The discussion (on my part at least) began with Benedikt's questioning of the historical acuuracy of the NT. I was making the point that, if the same standards are used to validate secular history that are used here to discredit NT history, then virtually nothing is known of the first century.  You seem to be saying that the Bible -cannot- be true because it speaks of the existence of God as it it were a fact.

For Sale\",\"I seldom see any posts in this group. Is anyone out there in Christendom listening? If so, why don't we get some dialog going here?  Here's a topic to get things started. My daughter's Christian school sends home a weekly update on school related topics. This week they sent something *very* interesting. It was an article written by the leader of a national (US) Christian school organization about a trip he recently made to Jerusalem. While there, he was introduced to one of the rabbis who is working on a project to rebuild the Temple at Jerusalem. The article included photos of the many furnishings that have already been made in preparation for furnishing the rebuilt temple according to the specifications given in the Bible.   What was even more striking is the fact that the plans for the temple are complete and the group is only awaiting permission from the Israeli government before beginning the building. The other startling fact is the very recent archeological discovery that the original site of the temple is unoccupied and available for building. Previously it has been thought that the original site was underneath what is now a mosque, making rebuilding impossible without sparking a holy war.   Now it appears that nothing stands in the way of rebuilding and resuming sacrifices, as the Scriptures indicate will happen in the last days. Although the Israeli government will give the permission to start, I think it is the hand of God holding the project until He is ready to let it happen. Brothers and sisters, the time is at hand.

But the difinition of modify that applies to how \\\"well regulated\\\"  modifies \\\"militia\\\" is:  to qualify or limit the meaning of.  For example, \\\"wet\\\"  modifes \\\"day\\\" in the phrase \\\"a wet day.\\\"  The amendment is similiar to the statement:  A wet day, being annoying, the right of the people to keep  and wear boots, shall not be infringed. So how does a dry day pertain the right to use boots?

Infringed is defined as:  To break or ignore the terms of or obligations (an oath,   an agreement, law, or the like); to disreguard; violate.  To go beyond the boundaries or limits; tresspass; encroach. This definition implies the following of some form of existing  agreement.  Laws and agreements are made in advance.  Boundaries  or limits of behavior are set by society as a whole.  The word  \\\"unconditional\\\" implies no agreements or all previous agreements  are off, which is the opposite.  The words used in the first amendment are much stronger, i.e., \\\"congress shall make no law,\\\" are much stronger.  They clearly            ^^^^^^^^^^^ imply \\\"unconditional.\\\"  If the writers of the amendment, wanted  unconditional whay didn't they says, \\\"congress shall make no  laws pertaining the the right of the people to keep and bear arms\\\"?

Gerald Perry of the Cardinals pinch hit in the eighth inning with two on and his club down by a run.  He stroked a line drive into the right field corner.  The ball cleared the three-foot high fence and went into the crowd.  Darryl, racing over from right center, got to the spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence, but he missed the ball.  A fan sitting in the front row, wearing a mitt, reached up and caught the ball.  Home run.  Now I've seen the replay several times and I have concluded that Darryl missed the ball, and that the fan's glove was essentially behind Darryl's.  Several Dodger fans with seats in the immediate vicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with Strawberry.  What cannot be disputed, however, is that the fan who caught the ball never took his eye off it;  he was oblivious to where the fielder was playing.  He was also quite exuberant as soon as he realized he had made the catch.  That exuberance disappeared immediately, however, when Strawberry went into a tirade at the man.  All reports indicate he used a lot of profanity and accused the man of interference, and therefore of costing the Dodgers a game.  Shortly afterwards other fans hurled food and beverages toward the man who made the catch.  Dodger Stadium officials started to remove him from the park, but then relented and just relocated him to another area.  In an interview after the game, Lasorda blamed the fan for the loss.  Strawberry also went into a tirade about how the fans are stupid and they don't care about  winning.  L.A. Times columnists similarly blasted the man who made the catch.  Before each Dodger game the public address announcer makes a speech wherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls that are hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any  that are in the field of play.  Was the fan wrong?  Should he have been more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility of interference?  Or was he human and just reacting?  By the way, he is a season ticket holder and on his request the Dodgers have relocated his seats to another area of the Stadium where future interference is impossible.  Others have questioned why Darryl should be so concerned with what the fan did when he has a grand total of 1 rbi through the first nine games.  I question what he was doing in right center with a left-handed pull hitter up and the game on the line.  Had he been closer to the play, he certainly would have had a much better chance of catching the ball.  But I guess the big debate continues as to what are the responsibilities of the fan.    -- The Beastmaster   \",\" Battery powered devices like the PowerBook are sometimes more sensitive to  serial port weirdness.

And the 'Islamic Holocaust' is much the topic of the day. The historical evidence proves that during  the period of 1914 to 1920, the Armenian Government ordered, incited,  assisted and participated in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people  because of race, religion and national origin. Armenians perpetrated acts  of sabotage, destroyed telephone cables, blew up bridges, blocked passes,  set up ambushes, attacked security stations and small Turkish outposts  behind the Ottoman Army lines on the one hand, and on the other ruthlessly  attacked Turkish and Kurdish villages, slaughtering the Turkish population  indiscriminately, women, children, old and young alike. Innocent  Muslims were one by one cruelly bayonetted to death, or massacred with  axes and swords, or else shut up in mosques or in schools and then burnt alive as can be seen below.  Widespread Armenian massacres of innocent Muslims took place in regions  of Van, Kars, Sivas, Erzurum, Bitlis, Erzincan, Mus, Diyarbakir and  Maras. The Ottoman Army, while fighting to prevent the Russian invasion, also had to deal with Armenian genocide squads who cowardly hit from  behind. The Armenian genocide of the Muslims spread to all parts of  Eastern Anatolia. Starting from late 1914, Armenians committed  widespread massacres and genocide in Eastern Anatolia, because the arena was left to the Armenians. Almost every Turkish town and village from  Erzincan up to Azerbaidjan suffered large scale massacres and genocide  by Armenians and the Turkish genocide has been documented by Armenian,  Russian, American, British, Ottoman, German, Austrian and French  journalists and officers who observed the first genocide of this century committed by the blood-thirsty Armenian genocide squads.  The Ottoman Army, liberating Trabzon, Bayburt, Erzincan, Erzurum,  Kars and other regions from the Russians, saw that the cities and their  villages had been destroyed and burnt, people slaughtered, massacred. The massacres conducted by Armenians, which became a black stain for humanity, shocked and disgusted even the Russian, British, German, Austrian, French and American authorities.  Almost every Ottoman document is related to Armenian massacres and  cruelties. The inhuman treatment, cruelties, atrocities, genocide by  Armenian genocide squads perpetrated against innocent Moslem Turkish  and Kurdish people, are sufficiently reflected in historical documents.  Even today over seventy-five years later, the terrifying screams of  the victims of these cruelties can be heard.

They clearly announced their intention of clearing what they called the  Armenian and Kurdish land from the Turks and thus, solve the nationality  problem.

Yes (2) What CPU is in the Mac Portable? A low power version of the 68000  running at 15.87 Mhz. (3) Does the Mac Portable run system 7? Yes, although it does use up a  lot of memory. (4) Is memory still availabe for the Portable? There are several vendors  that still make RAM for the Portable. There are two options: Some vendors  sell memory that plugs into the RAM Slot inside the portable. Others sell  memory that plugs into the Processor Direct Slot. Either way, the most  memory you can address is either 8 or 9 megabytes, depending on whether  the Portable is Backlit or not. King Memory and Peripherials in Irvine  California is the cheapest place I know of for Portable memory. 2MB -  $140, 4 MB, $250, and 7 MB $415. I still see several ads in macuser that  are selling 4 MB modules for $450. Wide variety in pricing here. (5) What is the internal HD? Its a Conner CP-3045 40 MB HD with an  average access time of about 25 ms. (6) Is the screen better that the PB 100? Heavens yes! The PB 100 is a  backlit PASSIVE matrix screen which means it fades out on you if you move  your head a few degrees left or right. The Portable has a backlit or  non-backlit ACTIVE Matrix screen which I think is a joy to read.  Other things to consider - Where to get the portable and how much to pay  for it? A good supplier has been SelectTerm in Mass. They were willing to  sell a 2MB Non-backlit Portable with an internal 2400 bps modem for about  $650. Or a 4 MB Backlit Portable with an internal 2400 bps modem for  about $900.   The answer is call around for a good while or you'll pay too much.

I'd like to expand our show automation a bit- namely add the capability to use cue tapes to bring the houselights up.  Our current automation consoles date from the early 60's and don't provide this function.  We already have the combo failsafe/contact rollers to read the cuetapes, and our dimmer system will raise the houselights when its fade-up control circuit (120 VAC) is momentarily closed, for at least 0.5 second.  I've tried wiring the dimmer control to a 12V relay, activated when the cue tape completes the circuit.  Low tech and simple, but there's one problem:  In order to get the 1/2 second pulse, there needs to be a sh**load of cuetape on the film.  (35mm runs at 90 feet per minute, so to get a 1/2 second pulse, there needs to be at least 9 inches of solid cuetape!)  Ideally, I would like to use a single cross-cue to accomplish this function. (A single strip of cuetape perpendicular to the length of the film) This would give a pulse of approximately 1/100 of a second. What I need is a circuit to detect the short cue and activate the relay for around 1/2 second.  The ability to adjust how long the relay is activated would be nice.  I figure this would require an RC circuit of some sort.  I'm sure some of you already have the solution figured out in your heads.  Any suggestions and schematics would be appreciated!   Thanks,  Mark Fontana \",\"    Then you must be living in an alternate universe. Where were they?                  An Appeal to Mankind  During the last three years Azerbaijan and its multinational population are vainly fighting for justice within the limits of the Soviet Union. All humanitarian, constitutional human rights guaranteed by the UN Charter, Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Helsinki Agreements, Human Problems International Forums, documents signed by the Soviet Union - all of them are violated.  The USSR's President, government bodies do not defend Azerbaijan though they are all empowered to take necessary measures to guarantee life and peace.  The 140,000 strong army of Armenian terrorists with Moscow's tacit consent wages an undeclared war of annihilation against Azerbaijan. As a result, a part of Azerbaijan has been occupied and annexed, hundreds of people killed, thousands wounded.  Some 200,000 Azerbaijanis have been brutally and inhumanly deported from the Armenian SSR, their historical homeland. Together with them 64,000 Russians and 22,000 Kurds have also been driven out, a part of them now settled in Azerbaijan. Some 40,000 Turkish-Meskhetians, Lezghins and representatives  of other Caucasian nationalities who escaped from the Central Asia where the President and government bodies did not guarantee them the life and peace also suffered from these deportations.  One of the scandalous vandalisms directed not only against Azerbaijan science but the world civilization as well is the Armenian extremists' destruction of the Karabakh scientific experimental base of The Institute of Genetics and Selection  of the Academy of Sciences of the Azerbaijan SSR.  We beg you for humanitarian help and political assistance, for the honour and dignity of 7 million Azerbaijanis are violated, its territory, culture  and history are trampled, its people are shot. There is persistent negative image of Azerbaijanians abroad, and this defamation is spread over  the whole world by Soviet mass media, Armenian lobby in the USSR and the United States.   One of the myths is that all events allegedly involves and generated by interethnic collisions and religious intolerance while the truth is that all these shootings and recent  events stem from the territorial claims of Armenia on Azerbaijan.  It is a well documented fact that before the conflict there were no frictions between Armenians and Azerbaijanis on the issue of Karabakh. Hundreds and thousands Armenians placidly and calmly lived and worked in Azerbaijan land, had their representatives in all government bodies of the Azerbaijan SSR.  We are for a united, indivisible, sovereign Azerbaijan, we  are for a common Caucasian home proclaimed in 1918 by one of the founding fathers of the Azerbaijan Democratic  Republic - Muhammed Emin Rasulzade.  But all these goals and expectations are trampled upon the Soviet leadership in favour of the Armenian expansionists encouraged by Moscow and intended to create a new '1,000 Year Reich' - the 'Great Armenia' - by annexing the  neighboring lands.  The world public opinion shed tears to save the whales, suffers for penguins dying out in the Antarctic Continent.  But what about the lives of seven million human beings? If these people are Muslims, does it mean that they are less valuable? Can people be discriminated by their  colour of skin or religion, by their residence or other attributes?  All people are brothers, and we appeal to our brothers for help and understanding. This is not the first appeal of Azerbaijan to the world public opinion. Our previous appeals were unheard. However, we still carry the hope that the truth beyond the Russian and Armenian propaganda will one day reveal the extent of our suffering and stimulate at least as much help and compassion for Azerbaijan as tendered to whales and penguins.

The Armenians are Christians, the Azerbaijanis are Moslems, and Islam is a religion especially unloved by the democrat-westernizers. Besides, at the root of this conflict lie the territorial claims on Azerbaijan, a consequence of which were the blood and suffering of innocent Azeri people, hundreds of thousands of refugees, and gross violations of human rights.   Recently Armenians attacked the Azeri town of Khojaly and massacred thousands of Azeris. The Paris-based 'Association for Democracy and Human Rights in Azerbaijan' puts the number of Khojali victims at 3,145. Some of the dead were scalped and mutilated. This whole thing has now gone entirely too far.   They already did.

The republic of Armenia reiterated denials that its militants had killed 1,000 people in the Azerbaijani populated town of Khojaly last week and  massacred men, women and children fleeing the carnage across snow-covered mountain passes.      But dozen of bodies scattered over the area lent credence to Azerbaijani reports of a massacre.                           Scalping Reported      Azerbaijani officials and journalists who flew briefly to the region by helicopter brought back three dead children with the back of their heads blown off. They said shooting by Armenians has prevented them  from retrieving more bodies.      \\\"Women and children have been scalped,\\\" said Assad Faradshev, an aide to Nagorno-Karabakh's Azerbaijani Governor. \\\"When we began to pick up bodies, they began firing at us.\\\" are lying there like flocks of sheep.

Nobuya \\\"Higgy\\\" Higashiyama replied (as, in substance, did others):   > Where is your source of moral standards by which you judge God's  > behavior?  It is often argued that we have no standing by which to judge God's actions.  Who is the clay to talk back to the potter? But we find a contrary view in Scripture. When God proposes to destroy the city of   + Suppose that there are some good men in the city.  + Will you destroy the righteous along with the wicked?  + Far be it from you, Lord, to do such a thing!  + Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?  I am told that the Hebrew is actually a bit stronger than this, and can perhaps be better rendered (dynamic equivalence) as   + Shame on you, Lord, if you do such a thing!  There are those who say that the definition of \\\"good\\\" is \\\"whatever God happens to want.\\\" But if that is so, then the statement that God is good has no meaning.  It simply says that God does what He wants. That being the case, no one can either love or obey God because He is good. The only motive left for obeying Him is that He is powerful. Just as it makes sense to obey a dictator, even when he tells you to round up all Jews and exterminate them, because if you defy him you might end up in the gas chamber yourself, so it makes sense to obey God, because He has the power to punish you if you don't. This ethical theory I take to be in radical contradiction to Genesis 18 and to Christianity in general.  Any theory that makes our moral judgements worthless makes any further discussion of morality (or of the goodness of God) meaningless. However, it does not follow that our moral judgements are always infallible in particular cases, still less our judgements in particular cases about the course of action most likely to achieve a good result.  When I read the Scriptural accounts of the actions of God in history, those actions often seem to me very different from what I might expect of a God who loves us and desires what is best for us. Moreover, leaving the Scriptures aside, and considering the natural world, I find that Nature is often very different from what I might \\\"Those who believe that the Author of Nature is also the Author of the Scriptures must expect to find in the Scriptures the same sort of difficulties that they find in Nature.\\\")  Now, that some such difficulties should exist is not in itself an argument against the existence, power, wisdom, and goodness of God. On the contrary, their ABSENCE would be such an argument. Suppose that I am watching Bobby Fisher play chess, and suppose that every time he makes a move, I find myself nodding and saying: \\\"Good move! Just what I was expecting him to do.  Same move I would have made if I were playing.\\\" That would be a sign that Fisher is no better a chess player than myself. Given that he is better, I expect that at least some of his moves will have me thinking, \\\"Now, what do suppose induced him to do that?\\\" or even, \\\"Boy, that was a real slip -- he's just thrown the game away!\\\" Similarly, if God understands the workings of the universe better than I do, it is to be expected that sometimes it will look to me as if He has made a mistake.  One difference between Fisher at the chessboard and God at the controls of the universe is that I can see the end of the chess game. If Fisher wins, I revise my earlier inference that it was carelessness that made him lose his queen 23 moves earlier. However, if he loses, and particularly if I can see that there was a time when he had an opportunity for a checkmate in two moves and did not take it, then I know that he is not as good a player as I had thought.  With God, on the other hand, I shall not in this life see the total result of some of His actions. Therefore, my grounds for judging that I have seen a bad move on His part must always be far shakier than my grounds for making a similar judgement about Fisher.       *****     *****     *****     *****     *****  In the book of Genesis, we read that Joseph's ten older brothers, who (with good reason) found  him insufferable, conspired to sell him into slavery in Egypt. There he eventually became Viceroy, and when there was a famine in Canaan, he was able to provide for his family. When his brothers nervously apologized, he told them: \\\"Do not worry. You meant to do me evil, but God turned it into good.\\\"           The history of the Jews is largely a history of events    that look like catastrophes that threaten the continued    survival of the religion, or the people, or both. But,    amazingly, those events turn out to be the saving of the Jews    and of Judaism.         The sale of Joseph by his brothers looked like the breakup    of the family.  But in fact, it ended with a reconciliation of    the quarrel between them. The famine that drove the family out    of Canaan looked like a misfortune for them.  But in fact, if    they had stayed in Canaan, they would almost certainly have    intermarried with the Canaanites and been assimilated into    their culture.  Their oppression by the Egyptians a few    generations after their arrival in Egypt again looked like a    disaster. But God used it to bring them out of Egypt, and into    the Promised Land.         Here the people built a Temple, and regularly offered    sacrifices. But the Babylonians captured Jerusalem and Judea,    destroyed Temple and city and countryside, and deported most of    the people to Babylon. You might have thought that that would    be the end of the people and the religion. But it was not.    Living in Canaan, the people had been under constant danger of    assimilation.  Again and again, they had turned from the    worship of the LORD to the worship of the Canaanite fertility    cults, with their ritual prostitution and ritual human    sacrifice. The Babylonian captivity put a stop to that. Never    again did the Jews show any interest in polytheism or idolatry.    Neither the worship of the Canaanites mor that of the    Babylonians ever again had a foothold among them.         Nor is that all. Judaism had been in danger of becoming    simply a system of sacrifices and Temple observances. The only    prescribed acts of worship consisted of coming to Jerusalem    every so often and offering a sacrifice. During the Captivity,    with the Temple gone, the Jews invented the synagogue, a place    of meeting for reading and study and discussion of the    Scriptures. They came to realize clearly, what they were in    danger of forgetting while they continued to live in Judea,    that God is not simply a local or tribal deity, not just the    controller of the land of Canaan, or the patron of the Jewish    people, but the Creator of the world, and the Ruler and Judge    of all humans everywhere.         Time passed, and the Babylonian Empire was replaced by    that of the Persians, and then that of the Greeks, or rather    the Macedonians. The ruler, Antiochus Epiphanes, was determined    to stamp out Judaism, and to this end he made the reading and    the study of the Torah punishable by death. Again, one might    think that this would be the end of Judaism. But it was not.    The people met for worship, and instead of reading the Torah    portion appointed for the day, they would read some passage    from the prophets that had a similar theme, and then discuss    that.  Before this time, the Torah, the so-called Five Books of    Moses (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy)    were the only books read and studied in the synagogue.  If it    had not been for Antiochus, the books of the prophets would    probably have been forgotten altogether. His hatred for Judaism    saved them.          [Other examples here omitted for brevity's sake.]          Some of you may remember that Julie Andrews first became    famous as Eliza Doolittle in the stage production of MY FAIR    LADY. When Warner Brothers undertook to make a movie of it,    everyone expected that Julie, who had been so magnificent on    stage, would play the same role in the movie. Instead, the    studio decided to go with an established screen star, and cast    Audrey Hepburn.  Julie Andrews was naturally crushed. But she    later realized that if she had played the screen role, she    would have been type-cast for life as an Elize Doolittle type.    It would have been a disaster for her. As it was, Walt Disney    offered her the role of Mary Poppins, and she won an Oscar for    it.  At the presentation, she stood there, smiling, and looking    at Walt Disney, she said, \\\"And now, my special thanks to the    man who made all this possible -- JACK WARNER!\\\" It was the most    memorable line of the evening.         In a similar spirit, we Jews might thank the men who in    the providence of God have preserved Judaism, and kept it alive    to this day, beginning with Joseph's brothers, and continuing    with two Pharaohs, with Nebuchadnezzar, with Antiochus    Epiphanes....  After the formal meeting had broken up, one woman came up to him privately and said, \\\"You were talking about the Holocaust, weren't you?\\\" He answered, \\\"If that is an example that came to your mind, then you are right, I was talking about it to you. But I would not talk about it to everyone, for not everyone can bear it.\\\" I assume that he meant that, without the Holocaust, there would have been no state of Israel.  Someone hearing the rabbi's lecture might leap to the conclusion that God is dependent on the wickedness of men to accomplish His purposes -- or at least that the rabbi thought so. He might then  go on to suppose that the wickedness is in fact God's doing -- that He stirred up Joseph's brothers to a murderous hate against him, and that when the Israelites were in Egypt, God hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he oppressed the people, and would not let them go. And this raises questions about how an action can be considered wicked and at the same time be considered something that God has brought about.  I suggest another way of looking at it. Consider a sculptor who has a log of wood from which he proposes to carve a statue. But the log, instead of having a smooth even grain throughout, has a large knot that spoils the appearance of the surface. The sculptor considers the wood for a while, and then carves a statue that features the knot, that makes that particular interruption in the grain and color of the wood correspond to some feature of the statue, so that observers will say: \\\"How fortunate the sculptor was in finding a piece of wood with a knot like that in just the right place. Its presence is the crowning touch, the thing that makes the statue a great work of art.\\\" In reality, the knot, far from being what the sculptor was looking for, was a challenge to his skill. If the wood had not contained that flaw, he would still have made a great work of art, but a different one. So, if Joseph's brothers had not sold him, God would still have brought about His purposes for the Jewish people, but He would have done so in another manner. If Judas had not betrayed Jesus, if Caiaphas and his fellow leaders had not rejected Jesus, but had rather acknowledged Him as the Annointed of God, if Pilate had followed his conscience rather than his fears and had set Jesus free, it might appear that there would have been no Crucifixion, and therefore no Redemption, and therefore no Salvation. Not so. God did not need Judas' sin to redeem us. If Judas had done right, then God in Christ would still have reconciled the world to Himself.  We do not know how, just as we do not know how Michelangelo would have painted the Sistine Chapel if its interior had instead been shaped like Grand Central Station, and just as we do not know how Bobby Fisher would have won his fourth game agianst Spassky if Spassky had refused the exchange of bishops and had attacked Fisher's knight instead (don't bother to look up the game in question--I am making up this example, but the point is none the less valid).  Thus, we may say both (1) that God used, say, the cowardice of Pilate to accomplish His purposes, and (2) that the said cowardice was not God's doing, and that Pilate would not have thwarted God's plans by behaving justly and courageously.  What, then, are we to make of the place where God says to Moses, \\\"I will harden Pharaoh's heart, so that he will not let the people go\\\"? Some Christians have taken this to mean that Pharaoh was a puppet with God pulling the strings, and that his stubbornness and cruelty were not his own work, but the work of God in him. I suppose rather that what God was telling Moses was something like this: \\\"If you see that Pharaoh is not willing to let the people go, do not be discouraged, or suppose that the situation is out of my control. My purposes will not be thwarted. If Pharaoh chooses to hear you and let the people go, well and good. If he does not, I will fit his resistance into my plans, and fit it so perfectly that future historians and theologians will suppose that I would have been thrown for a loss if Pharaoh had obeyed me.\\\"  To return to the question that started this all off. Is it possible that the Serbs, in slaughtering the Moslems of Bosnia, are instruments of God's will?      First point. What they are doing is wrong, just as what Joseph's brothers did was wrong, just as what Judas did was wrong. They intend it for evil. If God somehow brings good out of it, that does not make them any less subject to just condemnation and punishment.      Second point. Of course, God will bring good out of it. But not the same good that He would have brought if the Serbians had refrained from the sins of robbery and rape and murder. Nor does the good He purposes excuse us from the duty of doing what is right.\",\" Here's the scoop.  When you get your home brew receiver working, would you be willing to share it with the rest of us?  I always wanted to build my own but never have the time to fool around and design it.  pin 1:  signal ground pin 2:  signal pin 3:  always hot +6 volts pin 4:  +6 volts, hot only when preamp is turned on pin 5:  infrared repeater connectors  The infrared repeater jacks on the back of the preamp are not connected to anything inside the preamp except the 5 pin connector pin #5.  There is a 150 ohm resistor between the two jacks, with a 1.5K from pin 5 to ground.  The signal pin #2 in the preamp is summed with the built in IR receiver. They use a chip called CX20106A and a BJT to amplify the signal.  I would imagine the logical way would be to duplicate this circuit and use it as the external receiver.

They use RADAR to monitor how close other vehicles are and how fast their relative speeds are, and signals a warning to the driver if they're coming up on something too fast or are getting too close.  This is all I remember from the news reports a few months back; at the time, they were only talking about the possibility of installing the system. (They didn't mention how it worked in bumper-to-bumper traffic, or how it discriminated between a Camaro approaching at 120mph and ye olde bridge support in the median being approached  at 60mph on a curve.)

Regards, Dew\",\"I produced an error last week about CHORION:   I abhor publishing trash (I abhor it of myself even more than I do from others, but since I do not present myself as an authority on the subject, I do not feel dishonest, though I do openly admit ignorance and incompetence in this example).  Thus I felt honor bound to do a better set of research specifically on the word.  First it should be noted that Greek grammar is not as tough as I first assumed (it is not nontrivial by any means, and I still am not competent with it, but it is not as opaque as I had thought).  It turns out that while the Index for the Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich \\\"Greek Lexicon\\\" renders each verse in order, each word within a verse is put in greek alphabetical order.  Thus while the the meaning of the verse is decipherable, the syntax is far from clear.  On the other hand, a Greek-English Intralinear Bible makes things a lot more comprehendable.  And yes, the word for field in Acts 1:18 is indeed \\\"chorion.\\\"   Now I've checked several Greek-English lexicons:   \\\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\\\" Louw and Nida  \\\"Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament\\\"  \\\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\\\" Grimm  \\\"Word study Concordance,\\\" Tynsdale  \\\"A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other    early Christian Writings,\\\" Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich  \\\"The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,\\\" Perschbacher  In each case the meaning of the word Chorion was given variously as:   A space, place, region, district, field, area, \\\"country place,\\\"   land, farm, estate, \\\"a bit of tillage\\\", and similar meanings.  Nowhere do any of these books mention anything about \\\"grave.\\\" As some of these  books go into great detail, I would be very surprised to find that these books  are all inadequate and Mr Archer is the only competent scholar in Greek.  I  think it more likely that Mr Archer's investigations into \\\"contradictions\\\" to  be once again, as your friend said it, \\\"lacking in substance,\\\" and thus Archer  is again shown worthless as an expert witness (By the way Mr DeCenso, I would  have honorably presented my results on this matter, even if I had found them to support Mr Archer's contentions).   By the way, among these lexicons, (eg: Robinson's) is the definition of \\\"agros,\\\" the word used in Matthew 27 to describe the field bought.  The word \\\"agros\\\" is defined as \\\"a field in the country.\\\" Chorion is specifically noted as a synonym to agros.  This is significant, as it is evidence of how silly Bullinger's exegisis was, which stated that the word for \\\"field\\\" in Matthew (ie: agros) is different from the word for \\\"field\\\" in Acts (ie: chorion), and thus we must be talking about two different fields (Of course you already admit how stupid Bullinger's exegisis is, but this was a small serendipity which drives the point home).   So as of now, unless Mr DeCenso show compelling reasons to believe otherwise (eg: a reputable scholar with reputable references), I consider this  particular issue closed.  See Mr DeCenso, now you can go on to answer questions about the denials of Peter, the day of the Crucifixion, Tyre, and  the fact that the author of Matthew quoted from the wrong prophet in discussing the \\\"Potter's Field.\\\"       Later,      Dave Butler\",\" I don't know where you live, but I couldn't get out of my driveway at night without reverse lights.

This \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" stuff is the seeds for nightmares to make the  Nightmare on Elmstreet cheese-on-celluloid movies look like episodes of Mr. Roger's Neighborhood.  IF the gov establishes a cryptography standard that has to be used by everyone, and everyone's personal key is divided into two segments and stored at two separate, albeit easy to find places, and that key is only 80 bits to begin with, we are screwed (pardon the allusion to the  affore-mentioned article)!  the gov, I believe, as do many others probably already have the cracking chips for this Clipper Chip made.  Hell, they probably based the encoder on the  chip that cracks it, that way it's easier to break the code, but since it is a  classified algorythm, no one knows that they can crack it so easily.  I, for one, and quite scared of this kind of thing, and plan to support  organizations (and even disorganizations) who are fighting against this Clipper Chip in any way that I can.  I do not want the government to be able to have access, even with a search warrant, to my keys... and I don't want those keys to be only 80 bits long to begin with!  -nate sammons\",\"    It's not really their _decision_ to be tried. The rulings _do_ have legal consequences, but only in Islamic law and not in UK law (this should be obvious). Enforcing a judgment is distinct from the making of a judgment.

EDT               THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  The speech that  Octavius gave says more than anything I will be able to say today  about why it's important to give all of our young people a chance to  get a work experience and to continue to learn, to merge the nature  of learning and work; why it's important to honor the efforts of  people like Jerry Levin and Nancye Combs and Pat Irving and all of  those who are here.                I want to thank the Secretaries of Labor and Education  and all the people who work with them for sponsoring this; and my  good friend, Governor Wilder, for being here and for speaking; and  all of the business and local community leaders from the city and  county and state level from around America who are here.               This has been a pretty fun day.  (Laughter.)  I loved  hearing the young people sing.  It was music to my ears because it is  their future that we are really struggling about.  (Applause.)  A  year and a half ago I began the quest to seek the presidency because  I was concerned about their future.  Because I believe that our  country, which had always been a beacon of hope for the young, had  too little opportunity, was too divided among ourselves across lines  of income and race and region and other ways, without a vision to  take us into the future.                I entered with the hope that together we could create  more opportunity and insist on much more responsibility from all of  our people.  But in the process we might recreate the best of  America's community, knowing that together we could always to more  than we could individually and that we might secure our future.              All of you here today are committed to that.  The 1,000  jobs that Jerry Levin has committed Time-Warner to is symbolic of the  commitments made by many of the private sector people who are here,  and those who are around the country.  The work that Nancye Combs  does, and the successes of all the young people like those on this  stage, and especially the eloquent statement Octavius Jeffers -- all  those things show that together we know what we need to do, and we're  on the right track.              Last July when I was traveling across America's  heartland in my luxurious bus, I visited Seneca High School in  Louisville, Kentucky.  And there I met young people and business  people who were participating in the Louisville Education and  Employment Partnership.  I saw what Nancye Combs talked about today.   I saw how the young people were making an extra effort to succeed  both in school and at work.  I saw, as I have seen many times in my  own state, the principle illustrated that Octavius has talked about  -- that for millions of American young people it is really an  impediment to both their learning and their ability to be good  workers to draw a sharp dividing line between what is work and what  is learning.              In the world in which we are living, the average young  person will change the nature of work seven or eight times in a  lifetime.  We must learn to merge the work world and the learning  world much better.  And we must determine that all of our young  people see the opportunities that some of them have had showcased  here today.                Whether you're in business or in government or in  education, you know that we have a big job to do when it comes to  building a future that really, honestly includes opportunity for all  of our people.  There are still a lot of people who say, well, things  are pretty good here in Washington and everything's fine; the best  thing we can do about this whole thing is nothing.  They all have  jobs.  (Laughter.)  All the people who say that.  (Applause.)                They all have health insurance.  They all have a pretty  good education.  And they all have a pretty secure knowledge that  they'll be okay no matter what happens.  I say that not to be either  political or unduly critical, but to point out that one of the great  challenges of this age for every advanced nation -- everyone -- is to  fully develop the capacities of all of its people, and then find work  for them to do.              All the European countries have higher unemployment  rates than we do, but also stronger support systems for the  unemployed.  The Japanese unemployment rate has been going up.   They're going to adopt a stimulus that, even if you count it in its  most rigorous terms, is three or four times bigger than the one that  I have proposed to create jobs.               In West Germany alone, the unemployment rate is now  about as high as ours.  This is a big problem for advanced nations.   It costs a lot of money to add an extra employee, with a lot of  pressure from low-wage producers in other countries that are growing  their own economies and trying to provide new opportunity for their  people.                But it is especially important for America for two  reasons:  One is, we have a whole lot of folks who, unless we move  aggressively, will not have the education and skills we need to be  competitive and productive in a nation like this.  The second is,  even if we educate them all, if there aren't jobs they will be robbed  of the fruits of their educational labors.  People need to be able to  work in this country.  (Applause.)              We have always had some unemployment; and, indeed, some  of it is normal.  You've always got some people leaving jobs and  moving around the country and doing first one thing and another.  We  have now, at this moment in our history, the necessity for all big  organizations, including the government, to reexamine the way they  are organized and who ask whether there are too many people working  at some kinds of jobs.  But in the whole, we must still be able to  create jobs in a country like America, to provide people with the  chance to work.                It's going to be difficult for me to make the welfare  reform proposals that I will make to Congress in the next couple of  months -- it's going to be hard for me to make those work if, at the  end of all this work, to get off welfare there isn't a job.   (Applause.)              So we have two tasks.  One is to develop the capacity of  the American people to perform without regard to race or income or  the circumstances of their birth.  The other is to make sure that  there are some opportunities for them to bring to bear for their  talent and to be rewarded with a paycheck.  It is a great challenge.   I do not pretend that all of the answers are simple.  But I know if  you want to ask the American people, all of them, to be more  responsible, if you want to recreate a sense of community in this  country that bridges the lines of race and income and region, you  have got to have opportunity in that mix.               A part of our vision for America has to be a future for  every young person in this country who's willing to play by the rules  and work hard and strive for the end of the rainbow.  There has to be  something at the end of that rainbow.  And that is what we are  basically here to talk about today:  What can we all do as partners,  recognizing none of us can do it alone, to develop the capacities of  our people to succeed wherever they live and whatever their  background.  And then, what can we do to make sure that there's  something there for them to do?        The summer jobs program we're discussing today is an  integral part of that plan, because it will promote the values of  work and opportunity and fairness, community.  It will put the people  first, and it does have a partnership between the public and private  sector.              I said when I addressed the United States Congress in  February on this program that I would seek to create about 700,000  extra summer jobs from government sources and then challenge the  American business community to meet that target so that we can create   more than a million new summer jobs over and above what had been  created before.              Many, many people have responded to that challenge.  And  Jerry is just a shining example of that which has been replicated in  this room and around the country -- people who are going to do more  than they otherwise would in the private sector to give young people  a work experience.  And it is terribly important.              I want to emphasize that this summer jobs program is  part of an overall commitment to increase the capacity of the  American people -- from retraining defense workers who lose their  jobs and other adults who need to acquire new skills; to improving  the transition from school to work for young people who don't go to  college but do need at least two years of post-high school training  either on the job or in a community college or a vocational setting,  so that they can be competitive workers, making it possible for more  people to go on to college who do want to go.              All these things are part and parcel of a comprehensive  plan.  It's also important, as I said, that we create more jobs.  The  emergency jobs program that I asked the Congress to adopt would  create a half a million extra jobs over the next year and a half, and  that would reduce the unemployment rate by a half a percent.  It  would also enable us to absorb more young people coming into the work  force in jobs that otherwise will not be created.               It also will help a lot of cities and counties to  invest in things that need to be done at the grass-roots level -- projects long delayed, water projects, sewer projects, park projects,  new industries and particularly in small and medium-size communities  -- a whole range of things that will improve the economy and improve  the environment.                The summer jobs program is an important part of that  because we have tried for the first time, through the work of the  Labor Department and the Education Department and through reaching  out to people like you, to make this more than just a one-shot summer  jobs program; to integrate it with private sector efforts; to  hopefully replicate it in each coming summer; to move these young  people into further educational opportunities and to further job  opportunities; and to have a strong, meaningful education component  to these summer jobs -- something that the United States government  has never fully emphasized before.                A lot of these young people, as you well know, because  they come from difficult backgrounds, because they go to school in  difficult and challenging circumstances, need extra help in building  their basic skills in math and language, reasoning and in other  areas.  And a lot of educational studies show that young people who  have difficulty in school often forget as much as 30 percent of what  they learn over the summer and then that has to be repeated the next  year.                What we are trying to do here is to give people the  opportunity to learn good work habits and to reinforce their learning  skills and to put them together; and then, hopefully, over the next  couple of years, if our entire program passes, to give every school  in this country the opportunity to have a good work and learning  environment.                There will be more applied academics, more opportunities  for people to learn and work during the school year, so that this  will not simply be an isolated moment for these young folks, but will  be a part of building a whole new educational experience, a whole new  work experience, and moving on a pathway to a better future.              The summer jobs programs are not designed to be make- work jobs.  They're designed to make a future for the people holding  the job.  And that's what they will do.  In the process, they'll help  to build local communities, to strengthen local economies, to solve  local problems.  Real jobs -- renovating housing, repairing public  buildings, doing clerical work, providing nursing assistance in  hospitals, supervising and training children at child care centers,  and learning all the way.  Challenging young people to learn while  they earn, but letting them earn.              You know, it's very difficult to make a case to people  who have never seen opportunity on their own street that they should  do this, that, or the other thing if there's no evidence of the  opportunity that's at the end of the effort.  I have not been sparing  in going for the last year-and-a-half into places where it isn't  exactly popular to say it, and say I wanted to reform the welfare  system; I wanted to toughen child support; I wanted to require people  to work; I was sick and tired of people being irresponsible in the  use of guns on the streets, and I wanted to change all that.  But if  you're going to summon people to greater responsibility, you have to  reward them when they do the right thing with opportunity.   (Applause.)              The young people we propose to put to work under our  program will spend 90 hours learning basic skills, such as math,  reading, writing -- either on the job in the classroom.  They will  stretch their minds as well as work up a sweat.  They will have a  sense of accomplishment.  It will literally be a summer challenge,  but a challenge that will take them into a different life.              So I want to ask all of you to support this effort even  as I, as your President, support your effort.  At the end of the  summer we will evaluate all the young people who participate.  We'll  see whether they, instead of falling behind over the summer  academically as too many young people do, they stayed even or moved  ahead.  I suspect that they will.                This summer, Secretary Reich and Secretary Riley and I  will be visiting many of your communities.  We'll really try to learn  from you which of these efforts are working, what we should do next  summer, how we can build it in to what goes on during the school  year, how we can build in our job training efforts and the works that  we do with your companies to make sense of this whole thing -- so  that we maximize the impact of the taxpayer dollar and your private  investments as well.               We want to honor the companies and the communities, the  business leaders and the young people who do the very best jobs this  summer.  And, again, I want to say to all of you in private business  who have matched our effort, I thank you.  And to all of you who  haven't, and those across the country who may listen or learn about  this event today, I want to implore other private employers to  stretch a little bit to give other young people a chance to work this  summer.  I'm telling you, we cannot go through another 10 years when  we don't give these children anything to say yes to.  If we exhort  them to do right, we've got to be able to reward them.  (Applause.)              When the other speakers were talking, I was sitting up  here on the platform, listening and reveling.  And they got talking  about work, and I got to thinking about all the different things I've  done to make a living in my life.  When I was 13, I made a very  foolish short-term business investment:  I set up a comic book stand  and sold two trunks full of comic books.  Made more money than I had  ever had in my life.  But if I had saved those trunks, they'd be  worth $100,000 today.  (Laughter.)              That does not mean young people should not be  entrepreneurial.  It just means that you can't foresee a generation  ahead.  I have mowed yards and cleared land and built houses and  worked in body shops and the parts departments of a car dealership.   And I've done a lot of different things for a living.  Some  people say I got into politics to escape work.  (Laughter.)                I learned something from every job I ever had.  But I  grew up in a generation where I literally did not know a living soul  without regard to race or income who wanted to work who didn't have a  job.  I grew up in a generation when all you had to really say to  people is, get an education and you'll be all right.  You'll get a  job and you'll make more money next year than you did this year.  Now  I live in a generation full of people, most of whom don't make any  more money in real dollars than they did 10 years ago and they're  working longer hours and they're paying more for the basics of life.   And we are now wondering whether we can create the jobs that these  young people want.              Now, I want to close by reemphasizing these two things:   It doesn't matter what kind of economic policies this administration  pursues, or how much productivity increases there are in the private  sector, if young Americans don't get a good education, don't learn  how to work and can't be productive, those jobs will not be created  in this country.  Machines will do the work or the work will be done  off-shore by people who have the same skill levels and can work for a  third or a fourth or a fifth the wages.  So nothing we can do  economically will matter unless we build the skills and capacities of  America's work force.  And anybody that pretends otherwise is just  kidding.                On the other hand, we need to be honest.  Every wealthy  country in the world, including the United States, is having  difficulty creating jobs.  If I knew everything that needs to be done  I'd be glad to tell you and we   could just call off the whole  deliberations of Congress and everything else.  I don't have all the  answers.  But I know this:  Doing nothing is not the answer.   (Applause.)              And so the jobs program that I have presented to  Congress, with the summer jobs, with the money for the cities and the  counties, through the Community Development Program, with the  infrastructure money, is a small part of a big budget.  It is an  attempt to engage in an experiment to see whether or not, with the  economy recovering in terms of corporate profit, we can give a little  boost to it, give opportunities to young people, create a half a  million jobs and maybe get the engine going again.              Most of the jobs in this program are going to be jobs in  the private sector, not government jobs, even though it's government  money.  And the lion's share of the work in rebuilding the American  economy obviously will come from the private sector.  That's the kind  of system we have and it works pretty well.                But this is the challenge we have.  So I ask all of you  here today to support the summer jobs program, to ask your friends  and neighbors to support it, to go back home and ask your employers  to make a little extra effort; to do what you can to help me pass the  funds to create the 700,000 jobs that the United States government  should create this summer, so that together we can have this  partnership.  Because more than anything else, we have to give a  future -- a future that our young people can believe in.                We need to send them a message that here in America if  you study hard and work hard, if you obey the law and contribute  something to your community, you will be rewarded by your country.   You can build a future from you own dreams.               That has always been the promise of America.  Together  that's what this summer of challenge needs to be:  a reaffirmation of  the promise of America for so many young people to whom that promise  has been an illusion.  We can make it a reality.              Thank you very much.  (Applause.)\",\" I would hardly consider the BD's to be Christian.  They were acting in direct contradiction to scripture.  Jesus' Second Coming is something that everyone will know of.  Jesus also predicted that there will be false Messiahs who will use His name.  His prophecy has been fulfilled.   I agree with you there.    Me too.  I have already given my life to God.  If God tells me to lay down my life, it will be to save another life.    Do you judge all Christians by the acts of those who would call themselves Christian and yet are not?  The BD's contradicted scripture in their actions.  They were NOT Christian.  Simple as that.  Perhaps you have read too much into what the media has portrayed.  Ask any true-believing Christian and you will find that they will deny any association with the BD's.  Even the 7th Day Adventists have denied any further ties with this cult, which was what they were.  Do you judge all Muslims by the acts committed by Saddam Hussein, a  supposedly devout Muslim?

My sister's ex-boyfriend was such an incessant pain in the ass about wanting to ride my bikes (no way, Jose) that I finally took him to Lindner's BMW in New Canaan, CT last fall where I had seen a nice, used K100RS in perfect condition.  After telling everyone in the shop his Norton war stories from fifteen years ago, signing the liability waiver, and getting his pre-flight, off he went...  Well, not quite.  I walked out of a pizza shop up the street, feeling good about myself (made my sister's boyfriend happy and got the persistent wanker off my ass for good), heard the horrendous racket of an engine tortured to its red line and then a crash.  I saw people running towards the obvious source of the disturbance... Jeff laying under the BMW with the rear wheel spinning wildly and someone groping for the kill switch.  I stared in disbelief with a slice hanging out of my mouth as Matty, the shop manager, slid up beside me and asked, \\\"Friend of yours, Steve?\\\".  \\\"Shit, Matty, it could have been worse.  That could been my FLHS!\\\"  Jeff hadn't made it 10 inches.  Witnesses said he lifted his feet before letting out the clutch and gravity got the best of him. Jeff claimed that the clutch didn't engage.  Matty was quick. While Jeff was still stuttering in embarrassed shock he managed to snatch Jeff's credit card for a quick imprint and signature.  Twenty minutes later, when Jeff's color had paled to a flush, Matty presented him with an estimate of $580 for a busted right mirror and a hairline crack in the fairing.  That was for fixing the crack and masking the damaged area, not a new fairing.  Or he could buy the bike.  I'm not sure what happened later as my sister split up with Jeff shortly afterwards (to hook up with another piece of work) except that Matty told me he ran the charge through in December and that it went uncontested.  \",\"Is anyone reading this message involved with the new BMW plant?

The material in John (I'm not sure exactly what is referred to here, but I'll take for granted the similarity to the Matt./Luke \\\"Q\\\" material) IS different; hence, one could have almost any relationship between the two, right up to John getting it straight from Jesus' mouth.   The version of the \\\"usual theory\\\" I have heard has Matthew and Luke independently relying on Mark and \\\"Q\\\".  One would think that if Luke relied on Matthew, we wouldn't have the grating inconsistencies in the geneologies, for one thing.   This is the part that is particularly new to me.  If it were possible that you could point me to a reference, I'd be grateful.    Because it closes up the gap between (supposed) writing and the existing copy quit a bit.

Of course, with the Jets gone to Jersey (and a truly good football stadium), the Mets are saddled with a multipurpose stadium where, because it's circular, the seats are almost always too far from the action.

Open it up and look for the power amp \\\"ICs\\\".  They'll be fairly obvious.  Replace the one connected to the dead output.    Well, one thing you should do is poke around the terminals of the power amp chips.  Use a probe with a 10M resistor (like a scope probe) connected to the input of a small audio amp w/speaker.  If you find line-level input to both chips, one of the chips is bad and can probably replaced pretty easily.

This is *before* the volume control (and usually before the tone and balance controls too).

It would, however,  be rather cruel and/or sadistic to believe that such a place exists  and then remain quiet about it.

There is such a wide variation between people with respect to what causes their headaches, that I generally don't bother sharing what I've learned about mine, but since ours seem to be alike, here are my observations.

We will assume you mean a NASA astronaut, since it's probably     impossible for a non-Russian to get into the cosmonaut corps (paying     passengers are not professional cosmonauts), and the other nations have     so few astronauts (and fly even fewer) that you're better off hoping to     win a lottery. Becoming a shuttle pilot requires lots of fast-jet     experience, which means a military flying career; forget that unless you     want to do it anyway. So you want to become a shuttle \\\"mission     specialist\\\".      If you aren't a US citizen, become one; that is a must.  After that,     the crucial thing to remember is that the demand for such jobs vastly     exceeds the supply.  NASA's problem is not finding qualified people,     but thinning the lineup down to manageable length. It is not enough     to be qualified; you must avoid being *dis*qualified for any reason,     many of them in principle quite irrelevant to the job.      Get a Ph.D.  Specialize in something that involves getting your hands     dirty with equipment, not just paper and pencil.  Forget computer     programming entirely; it will be done from the ground for the fore-     seeable future.  Degree(s) in one field plus work experience in     another seems to be a frequent winner.      Be in good physical condition, with good eyesight. (DO NOT get a     radial keratomy or similar hack to improve your vision; nobody knows     what sudden pressure changes would do to RKed eyes, and long-term     effects are poorly understood.  For that matter, avoid any other     significant medical unknowns.)  If you can pass a jet-pilot physical,     you should be okay; if you can't, your chances are poor.      Practise public speaking, and be conservative and conformist in     appearance and actions; you've got a tough selling job ahead, trying     to convince a cautious, conservative selection committee that you     are better than hundreds of other applicants.  (And, also, that you     will be a credit to NASA after you are hired:  public relations is     a significant part of the job, and NASA's image is very prim and     proper.)  The image you want is squeaky-clean workaholic yuppie.     Remember also that you will need a security clearance at some point,     and Security considers everybody guilty until proven innocent.     Keep your nose clean.      Get a pilot's license and make flying your number one hobby;     experienced pilots are known to be favored even for non-pilot jobs.      Work for NASA; of 45 astronauts selected between 1984 and 1988,     43 were military or NASA employees, and the remaining two were     a NASA consultant and Mae Jemison (the first black female astronaut).     If you apply from outside NASA and miss, but they offer you a job     at NASA, ***TAKE IT***; sometimes in the past this has meant \\\"you     do look interesting but we want to know you a bit better first\\\".      Think space:  they want highly motivated people, so lose no chance     to demonstrate motivation.      Keep trying.  Many astronauts didn't make it the first time.         NASA     National Aeronautics and Space Administration     Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center     Houston, Texas      Announcement for Mission Specialist and Pilot Astronaut Candidates     ==================================================================      Astronaut Candidate Program     ---------------------------      The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has a need for     Pilot Astronaut Candidates and Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidates     to support the Space Shuttle Program. NASA is now accepting on a     continuous basis and plans to select astronaut candidates as needed.      Persons from both the civilian sector and the military services will be     considered.      All positions are located at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in     Houston, Texas, and will involved a 1-year training and evaluation     program.      Space Shuttle Program Description     ---------------------------------      The numerous successful flights of the Space Shuttle have demonstrated     that operation and experimental investigations in space are becoming     routine. The Space Shuttle Orbiter is launched into, and maneuvers in     the Earth orbit performing missions lastling up to 30 days. It then     returns to earth and is ready for another flight with payloads and     flight crew.      The Orbiter performs a variety of orbital missions including deployment     and retrieval of satellites, service of existing satellites, operation     of specialized laboratories (astronomy, earth sciences, materials     processing, manufacturing), and other operations. These missions will     eventually include the development and servicing of a permanent space     station. The Orbiter also provides a staging capability for using higher     orbits than can be achieved by the Orbiter itself. Users of the Space     Shuttle's capabilities are both domestic and foreign and include     government agencies and private industries.      The crew normally consists of five people - the commander, the pilot,     and three mission specialists. On occasion additional crew members are     assigned. The commander, pilot, and mission specialists are NASA     astronauts.      Pilot Astronaut      Pilot astronauts server as both Space Shuttle commanders and pilots.     During flight the commander has onboard responsibility for the vehicle,     crew, mission success and safety in flight. The pilot assists the     commander in controlling and operating the vehicle. In addition, the     pilot may assist in the deployment and retrieval of satellites utilizing     the remote manipulator system, in extra-vehicular activities, and other     payload operations.      Mission Specialist Astronaut      Mission specialist astronauts, working with the commander and pilot,     have overall responsibility for the coordination of Shuttle operations     in the areas of crew activity planning, consumables usage, and     experiment and payload operations. Mission specialists are required to     have a detailed knowledge of Shuttle systems, as well as detailed     knowledge of the operational characteristics, mission requirements and     objectives, and supporting systems and equipment for each of the     experiments to be conducted on their assigned missions. Mission     specialists will perform extra-vehicular activities, payload handling     using the remote manipulator system, and perform or assist in specific     experimental operations.

Citizenship Requirements      Applications for the Astronaut Candidate Program must be citizens of     the United States.      Note on Academic Requirements      Applicants for the Astronaut Candidate Program must meet the basic     education requirements for NASA engineering and scientific positions --     specifically: successful completion of standard professional curriculum     in an accredited college or university leading to at least a bachelor's     degree with major study in an appropriate field of engineering,     biological science, physical science, or mathematics.        The following degree fields, while related to engineering and the     sciences, are not considered qualifying:       - Degrees in technology (Engineering Technology, Aviation Technology,  Medical Technology, etc.)       - Degrees in Psychology (except for Clinical Psychology, Physiological  Psychology, or Experimental Psychology which are qualifying).       - Degrees in Nursing.       - Degrees in social sciences (Geography, Anthropology, Archaeology, etc.)       - Degrees in Aviation, Aviation Management or similar fields.      Application Procedures     ----------------------      Civilian      The application package may be obtained by writing to:   NASA Johnson Space Center  Astronaut Selection Office  ATTN: AHX  Houston, TX 77058      Civilian applications will be accepted on a continuous basis. When NASA     decides to select additional astronaut candidates, consideration will be     given only to those applications on hand on the date of decision is     made. Applications received after that date will be retained and     considered for the next selection. Applicants will be notified annually     of the opportunity to update their applications and to indicate     continued interest in being considered for the program. Those applicants     who do not update their applications annually will be dropped from     consideration, and their applications will not be retained. After the     preliminary screening of applications, additional information may be     requested for some applicants, and person listed on the application as     supervisors and references may be contacted.      Active Duty Military      Active duty military personnel must submit applications to their     respective military service and not directly to NASA. Application     procedures will be disseminated by each service.      Selection     ---------      Personal interviews and thorough medical evaluations will be required     for both civilian and military applicants under final consideration.     Once final selections have been made, all applicants who were considered     will be notified of the outcome of the process.      Selection rosters established through this process may be used for the     selection of additional candidates during a one year period following     their establishment.      General Program Requirements      Selected applicants will be designated Astronaut Candidates and will be     assigned to the Astronaut Office at the Johnson Space Center, Houston,     Texas. The astronaut candidates will undergo a 1 year training and     evaluation period during which time they will be assigned technical or     scientific responsibilities allowing them to contribute substantially to     ongoing programs. They will also participate in the basic astronaut     training program which is designed to develop the knowledge and skills     required for formal mission training upon selection for a flight. Pilot     astronaut candidates will maintain proficiency in NASA aircraft during     their candidate period.      Applicants should be aware that selection as an astronaut candidate does     not insure selection as an astronaut. Final selection as an astronaut     will depend on satisfactory completion of the 1 year training and     evaluation period. Civilian candidates who successfully complete the     training and evaluation and are selected as astronauts will become     permanent Federal employees and will be expected to remain with NASA for     a period of at least five years. Civilian candidates who are not     selected as astronauts may be placed in other positions within NASA     depending upon Agency requirements and manpower constraints at that     time. Successful military candidates will be detailed to NASA for a     specified tour of duty.      NASA has an affirmative action program goal of having qualified     minorities and women among those qualified as astronaut candidates.     Therefore, qualified minorities and women are encouraged to apply.      Pay and Benefits     ----------------      Civilians      Salaries for civilian astronaut candidates are based on the Federal     Governments General Schedule pay scales for grades GS-11 through GS-14,     and are set in accordance with each individuals academic achievements     and experience.      Other benefits include vacation and sick leave, a retirement plan, and     participation in group health and life insurance plans.      Military      Selected military personnel will be detailed to the Johnson Space Center     but will remain in an active duty status for pay, benefits, leave, and     other similar military matters. \",\"According to BBC Radio this morning, UK, Denmark, Portugal & a few others have vetoed a proposal to limit EC-sold bikes to 100 BHP.

This day marked the first testimony of the trial.  Deputy U.S. Marshal Larry Cooper took the stand for the prosecution.  The short version is that his testimony was consistent with the opening statements for the prosecution.  Cooper testified that he had arrived in Spokane (Washington) on August 17, 1992 to participate in a surveillance operation with five other deputies near the Weaver cabin.  The team was using night vision equipment for surveillance, and split up into two teams of three people.  The six later met at an observation point above the cabin.  After this, deputies Cooper, William Degan, and Arthur Roderick began a descent to scout further possible surveillance sites.  Cooper told the court that Roderick threw two large rocks into a gully to see, \\\"whether the [Weaver family] dogs would respond.\\\" Striker, the Weaver's yellow lab, started toward them barking loudly.  Roderick led the three in a run from the area.  They ran through some dense woods into an open area [called the \\\"fern field\\\"] with the dog in pursuit.  By this time, Kevin Harris and Samuel Weaver had joined the chase.  The surveillance team had reached a Y in the road: Cooper decided that they should take cover in the woods because otherwise they would be an easy target and might be \\\"shot in the back.\\\"  As Degan reached the Y, he spotted Randy Weaver coming down the road from the cabin ahead.  Weaver was startled but did not fire.  At this moment, Striker reached Degan, and Cooper had to \\\"fend him off with his gun.\\\"  [It is unclear whether this means he clubbed the dog or shot the dog].  Both Cooper and Degan then took cover in the woods.  According to Cooper, Kevin Harris and Samuel Weaver continued walking down the road, apparently not noticing the two.  After they had passed by on the road, Degan got up on one knee, raised his gun, and shouted, \\\"Stop!  U.S. Marshal!\\\"  Harris then \\\"...brought the weapon around at hip level and fired.  He didn't bring the weapon up to eye level.  I saw Bill's arm going back, and I knew he had been hit.\\\"  Cooper fired at Harris, and Harris went down.  Cooper then brought his weapon to bear on Samuel, but did not fire.  At this point, Cooper then heard two shots to his right.  Samuel Weaver looked in the direction of the shots, yelled, \\\"You son of a bitch!\\\" and ran toward them.  Cooper then realized that shots were coming at him from directly ahead, so he fired a three-round burst at the cabin.  At this point he then saw Samuel Weaver running toward the cabin.  When Cooper reached Degan, he placed his first two fingers on Degan carotid artery, counted two or three beats, and then his heart stopped.  Shortly thereafter, Roderick and the other three marshals joined him.  They then all heard a large burst of gunfire from the area around the cabin.  On cross-examination, David Nevin questioned the point of throwing rocks into the gulley, asking, \\\"You wanted to lure that dog out so you could shoot that dog, didn't you?\\\"  Nevin also pointed out that in last September's testimony, Cooper had claimed that he spotted Weaver after the dog had left him. Cooper claimed that he had gone over the events in his head and decided that Thursday's account was correct.  Nevin continued the cross-examination by asking what Cooper would have done had an armed man dressed in full camouflage jumped out of the woods at him [no answer was available].  Friday, April 16 marks continued cross-examination of Cooper.  Notes: There was no coverage of protestors.  Drew ============================================================== \",\" That's nothing.

The original documentation for the sound hardware (IM-3) documents how to make sound by directly accessing hardware.  Basically, you jam values into all the even bytes from SoundBase to SoundBase+0x170. This was because of how the Mac 128 (and some later machines) generated sound was by scanning this block and D/Aing every even byte (the odd bytes went to the floppy on some machines).  When the Mac II (and Apple Sound Chip) was invented, it was designed to generate stereo sound. It was also designed to be compatible with we had once documented. So storing bytes at the even values at SoundBase meant \\\"I want to play a mono sound\\\" and so it was emulated. But Apple had since retracted the documentation on SoundBase and decided not to document the lowest layers of sound generation. So apple never explained where to stuff bytes if you want to make stereo sound.  Enter game developers. The sound driver and current sound manager are inconveniently lame for making games. Furthermore, people who port from the IBM don't want to learn more APIs. So, it has become popular for game writers to write to SoundBase to make sound, since it is very easy.  Since the Mac II, Apple has had many different kind of sound output hardware, and the only things they have in common are that writing to SoundBase works. On some hardware, (Mac II, IIx, IIcx, IIci at least), writing to SoundBase gets you mono sound through both speakers. On some Macs (Quadra 700/900/950 at least) writing to SoundBase gets you mono sound on the left channel only. Both are technically correct interpretations of the original specification, but one is obviously preferable for asthetic reasons.  If developers use the Sound Manager (and I think the sound driver), mono sounds will (typically) come out through both channels regardless of the underlying hardware. It is possible to specify you want to generate left channel only, but no one does. If developers write to sound base, their games will only come out the left on some games.  The other problem, the original Mac II only producing left channel sound on the internal speaker, while the SE/30 mixes both, isn't really related. It is due to the post generation amplification used on the motherboards of the different machines. It only affects true stereo sounds. Sounds which are actually mono, will play on the internal speaker, no matter what machine you have.  Now, to more directly address the question, the games you list: and also Hellcats, Super Tetris Oxyd (and many more, these are just what I've tested)  Cheat and write to SoundBase and so are only left channel on Quadras.   Other games you list: and also PGA Tour Golf Civilization (and more, these are again only from personal experience)  Use the sound manager and work fine on all machines.  The more of the story is to developers: DON'T CHEAT! Really, I am absolutely, positively not allowed to do what I am about to do, but I'm going say it anyway. Stop cheating on sound! Really soon, you will be sorry, as even those without external speakers will be disappointed with your sound on future hardware. The grace period is about to end. The Sound Manager is understandable now, and works pretty well and will work even better soon, so use it.  In conclusion: To Doug, it isn't a hardware problem, at least, not a bug. To Jon, it isn't a choice to developers as to whether they want to send sound to both channels. If they do it the right way, it is taken care of automatically. If you cheat, there is not way to make it work on all hardware.   Have fun.  Disclaimer number 1: I don't work on sound here at Apple, I'm just pretty well informed. So don't write me with sound questions.  Disclaimer number 2: If it says up above that I wrote anything like \\\"the grace period is about to end\\\" then it is a bug in your news feed, since I am catagorically not allowed to say anything like that. You know what I mean.

Most of my friends are anti-gun, and without exception NONE of them bases his/her opinions on facts. They would rather believe (despite all evidence to the contrary) that disarming law-abiding citizens would make the world more civilized, when all it really does is make us all sheep. They  would rather wallow in their pitiful liberal white guilt about how society has driven the criminal to rob, rape, and murder. They  support spending millions of public dollars protecting the rights of scum who have already demonstrated that they have no regard for society or its laws. They ignore the fact that areas with the strictest gun control (NYC,DC) have the worst crime and areas with little gun control (VT,NH,ID) have very little crime in comparison. But they have to ignore this because otherwise they would need to confront the fact that law-abiding citizens who own guns are not the ones that are causing most of the trouble in society.

Anthony Fauci, director of the  U.S.  National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID),  said,  \\\"We must address the question of how to treat people as  early as we possibly  can with drugs that are safe enough to give  people for years and that will  get around microbial resistance.\\\"  He said any delay would signify questions  over safety and  resistance rather than a lack of funds.

John Tew of the Medical College of  Virginia in Richmond claims that the new evidence strongly backs the argument  for  early treatment of HIV-infected patients.

This finding  supports previous conclusions by health  experts that the chance of  contracting HIV from a health care  worker is remote.  Three studies in the  JAMA demonstrate that  thousands of patients were treated by two HIV-positive  surgeons  and dentists without becoming infected with the virus.  The  studies  were conducted by separate research teams in New  Hampshire, Maryland, and  Florida.  Each study started with an  HIV-positive doctor or dentist and  tested all patients willing to participate.  The New Hampshire study found  that none of the  1,174 patients who had undergone invasive procedures by an   HIV-positive orthopedic surgeon contracted HIV.

The Florida researchers, led by  Gordon  M. Dickinson of the University of Miami School of Medicine, said,  \\\"This study indicates that the risk for transmission of HIV from  a general  dentist to his patients is minimal in a setting in  which universal  precautions are strictly observed.\\\"   Related Story: Philadelphia Inquirer  (04/14) P.

The OAM is a small division of  the NIH, with its budget only at $2  million dollars compared to more than $10  billion for the NIH as  a whole.  In addition, the money for available  research grants is even smaller.  About $500,000 to $600,000 total will be  available this year for 10 or 20 grants.  Kaiya Montaocean, of the Center  for  Natural and Traditional Medicine in Washington, D.C., says  the OAM is afraid  to become involved in AIDS.  \\\"They have to look successful and there is no  easy answer in AIDS,\\\" she said.    There is also a common perception that the  OAM will focus on  fields the NIH establishment will find non-threatening,  such as  relaxation techniques and acupuncture.  When the OAM called for  an  advisory committee conference of about 120 people last year,  the AIDS  community was largely missing from the meeting.  In  addition, activists'  general lack of contact with the Office has  added suspicion that the epidemic  will be ignored.  Jon  Greenberg, of ACT-UP/New York, said, \\\"The OAM advisory  panel is  composed of practitioners without real research experience.  It   will take them several years to accept the nature of research.\\\"    Nevertheless,  Dr. Leanna Standish, research director and AIDS  investigator  at the Bastyr College of Naturopathic Medicine in  Seattle, said, \\\"Here is a  wonderful opportunity to fund AIDS  research.

Scientists conducting test tube experiments have found that  herpesvirus- 6 can attack the human immune system's natural killer cells.  This attack  causes the killer cells to malfunction,  diminishing an important component in  the immune system's fight  against diseases.  Also, the herpesvirus-6 may be a  factor in  immune diseases, such as AIDS.  In 1989, Paolo Lusso's research   found that herpesvirus-6 attacks another white cell, the CD4  T-lymphocyte,  which is the primary target of HIV.  Lusso also  found that herpesvirus-6 can   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 44 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  kill natural killer cells.   Scientists previously knew that the natural  killer cells of  patients infected with HIV do not work correctly.  Lusso's   research represents the first time scientists have indicated that natural  killer cells are vulnerable to any kind of viral attack,  according to Anthony  L. Komaroff, a researcher with Harvard  Medical School.  Despite the test-tube  findings, scientists are  uncertain whether the same result occurs in the  body.  Lusso's  team also found that herpesvirus-6 produces the CD4 receptor   molecule that provides access for HIV.  CD4 T-lymphocytes express this surface  receptor, making them vulnerable to HIV's attack.   Researchers concluded that  herpesvirus-6 cells can exacerbate the affects of HIV.       ======================================================================                                    April 15, 1993       ====================================================================     \\\"AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village: To the Editor\\\" Journal of the  American Medical Association (04/07/93) Vol. 269,  No. 13, P. 1636  (Gellert,  George and Nordenberg, Dale F.)        All health-care workers are obligated and responsible for not  only  ensuring that politicians understand the dimensions of  certain health  problems, but also to be committed to related  policies, write George Gellert  and Dale F. Nordenberg of the  Orange County Health Care Agency, Santa Ana,  Calif., and the  Emory University School of Public Health in Atlanta, Ga.,   respectively.  Dr. Berkley's editorial on why American doctors  should care  about the AIDS epidemic beyond the United States  details several reasons for  the concerted interest that all  countries share in combating AIDS.  It should  be noted that while AIDS leads in hastening global health interdependence, it  is not  the only illness doing so.  Diseases such as malaria and many   respiratory and intestinal pathogens have similarly inhibited the economic  development of most of humanity and acted to marginalize large populations.   Berkley mentions the enormous social and  economic impact that AIDS will have  on many developing countries, and the increased need for international  assistance that will  result.  Berkley also cites the lack of political  aggressiveness  toward the AIDS epidemic in its first decade.  But now there  is a new administration with a promise of substantial differences in  approach  to international health and development in general, and  HIV/AIDS in  particular.  Vice President Al Gore proposes in his  book \\\"Earth in the  Balance\\\" a major environmental initiative that includes sustainable  international development, with programs to  promote literacy, improve child  survival, and disseminate  contraceptive technology and access throughout the  developing  world.  If enacted, this change in policy could drastically   change the future of worldwide health.  ====================================================================    \\\"AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village: In Reply\\\" Journal of the American   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 45 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  Medical Association (04/07/93) Vol. 269,  No. 13, P. 1636  (Berkley, Seth)        Every nation should tackle HIV as early and aggressively as    possible  before the disease reaches an endemic state, even at a  cost of diverting less  attention to some other illnesses, writes  Seth Berkley of the Rockefeller  Foundation in New York, N.Y., in  reply to a letter by Drs. Gellert and  Nordenberg.  Although it is true that diseases other than AIDS, such as  malaria and  respiratory and intestinal illnesses, have similarly inhibited   economic development in developing countries and deserve much  more attention  than they are getting, Berkley disagrees with the  contention that AIDS is  receiving too much attention.  HIV  differs from other diseases, in most  developing countries because it is continuing to spread.  For most endemic  diseases, the  outcome of neglecting interventions for one year is another  year  of about the same level of needless disease and death.  But with  AIDS  and its increasing spread, the cost of neglect, not only in  disease burden  but financially, is much greater.  Interventions  in the early part of a  rampantly spreading epidemic like HIV are  highly cost-effective because each  individual infection prevented significantly interrupts transmission.  Berkley  says he agrees  with Gellert and Nordenberg about the gigantic social and   economic effects of AIDS and about the need for political  leadership.  But he  concludes that not only is assertive  political leadership needed in the  United States for the AIDS  epidemic, but even more so in developing countries  with high  rates of HIV infection and where complacency about the epidemic   has been the rule.

The trial will compare the safety of three HIV experimental vaccines in 90  children recruited from at least 12 sites nationwide. Volunteers must be HIV- infected but have no symptoms of HIV disease.   HHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala said this initial study can be seen as \\\"a  hopeful milestone in our efforts to ameliorate the tragedy of HIV-infected  children who now face the certainty they will develop AIDS.\\\"   Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., director of the National Institute of Allergy and  Infectious Diseases and of the NIH Office of AIDS Research, said the trial \\\"is  the first step in finding out whether vaccines can help prevent or delay  disease progression in children with HIV who are not yet sick.\\\"  If these  vaccines prove to be safe, more sophisticated questions about their  therapeutic potential will be assessed in Phase II trials.   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 10,000 children in  the United States have HIV.  By the end of the decade, the World Health  Organization projects 10 million children will be infected worldwide.   The study will enroll children ages 1 month to 12 years old.  NIAID, which  funds the AIDS Clinical Trials Group network, anticipates conducting the trial  at nine ACTG sites around  the country and three sites participating in the  ACTG but funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human  Development.   Preliminary evidence from similar studies under way in infected adults shows  that certain vaccines can boost existing HIV-specific immune responses and   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 47 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  stimulate new ones.  It will be several years, however, before researchers  know how these responses affect the clinical course of the disease.   The results from the pediatric trial, known as ACTG 218, will be examined  closely for other reasons as well.  \\\"This trial will provide the first insight  into how the immature immune system responds to candidate HIV vaccines,\\\" said  Daniel Hoth, M.D., director of NIAID's division of AIDS.  \\\"We need this  information to design trials to test whether experimental vaccines can prevent  HIV infection in children.\\\"   In the United States, most HIV-infected children live in poor inner-city  areas, and more than 80 percent are minorities, mainly black or Hispanic.   Nearly all HIV-infected children acquire the virus from their mothers during  pregnancy  or at birth.  An infected mother in the United States has more than  a one in four chance of transmitting the virus to her baby.  As growing  numbers of women of childbearing age become exposed to HIV through injection  drug use or infected sexual partners, researchers expect a corresponding  increase in the numbers of infected children.   HIV disease progresses more rapidly in infants and children than in adults.   The most recent information suggests that 50 percent of infants born with HIV  develop a serious AIDS-related infection by 3 to 6 years of age.  These  infections include severe or frequent bouts of common bacterial illnesses of  childhood that can result in seizures, pneumonia, diarrhea and other symptoms  leading to nutritional problems and long hospital stays.   At least half of the children in the trial will be 2 years of age or younger  to enable comparison of the immune responses of the younger and older  participants.  All volunteers must have well-documented HIV infection but no  symptoms of HIV disease other than swollen lymph glands or a mildly swollen  liver or spleen.  They cannot have received any anti-retroviral or immune- regulating drugs within one month prior to their entry into the study.   Study chair John S. Lambert, M.D., of the University of Rochester Medical  School, and co- chair Samuel Katz, M.D., of Duke University School of  Medicine, will coordinate the trial assisted by James McNamara, M.D., medical  officer in the pediatric medicine branch of NIAID's division of AIDS.   \\\"We will compare the safety of the vaccines by closely monitoring the children  for any side effects, to see if one vaccine produces more swollen arms or  fevers, for example, than another,\\\" said Dr. McNamara.  \\\"We'll also look at  whether low or high doses of the vaccines stimulate immune responses or other  significant laboratory or clinical effects.\\\"   He emphasized that the small  study size precludes comparing these responses or effects among the three   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 48 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  products.   The trial will test two doses each of three experimental vaccines made from  recombinant HIV proteins.  These so-called subunit vaccines, each genetically  engineered to contain only a piece of the virus, have so far proved well- tolerated in ongoing trials in HIV-infected adults.   One vaccine made by MicroGeneSys Inc. of Meriden, Conn., contains gp160--a  protein  that gives rise to HIV's surface proteins--plus alum adjuvant.   Adjuvants boost specific immune responses to a vaccine.  Presently, alum is  the only adjuvant used in human vaccines licensed by the Food and Drug  Administration.   Both of the other vaccines--one made by Genentech Inc. of South San Francisco  and the other by Biocine, a joint venture of Chiron and CIBA-Geigy, in  Emeryville, Calif.--contain the major HIV surface protein, gp120, plus  adjuvant.  The Genentech vaccine contains alum, while the Biocine vaccine  contains MF59, an experimental adjuvant that has proved safe and effective in  other Phase I vaccine trials in adults.   A low dose of each product will be tested first against a placebo in 15  children.  Twelve children will be assigned at random to be immunized with the  experimental vaccine, and three children will be given adjuvant alone,  considered the placebo.  Neither the health care workers nor the children will  be told what they receive.   If the low dose is well-tolerated, controlled testing of a higher dose of the  experimental vaccine and adjuvant placebo in another group of 15 children will  begin.   Each child will receive six immunizations--one every four weeks for six  months--and be followed-up for 24 weeks after the last immunization.

They report that HIV itself, not an opportunistic infection, caused scaling  skin conditions to develop in mice carrying the genes for HIV.  Although the  HIV genes were active in the mice, they did not compromise the animals'  immunity, the researchers found.  This led them to conclude that the HIV  itself caused the skin disease.   Our findings support a growing body of evidence that HIV can cause disease  without affecting the immune system, said lead author Dr. Jeffrey Kopp of the  National Institute of Dental Research (NIDR).  Dr. Kopp and his colleagues  described their study in the March issue of AIDS Research and Human  Retroviruses.   Developing animal models of HIV infection has been difficult, since most  animals, including mice, cannot be infected by the virus.  To bypass this  problem, scientists have developed HIV-transgenic mice, which carry genes for  HIV as well as their own genetic material.   NIDR scientists created the transgenic mice by injecting HIV genes into mouse  eggs and then implanting the eggs into female mice.  The resulting litters  contained both normal and transgenic animals.   Institute scientists had created mice that carried a complete copy of HIV  genetic material in l988.  Those mice, however, became sick and died too soon  after birth to study in depth.  In the present study, the scientists used an  incomplete copy of HIV, which allowed the animals to live longer.   Some of the transgenic animals developed scaling, wart-like tumors on their  necks and backs.  Other transgenic mice developed thickened, crusting skin  lesions that covered most of their bodies, resembling psoriasis in humans.  No  skin lesions developed in their normal, non-transgenic littermates.   Studies of tissue taken from the wart-like skin tumors showed that they were a  type of noncancerous tumor called papilloma. Although the papillomavirus can  cause these skin lesions, laboratory tests showed no sign of that virus in the  animals.   Tissue samples taken from the sick mice throughout the study revealed the  presence of a protein-producing molecule made by the HIV genetic material.    HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 50 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  Evidence of HIV protein production proved that the viral genes were \\\"turned  on,\\\" or active, said Dr. Kopp.   The scientists found no evidence, however, of compromised immunity in the  mice:  no increase in their white blood cell count and no signs of common  infections.  The fact that HIV genes were active but the animals' immune  systems were not suppressed confirms that the virus itself was causing the  skin lesions, Dr. Kopp said.   Further proof of HIV gene involvement came from a test in which the scientists  exposed the transgenic animals to ultraviolet light.  The light increased HIV  genetic activity causing papillomas to develop on formerly healthy skin.   Papilloma formation in response to increased HIV genetic activity proved the  genes were responsible for the skin condition, the scientists said.  No  lesions appeared on normal mice exposed to the UV light.   The transgenic mice used in this study were developed at NIDR by Dr. Peter  Dickie, who is now with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious  Diseases.   Collaborating on the study with Dr. Kopp were Mr. Charles Wohlenberg, Drs.  Nickolas Dorfman, Joseph Bryant, Abner Notkins, and Paul Klotman, all of NIDR;  Dr. Stephen Katz of the National Cancer Institute; and Dr. James Rooney,  formerly with NIDR and now with Burroughs Wellcome.

Shalala today announced the first nationwide  clinical consultation telephone service for doctors and other health care  professionals who have questions about providing care to people with HIV  infection or AIDS.       The toll-free National HIV Telephone Consulting Service is staffed by a  physician, a nurse practitioner and a pharmacist. It provides information on  drugs, clinical trials and the latest treatment methods.  The service is  funded by the Health Resources and Services Administration and operates out of  San Francisco General Hospital.       Secretary Shalala said, \\\"One goal of this project is to share expertise  so patients get the best care.  A second goal is to get more primary health  care providers involved in care for people with HIV or AIDS, which reduces  treatment cost by allowing patients to remain with their medical providers and  community social support networks.  Currently, many providers refer patients  with HIV or AIDS to specialists or other providers who have more experience.\\\"       Secretary Shalala said, \\\"This clinical expertise should be especially  helpful for physicians and providers who treat people with HIV or AIDS in  communities and clinical sites where HIV expertise is not readily available.\\\"       The telephone number for health care professionals is 1-800-933-3413, and  it is accessible from 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. EST (7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. PST)  Monday through Friday.  During these times, consultants will try to answer  questions immediately, or within an hour.  At other times, physicians and  health care providers can leave an electronic message, and questions will be  answered as quickly as possible.       Health care professionals may call the service to ask any question  related to providing HIV care, including the latest HIV/AIDS drug treatment  information, clinical trials information, subspecialty case referral,  literature searches and other information.  The service is designed for health  care professionals rather than patients, families or others who have alternate  sources of information or materials.       When a health care professional calls the new service, the call is taken  by either a clinical pharmacist, primary care physician or family nurse  practitioner.  All staff members have extensive experience in outpatient and  inpatient primary care for people with HIV-related diseases.  The consultant  asks for patient-specific information, including CD4 cell count, current  medications, sex, age and the patient's HIV history.       This national service has grown out of a 16-month local effort that   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 52 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  responded to nearly 1,000 calls from health care providers in northern  California.  The initial project was funded by HRSA's Bureau of Health  Professions, through its Community Provider AIDS Training (CPAT) project, and  by the American Academy of Family Physicians.       \\\"When providers expand their knowledge, they also improve the quality of  care they are able to provide to their patients,\\\" said HRSA Administrator  Robert G. Harmon. M.D., M.P.H.  \\\"This project will be a great resource for  health care professionals and the HIV/AIDS patients they serve.\\\"       \\\"This service has opened a new means of communication between health care  professionals and experts on HIV care management,\\\" said HRSA's associate  administrator for AIDS and director of the Bureau of Health Resources  Development, G. Stephen Bowen, M.D., M.P.H.  \\\"Providers who treat people with  HIV or AIDS have access to the latest information on new drugs, treatment  methods and therapies for people with HIV or AIDS.\\\"       HRSA is one of eight U.S. Public Health Service agencies within HHS.

I thought I should, this charge was so constant, so gritted my teeth and    went inside.   The place was cool but reeked of sodden ashes, and was dark at first, for   its stone walls had only window slits. Rags strewed the mud floor around an   iron tripod over embers that vented their smoke through roof beams black   with soot. All looked bare and empty, but in an inner room flies buzzed. As   the door swung shut behind me I saw they came from a man's body lying face   up, naked but for its grimy turban. He was about fifty years old by what   was left of his face - a rifle butt had bashed an eye. The one left slanted,   as with Tartars rather than with Turks. Any uniform once on him was gone, so   I'd no proof which he was, and quickly went out, gagging at the mess of his    slashed genitals.\\\"  p. 363 (first paragraph).    'How many people lived there?'  'Oh, about eight hundred.' He yawned.  'Did you see any Turk officers?'  'No, sir. I was in at dawn. All were Tartar civilians in mufti.'   \\\"The lieutenant dozed off, then I, but in the small hours a voice woke me -   Dro's. He stood in the starlight bawling out an officer. Anyone keelhauled  so long and furiously I'd never heard. Then abruptly Dro broke into   laughter, quick and simple as child's. Both were a cover for his sense  of guilt, I thought, or hoped. For somehow, despite my boast of irreligion,  Christian massacring 'infidels' was more horrible than the reverse would  have been.   From daybreak on, Armenian villagers poured in from miles around.....  The women plundered happily, chattering like ravens as they picked over  the carcass of Djul. They hauled out every hovel's chattels, the last   scrap of food or cloth, and staggered away, packing pots, saddlebags,   looms, even spinning-wheels.   'Thank you for a lot, Dro,' I said to him back in camp. 'But now I must   leave.'...We shook hands, the captain said 'A bientot, mon camarade.' And   for hours the old Molokan scout and I plodded north across parching plains.   Like Lot's wife I looked back once to see smoke bathing all, doubtless in   a sack of other Moslem villages up to the line of snow that was Iran.'\\\"  p. 354.  \\\"At morning tea, Dro and his officers spread out a map of this whole  high region called the Karabakh. Deep in tactics, they spoke Russian,  but I got their contempt for Allied 'neutral' zones and their distrust  of promises made by tribal chiefs. A campaign shaped; more raids on  Moslem villages.\\\"  p. 358.  \\\"It will be three hours to take,\\\" Dro told me. We'd close in on three  sides. \\\"The men on foot will not shoot, but use only the bayonets,\\\" Merrimanov said, jabbing a rifle in dumbshow. \\\"That is for morale,\\\" Dro put in. \\\"We must keep the Moslems in terror.\\\" \\\"Soldiers or civilians?\\\" I asked. \\\"There is no difference,\\\" said Dro. \\\"All are armed, in uniform or not.\\\" \\\"But the women and children?\\\" \\\"Will fly with the others as best they may.\\\"  p. 360.  \\\"The ridges circled a wide expanse, its floors still. Hundreds of feet   down, the fog held, solid as cotton flock. 'Djul lies under that,' said   Dro, pointing. 'Our men also attack from the other sides.'   Then, 'Whee-ee!' - his whistle lined up all at the rock edge. Bayonets  clicked upon carbines. Over plunged Archo, his black haunches rippling;  then followed the staff, the horde - nose to tail, bellies taking the  spur. Armenia in action seemed more like a pageant than war, even though   I heard our Utica brass roar.   As I watched from the height, it took ages for Djul to show clear. A tsing  of machine-gun fire took over from the thumping batteries; cattle lowed,  dogs barked, invisible, while I ate a hunk of cheese and drank from a snow  puddle. Mist at last folded upward as men shouted, at first heard faintly.  The came a shrill wailing.   Now among the cloud-streaks rose darker wisps - smoke. Red glimmered about  house walls of stone or wattle, into dry weeds on roofs. A mosque stood in  clump of trees, thick and green. Through crooked alleys on fire, horsemen  were galloping after figures both mounted and on foot.   'Tartarski!' shouted the gunner by me. Others pantomimed them in escape  over the rocks, while one twisted a bronze shell-nose, loaded, and yanked  breech-cord, firing again and again. Shots wasted, I thought, when by  afternoon I looked in vain for fallen branch or body. But these shots and  the white bursts of shrapnel in the gullies drowned the women's cries.   At length all shooting petered out. I got on my horse and rode down toward  Djul. It burned still but little flame showed now. The way was steep and   tough, through dense scrub. Finally on flatter ground I came out suddenly,  through alders, on smoldering houses. Across trampled wheat my brothers-in-  arms were leading off animals, several calves and a lamb.\\\"  p. 361 (fourth paragraph).  \\\"Corpses came next, the first a pretty child with straight black hair,   large eyes. She looked about twelve years old. She lay in some stubble   where meal lay scattered from the sack she'd been toting. The bayonet   had gone through her back, I judged, for blood around was scant. Between   the breasts one clot, too small for a bullet wound, crusted her homespun   dress.   The next was a boy of ten or less, in rawhide jacket and knee-pants. He   lay face down in the path by several huts. One arm reached out to the   pewter bowl he'd carried, now upset upon its dough. Steel had jabbed   just below his neck, into the spine.    There were grownups, too, I saw as I led the sorrel around. Djul was   empty of the living till I looked up to see beside me Dro's German-speaking   colonel.

In     general, however, systems connected to 'the net' fall in one of three     categories: Internet, Usenet, or BITNET. Electronic mail may be sent     between these networks, and other resources available on one of these     networks are sometimes accessible from other networks by email sent to     special 'servers'.      The space and astronomy discussion groups actually are composed of     several mechanisms with (mostly) transparent connections between them.      One mechanism is the mailing list, in which mail is sent to a central     distribution point which relays it to all recipients of the list. In     addition to the general lists for space (called SPACE Digest for     Internet users, and SPACE on BITNET), there are a number of more     specialized mailing lists described below.      A second mechanism is Usenet 'netnews'. This is somewhat like a bulletin     board operating on each system which is a part of the net. Netnews     separates contributions into hundreds of different categories based on a     'group name'. The groups dealing most closely with space topics are     called 'sci.space.news', 'sci.space', 'sci.space.shuttle', 'sci.astro',     and 'talk.politics.space'. Contributors 'post' submissions (called     'articles' in netnews terminology) on their local machine, which sends     it to other nearby machines. Similarly, articles sent from nearby     machines are stored locally and may be forwarded to other systems, so     that an article is posted locally and eventually reaches all the Usenet     sites interested in receiving the news group to which the article was     posted.      Gateway machines redirect the Usenet sci.space group into Internet and     BITNET mailing lists and vice versa; the other Usenet groups are not     accessible as mailing lists. If you can receive netnews, its more     flexible interface and access to a wider range of material usually make     it the preferred option.  MAILING LISTS      SPACE Digest is the main Internet list, and is now being run by the     International Space University (in only its second change of management     in over a decade). Email space-request@isu.isunet.edu (message body     should be in the format 'subscribe space John Public') to join. Note     that the moderated SPACE Magazine list is defunct at present for lack of     a moderator. Old copies of SPACE Digest since its inception in 1981 are     available by anonymous FTP. Retrieve  julius.cs.qub.ac.uk:pub/SpaceDigestArchive/README     for further details.      Elements is a moderated list for fast distribution of Space Shuttle     Keplerian Elements before and during Shuttle flights. NASA two line     elements are sent out on the list from Dr. Kelso, JSC, and other sources     as they are released. Email to elements-request@telesoft.com to join.      GPS Digest is a moderated list for discussion of the Global Positioning     System and other satellite navigation positioning systems. Email to     gps-request@esseye.si.com to join.      Space-investors is a list for information relevant to investing in     space-related companies. Email Vincent Cate (vac@cs.cmu.edu) to join.

It takes *more* than a great GM to win a stanley cup, even once.  Some of the guys on the list you gave earlier never won one.  I agree that you and I could probably argue back and forth for days to no avail about who is the best GM in hockey- that is a matter of opinion, and who is to say my opinion is any better  than yours or yours than mine?  But the point of my *original* original post (if not well stated) was that Murray has the GM abilities but not the coaching abilities.  Which leads to below:   I think at this point there's a personal, emotional element involved here which transcends Murray's logical thought.  As outsiders, it's fine for  us to say, \\\"He should hire a different coach.\\\"  In fact, he has talked about doing so in the past.  But, the press (here in Detroit, at least) has so built up this business about Murray never getting past the second round of the playoffs as a coach, that I think he has taken it upon himself to  prove to the world that he *is* capable of coaching a team past the second round.  He needs to, as the papers say, \\\"get that monkey off his back.\\\" So it becomes a matter not of intelligence, but of pride.  Is it foolish to let pride stand in the way of sound logic?  Perhaps, but we're all a little that way from time to time.  I think eventually he'll step down from behind the bench and concentrate on his GM duties, and the team will improve as a result.  I think his coaching duties take away time he might have otherwise spent on GM work.  In that sense, once he steps down as coach, we'll see how good of a GM he really is.   I may not agree with everything you've said, but it's been fun discussing it with you. \",\"# # Unfortunately, homosexuals don't believe in this concept of freedom. # # They believe that they have a right to FORCE people to hire them, # # rent to them, and do business with them, regardless of the feelings # # or beliefs of the other person. #  # <ha ha ha#, oh, Clayton, you're so good, so consistent, so predictable, # yup, that's right, they, these homosexual people want to FORCE you to # ignore what's none of your fucking business.

Yet, when a law was proposed for Virginia that extended this  philosophy to cigarette smokers (so that people who smoked away from the work couldn't be discriminated against by employers), the liberal Gov.

Yes, on the showroom floor, the cars have this deep, lustrous shine that just can't be found on paint jobs that aren't clear coated.  On the other hand, it seems that every clear coated car that I've seen on the road (in a parking lot, etc.) has fine scratches throughout the paint job.  As does, alas, my 1992 Laser.  Several weeks ago I had my car professionally polished and waxed. When I picked it up, it had that same showroom shine that I remember from a year ago when I bought it.  Several days ago I took my car to the dealership for some work.  As an added bonus, they washed my car.  Unfortunately, whoever washed it either didn't get the roof (which is black, the rest of the car is red) completely clean before he dried it, or he used a dirty towel.  Now my showroom shine is a haze of fine scratches that aren't really visible until the light hits the roof at a particular angle.  I am, to put it mildy, somewhat peeved about this.  Do I have any  chance of getting the dealership to do something about this? My guess is 'no'.  Is there any product on the market that provides a solution to this problem?  Or am I faced with the prospect of having the car professionally polished again to hide the scratches?

The fact that this is precisely what the US was up to of course is not mentioned. It is a fact that Regan and Bush sold arms to Iran, it is also a fact that they supported and armed Iraq.  Still this is state dept propaganda so none too surprizing.   In the case of Lybia there is the problem that the US only decided that Gadffii ordered the bombing after it needed to make peace with damascus during the gulf war. One day the US is certain that its Syria, the next Lybia. For a strange reason the US will not provide evidence to Lybian courts for extradition proceedings. Faced with similar demands the USA would reject them as would any other country.    The word is \\\"terrorism\\\".   The problem is that after the behaviour of George Bush the USA has an image abroad as doing precisely what it likes and is in its own interests then comming out with a Dysney scripted sugary justification repeating a fitting combination of the words \\\"freedom\\\" \\\"dignity\\\" \\\"democaracy\\\" or of \\\"terrorism\\\" \\\"dictatorship\\\" etc as appropriate.  The USA could go quite far to mend the bridges with  Iran. The people there are rather pissed off because the USA first supported the Shah who they loathed and then supported Saddam when he mounted an unprovoked attack.  Hardly surprizing after the embassy hostage crisis but Iran is meant to be the country run by unreasonable bigots not the USA so if there is to be movement it would be easier for the USA to move.  First off they could recognise Iraqu's responsibility in initiating the Iran/Iraq war. Providing technical assistance to Iran to get it's oil production back up to capacity would also be a smart move, at the moment  Iran is above it's OPEC ceiling. If they had extra capacity they would use it and bring down the oild price further which is in our interests.  The Iranian clerics would have an interest in seeking a raprochment  simply because a permanent war footing is debilitating.

I believe I discussed countersteering a horse before.  Basically, there are two ways to steer a horse, plow-rein and neck-rein.  Plow-reining steers him by keeping the reins separate, and you pull in the direction you wish to go.  Neck-reining steers a horse by holding the reins together in one hand, and pulling against the horse's neck in the direction you wish to go.  When training a plow-steering horse to neck-rein, one technique is to cross the reins under his necks.  Thus, when neck-reining to the left, the right rein pulls against the right side of the neck, but the left side of the bit (which the horse is used to from his plow-reining days).  Are you sorry you asked yet? \",\"  Nonsense.  I quite clearly state that it was Greg that made the claim that Gainey never made an error.  And he made the claim. Read below.

I stand by that assessment. He was a very good player who belongs in the hall of fame.  Did you ever watch him play? He never made a technical error.  [more nonsense deleted]   To knowledgeable observers of the game my meaning is obvious.  Your hockey education is not my responsibility.    He was just another player.  To laud him as anything more I find bothersome.  I hated the Habs.  I hated Lafleur until I realized that he was likely the most aesthetically pleasing player to ever  skate in my lifetime.  Why would anyone talk about Gainey?      Did he play hockey at a high level?  Was he any good?  If not, why would you bother to bring JC up?  I am talking about hockey players here.  If you can't follow the conversation don't follow up.  As I said previously, it is not my responsibility to educate you.   Sure.  Two journeymen.  Big deal.  Neither one of them is worth discussing.     That is an excellent idea and if I decide to waste any more time responding to any of your, or Greg's, postings then I will be sure to implement that very macro.

But what was wrong with it?  It won't tempt anyone to any kind of sin, as far as I can tell.  It doesn't belittle anyone.  It does not substitute offensiveness for humor (it's genuinely funny).  We shouldn't assume that _all_ jokes that mention sexuality are \\\"dirty\\\" merely because so many are.  And we should never mistake prudery for spirituality.  It can be the direct opposite -- a symptom of the _lack_ of a healthy perspective on God's creation.  \",\" I think your experiences under the Bulgarian regime are highly relevant. We have too many people with their heads in the sand saying it cannot happen here, as our Constitutional Rights are being trashed every day because the government justifies doing some end-run around the protections by a 'crisis' requiring 'drastic action'.   It is most likely that in the future possession of secure encryption tools will be regarded as possession of 'terrorist and drug dealers tools', and be some serious Fedaral Felony. Just like common tools are 'burgular tools' if the police say so, common computer programs (even computers themselves) are now 'hackers tools', and will become 'terrorist tools'.  BET ON IT.  The insights of someone who has lived throught this are very important. If the US goes the way of the old Soviet Union and its client states as far as individual rights, privacy and overall freedom are concerned, the rest of the world (remember 'New World Order'?) will not be far behind - only a few years.  Please keep posting anything you find that is deficient or that threatens ones rights in this thing.  For example, a conversation between a suspect and a lawyer will no longer be private from Big Brother eavesdropping.  Political dissent allready is very dangerous in this country, all it takes is the government to decide that enough people will take one seriously, then one becomes guilty of 'plotting to overthrow the government by illegal means'.  The phrase 'illegal means' is defined as whatever the government wants it to be defined as.  Couple this with Clinton's pressing for a 'smart' National ID card (an 'Internal passport'?), with the added wrinkle that anything about you and your past can be put on it, and you can only take the government's word as to what is really on it (since they will be the only ones with the means to completely read and reprogram the thing).  Isn't that nice?  While the Feds can bust into one's safe without the keys, the owner knows his safe has been broken into.  When they break into your 'secure' phone conversations (or other stored/transmitted data in the near future) you have no way of knowing, so accountability as to the legalities has gone out the window.  Just like a safe, if they have a legal cause, they can get the keys from the suspect, just like they can get the keys to a safe or the combination from the suspect.  Same with encryption: Record everything, get the warrants, THEN decode it with the keys obtained from the suspect.  This Clinton Cripple, along with its natural extensions, will make any priviliged communications between client and lawyer, and any meaningful political dissent virtually impossible.  Which is the general idea. Any propeganda about its being secure, and the safeguards, and all of that are just that - propeganda to reassure people so they will by into this monstrosity.

I will not comment on the value or lack of value of Elias's \\\"proposal\\\".  I just want to say that it is very distressing that at least two people here are profoundly ignorant of Nazi racial doctrine.  They were NOT like Elias's idea, they were more like the opposite.    Nazis believed in racial purity, not racial assimilation.  An  instructive example is the Nazi attitude to Gypsies.  According to  Nazi theoreticians, Gypsies were an Aryan race.  They were persecuted, and in huge numbers murdered, because most European Gypies were considered not pure Gypsies but \\\"mongrels\\\" formed from the pure Gypsy  race and other undesirable races.  This was the key difference between  the theoretical approach to Jews and Gypsies, by the way.  It is also  true that towards the end of WWII even the \\\"purist\\\" Gypsies were  hunted down as the theory was forgotten.\",\"DH>>Does anyone out their have a mountain tape backup that I could compare DH>>notes with, (jumper settings, software, ect...)

Hams are unlikely to have an illegal amp,  and are also unlikely to have a \\\"dirty\\\" amp.     Hams can legally run up to 1500 watts.  It is very unlikely, however,    that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car.  Ham rigs  Not possible either.  You'd need about a 300 amp alternator for just the amplifier.  I can just see it.  You need to slow down on a downgrade,  so you hit the push to talk button.     for cars put out around 100 watts.  It is possible that a 100 watt    radio would cause interference to consumer electronic 100 feet     away.  Most TVs, stereos, and VCRs have very poor RF shielding.    If you experience the problem frequently, it may be     caused by a ham, CBer, or other radio operator in a base station    nearby.    The interference may have been caused by a radio     transmitter used for other purposes, such as police, fire,    etc.  If you heard voices over your stereo, I think you are    correct in assuming that the source is an RF transmitter.     If you have frequent trouble, you may want to try the RF ferrite    chokes available at Radio Shack.  The interference is probably    being picked up by your speaker wires, and those chokes can    be installed on the wires very easily (without cutting them).    Good instructions are included with the chokes.    If that does not solve the problem, you may want to search your    neighborhood for a radio operator.  Look for antennas on the roof    or car.  Talk to him/her about your problem.  There are things    a radio operator can do to reduce interference.  And please remember to be friendly when approaching your local radio operator.  This person may or may not be the  cause of your troubles,  and you'll get better cooperation and help if you assume that he is going to be helpful (most are).  It was amazing the accusations that we sometimes dealt with as I grew up.  We were blamed for skip (ghost pictures on the TV that occur at sunspot peaks),  c.b. interferance,  dead grass :),  you name it.    BTW, the local operator should try and help you whether or not he or she is directly responsible.  It is part of being a good neighbor and that is how the FCC views it. Too bad they don't require the consumer equipment makers to take any precautions.  Last, you can usually tell ham radio vs. CB.  Ham operators are required to declare their call (sign) every so many minutes (no more than 10).  So if you hear \\\"This is WA1QT\\\" or some other call starting with A, W or K and no more than 6 total characters, you heard a ham. CB'ers probably won't sign (I don't know that they're even required to) and fire/police have other private ids.      \",\"Has anyone noticed or commented on the fact that so many of those who were willing, nay demanding, that we wait forever for Mr Hussein and Iraq, that we use tremendously costly \\\"sanctions\\\", to avoid a loss of life, are now at the fore front of those clammoring that we should have smashed those \\\"religious radicals\\\" and we were wasting money allowing this stand off to go on  ?

for not posting to alt.clipper, or whatever, but it seems it may not be in the newsfeed here.]  There may be another reason (good from NSA's point of view, horrible from everyone else's) why the algorithm/chip design might be secret.  First, note that the \\\"experts\\\" will only look at \\\"details\\\", and of just  the algorithm:      In addition, respected experts from outside the     government will be offered access to the confidential details of     the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report     their findings.  Why not the chip design?  Well, here's the possiblity:  in addition to encryption, the chip pre-processes voice signals to make them easier to analyze/transcribe electronically.  The chip, once widespread, might effectively be part of a massively parallel computer for \\\"voice- grepping\\\" the US phone network (or the criminal & wrong-thinking patrons thereof).  I wouldn't put it past the NSA.  Think how much easier it would make life for them.  And if this is indeed the case, think of the possible public outcry should it become widely known.  Thus the secrecy.  It might be a good idea to have experts in DSP, voice recognition, and AI conversation-understanding to be on that panel, and insist they be given (authenticatable) design specs and implementation documentation.\",\"Forty-two is six times nine. \",\" Actually, the story goes that Lucifer refused to bow before MAN as  God commanded him to.  Lucifer was devoted to God.  Oh yeah, there is nothing in Genesis that says the snake was anything more than a snake (well, a talking one...had legs at the time, too).  I don't think pointing out contradictions in STORIES is the best way to show the error in theology:  if they think a supernatural entity kicked the first humans out of paradise because they bit into a fruit that gave them special powers...well, they might not respond well to reason and logic.  :^)\",\"  There is a rite like this described in Joseph Campbell's _Occidental_Mythology_.  He also described levels of initiation, I think 6?  I don't know where Campbell got his info, but I remember thinking he was being a little eclectic.   Quite a bit.  If you haven't read Campbell, give him a try.   \",\"In this giant bally-ho over this Clipper chip I noticed a rather disturbing trend in some of the E-mail and posts I've tossing back and forth.    Somebody asked me what was wrong about overreacting in cases such as this.  The reason is very simple:  How many people do you want to die in a riot?  In a new Civil War?   Everybody is jumping up and down and screaming about it, and I'm worried that people are going to reach for their hammers and rifles before their pens and paper.    Can people work within the system before trying to break it?  Examine your history books, and find out how many armed revolutions led to Democratic (or Democratic style) governments.  I think you'll only find one in over five thousand years of written history.  That's not very good odds.    Somebody once said something like: \\\"Armed Violence is meant only to be used in response to an armed attack.  It is not meant to be used in agression.  This is the difference between self-defence and murder.\\\"  Let's try to avoid killing things, eh?  There's enough blood shed in the world, without adding a couple of riots, Civil Wars, etc.  I'm probably overreacting.  But what I've read scared me a lot.  I don't want my children growing up in a War Zone.  \",\" Yes, Ivan Rodriguez, last year.  Batted .260 and threw out 51% of the baserunners.  Not too shabby for a rookie from AA.  20 years old last year. \",\"  Wow, the WWII channel did something not-WWII?   The graphics capabilities of the computers were very faked for movie  audiences who have not ability or patience with numbers.  The book was more  realistic in that respect.  In all respects, actually.  The robotics are  still out of range, but not impossible.   SF (and I\\\"ve always wondered how Crichton escapes this classification) is  usually ahead of science in both prediction and precaution.  NASA's  decontaimination processes were supposedly taken to prevent SF story  disasters.  I mean, NASA scientists were often SF readers (and  sometimes writers) and felt pre-warned by their reading.

On the non-pacifist side:]  (1) Killing to defend the innocent may be, if anything, _more_ justifiable than killing in self-defense.  I can turn my _own_ other cheek, but I have no right to turn someone else's.  (2) It seems to me that if Jesus had meant to teach pacifism, He would have made His position more explicit.  He didn't tell the centurion to leave the army, for instance; and the NT is full of military metaphors.  [B. On the pacifist side:]  (1) Apparently many early Christians refused to fight in the Roman army, or stated that one should refuse if given a choice.  But it's not clear whether they were objecting to war _per se_, or objecting to Roman policies.  (2) In modern warfare, it seems to be impossible to direct attacks only at combatants.  Bombing, both conventional and nuclear, kills lots of civilians.  (3) It's hard to tell whether any _particular_ war is justified at the time.

There will be no product called C 8.0 (although the command-line compiler of VC++ lists its version as 8.00).  C7 is not a \\\"DOS\\\"-only product -- it is a C/C++ compiler capable of producing executables for DOS or Windows, as is VC++ (Pro. Ed.).  The (significant) difference is that VC++ comes with many Windows-hosted tools (ide, etc) which assist developers in creating Windows executables much more quickly (basically by automating the thousands of lines of boilerplate code).  Initial impressions have been very favorable.  Everyone who is a registered user of C7 should have received a considerable amount of info regarding the specifics of C7.

Basically the Glock is great but I have heard/read that it is a lot harder to learn proper handling because of the type of safety that it has.  I was looking at a Glock .40S&W and the S&W 4006 a couple of weeks ago and the safties on the guns were very different.  The saftey on the 4006 seemed a lot more \\\"safe\\\"  (for lack of a better word) than the one on the Glock.  Of course this could also be a bad thing if you were to pull the gun on somebody.  You would spend more time fiddling around turning the safety off.  Personally I like the Glocks because they are very light and I think they look really cool (guess that's why they use them in so many movies) but I wouldn't get one as my first semi-auto because of the safety.  I would prefer more training with a \\\"traditional\\\" semi-auto (ala Colt .45) but of course that's just my opinion.\",\"  One can't.

Some (but not all) X terminal emulators provide environment variables giving a window ID.  Even if such a thing is present in the environment, it may not be what you want; it may correspond to a window on a different server, for example.       der Mouse\",\" Insofar as several \\\"liberal\\\" jurisdictions are concerned, the essential elements of rape are gender neutral. Nonetheless, I decided to provide a number of references to support my original argument. Black's Law Dictionary (every law student/lawyer's friend) defines rape as: Unlawful sexual intercourse with a female without her consent. The unlawful knowledge of a woman by a man forcibly and against her will. The Model Penal Code (the statute proposed by the National Conference of Commissioners of Uniform State Laws or other organization for adoption by state legislatures) defines rape as: A male who has sexual intercourse with a female not his wife is guilty of rape if he (a) compels her to submit by force or by threat of imminent death....

The 'little thing in the trigger' has to be depressed before the trigger can move.  What this means is the damned thing won't go off until the trigger is pulled.  This makes it just about (there HAVE been some problems, but we're assuming the gun is functioning correctly..) as safe as a revolver.  The gun when working correctly is totally drop safe.  Now, in police work this is a consideration.  There is not a single documented case I'm aware of where a police officer was killed because he failed to operate the safety on his firearm.  There are quite a few documented cases where criminals got hold of the cops gun and couldn't figure out how to get the safety off in time to use the gun, thus the proprietary nature of the safety (to the criminal at least) very likely prevented the office from getting shot.  The purpose of a safety is to make the gun safe from unintentional fire. This does not mean it should be so complicated as to slow down intentional use!  Thus the Glock safety is perfectly adequate from a 'safety' standpoint, but not necessarily the most desirable from the standpoint of open carry where it is easily grabbed by somebody else. By this criteria it DOES make a lot of sense as a concealed carry piece. From the standpoint of police use, it is no better (or worse) than a revolver as far as being 'proprietary' to the officer in the method of firing it.  The ideal solution may someday be biometric sensing of the user so that the firearm can't be used by anybody but it's owner, but for now the wide variety of safety systems helps, unless the criminal happens to be familiar with that particular type of firearm.\",\"Hi,  I found what I believe is an undocumented feature in my windows directory, Microsoft Diagnostics, ver 2.00.

While I can't offer such a proof, it seems pretty damn plausible that if the government does not regulate a particular area, it cannot become a tool of private interests to pursue their own agendas in that area.

So Bush and the Democrats got together in a Budget Summit and replaced Grahm-Rudman with the now historic Grand Compromise in which Bush \\\"consented\\\" to raise taxes in exchange for certain caps on spending increases.

Thanks for your assistance.\",\"Being a parent in need of some help, I ask that you bear with me while I describe the situation which plagues me...  I am a divorced father. Chance would have it that \\\"my weekend\\\" with my  daughter has fallen upon Easter Weekend this year.  Although I am Presbyterian, I had married a Catholic woman. We decided that the Catholic moray of indoctrination of the spouse into the faith was too confining (and restrictive due to time as we had already set a date), and we were married in a Christian Church which was non-denominational.  During the years of our marriage, we did not often attend church.   When our daughter was born, some years later, my wife insisted that she  be baptised as Catholic. This wasn't a problem with me.  During a separation of five years, my ex-wife was taken ill with a disease that affected her mental capacities. She was confined to a mental ward for two months before it was diagnosed. It has since been treated \\\"effectively\\\".  In other words, professionals have deemed her a functioning member of society.  During the recuperation, my ex-wife has embraced Buddism. Her influence over my daughter has been substantial, and has primarily allowed me only Saturday visitation for a number of years. During this period I have read Bible study books to my daughter, and tried to keep her aware of her Christian heritage.  Last fall, our divorce was finalized after a year of viscious divorce hearings. At that time I was awarded visitation rights every other weekend. At that time, I started taking my daughter to church quite often, although not every weekend. I did this to attempt to strengthen the Christian ethic and expose her to a religious community.  Today, Easter Sunday, I took my daughter to church. When it came time for  Communion, my daughter took the bread (The body of Christ) but left the wine (The blood of Christ) professing that she was too young for wine. She then balled the bread up in her hand and tried to descretely throw it under the pew in front of us.  I feel this was a slap in the face to me, my religion, and an afront to her religious heritage. It can be construed as breaking several of the commandments if you try. I really felt dishonored by the action.  My daughter is only nine years old, but I think she should have been old and mature enough to realize her actions. I have difficulty blaming her directly for religious teachings her mother swears to, but when I discussed this with my daughter she made it clear she believed in Buddhism and not Christianity.  My initial response of anger (moderated) was to suggest if there is no faith in Christ then why does she celebrate Easter, or Christmas? I suggested I would never force her to practice my religious beliefs by celebrating holidays with her again.  I do not want to \\\"drive her from the fold\\\", and would be willing to allow her to continue practicing Buddhism (as though I had a choice seeing her only for two days out of fourteen) but I want her to want to embrace Christianity.  Any suggestions?  If you have a response, please e-mail me a copy. (I'm not a regular reader of this newsgroup.) (Naturally, feel free to post too!)  Thanks, and I hope you've had a happy Easter.

If the gift of tounges were the ability to be understood by everyone, no matter what languages they know, there would be no need for the gift of interpretation, and I Corinthians 14 would not have had to have been written.     That's a pretty harsh assumption to make about a several million Christians world wide.  Sure, there are some who want glory for themselves who speak in tounges, just as there are among those who do not have this gift.  There were people like this in the Corinthian church also.  that does not mean that there is no true gift or that all who speak in tounges do it for their own glory in the sight of men.   I would venture to say that a large percentage of those who do speak in tounges  do so more often in private prayer than in public.

How do you avoid situations which encourage criminals?  I'd really like to know.  Would you, say, prohibit female college students from riding their bicycles near the university during the daytime?    Sounds a bit drastic, doesn't it?  Especially when the university is locatd in a nice residential area.  A friend of mine was attacked and nearly raped in just this situation.  The police didn't feel she was in a situation which 'encouraged criminals'.  What do you think?  Should we just tell her, that it was her fault for daring to ride a bicycle in the middle of the day?  That she didn't avoid a situation that encouraged criminals?  If that's the case, then we'd all better put bars on our doors and windows and pray for a police state to keep us all safe.  Crime happens in all situations - there are no defined areas that criminals avoid.  \",\"Sterrenkundig symposium 'Compacte Objecten'                                              op 26 april 1993   In het jaar 1643, zeven jaar na de oprichting van de Universiteit van Utrecht, benoemde de universiteit haar eerste sterrenkundige waarnemer. Hiermee ontstond de tweede universiteitssterrenwacht ter wereld. Aert Jansz, de eerste waarnemer, en zijn opvolgers voerden de Utrechtse sterrenkunde in de daaropvolgende jaren, decennia en eeuwen naar de voorhoede van het astronomisch onderzoek. Dit jaar is het 350 jaar geleden dat deze historische benoeming plaatsvond.  De huidige generatie Utrechtse sterrenkundigen en studenten sterrenkunde, verenigd in het Sterrekundig Instituut Utrecht, vieren de benoeming van hun 'oervader' middels een breed scala aan feestelijke activiteiten. Zo is er voor scholieren een planetenproject, programmeert de Studium Generale een aantal voordrachten met een sterrenkundig thema en wordt op de Dies Natalis aan een astronoom een eredoctoraat uitgereikt. Er staat echter meer op stapel.  Studenten natuur- en sterrenkunde kunnen op 26 april aan een sterrenkundesymposium deelnemen. De onderwerpen van het symposium zijn opgebouwd rond een van de zwaartepunten van het huidige Utrechtse onderzoek: het onderzoek aan de zogeheten 'compacte objecten', de eindstadia in de evolutie van sterren. Bij de samenstelling van het programma is getracht de deelnemer een zo aktueel en breed mogelijk beeld te geven van de stand van zaken in het onderzoek aan deze eindstadia. In de eerste, inleidende lezing zal dagvoorzitter prof. Lamers een beknopt overzicht geven van de evolutie van zware sterren, waarna de zeven overige sprekers in lezingen van telkens een half uur nader op de specifieke evolutionaire eindprodukten zullen ingaan. Na afloop van elke lezing is er gelegenheid tot het stellen van vragen. Het dagprogramma staat afgedrukt op een apart vel. Het niveau van de lezingen is afgestemd op tweedejaars studenten natuur- en sterrenkunde. OOK ANDERE BELANGSTELLENDEN ZIJN VAN HARTE WELKOM!  Tijdens de lezing van prof. Kuijpers zullen, als alles goed gaat, de veertien radioteleskopen van de Radiosterrenwacht Westerbork worden ingezet om via een directe verbinding tussen het heelal, Westerbork en Utrecht het zwakke radiosignaal van een snel roterende kosmische vuurtoren, een zogeheten pulsar, in de symposiumzaal door te geven en te audiovisualiseren. Prof. Kuijpers zal de binnenkomende signalen (elkaar snel opvolgende scherp gepiekte pulsen radiostraling) bespreken en trachten te verklaren. Het slagen van dit unieke experiment staat en valt met de technische haalbaarheid ervan. De op te vangen signalen zijn namelijk zo zwak, dat pas na een waarnemingsperiode van 10 miljoen jaar genoeg energie is opgevangen om een lamp van 30 Watt een seconde te laten branden! Tijdens het symposium zal er niet zo lang gewacht hoeven te worden: de hedendaagse technologie stelt ons in staat live het heelal te beluisteren.  Deelname aan het symposium kost f 4,- (exclusief lunch) en f 16,- (inclusief lunch). Inschrijving geschiedt door het verschuldigde bedrag over te maken op ABN-AMRO rekening 44.46.97.713 t.n.v. stichting 350 JUS. Het gironummer van de ABN-AMRO bank Utrecht is 2900. Bij de inschrijving dient te worden aangegeven of men lid is van de NNV. Na inschrijving wordt de symposiummap toegestuurd. Bij inschrijving na 31 maart vervalt de mogelijkheid een lunch te reserveren.  Het symposium vindt plaats in Transitorium I, Universiteit Utrecht.

I've already pointed out how we aren't nailing DUI's hard enough...  Comparing the US with other countries seldom works, but the European attitude towards alchohol and DUI seems to work.. Their attitude towards weapons isn't really a valid comparison because they've historically done their best to keep the populace disarmed and submissive, while our country was founded by a bunch of rugged individualists who told the European monarchies (for the most part) to take a flying leap (used more polite language though).  We even weaseled out of our first international treaty, and then convinced the French that it was in their best interests not to complain.. But first we had to overcome the fact that the Brits were doing their best to  restrict us to squirrel guns and such, so we'd be properly submissive while they forced us to pay for their wars.  Of course, most American history classes these days tend to gloss over facts that do not fit the image they wish to  convey... I'm glad my Amer.

CIA World Map II ---------------- [  NOTE: this database is quite out of date, and not topologically structured.   If you need a standard for world cartographic data, wait for the   Digital Chart of the World. This 1:1M database has been produced from   the Defense Mapping Agency's ONCs and will be available, together with   searching and viewing software, on a number of CD-ROMs later this summer. ]    Check into HANAUMA.STANFORD.EDU and UCSD.EDU (see ftp list above)   The CIA database consists of coastlines, rivers and political boundaries   in the form of line strokes. Also on hanauma.stanford.edu is a 720x360   array of elevation data, containing one ieee floating point number for   every half degree longitude and latitude.     A program for decoding the database, mfil, can be found on the machine   pi1.arc.umn.edu (137.66.130.11).   There's another program, which reads a compressed CIA Data Bank file and   builds a PHIGS hierachical structure. It uses a PHIGS extension known as   polyline sets for performance, but you can use regular polylines. Ask   Joe Stewart <joes@lpi.liant.com>.   The raw data at Stanford require the vplot package to be able to view it.   (was posted in comp.sources.unix). To be more exact, you'll have to   compile just the libvplot routines, not the whole package.  NCAR data ---------   NCAR (National Center for Atmospheric Research) has many types of   terrain  data, ranging from elevation datasets at   various resolutions, to information about soil types, vegetation, etc.   This data is not free -- they charge from $40 to $90 or more, depending   on the data volume and media (exabyte tape, 3480 cartridge, 9-track tape,   IBM PC floppy, and FTP transfer are all available).  Their data archive   is mostly research oriented, not hobbyist oriented.  For more information,   email to ilana@ncar.ucar.edu.  UNC data tapes with voxel data --------------   There are 2 \\\"public domain\\\" tapes with data for the comparison and   testing of various volume rendering algorithms (mainly MRI and CT   scans). These tapes are distributed by the SoftLab of UNC @ Chapel Hill.   (softlab@cs.unc.edu)    The data sets (volume I and II) are also available via anonymous FTP from   omicron.cs.unc.edu [128.109.136.159] in pub/softlab/CHVRTD  NASA ----   Many US agencies such as NASA publish CD-ROMs with many altimetry data   from various space missions, eg.

Background imagery/textures/datafiles =========================================   First, check in the FTP places that are mentioned in the FAQ or in the FTP list above.  24-bit scanning: ----------------   Get a good 24-bit scanner, like Epson's. Suggested is an SCSI port for   speed. Eric Haines had a suggestion in RT News, Volume 4, #3 :   scan textures for wallpapers and floor coverings, etc. from doll   house supplies.   So you have a rather cheap way to scan patterns that don't have   scaling troubles associated with real materials and scanning area.  Books with textures: --------------------   Find some houses/books/magazines that carry photographic material.   Educorp, 1-619-536-9999, sells CD-ROMS with various imagery - also   a wide variety of stock art is available.   Stock art from big-name stock art houses, such as Comstock,   UNIPHOTO, and Metro Image Base, is available.    In Italy, there's a company called Belvedere that makes such books   for the purpose of clipping their pages for inclusion in your   graphics work. Their address is:  Edition Belvedere Co. Ltd.,  00196 Rome Italy,  Piazzale Flaminio, 19  Tel. (06) 360-44-88, Fax (06)  360-29-60  Texture Libraries: ------------------ a. Mannikin Sceptre Graphics announced TexTiles, a set of 256x256 24-bit    textures. Initial shipments in 24-bit IFF (for Amigas), soon in 24-bit    TIFF format. Algorithmically built for tiled surfaces. SRP is $40 / volume    (each volume = 40 images @ 10 disks). Demo disks for $5 are available.

ESSENCE is a library of 65 (sixty-five) new algoritmic textures for Imagine    by Impulse, Inc. These textures are FULLY compatible with the floating point    versions of Imagine 2.0, Imagine 1.1, and even Turbo Silver.    Written by Steve Worley.

Introduction to rendering algorithms ========================================  a. Ray-Tracing: ---------------    I assume you have a general understanding of Computer Graphics. No? Then read   some of the books that the FAQ contains. For Ray-Tracing, I would   suggest:    An Introduction to Ray Tracing, Andrew Glassner (ed.), Academic Press      1989, ISBN 0-12-286160-4   Note that I have not read the book, but I feel that you can't be wrong   using his book. An errata list was posted in comp.graphics by Eric Haines   (erich@eye.com)  There's a more concise reference also:    Roman Kuchkuda , UNC @ Chapel Hill: \\\"An Introduction to Ray Tracing\\\", in   \\\"Theoretical Foundations for Computer Graphics and CAD\\\", ed. R.A.E.Earnshaw,   NATO AS, Vol. F-40., pp. 1039-1060. Printed by Springer-Verlag, 1988.  It contains code for a small, but fundamentally complete ray-tracer.  b. Z-buffer (depth-buffer) --------------------------  A good reference is:          _Procedural Elements for Computer Graphics_, David F. Rogers,         McGraw-Hill, New York, 1985, pages 265-272 and 280-284.  c. Others: ---------- ??? [ More info is needed -- nfotis ]  ========================================================================  15. Where can I find the geometric data for the: ================================================  a. Teapot ? -----------  \\\"Displays on Display\\\" column of IEEE CG&A Jan '87 has the whole story about origin of the Martin Newell's teapot. The article also has the bezier patch model and a Pascal program to display the wireframe model of the teapot.  IEEE CG&A Sep '87 in Jim Blinn's column \\\"Jim Blinn's Corner\\\" describes an another way to model the teapot; Bezier curves with rotations for example are used.  The OFF and SPD packages have these objects, so you're advised to get them to avoid typing the data yourself.  The OFF data is triangles at a specific resolution (around 8x8[x4 triangles] meshing per patch). The SPD package provides the spline patch descriptions and performs a tessellation at any specified resolution.  b. Space Shuttle ? ------------------  Tolis Lerios <tolis@nova.stanford.edu> has built a list of Space Shuttle datafiles. Here's a summary (From his sci.space list):  model1: A modified version of the newsgroup model (model2)  406 vertices (296 useful, i.e. referred to in the polygon descriptions.) 389 polygons (233 3-vertex, 146 4-vertex, 7 5-vertex, 3 6-vertex). Payload doors non-existent. Units: unknown.  Simon Marshall (S.Marshall@sequent.cc.hull.ac.uk) has a copy. He said there is no proprietary information associated with it.  model2: The newsgroup model, in OFF format. You can find it in  gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au , file pub/off/objects/shuttle.geo hanauma.stanford.edu ,  /pub/graphics/Comp.graphics/objects/shuttle.data  model3: The triangles' model.  This model is stored in several files, each defining portions of the model.  Greg Henderson (henders@infonode.ingr.com) has a copy.  He did not mention any restriction on the model's distribution.  model4: The NASA model.  The file starts off with a header line containing three real numbers, defining the offsets used by Lockheed in their simulations:  <x offset> <y offset> <z offset>  From then on, the file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions  3473 vertices. 2748 polygons (407 3-vertex, 2268 4-vertex, 33 5-vertex, 14 6-vertex,  10 7-vertex, 8 8-vertex, 8 12-vertex, 2 13-vertex, 2 15-vertex,  17 16-vertex, 2 17-vertex, 2 18-vertex, 3 19-vertex, 8 24-vertex). Payload doors closed. Units: inches.  Jon Berndt (jon@l14h11.jsc.nasa.gov) seems to be responsible for the model Proprietary info: unknown  model5: The old shuttle model.  The file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions.  104 vertices. 452 polygons (11 3-vertex, 41 4-vertex). Payload doors open. Units: meters.  We have been using this model at STAR Labs, Stanford University, for some years now. Contact me (tolis@nova.stanford.edu) or my supervisor Scott Williams (scott@star5.stanford.edu) if you want a copy.  ========================================================================  16. Image annotation software =============================  a. Touchup runs in Sunview and is pretty good.  It reads in   rasterfiles, but even if your image isn't normally stored   in rasterfile format you could use screendump to make it a   rasterfile.  b. Idraw (part of Stanford's InterViews distribution) can handle some   image formats in addition to being a MacDraw like tool.  I'm not   sure exactly what they are.   You can ftp the idraw's binary from interviews.stanford.edu.  c. Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)   and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats   other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert   things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.   Tgif's sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu   (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)  d. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).   This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all   your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.  e. You might be able to get by with PBMPlus.  pbmtext gives you text output   bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image.  f. 'ice' requires Sun hardware running OpenWindows 3.It's a PostScript-based   graphical editor,and it's available for anonymous ftp from Internet host   eo.soest.hawaii.edu (128.171.151.12). Requires Sun C++ 2.0 and   two other locally developed packages, the LXT library (an Xlib-based   toolkit) and a small C++ class library. All files (pub/ice.tar.Z,   pub/lxt.tar.Z and pub/ldgoc++.tar.Z) are available in compressed   tar format. pub/ice.tar.Z contains a README that gives installation   instructions, as well as an extensive man page (ice.1).   A statically-linked compressed executable pub/ice-sun4.Z for   SPARC systems is also available for ftp.    All software is the property of Columbia University and may not   be redistributed without permission.    ice means Image Composition Environment and it's an imaging tool that   allows raster images to be combined with a wide variety of   PostScript annotations in WYSIWYG fashion via X11 imaging   routines and NeWS PostScript rasterizing.  g. Use ImageMagick to annotate an image from your X server.  Pick the    position of your text with the cursor and choose your font and pen    color from a pull-down menu.  ImageMagick can read and write many   of the more popular image formats.  ImageMagick is available as   export.lcs.mit.edu: contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z or at your nearest   X11 archive.  ========================================================================  17.

A flow library allows graphs to employ broadcast, merge,   synchronization, conditional, and sequencing control strategies.    WIT delivers an object-oriented, distributed, visual programming   environment which allows users to rapidly design solutions to their   imaging problems. Users can consolidate both software and hardware   developments within a complete CAD-like workspace by adding their   own operators (C functions), objects (data structures), and servers   (specialized hardware). WIT runs on Sun, HP9000/7xx, SGI and supports   Datacube MV-20/200 hardware allowing you to run your graphs in real-time.

This was   developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working   for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL   or would be willing to buy it.  It's a few thousand dollars (American) I   expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general   purpose packages I've heard of, besides what TerraMar has.   SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I'm not sure how general purpose   it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I   have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh   transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image   modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I've   used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best   speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large   images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That's a   freebie if you want it\\\"    \\\"My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,   Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its   programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It   handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing   the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even   Excel on the Mac if it's not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH   Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which   that combination couldn't handle, and the speed and ease of use   (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it's mostly astronomical   image processing which I've been doing. This means image enhancement,   cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image   processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity   versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve   fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.) \\\"  [ For IDL call Research Systems , for PV-WAVE call Precision Visuals and  for SIPS call University of Colorado @ Boulder .

The system can be distri-  buted among workstations, between supercomputers and  works-  tations,  and between supercomputers, workstations and video  animation controllers.  The system is most commonly used  to  produce  video based movie displays of images resulting from  visualization of time dependent data, complex 3D data  sets,  and  image  processing  operations.

SVLIB widgets are macro-widgets    comprising lower level Motif widgets such as buttons, scrollbars,    menus, and drawing areas. It is designed to address the reusability    of 2D visualization routines and each widget in the library is an    encapsulation of a specific visualization technique such as colormap    manipulation, image display, and contour plotting. It is targetted   to run on UNIX workstations supporting OSF/Motif. Currently, only    color monitors are supported. Since SVLIB is a collection of widgets    developed in the same spirit as the OSF/Motif user interface widget    set, it integrates seamlessly with the Motif widgets. Programmers    using SVLIB widgets see the same interface and design as other    Motif widgets.    FVS is a visualization software for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)    simulations.  FVS is designed to accept data generated from these   simulations and apply various visualization techniques to present these   data graphically.

In the Graphics and Visualization Lab (GVL) we are using these tools along side standard packages, such as SGI Explorer and the Utah Raster Toolkit, to render 3D volumes and create digital movies. A couple of the more general purpose programs have been bundled into a package called \\\"GVLware\\\".  GVLware, currently consisting of Bob, Raz and Icol, is now available via ftp.  The most interesting program is probably Bob, an interactive volume renderer for the SGI.  Raz streams raster images from disk to an SGI screen, enabling movies larger than memory to be played.

GIS (Geographical Information Systems software) ===================================================  GRASS -----   (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army   Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and   remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a   Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,   although it is reported to have significant image processing   capabilities.    Feature Descriptions    I use GRASS  because it's public domain and can be obtained through the   internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source   code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass   Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using   scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who   already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very   user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software.\\\" A first review  of   overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel   resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose   image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in   Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the   GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric   rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective   interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus   and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them   at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68    Host Configuration Requirements    If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh   which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for   satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC   under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,   and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster   environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it   easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented   in raster (grid-cell) form.    Availability    CERL's Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:   moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).    Mail regarding this site should be addressed to   grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.    This location will be the new \\\"canonical\\\" source for GRASS software, as   well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.   This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and   \\\"tar\\\" archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John   Parks' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,   John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review   it and mail him comments/corrections. The OGI is not currently   maintaining this document, so all correspondence about it should be   directed to grassx@tang.uark.edu    Support    Listserv mailing lists:    grassu-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS users; application-level   questions, support concerns, miscellaneous questions, etc) Send   subscribe commands to grassu-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.    grassp-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS programmers; system-level   questions and tips, tricks, and techniques of design and implementation   of GRASS applications) Send subscribe commands to   grassp-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.    Both lists are maintained by the Office of Grass Integration (subset of   the Army Corps of Engineers Construction Engineering Research Lab in   Champaign, IL). The OGI is providing the lists as a service to the   community; while OGI and CERL employees will participate in the lists,   we can make no claim as to content or veracity of messages that pass   through the list.

Microstation Imager -------------------   Intergraph (based in Huntsville Alabama) sells a wide range of GIS   software/hardware. Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager   sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a   heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.    Feature Description    Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.   Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a   projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).   RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.   Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering   and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,   generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages   up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band   image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.    The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle   VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available   for GIS applications.   Host Configuration Requirements    It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)   though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software   would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.  PCI ---   A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes   an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of   remote sensing data in eight or ten different \\\"industry standard\\\"   formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I   forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix   workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly   other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.    The \\\"PCI software\\\" consists of several classes/groups/packages of   utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common \\\"PCI   database\\\" disk file.  The \\\"Tape I/O\\\" package is a set of utility   programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape   formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the \\\"PCI database\\\" file;   this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can   display data from the PCI database to one or another of several   PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap   representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type   dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically   interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and   Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.   \\\"multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5\\\"), and   God only knows what all else -- there's a LOT.  I don't have and don't   use these, so can't say much about them; you only buy the packages your   particular application/interest calls for.    Each utility is controlled by from one to eight \\\"parameters,\\\" read from   a common \\\"parameter file\\\" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your \\\"default   directory.\\\"  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same   parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting   up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a   scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to   automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,   lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also   invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There's   also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled   language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI   data structures (database file, parameter file).    The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but   requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the   level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle   a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a   utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the   Macintosh calls \\\"raw\\\") data from tape, in a number of different   \\\"interleave\\\" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the   graphic-arts industry's \\\"CT2T\\\" format, would probably (I haven't tried)   handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT   YOU'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start   over.  It's worth noting that the PCI \\\"database\\\" file is designed to   contain not only \\\"raster\\\" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map   information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of   other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often   contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,   longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this   can go into the PCI \\\"database\\\").    I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX   systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific   third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to   mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would   display directly from a PCI \\\"database\\\" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus   24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be \\\"overkill\\\"   in your case; it seems designed for the very \\\"high end\\\"   applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn't suffice   (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It's   probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which   does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe   the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these   areas.  SPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager) --------------------------------   Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis   Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed   for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels   across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since   been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging   Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.    Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and   IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).   Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement   (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.    The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may   require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame   buffer.  I can refer you to people if you're interested.  PCW requires X   for display.  MAP II ------   Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.  CLRview -------   CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit   the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.    This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the   visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.  It supports   the integration of many common but disperate data sources such as DXF,   TIN, DEM, Lattices, and Arc/Info Coverages among others.    CLRview can be obtained from explorer.dgp.utoronto.ca (128.100.1.129)    in the directory pub/sgi/clrview.

And when controlled for usage of oil, gas, etc. energy efficiency in all countries turns out to be identical :-)  To take population density as an example, one way to reduce energy used in transportation is surely to concentrate the population in dense urban areas (though this might, of course, have other disadvantages, possibly even relating to energy use).

The one line description is: Afflict Your Icons with \\\"Cursorphobia\\\"\",\"  Note that I said the fall of Rome, not of the Empire.  The Roman Empire lasted until 1453, with its transfered capital in Constantinople.  The main reason for it's fall was not so much the sack of Constantinople by the men of the 4th Crusade (who were not Christians - they had been excommunicated down to the last man after attacking the Christian city of Zara in Croatia), but rather the disastorous defeat in the battle of Mazinkert.  After the Turks breached the frontier, it was only a matter of time before the Empire fell, the inability of the Empire to hold onto the rim of Anatolia, with the Ottomans and Rum Seljuks in the middle should be quite obvious to any student of history.  The sack of Constantinople only hastened the inevitable along.  For if the Greeks had wanted to save their empire, why would they not cooperate with the Crusaders when they came to do battle with the Saracens in the 1st-3rd Crusades?  Because of their obstinacy over cooperating with people they considered heretics, even though those \\\"heretics\\\" were fighting for the cause of the Empire and Christendom in doing battle with the Turkish hordes in Anatolia, Edessa, Lebanon, Palastine, and Syria, the some hordes who were to later sack Constantinople, and overrun a third of Europe (the Balkans, Hungary, the Ukraine, the Caucasus, etc.)\",\" no, sheesh, didn't you know 666 is the beast's apartment?  667 is across the hall from the beast, and is his neighbor along with the rest of the 6th floor.

For those who have not heard of this effect, you put a current through one of these devices, and it pumps heat from one side to the other.  Reverse the current and you reverse the effect.  I think a temperature difference can give you an EMF as well.  Anyway, it struck me that you could make a nice cool/hot box for picnics with one of these, a power regulator, a thermostat and a couple of heat sinks.  The biggest device can shift 60W with an efficiency of 80-90%, which ain't bad (although it would flatten my car battery in about half an hour).  Unfortunately the catalogue didn't list anything more than the basic specs as a heat pump.  I imagine that you would get a back-EMF as the temperature gradient across the device increases.  If so, presumably its power decreases as the back-EMF increases, until eventually we have a steady state with no current being consumed (assuming no leakage).  If so, then the final temperature difference between the two sides could be set by the supply voltage and nothing more (although that would be a lousy way to control it).  What I would like to know is:  1: Are the above guesses correct?  2: What is the open-circuit thermal resistance of a typical device?    (I just want to be sure that my coolbox is not going to get warm    too fast when I unplug it)  3: How does a Peltier Effect heat pump actually work?

Presumably the protocol can be recovered (if by nothing else, differential analysis).  Postulate if you will, a chip (or logic) sitting between the clipper chip and its communications channel.  The purpose of this chip is twofold:       1) Transmit Channel       The spoof chip XORs the 30 bit encrypted serial number with      a secondary keying variable.  This renders the serial number      unrecoverable with just the system key   2) Recieve Channel       The spoof chip XORs the incoming encrypted serial number      with a secondary keying variable (assuming the serial number      is necessary for local operation).  This has the net result of hiding the serial number.  This gets more interesting when the number of serial numbers issued becomes large, making it difficult to distinguish between valid serial numbers and a spoofed serial number.  Without knowing the system key, you could lie about the serial number, but risk detection of the lie.  IF you had the system key and the encryption algorithm you could successfully lie with a lower probability of detection by emulating the format of your own serial number.\",\"Hello.

I have got that wrong. My apology.     (Deletion)     So? No fun, but I must have met the minority then. And \\\"given by god\\\" refers to any action whereby a god god causes or better effects something.     Rob, I am not intimate with Jewish theology, but I understand that you are a Messianic Jew. Correct me if I am wrong, but it appears that the views of Messianic Jews on metaphysics is different to that of the majority of Jews. While Jewish theology overall is quite distinct from the Christianic god views, I have heard that it is possible for Jews to attribute evil to their god, an no-no for Christians, the Bible is still seen as effect of the interaction of some god with man.     (Deletion)   The context was metaphysics, even when the process of adapting the commandments is not transcendent, the justification of the process lie in metaphysic specualtion. I wonder how you break out of the shackles of having metaphysics in your system.     (Deletion)   Is is in a book that commands to commit genocide among other reprehensible deeds. The context is repulsive, and it is foul play, IMO, to invoke some relatively enlightened passages as an example for the content of the whole book.     (Big deletion)   No, not the interpretation of some laws, but the interpretation of the bible. As in the example that Sodom and Gomorrha mean argue with god. The whole idea that it is metaphorically and yet allows you to argue with a god (whatever that means, that alone is a theo- logic question) is proof of a theology used.       It is an important question in the light of what for instance the passage witrh Sodom and Gomorrha means. Either there is some connection between the text, the fact that it exists, and your interpretation of it, or it is purely arbitrary.. Further, the question is why is has one to carry the burden of Biblical texts when one could simply write other books that convey the message better. You might answer that one can't becuase  some peculiar Biblical information might be lost, but that holds true of every other book, and the question remains why has the Bible still a special place? Can't it be replaced somehow? Is it ok to bargain the dangerous content of the Bible against some other message that is included as well?     (Deletion)   Sorry, but there are worse systems does not say anything about if one could not have a better system.   (Deletion)   If we read two stories in the Bible, one that god commands people to kill children for being idolaters and another where god kills children directly, what is more important to resolve, the message that children are to be killed or if it has  to be done by god?     And the argument you have given is a fallacy, while it may not be important in the context you have given to find out if god is corporeal or not, it can be crucial in other questions. Religious believers resolve contradictions with that they choose one of the possibilities given in an arbitrary way, and have the advantage of being able to attribute their decision to some god.\",\" The computer, err, government, is your friend.  Have a nice day (under penalty of law).\",\"I just installed a Motorola XC68882RC50 FPU in an Amiga A2630 board (25 MHz 68030 + 68882 with capability to clock the FPU separately).  Previously a MC68882RC25 was installed and everything was working perfectly.  Now the systems displays a yellow screen (indicating a exception) when it check for the presence/type of FPU.  When I reinstall an MC68882RC25 the system works fine, but with the XC68882 even at 25 MHz it does not work.  The designer of the board mentioned that putting a pullup resistor on data_strobe (470 Ohm) might help, but that didn't change anything.  Does anybody have some suggestions what I could do?  Does this look like a CPU-FPU communications problem or is the particular chip dead (it is a pull, not new)? Moreover, the place I bought it from is sending me an XC68882RC33.  I thought that the 68882RC33 were labeled MC not XC (for not finalized mask design).

Only TV could transmit the full sadness of his face. \\\"You say that we teach our children to hate you, but what do you expect to happen to a child who sees this ?\\\" And once again he wraps himself in a lengthy silence, his face crumbling into weeping. Mahmoud stood in the field of rubble that was once his home. The term 'dispossession' has an absolute meaning here. Nothing is left of what he accumulated during his entire life, only the rubble of a house and shreds of belongings.  Once again Khan Yunis. Once again demolished homes. Last Thursday there was a search for wanted people here. Once again the IDF forces employed the new method, fired and bombed and shot missiles and placed explosives. Already three times during the past weeks I have gone out to see the destruction and each time I was more horrifying scenes. This time they hit the largest number of houses, 17 according to the IDF estimate, ten of them completely demolished. But not only that:  the method has also become more brutal. Three weeks ago, in Tufah neighborhood in Gaza, the residents were still told to remove their valuables from their homes.  This time the army skipped that part; three weeks ago the handcuffed men, inhabitants of the demolished homes, were supplied with some water and one apple during the 12 hours they had to stand. This time there was only water. Three weeks ago they were even allowed to go out to the toilet. This time the soldier just gold them: Piss and shit in your pants. And thus, last Thursday, some 45 men stood for about 12 hours, their hands bound behind their backs, their eyes blindfolded, without food, with wet pants on their legs and a terrible feeling of humiliation in their hearts, listening to the sounds of the explosions destroying their homes, one after the other.  (...)\",\"  Uh Oh!  The first sign of an argument without merit--the stating of one's  \\\"qualifications\\\" in an area.  If you know something about Nazi Germany,  show it.  If you don't, shut up.  Simple as that. \",\"    Each chip includes the following components:        the Skipjack encryption algorithm       F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips       N, a 30-bit serial number       U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip  Hmmm. A thirty bit serial number. And, we are told, the unit key U is derived deterministically from this serial number. That means that there are only one billion possible unit keys.     To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is    first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.    S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a    64-bit block R1:      R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .     Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and    N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:        R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1]      R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .     R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The    first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The    rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2    are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow    agencies.  Hmmm. We must assume that generating the unit key U from the serial number N rather than generating it from a randomly selected U1 and U2 is an intentional way of assuring a \\\"fail safe\\\" for the government -- U is completedly determined given S1, S2 and N. If S1 and S2 do not change they constitute effective \\\"master keys\\\" (along with F), the theft of which (or the possession of which by various authorities) completely obviates the security of the system. However, more interestingly, we know, for a fact that if S1 and S2 are fixed no matter what the keyspace for U is no more than 2^30. Why not pick U1 and U2 at random? Why this interesting restriction of they key space if it NOT to provide an additional back door?  I find it disturbing that at the very best my security is dependant on approximately 30 bytes worth of information that could be written on the back of a napkin.  Even if S1 and S2 change periodically, the rationale behind this restriction in the size of the keyspace seems strange if one is assuming that the goal is security -- and makes perfect sense if the goal is an illusion of security.  If S1 and S2 do not change, even if they remain secret I wonder if they can somehow be back-derived given enough unit key/serial number pairs. We are assured that this cannot happen -- but no one understands how Skipjack works outside of government officials and, soon, foreign intelligence services that gain the information via espionage. Presumably we will eventually have the information as well -- reverse engineering gets more and more advanced every year -- but by the time we know it may be too late.     As a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are    written onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a    file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part    U1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third    disk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent    2 takes the second disk.  The third disk is used to program the chips.    After the chips are programmed, all information is discarded from the    vault and the agents leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional    assurance that no information is left behind.  None of this makes me feel the least bit secure. The silly notion of \\\"destroying the laptop\\\" appears to be yet another bizarre distraction. We all know that you can't read data from DRAM that has been turned off for more than a few moments. On the other hand, what we don't know is why there is a need to generate the unit keys from S1 and S2 in the first place other than to weaken the system. We don't know if the agents in question would resist a million in cash a piece for their information -- its probably worth hundreds of million, so you can make the bribe arbitrarily hard to resist. And to tell you the truth, doing this in a \\\"vault\\\" rather than in Joe Random Tempest-shielded Room with a laptop computer seems like melodrama designed to make high-school dropouts from Peoria impressed -- but it does very little for most of the rest of us.     The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the    room instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2,    and the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to    the escrow agencies.  What would this provide? Lets say the escrow agencies are the ACLU and the NRA and their agents personally take back the disks and are always honest. Who cares? The NSA must be laughing out loud, because they have the algorithm to regenerate U given N and likely don't need to steal they keys as they effectively already have them.  -- Perry Metzger  pmetzger@shearson.com\",\"I'd like to add a second S3 based video card to my system.

Pat LaFontaine was awarded the Captaincy when Mike Ramsey was forced to give it up (Ramsey's now a Penguin).  Ramsey inherited it from Mike Foligno (who's now a leaf).  He in turn had inherited it from Lindy Ruff, who went I forget where.  Ruff had it from Perreault, who retired, so I guess that's where the streak started.  Or did it? After all, Danny Gare was captain before him, and he went to Detroit. Jim Scoenfeld, Gerry Meehan, and Floyd Smith are the others, in reverse order, last to first.  I was a bit young at the time, so I'm not sure of the fate of Schoenfeld, but he ultimately went to Detroit and Boston.  Meehan went to Vancouver, Atlanta and Washington.  Smith seems to have hung up his skates after Buffalo, but I don't know if the captaincy was removed before or after that, or how many games he played for Buffalo.  This is actually getting fascinating.  :-)  Captaincy in Buffalo is a sure sign you're to be traded, almost, unless you're a franchise player. \",\"I don't know if you could call him rushed, but \\\"Big\\\" Ben McDonald didn't much time at all in the minors.

In the NT, it is expected that when believers gather,   - people will prophesy   - the prophecy must be judged (1 Cor 14:29) There is nothing about killing someone who makes a mistake.   Scripture is scripture; there is no \\\"gift of scripture\\\".  And I don't know about you, but I know that _I_ have made mistakes while filled with the spirit.  If you don't give grace to allow people to make mistakes, they will never grow in the use of the spiritual gifts!  When we minister in my small group, I encourage people to speak out any impressions or images they think might be from the Lord.  Only by trying will they know whether they were right or wrong -- and in either case, they'll have a better handle on it the next time.  Didn't you fall when you were learning to ride a bicycle?  But you kept on trying, and you learned both from your failures and your successes. Spiritual gifts are no different -- you get better with experience.   The canon of Scripture is complete.  Does this mean that God no longer speaks?  I have heard his voice -- not audibly (though some have), but clearly nonetheless.  Is what I heard equivalent to Scripture?  No.  I have never heard contemporary prophets claim that what they receive from the Lord is on the same level as Scripture; on the contrary, those who are mature obey the Scriptures by submitting their prophecies to fellow believers for judgement.  And the most reliable yardstick for judging prophecies is, certainly, the Scriptures themselves.  The canon is closed -- but God is not silent!   Does it matter what it is called?  The question is not how to label it, but how to receive it.  Words of knowledge, incidentally, are similar to prophecy (and sometimes the two overlap), but generally it is supernatural knowledge of some fact that could not be known otherwise.\",\"I need to write an application which does annotation notes on existing documents.
