PURPOSE OF THE GROUP:  ====================       The following are some of the main purposes this group will      achieve:       i)   To discuss the common beliefs of all major religions as           they relate to Ahmadiyya Muslim Community.       ii)  To discuss the doctrines, origin and teachings  of this           puissant spiritual force on earth.       iii) To examine Islamic teachings and beliefs in general  in           light  of the Quran  and established Islamic traditions           of 15 centuries from Ahmadiyya perspective.       iv)  To discuss the similarities  between Ahmadi Muslims and           people of other Religions  of the world and discuss how           religious tolerance  and respect to other's  faiths can           be brought about to  eliminate inter-religion rivalries           and hatred among people of religions.        v)   To discuss the origin and teachings of all religions in           general and Islamic and Ahmadiyya Muslims in particular           to foster better understanding among Ahmadi Muslims and           other religious people.       vi)  To discuss current world problems and solution to these           problems as offered by religion.       vii) To exchange important news and views about the Ahmadiyya           Muslim Community and other Religions.       viii)To add diversity in the religious newsgroups present           on Usenet.       ix)  To discuss why  religious persecution is on the rise  in           the world  and find  solutions to remedy the ever deter-           iorating  situation  in the  world in general and in the            Islamic world in particular.       x)   To discuss the contributions of founders of  all  reli-           gions and their  people for humanity, society and world            peace in general and by the International Ahmadiyya Mus           -lim Community in particular.   TYPE:  ====  The group will be MODERATED for orderly and free religious dialo- gue.   The moderation will NOT prevent disagreement or dissent to beliefs, but will mainly be used  to  prevent  derogatory/squalid use  of  dialect  and irrelevant issues. The moderators have been decided through personal e-mail and through a  general  consensus among  the proponants by discussion in news.groups. The following moderators have been proposed and agreed upon:  Moderator:     Nabeel A.

The founder of this sect, Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835-1908), proclaimed to be the Promised Reformer of this age as foretold in almost all the major religions of the world today (Islam, Christianity, Judiasm,  Hin- duism).  He  claimed  to  be  the  long awaited second comming of Jesus Christ (metaphorically), the Muslim Mahdi, and the Promised Messiah.  He  claimed that the prophecies contained in almost all the great religions of the world about the advent of a  messenger from God have been fulfilled.          The claims Hazrat Ahmad raised storms  of  hostility  and extreme  oposition from many priestlike people of Muslims, Chris- tians, Jews and Hindus of that age. Such opposition is often wit- nessed  in  the history of divine reformers. Even today this sect is being persecuted specially in  some  of  the  Muslim  regimes. Dispite  the  opposition  and persecution, this sect has won many adherents in 130 countries. It has over 10 million followers, who come from a diverse ethnic and cultural background.          The sect is devoted to world peace and in bringing  about a better understanding of religion, and the founders of all reli- gions. Its mission is to unite mankind into one Universal  broth- erhood  and  develop  a  better  understanding  of  faith. Ahmadi Muslims have always been opposed to all kind of violence and spe- cially religious intollerance and fundamentalism.          Among its many philanthropic activities, the sect has es- tablished  a network of hundreds of schools, hospitals, and clin- ics in many third world countries. These institutions are staffed by  volunteer  professional  and are fully financed by the sect's internal resources.          The Ahmadiyya mission is to bring about a universal moral reform,  establish  peace and justice, and to unite mankind under one universal religion.   NEWSGROUP CREATION:  ==================\",\"It seems to me that you are the one who is supposed to do some reading. I think that our major difference in opinion is on the legitimacy of Sevres. First, thattreaty was signed by the Ottoman Empire therefore legally it does not bind the  Republic of Turkey. The new independence movement (which by the way, is not the same as the Young Turks) naturally rejected it out of hand. to say that we  should accept because the Germans did theirs is absurd. We saw what the cosequences of such harsh treaties were in Hitler. Second, the Sevres treaty was even  worse than Versailles. It divided the Ottoman Empire in to several influence  zones, had the capital occupied, the economy under Allied control, the army di minished to nothing but a police force, in short a country in name only. I'd wonder if you would like to live under such conditions. And for the record, I donot feel sorry for the soldiers killed in IZMIR harbour. Before evacuating the  city, the Greek forces burned it down, so it serves them right. As for being fooled by Allied promises, that too is your fault. You did not come to Anatolia just to enforce Sevres but to take part in the plunder  as well. K. Burak Ucer\",\"In reference to the limits of acceleration with guns launching solid rockets as payloads.  Thiokol provided me with samples and data on a reinforcement to solid motor grains for high accelerations.  Solid motor propellants usually have a substantial percentage of  aluminum in the mix.  For example, the Space Shuttle SRBs are 16 percent Aluminum.  The technique is to use a 'foamed aluminum' structure. The structure looks like the inverse of a set of bubbles (an I suspect some bubbling process is used to form it).  In other words, if you made a bunch of bubbles in molten aluminum, then froze it, this is what you get.  It forms a strong network of effectively aluminum wires in all directions.  The remaining solid fuel mix is infiltrated into the voids, and you get aluminum-reinforced solid propellant.  The foamed-aluminum makes up about 6 percent of the total propellant, so there is still aluminum particles in the bulk grain.  The major improvement is the higher resistance to grain cracking, which is the principal failure mode for solid propellant.  Dani Eder \",\"   .

You lurkers can join in at any time, you know!  Ahhh.. Talk.politics.guns -- the kindler, gentler newsgroup.  Who would have thought?    I remind you of shrapnel.  I consider 5' a reasonable space limitation, but make no mistake a gun blowing up is a hazard to those nearby, say in the next lane at the range.  My point was at what distance, or level of threat, we draw the line.  Is it the endangerment of others, so we do a 5' restriction, or the possibility of being shot, hence we draw a 1.5 mile restriction, or a nuke and draw a 5 mile restriction?  To me they al suffer from the fundamental flaw that they restrict based upon the instrument rather than placing the responsibility for usage squarely upon the shoulders of the user. Perhaps Sen. Metzenbaum declaring the Barrett Light Fifty an assault rifle has made this more apparent to me, since the Barrett has only range and acurracy going for it.    I disagree, on the grounds that a house can be rebuilt much more easily than my family once I have died.  I assume that word would get to the citizens that such an attack was planned.  If this is not the case, the tactical and strategic implications change quite a bit.  Personally, my home is worth, say, twenty Martians intent on taking over the world.  My family?  All of them.  The balancing act here is hard to judge sitting at my desk.    That seems to be the case already, given that heavy weapons aren't commonly owned by the citizenry.  With such low numbers, obviously due to cost, I don't think the superior weapons are going to be of great effect against a numerically superior foe.  Furthermore, it is even more doubtful their training includes proper tactical movements that best utilize tanks, whereas the commonly rifleman is not so hampered in effectiveness.    I had envisioned that the armorer, perhaps the officers of a select group, and the like would exercise control over the heavier, more complex weapons.  But, if Joe Bob owns an old Sherman tank I certainly wouldn't ask him to give it up.  Follow orders from the officers, yes.  Since the expense of a tank is so large, though, chances are it would be jointly purchased and should therefore be jointly maintained and operated.    This I'll agree with to a point.  The State having control over the heavy weapons should not be justification for the state to have them centrally located.  Keep them spread out, such that the ability of the State to lock them up isn't so easy.  Otherwise, I would have to assume that State control would rest on the authority of the Governor and militia officers.    I'm having a hard time seeing how these heavy weapons, fairly few in numbers, could not be easily wielded by a few people with government support.  Just as you argued above that the weapons should be divvied up and under democratic control so one side doesn't have all of them, I can't see where this situation is alleviated in having the select militia holding all the weapons and the unorganized militia being the infantry. I think a better mix is called for.  But, I would argue that the Federal army should rely upon the select militia and the unorganized militia for the bulk of its infantry units.    We have to assume that there would be those who would side with the government-controlled forces, and if they've all the equipment an infantry force 3x the size would be in trouble. I'd like to see that heavy stuff, say tanks, offset by the local troups having a few 105's and anti-tank weapons in their armory.  These would be much more useful to infantry than the tank would be when cost and training requirements are figured in. I suppose I'm quibbling over what constitutes heavy equipment.    So would I, but the resources often aren't available to outfit local units well enough.  Thus, we will certainly have to call in others, and a mechanized unit carries more stuff faster than anything else.    Perhaps our ideas of heavy weapons are different?  I think main battle tanks, self-propelled artillery, and 155mm and up field pieces are heavy stuff.  M113 troop carriers, 2 1/2 ton trucks, HumVee's, old M60 tanks, 105 Howitzers, are more the stuff of a mechanized infantry.  Actually, this is what the Guard units in Iowa are currently fielding in some units.   Perhaps it is just my innate fear of having the real heavy equipment under State control, with little but numbers and light stuff to act as a deterrent.  Allowing main battle tanks to the states should be balanced with anti-tank capability in the local ranks.  Similarly, local units would need to band together quickly, hence small and fast response means mechanized infantry.  Finally, the militia is more than just fighting.  Equipment is needed for other responses.  The Federal army, I'm convinced, should have a very minumum of infantry, relying on the state and local militias for these functions.\",\"I am using X11R5patch23 with the R5-SUNOS5 patch posted on export.

I've got unix loaded on one of my pcs (along with windogs) and the OS can only use one of the two IDE drives at one time.  It's pretty ugly.  I just bought at Quantum 240 for my mac at home.  I paid $369 for it.  I haven't seen IDE drives cheaper.  : The original CGA cart back in '84 was $300.  I think the original EGA card : (or PGA?) was $800.  SCSI has stood relatively alone in not coming down : in price, mainly because we're talking about PC's and not Sun's or Sparc : or SGI or (name your favorite unix workstation).  That is, after millions : of PC buying decisions over the years, SCSI has had plenty of time to : come down in price.  No, actually, we're talking about SCSI being expensive simply because nobody did a common interface for the PC.  If they had a common (read: easily implemented) method of adding scsi to a PC (like as in a Sun or Mac), then you'd find SCSI the connection medium of choice.  : I won't argue that the SCSI standard makes for a good, well implimented : data highway, but I still want to know why it intrinsically better : (than IDE, on an ISA bus) when it comes to multi-tasking OS's when : managing data from a single SCSI hard drive.  On a single drive, SCSI is more expensive.  But, you bought your PC for expandibility, so, you'd want to add more drives or whatever.  The following are why I find SCSI intrinsically better than IDE:  A (partial?) list:  1.  You can add many different types of devices and access them   concurrently.  2.  A SCSI device works on many different machines (I have a mac  and a PC at home and moving hard drives between them is VERY nice  with SCSI -- hook them up and away they go)  3.  SCSI devices work together better than IDE devices.  For  instance, recently, I added an older connor 100 meg IDE to a maxtor  212 meg IDE.  The connor *MUST* be setup as the slave.  It will  work no other way.  On SCSI, you set the address, check the  termination, plug it in, and away it goes.  4.  I have a problem with IDE's mutual exclusion - I notice that  the time it takes to switch from accessing drive c: to drive d: is  quite long as compared to the time it takes to switch from drive c:  to d: on a SCSI system.  Under a multitasking OS, this is very  noticable, as many things can be going on at once.  One neat thing that I've noticed lately (a fringe benefit) has been the ability to add older (almost dead) drives as storage on a SCSI system with little problem -- we've got a bunch of almost dead 20 meg drives that I've added to my PC.  I've now got the interface full, but, it does allow me to have 4 20 meg drives, 1 240 meg drive, 1 tape drive, and 1 105 meg drive all on the same card.    Simply put, SCSI is handier than IDE.  No mysterious jumpers to figure out.

To cover my arse, what I'm trying to say is that there is an infinitely grey area between weak and strong, as well as between strong and the unattainable mathematical atheism (I wish!).  Whereas I _logically_ can only support the weak atheist position, in effect I am a strong atheist (and wish I could be a mathematical one).  To justify my strong atheist position I believe I need only show that the evidence presented in favour of any of the gods under scrutiny is faulty.  If I read the FAQ correctly, no argument for the existence of god (generic, as represented by mainstream theologians) has ever been found to be unassailable.  To me this is adequate evidence that the _real_god_ is undefinable (or at least no definition has yet been found to be watertight), which in turn I accept as sufficient to base a disbelief in each and every conceivable god.  I'm a little fuzzy on the edges, though, so opinions are welcome (but perhaps we should change the thread subject).\",\"Hi, all!  Anyone knows of a Motif mailing list?

Any suggestions/answers would be greatly appreciated.  Please reply to:\",\" I agree with Carol here.  Determining absolutes is, practically speaking, a waste of time.  And we easily forget that relative truth is, in fact relative.  For example, I recently was asking some children the question \\\"What temperature does water boil at?\\\"  I got the answer 212 degrees consistently.  I asked if they knew what scale, and was told \\\"It's just 212 degrees.  Any scale. That's what all thermometers say.\\\"  Well, that's sincere, and may be true in the experience of the speaker, but it is simply wrong.  IT is NOT an absolute truth.  Similarly, Scripture is full of Truth, which we should nurture and cherish, but trying to determine which parts are Absolute Truth and which parts are the manifestations of that in the context of the time and culture in which the text was penned is missing the point.  Then religion easily becomes an intellectual head-trip, devoid of the living experience of  the indwelling Trinity and becomes dead scholasticism, IMO.   [example of head-covering in Church deleted]  This was a good example.  There may be an Absolute Truth behind the writing, but the simplest understanding of the passage is that the instructions apply to the Corinthians, and not necessarily elsewhere. The instructions may reflect Absolute Truth in the context of first century culture and the particular climate at Corinth, which was having a LOT of trouble with order. Is it Absolute Truth to me?  No.  And I  see no compelling, or even reasonable, reason that it should be.    Even the most die-hard literalists do not take all of the Bible literally. I've yet to meet anyone who takes the verse \\\"blessed is he who takes your babies and smashes their heads against the rocks\\\" literally.  The Bible was not printed or handed to us by God with color codings to tell us what parts should be interpreted which way.     I agree.  Very few.  And even if we knew them, personally, we may not be  able to express that in a way that still conveys Absolute Truth to another. The presence of absence of Absolutes may not make any difference, since I know I can never fully apprehend an Absolute if it walks up and greets me.  I can't prove the existence of absolutes.  I can only rely upon MY experience. I also trust God's revelation that WE cannot fully comprehend the infinite. Therefore we can't comprehend the Absolutes.  So I don't need them.   I can never know the essence of God, only the energies by and through which God is manifested to God's creation.  So the reality can be that there ARE absolutes, but it is of no practical importance.  It's like claiming that the original scriptural autographs were perfect, but copies may not be.  Swell. Who cares?  It doesn't affect me in any practical useful way.  I might as  well believe that God has made a lot of electric blue chickens, and that they live on Mars.  Maybe God did.  So what? Is that going to have ANY effect on  how I deal with my neighbor, or God?  Whether or not I go to this or that cafeteria for lunch?  No.    This attitude leads many non-Christians to believe that ALL Christians are arrogant idiots incapable of critical reasoning.  Christianity is true, wonderful and sensible.  It appeals to Reason, since Reason is an inner reflection of the Logos of God.  Explanations that violate that simply appear to be insecure authoritarian responses to a complex world.  NOTE:  I'm NOT claiming there is no place for authority. That'd be silly.        There IS a world of difference between authoritative and authoritarian.        Authoritative is en expression of authority that respects others.        Authoritarian is en expression of authority that fails to do that,        and is generally agressive.  Good parents (like God) are authoritative.        Many Christians are simply authoritarian, and, not surprisingly, few         adults respond to this treatment.

CRYPTO '93  -  General Information  (August 22 - 26, 1993) ............................................................................  THE PROGRAM:  Crypto'93 is the thirteenth in a series of workshops on  cryptology held at Santa Barbara, and is sponsored by the International  Association for Cryptologic Research, in cooperation with the IEEE  Computer Society Technical Committee on Security and Privacy, the Computer  Science Department of the University of California, Santa Barbara, and  Bell-Northern Research (a subsidiary of Northern Telecom). The program  for the workshop will cover all aspects of cryptology. Extended abstracts of  the papers presented at the conference will be distributed to all attendees  at the conference, and formal proceedings will be published at a later date.  In addition to the regular program of papers selected or invited by the  program committee, there will be a rump session on Tuesday evening for  informal presentations. Facilities will also be provided for attendees to  demonstrate hardware, software and other items of cryptographic interest.  If you wish to demonstrate such items, you are urged to contact the General  Chair so that your needs will be attended to. The social program will include  hosted cocktail parties on Sunday and Monday. In addition, there will be a  beach barbecue on Wednesday evening. The price of the barbecue is included  in the room and board charge, and extra tickets may be purchased.  ABOUT THE CONFERENCE FACILITIES:  The workshop will be held on the campus of  the University of California, Santa Barbara. The campus is located adjacent  to the Santa Barbara airport and the Pacific Ocean. Accommodations are  available in the university dormitories at relatively low cost for conference  participants. Children under the age of 13 are not allowed to stay in the  dormitories, so those bringing small children will need to make separate  arrangements in one of several nearby hotels. More information on hotels is  enclosed. Parking on campus is available at no cost to the participants.  However, participants must indicate on the registration form if they desire  a parking permit.  TRAVEL INFORMATION:  The campus is located approximately 2 miles from the  Santa Barbara airport, which is served by several airlines, including  American, America West, Delta, United, and US Air. Free shuttle bus service  will be provided between the Santa Barbara airport and the campus on Sunday  and Thursday afternoons. All major rental car agencies are also represented  in Santa Barbara, and AMTRAK has rail connections to San Francisco from the  north and Los Angeles from the south. Santa Barbara is approximately 100 miles  north of Los Angeles airport, and 350 miles south of San Francisco.  REGISTRATION:  Participation is invited by interested parties, but attendance  at the workshop is limited, and pre-registration is strongly advised. Late  registrations, subject to a late registration fee, may be accepted if space  is available, but there are NO GUARANTEES. To register, fill out the attached  registration form and return to the address on the form along with payment in  full before July 9, 1993. Campus accommodations will be available on a first  come, first serve basis for attendees who register by July 9, 1993. The  conference fees include participation in the program and all social functions,  as well as membership to the IACR and a subscription to the Journal of  Cryptology. The room and board charges include dormitory lodging and meals  are available to those unable to obtain funding. Applications for stipends  should be sent to the General Chair before June 4, 1993.  ............................................................................

CRYPTO '93  -  Hotel Information ............................................................................  For those who choose not to stay in the dormitories, the following is a  partial list of hotels in the area. Those who choose to stay off campus are  responsible for making their own reservations, and early reservations are  advised since August is a popular season in Santa Barbara. Note that Goleta  is closer to UCSB than Santa Barbara, but that a car will probably be  required to travel between any hotel and the campus. All prices are subject  to change; prices should be confirmed by calling the individual hotels  directly. However, mention CRYPTO'93 when you are making your reservation and  in several of the hotels listed you will be eligible for the university rate  which can be significantly less than the normal rates. We are not able to  block rooms in these hotels, so please make reservations as early as  possible.

Does it grow automatically : on trees when we wish so, or someone has to produce it ?  Some say it was generated by God or Goddess; some say it was the result of the coalescence of billions of tons of interstellar debris.  In either case, the property of which Xavier speaks has been around for millions of years.   :     It all follows from the fact that Mother Nature does not : provide us automatically with our needs,  Oh?  When did She *stop*?  Mother Nature has been automatically providing us with her bounty ever since we crawled out of the primordial ooze.  It is not \\\"produced\\\": it produces itself, year after year.  Last night, for example, I saw four deer crossing the road (pretty sight, too); in an earlier time, one of them would have been dinner.  : There are 2 ways to go with produced things: the first is to  : _trade_ it with the the person(s) who produced it.  : The other one is to take it with a gun from the person who produced : it. The first way is the civilized method, the second is how savages : arrange their affairs.  The American Indians had no concept of ownership of property, and often freely gave of their supplies to neighboring tribes, trading food and clothing for weapons or services.  The Native Hawaiians, like their Polynesian ancestors, also could not conceive of that idea, and shared many things with the other Islanders.  In fact, \\\"hi'ipoi\\\", the Hawaiian word for \\\"cherish\\\" means \\\"sharing food\\\".  The Great Mahele, in which the Islands were divided up more-or-less evenly between the rich and the poor, was a white man's idea.  In Africa, villagers will often share tools, crops, and clothing with other members of their own village and neighboring villages.  Every anthropologist who has ever been to Africa has at least one tale of the difficulties arising from the so- called \\\"theft\\\" of the scientists possessions -- two concepts of which, until the visitors came along, the natives had no understanding.  These are the people we call \\\"savages\\\".  On the other hand, car-jackings and muggings are up from last year.

The first attempt failed in the summer  of 1992 (the voting deadline was August 31, 1992).  The voting rules  state that another attempt for creating newsgroups can be started  after a six month waiting period (in this case, it is March 1, 1993).  This is the first attempt at creating comp.os.os2.multimedia and  comp.os.os2.bugs.   This document contains:  *  the background showing the need for these proposals  *  the proposed charters for these proposals  *  voting instructions  *  a voting ballot  *  some example ballots  *  the voting rules  *  the voting schedule  *  the Mass Acknowledgement   Background:   The creation of two, free, 32-bit compilers for OS/2 2.x (gcc/2  and emx/gcc; read comp.os.os2.programmer for details) has spurred  a continuing deluge of software ported from UNIX platforms, such  as emacs, less, awk, grep, sed, xscheme, ispell, flex, yacc, and  much more.  Borland has released its C/C++ compiler for OS/2 2.x,  allowing for easier porting of DOS and Windows software.   Much of the PC hardware and drivers were written for DOS, and  later, Windows.  As more people are discovering OS/2 2.x, the  number of people asking questions about OS/2's compatibility  with their hardware increases, as does the questions on the  availability of drivers for their hardware, installation  procedures, etc.   Multimedia is becoming popular.  OS/2 2.0 supports Windows  Multimedia Extensions using Win-OS/2 3.0.  Furthermore, IBM is  including direct multimedia support in OS/2 starting with version  2.1 (in addition to using Win-OS/2 3.1).   Any non-trivial software will have bugs -- OS/2 is not exempt,  especially since IBM is constantly adding new features to OS/2.  So far, IBM has issued system patches and corrective service disks  (e.g.  the Service Pak) for free (free from BBSs and ftp sites, or  for free plus a small media charge for diskettes -- read  comp.os.os2.misc for details).   Proposed Charters:   (a)  create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting (unmoderated)    It will provide a forum for developers of ported software so   as to coordinate efforts, avoid duplication of effort, and   spur additional development.  The group will also cover   topics such as porting from other platforms (such as DOS,   Windows, UNIX, etc), toolkits which aid in program   portability (including porting tools such as Mirrors), and   so forth.   (b)  rename: comp.os.os2.programmer.misc (unmoderated)    To keep the structure of the OS/2 newsgroup heirarchy   orthogonal, comp.os.os2.programmer should be renamed to   comp.os.os2.programmer.misc.    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc will still be the newsgroup   for OS/2 programmers to discuss programming issues and   technical aspects of OS/2 in an unmoderated setting.   (c)  create comp.os.os2.setup (unmoderated)    It will be devoted to OS/2 system setup topics, including the   availability of device drivers, compatibility information,   installation procedures, system requirements, and overall   performance optimization.   (d)  create comp.os.os2.multimedia (unmoderated)    It will provide a forum for discussion of multi-media issues.   (e)  create comp.os.os2.bugs (unmoderated)    It will provide a forum for OS/2 system bug reports, bug   diagnosis and work arounds, the availability of system   patches and corrective service disks, and so forth.    [Note that discussion of bugs in applications belong in other   newsgroups, and discussion of bugs in OS/2 betas belong in   comp.os.os2.beta]   How to Vote:   To cast your vote, fill out the ballot below and e-mail it to me.  Many newsreaders will allow e-mail to be sent by replying to this  post.  Be sure to send only the ballot, and edit out the rest of  this post.   1)  Type in your vote for each proposal:       If you favor the charter as proposed, put a \\\"yes\\\" after its name.      If you oppose the charter as proposed, put a \\\"no\\\" after its name.      To abstain, leave a blank after its name.   2)  Type in your last name (i.e. your family name), a comma, and      your first name (i.e. your personal name).   3)  Cut out the ballot,  Please do not delete any lines of the      ballot.   4)  E-mail your ballot to mlevis@lonestar.utsa.edu before 11:59:59 pm      (Central Time), April 24, 1993.   Ballot:  ----------------cut here----------------cut here----------------cut here----          (a) comp.os.os2.programmer.porting:         (b)    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc:         (c)              comp.os.os2.setup:         (d)         comp.os.os2.multimedia:         (e)               comp.os.os2.bugs:          (f)       voter's last, first name:          e-mail ballot to mlevis@lonestar.utsa.edu by April 24  ----cut here----------------cut here----------------cut here----------------   Example Ballot #1:   (a) comp.os.os2.programmer.porting: yes  (b)    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc: yes  (c)              comp.os.os2.setup: no  (d)         comp.os.os2.multimedia:  (e)               comp.os.os2.bugs: no   (f)       voter's last, first name: Smith, John   In this example, John Smith favors comp.os.os2.programmer.porting  to be created, and comp.os.os2.programmer to be renamed to  comp.os.os2.programmer.misc.  He also opposes the creation of  comp.os.os2.setup and comp.os.os2.bugs.  He does not have a view  on the creation of comp.os.os2.multimedia.    Example Ballot #2:   (a) comp.os.os2.programmer.porting: yes  (b)    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc: yes  (c)              comp.os.os2.setup: yes  (d)         comp.os.os2.multimedia: yes  (e)               comp.os.os2.bugs: yes   (f)       voter's last, first name: Doe, Jane   In this example, Jane Doe favors the creation or rename of all  the proposals.   Voting Rules:   * One vote per person.  If you vote more than once, only the most    recent vote will be counted.   * Votes must be mailed to me by the person voting.  Proxy voting,    forwarding, posting votes to a newsgroup, etc. will not be counted.   * Do not ask how the votes are going.  The status of the votings    will be revealed only after the poll closes.   * I will acknowledge votes by Mass Acknowledgement (ACK).  I will    post the ACK twice (see Schedule below).   * If you need help for using your editor, using e-mail, how    voting works in general, etc. then ask an expert at your site.    Also see the ``How To Create a New Newsgroup'' article which is    posted to news.answers on a regular basis.   * If you need any clarifications on voting procedures for this    CFV, send me e-mail at mlevis@ringer.cs.utsa.edu.   * When the voting period is over (see Schedule below), a proposal    passes if both of the following formulas are true:    1)  the number of YES votes exceeds the number of NO votes        by at least 100 (i.e. YES >= NO + 100, or YES - NO >= 100).    2)  the number of YES votes exceeds at least twice the        number of NO votes (i.e. YES >= 2 * NO, or YES - NO >= NO).    In other words, a proposal passes if:        YES - NO >= max (100, NO)    where max() returns the highest number given to it.   Schedule:   The voting period started on March 29 when the first CFV was posted  by David Lawrence (the news.announce.newgroups moderator).   This third CFV is a repeat of the first CFV, but it also has the  Mass Acknowledgement (ACK) of names and e-mail addresses of those who  have already voted -- re-send your vote if it is not there.  If you  have not voted yet, vote now!   The voting period will end at 11:59:59 pm (Central Time), on  April 24, 1993.  Votes received after that time will not count.  The voting results and tally will be posted shortly after that  date.   Mass Acknowledgement:   Here is the list of people who have already sent in their ballots  as of 12:01 am (Central Time) on April 15, 1993:                            bdubbs@cs.tamu.edu Aiyagari,

I'd trust something from the NSA long before I'd trust something from some Swiss or anybody Japanese.  This may seem surprising to some here, but I suggest most corporations would feel the same way.

The tool survived  the trip from the launch pad up to approximately a 250,000 foot  altitude, then down to splashdown and towing back to KSC.      NASA spokesperson Lisa Malone told the media,      \\\"It's been a long time since something like this happened.  We've  lost washers and bolts (before) but never a tool like this.\\\"      The initial investigation into the incident has shown that a  Thiokol Corp. technician noticed and reported his pliers as missing on  April 2nd.  Unfortunately, the worker's supervisor did not act on the  report and Discovery was launched with its \\\"extra payload\\\".  NASA  officials were never told of the missing tool before the April 8th  launch date.      The free-flying pliers were supposed to be tethered to the SRB  technician.  When the tool was found in an aft section of the booster,  its 18-inch long rope was still attached.  The pliers were found in a  part of the booster which is not easily visible from the launch pad.      A spokesperson for the Lockheed Space Operations Company said that  the Shuttle processor will take \\\"appropriate action\\\".

Overacker writes, responding to Simon:     I may be interesting to see some brief selections posted to the    net.  My understanding is that SSPX does not consider ITSELF in    schism or legitimately excommunicated.  But that's really beside    the point.  What does the Roman Catholic church say?    Excommunication can be real apart from formal excommunication, as    provided for in canon law.  Here's some of the theology involved for the interested.  There is confusion over this issue of the SSPX's \\\"schism\\\"; often the basic problem is lack of an ability to distinguish between:  - true obedience - false obedience - disobedience - schism  Take the various classifications of obedience first.  There are 2 important elements involved here for my purposes:  1) a command 2) the response made to the command  As far as the command goes, commands can be LEGITIMATE, such as the Pope ordering Catholics to not eat meat on Fridays.  Or they can be ILLEGITIMATE, such as the Pope ordering Catholics to worship the god Dagon when every other full moon comes around.  As far as the response to a command goes, it can be to REFUSE to do what is commanded, or to COMPLY.  Making a table, there are thus 4 possibilites:  command         response            name ----------------------------------------------------- LEGITIMATE      COMPLY              true obedience ILLEGITIMATE    REFUSE              true obedience LEGITIMATE      REFUSE              disobedience ILLEGITIMATE    COMPLY              false obedience  So now you see where my 3 classifications of obedience come from.  Obedience is not solely a matter of compliance/refusal.  The nature of the commands must also be taken into account; it is not enough to consider someone's compliance or refusal and then say whether they are \\\"obedient\\\" or \\\"disobedient\\\".  You also have to take into consideration whether the commands are good or bad.  In my example, if the Pope commands all Catholics to worship the god Dagon, and they all refuse, they aren't being disobedient at all!  As far as the Society of Saint Pius X goes, they are certainly refusing to comply with certain things the Pope desires.  But that alone is insufficient to allow one to label them \\\"disobedient\\\".  You also have to consider the nature of the Papal desires.  And there's the rub: SSPX says the Popes since Vatican II have been commanding certain very bad things for the Church.  The Popes have of course disagreed.  So where are we?  Are we in another Arian heresy, complete with weak Popes?  Or are the SSPX priests modern Martin Luthers?  Well, the only way to answer that is to examine who is saying what, and what the traditional teaching of the Church is.  The problem here is that very few Catholics have much of an idea of what is really going on, and what the issues are.  The religion of American Catholics is especially defective in intellectual depth.  You will never read about the issues being discussed in the Catholic press in this country.  (On the other hand, one Italian Catholic magazine I get -- 30 Days -- has had interviews with the Superior General of the Society of Saint Pius X.)  Many Catholics will decide to side with the Pope.  There is some soundness in this, because the Papacy is infallible, so eventually some Pope *will* straighten all this out.  But, on the other hand, there is also unsoundness in this, in that, in the short term, the Popes may indeed be wrong, and such Catholics are doing nothing to help the situation by obeying them where they're wrong.  In fact, if the situation is grave enough, they sin in obeying him.  At the very least, they're wasting a great opportunity, because they are failing to love Christ in a heroic way at the very time that He needs this badly.  Schism... let's move on to schism.  What is it?  Schism is a superset of disobedience (refusal to obey a legitimate command).  All schismatics are disobedient.  But it's a superset, so it doesn't work the other way around: not all disobeyers are schismatics.  The mere fact that the SSPX priests don't comply with the Holy Father's desires doesn't make them schismatics.  So what is it that must be added to disobedience to constitute a schism?  Maybe this something else makes the SSPX priests schismatics.  You must add this: the rejection of the right to command.  Look in any decent reference on Catholic theology, and that's what you'll find: the distinguishing criterion of schism is rejection of the right to command.  Here's what the Catholic Encyclopedia says, for example:      ... not every disobedience is a schism; in order to possess this     character it must include besides the trangression of the commands     of superiors, denial of their Divine right to command.     (from the CE article \\\"Schism\\\")  Is the Society of Saint Pius X then schismatic?  The answer is a clear no: they say that the Pope is their boss.  They pray for him every day.  And that's all that matters as far as schism goes.  What all this boils down to is this: if we leave aside the consideration of the exact nature of their objections, their position is a legitimate one, as far as the Catholic theology of obedience and schism goes.  They are resisting certain Papal policies because they think that they are clearly contrary to the traditional teaching of the Papacy, and the best interests of the Church.  (In fact, someone who finds himself in this situation has a *duty* to resist.)  Now, what is the stance of Rome on all this?  Well, if you read the Holy Father's motu proprio \\\"Ecclesia Dei\\\", you can find out.  It's the definitive document on the subject.  A motu proprio is a specifically Papal act.  It's not the product of a Roman congregation, a letter that the Pope has possibly never even read.  It's from the Pope himself.  His boss is God... there's no one else to complain to.  In this document, the Holy Father says, among other things:  1) The episcopal consecrations performed by Archbishop Lefebvre constituted a schismatic act.  2) Archbishop Lefebvre's problem was a misunderstanding of the nature of Tradtion.  Both are confusing: I fail to see the logic of the Pope's points.  As far as the episcopal consecrations go, I read an interesting article in a translation of the Italian magazine \\\"Si Si No No\\\".  It all gets back to the question of jurisdiction.  If episcopal consecrations imply rejection of the Pope's jurisdiction, then they would truly constitute a schismatic act, justifying excommunication under the current code of canon law.  But my problem with this is this: according to the traditional theology of Holy Orders, episcopal consecration does not confer jurisdiction.  It only confers the power of Order: the ability to confect the Sacraments.  Jurisdiction must be conferred by someone else with the power to confer it (such as the Pope).  The Society bishops, knowing the traditional theology quite well, take great pains to avoid any pretence of jurisdiction over anyone.  They simply confer those Sacraments that require a bishop.  The \\\"Si Si No No\\\" article was interesting in that it posited that the reason that the Pope said what he did is that he has a novel, post-Vatican II idea of Holy Orders.  According to this idea, episcopal consecration *does* confer jurisdiction.  I lent the article to a friend, unfortunately, so can't tell you more.  I believe they quoted the new code of canon law in support of this idea.  The Pope's thinking on this point remains a great puzzle to me. There's no way there is a schism, according to traditional Catholic theology.  So why does the Pope think this?  As far as the points regarding the nature of Tradition goes, here's the passage in question:      The root of this schismatic act can be discerned in an incomplete     and contradictory notion of Tradtion.  Incomplete, because it does     not take sufficiently into the account the living character of     Tradition, which, as the Second Vatican Council clearly taught,          comes from the apostles and progresses in the Church with the         help of the Holy Spirit.  There is a growth in insight into         the realities and words that are being passed on.  This comes         about in various ways.  It comes through the contemplation and         study of believers who ponder these things in their hearts.         It comes from the intimate sense of spiritual realities which         they experience.  And it comes from the preaching of those who         have received, along with their right of succession in the         espiscopate, the sure charism of truth.      But especially contradictory is a notion of Tradition which     opposes the universal Magisterium of the Church possessed by the     Bishop of Rome and the body of bishops.  It is impossible to     remain faithful to the Tradition while breaking the ecclesial bond     with him to whom, in the person of the Apostle Peter, Christ     himself entrusted the ministry of unity in His Church.      (Papal motu proprio \\\"Ecclesia Dei\\\", 2 July 1988)  It seems to me that the Holy Father is making two points here that can be simplified to the following:  - Vatican Council II has happened. - I am the Pope.  The argument being that either case is sufficient to prove that Archbishop Lefebvre must be wrong, because he disagrees with them. This is weak, to say the least!  It would have helped clarify things more if the Pope had addressed Archbishop Lefebvre's concerns in detail.  What is John Paul II's stand on the social Kingship of Christ, as taught by Gregory XVI, Pius IX, Leo XIII, Pius XI and Pius XII, for example?  Are we supposed to ignore what all these Popes said on the subject?  I don't know what the future will hold, but the powers that be in the SSPX are still talking with Rome and trying to straighten things out.  --------------------------------------------------------------  [Many people would prefer to call a justified refusal to obey \\\"justified disobedience\\\" or even \\\"obeying God rather than man\\\". Calling a refusal to obey obedience puts us into a sort of Alice in Wonderland world where words mean whatever we want them to mean.  Similarly, schism indicates a formal break in the church.  If the Pope says that a schism exists, it seems to me that by definition it exists.  It may be that the Pope is on the wrong side of the break, that there is no good reason for the break to exist, and that it will shortly be healed.  But how can one deny that it does in fact exist?  It seems to me that you are in grave danger of destroying the thing you are trying to reform: the power of the papacy.  What good will it do you if you become reconciled to the the Pope in the future, but in the process, you have destroyed his ability to use the tools of church discipline?  It's one thing to hold that the Pope has misused his powers, and excommunicated someone wrongly.  It's something else to say that his excommunication did not take effect, and the schism is all in his imagination.  That means that acts of church discipline are not legal tools, but acts whose validity is open to debate.  Generally it has been liberal Catholics who have had problems with the Pope. While they have often objected to church sanctions, generally they have admitted that the sanctions exist.  You are now opening the door to people simply ignoring papal decisions, claiming to be truly obeying by disobeying, and to be in communion while excommunicated. This would seem to be precisely the denial of Divine right to command that you say defines schism.\",\"Help!!!  I have an ADB graphicsd tablet which I want to connect to my Quadra 950.

At the time this seemed the thing to do as the documentation I had with my Adaptec SCSI controller said that this is the driver to be used with CD-ROM drives.  Since then I have learn that this driver is out of date in a major way and that Adaptec have an upgrade deal for going to the next driver (I think it's called EZI-SCSI or something).  I wasn't too fussed about this until I upgraded by CD-ROM drive from a Sony CDU-541 to a Sony CDU-641.  I now find that the audio-mode will not work.  I assume it is not being handled correctly by the ASW-410 driver.  So, should I chase Adaptec for an upgrade?  If so does anyone know their FAX number?  Any assistance appreciated.

This is how the history  between the two nations started some centuries ago.  Since then, it has been  a continuous battle between the two nations.  From my perspective I can't see  why I should say that Greeks have been responsible for what has happened   between the two nations.  Of course, it would not be reasonable to argue that  the hostility should drag till we kick the Turks out of this area.  This isn't  going to happen, so the best would be to improve the relations between the two  countries.  A golden oportunity exists with Cyprus.  If things can't work  there, there isn't any possible way that could work between our nations.    I always avoid to discuss such things.  I consider it a waist of my time.  Besides, as I said, I do not want to open a new flame.    I thought it was a smart move to receive more money from Greek tourists.  I bet that this week there should be about 200,000 tourists from Greece  in Turkey.  Each one will leave at least $1,000 so go and figure what this  means to your economy.  If you had kept the visa requirement, how many  Greeks would bother to visit Turkey?    Come on. Do not extrapolate from your limited personal experience.

The jealousy does not technically exist until the object is apparent. However, the capacity to be jealous is presumably still there even though it is not detectable.  Your description of the Unbilical took me three passes to understand (!) but I get the gist and I have to tentatively agree. I think our two definitions can sit side by side without too much trouble, though. I haven't attempted to define the reason behind the Moral Driver (only hinted through the essence of each Moral). Your definition hints that animals are also capable of a similar morality - Simians have a similar Social Order to ourselves and it is easy to anthropomorphize with these animals. Is this possible or have I misunderstood?   My p.s. thoughts falls roughly in line with John Stuart Mill and his writings on Utilitarianism. I have no particular plan (except to do my bit - personal ethics AND social work). My opinion (for what it is worth) is that the Authority for each Moral must be increased somehow, and that this will probably take several generations to be effective. I don't think that the list of Morals has changed for Society significantly, though . The Authority element may come from our authority figures and roles models (see Eric Berne and his transactional analysis work [+ Mavis Klein] for references) and this is what gives rise to a deterioration of moral standards in the long term.  I've had some more thoughts on my definitions:  I've was thinking that I should add Moral Character to the list of definitions in order to get a dynamic version of the Moral Nature (ie. the interplay of the Moral Code and associated Authorities). A suitable analogy might be a graphic equaliser on a HiFi system - the Moral Nature being the set of frequencies and the chosen 'amplitudes', and the Moral Character being the spectrum over time.  Conscience is a little more difficult because I can't define it as the reasoning of a person between actions in the context of his Moral Nature because Conscience seems to cut in most of the time unbidden and often unwanted. I think Conscience is manifest when a decision is made at a given time which compromises one's Moral Nature. My Conscience fits in more with Freud's SuperEgo (plus the Moral Driver) with the stimulous being the urges or Freud's Id. The reasoning that I mentioned before is Freud's Ego, I suppose. If the Moral Driver is part of the Id then the reason why Conscience cuts in unbidden is partially explained. The question is \\\"what provides the stimulous to activate the Moral driver?\\\". I think I need some more time with this one.  That's about it for now!  David.  --- On religion:\",\" Bill, I have taken the time to explain that biblical scholars consider the Josephus reference to be an early Christian insert.  By biblical scholar I mean an expert who, in the course of his or her research, is willing to let the chips fall where they may.  This excludes literalists, who may otherwise be defined as biblical apologists.  They find what they want to find.  They are not trustworthy by scholarly standards (and others).  Why an insert?  Read it - I have, a number of times.  The passage is glaringly out of context, and Josephus, a superb writer, had no such problem elsewhere  in his work.  The passage has *nothing* to do with the subject matter in which  it lies.  It suddenly appears and then just as quickly disappears.  Until you can demonstrate how and why the scholarly community is wrong about the Josephus insert, your \\\"proof\\\" is meaningless and it should not be repeated here.  What's more, even if Josephus happened to be legitimate, it would \\\"prove\\\" nothing.  Scholars speak of the \\\"weight of evidence.\\\"  Far more independent evidence would be required to validate your claim.  Until forthcoming, your belief is based on faith.  That's OK, but you exceed your rights when you pass faith off as fact.  As for the gospels, there are parallels, but there are also glaring inconsistencies and contradictions.  Shouldn't a perfect canon be perfect?  Shouldn't there be absolutely no room for debate?  I suggest you read _Gospel  Fictions_ by Randel Helms, and _The Unauthorized Version_ by Robin Fox (for  Herb Huston, no known kinship or familial relationship, but we do indeed share  an evolutionary ancestry).  The fact that there are inconsistencies, gaps and contradictions does not deny your position.  On the other hand, neither do the gospels \\\"prove\\\" your faith.  Independent evidence is necessary, and I know of none (which we have already discussed, and so far you have not provided any).  Until then, its faith.  Moreover, you have committed a fundamental error in logic.  You have attempted to \\\"prove\\\" your claim with that which you want to prove.  Its no different than saying \\\"I am right because I say so.\\\"    Your logic is full of circles.  It reminds me a bit of the 1910 Presbyterian  General Assembly.  The assembly defined five fundamentals (this is where \\\"fundamentalist\\\" came from) of orthodox Protestant Christianity, to wit: 1) Jesus performed miracles, 2) Jesus was born of a virgin, 3) Jesus was bodily resurrected, 4) Jesus' crucifixion atoned for human sin, and - here is the clincher - 5) the bible is the inerrant word of God.  Presbyterians construe \\\"inerrant\\\" broadly as spritually inerrant.  Fundamentalists take the first four as literally true, and then validate them with a literally inerrant bible, which contains the first four, and which is the only thing known to  contain the first four.    Smoke and mirrors and wands and hand waving if ever there was!  Its faith, Bill.  You don't have any more or better truths than anyone else.  Whatever works for you.  Just don't foist it on others.

Prince has never hit well in the minors and he's now 27 years old, I think.  Pagnozzi was not a bad hitter in the minors.  (I'll bring in the numbers tomorrow assuming I don't have another brain cramp and forget.)  He had a very good year at Louisville  before coming up to the majors.  As I recall, the hype on Pagnozzi coming up in the organization was good hit, decent fielding.  When he got to the  majors and didn't hit as well as expected (not as much playing time?), he  became Exhibit 312 in Nichols' Law of Catcher Defense and got the reputation  as an outstanding defensive catcher.  It's not clear he ever learned to hit.

If Ted is going to invoke Pagnozzi as a model for Prince, given that Prince has underperformed Pagnozzi in the minors, it's not a rosy picture.  BTW, I'm still unhappy with moving Zeile, who had the same reputation  coming up in the Cardinal organization as Pagnozzi, except that he was a much, much better hitter, to 3rd where he could be an average hitter and a below average fielder instead of a well-above average hitter as an average (or below average) fielding catcher.

We'll probably end up giving them weapons.   During WWII, the British managed to supply arms to the Yugoslavs despite German occupation.  If the Europeans had the will to do anything besides sponsoring peace conferences, they would have no problem putting any kind of weapon they wanted into Bosnia.  I guess I would favor ending the embargo if the Congress would pass a law forbidding export of US military supplies to Yugoslavia, including via third parties.  Until then the risks of the US being drawn into a more active role would be too great.  I do not see the arms embargo as a major factor in the outcome of the war.

Those who subscribe to _Biblical Archaeology Review_ will remember a spectacular letter battle set off when someone complained about a Franklin Mint ad.  (_BAR_ is a great magazine, but the contrast between the rather scholarly articles and the incredibly sleazy ads is extreme.)  In this ad, they were hawking a doll with a head based on the famous bust of Nefertiti, giving the face a typical doll-pink complexion. The letter complained about this as a misrepresentation on the grounds that Nefertiti was \\\"a beautiful black queen.\\\"  This set off an exchange of hotheaded letters than ran for several issues, to the point where they had an article from an Egyptologist titled \\\"Was Cleopatra Black?\\\"  (The answer to the title is \\\"no\\\"-- she was greek.)  I have to say that I hear a hysterical note in much of the complaining.  I personally have seen only one blond-haired Jesus (in the National Shrine in Wash. DC), and I found it very jarring.  Western representations vary enourmously, but in general the image of is of a youngish male with dark hair and beard, of a sort that can be found (modulo the nose) all up and down the Mediterranean.  (Also, if what I remember is correct, the \\\"Black Madonna\\\" doesn't represent a person with negroid features.  It is black because of an accident.  Joe Buehler....?)  In the presence of all those marble statues, one is prone to forget that greeks are rather likely to have black hair.  When one crosses the bosporus, the situation breaks down completely.  Are Turks white?  How about Persians, or various groups in the indian subcontinent?  Was Gandhi white?  How about the Arabs?  Or picture Nassar and Sadat standing side by side.  And then there are the Ethiopians....  Those of a white racist bent are not likely to say that *any* of these people are \\\"white\\\" (i.e., of the racist's \\\"race\\\").  If I may risk a potentially inflammatory remark, one undercurrent of this seems to be the identification of modern jews as members of the oppressor race.  Considering the extreme dicotomy between medieval religion on the one hand and medieval antisemitism on the other, I don't think that this \\\"Jesus was white\\\" thesis ever played the roles that some hold it did.  Representations of Jesus as black or korean or whatever are fine.  It seems awfully self-serving to insist that Jesus belongs to one's own racial group.\",\"Hi.

In the early 80's with the fuel crisis, etc., everyone wanted better fuel mileage.  Diesel fuel was the cheapest fuel available and usually provides better mileage than comparable gasoline engines.  So, GM decided to conver their 350 gas engine into a diesel engine (I think was a 5.7 liter).  Big mistake.  The engine was not redesigned, but converted.  The engine could not handle the higher compression, etc.  Lots of problems with these cars.  This thew up a big red flag to the casual observer -- DON\\\"T BUY A DIESEL.  THEY ARE BAD.  This was a gross generalization.  Ask yourself this question -- if your livelihood depended on driving, LOTS of it, would you use a dependable or undependable (but cheaper in the short run) vehicle?  What do Greyhound busses have in them? Trailer Trucks?  Even Train Locomotives?  Are these gasoline engines? No, they are diesel.  Tractor trailer truck manufacturers provide a 500,000 mile warrantee with they vehicles.  I own an `82 Diesel Suburban.  The 6.2L diesel is a GREAT engine. Just keeps going.  It was more expensive (when new) than the gasoline engine vehicle was.  The only problem with diesel engines is that  when they need to be rebuilt, they are expensive.  In a gas 350 engine, you will pay about $1000 for a rebuild.  Diesel 6.2L is about $2000.  But then again, the diesel engine lasts about twice as long and gets about 50% better mileage.  A carburator for a gasoline engine costs about $100 to rebuild (or less).  A rebuild of the fuel injection pump on a diesel will cost about $500 (or more).  But then again, you never need a tune-up.  If you're looking at a rebuilt 6.2L, I'd say you got a great deal. Check to see if the fuel injection pump was rebuilt also.\",\"  On my LC (RZ to any ex-colonists) I replaced the bolt at the bottom of the barrel with a tap. When I wanted a coffee I could just rev the engine until boiling and pour out a cup of hot water. I used ethylene glycol as antifreeze rather than methanol as it tastes sweeter.  (-:\",\" I must admit that this point has been running through my mind for most of the discussion: one the dice are out there, it won't be long before someone decaps it and, after a bit of work, has full details of the Clipper algorythm.  This isn't trivial to do, but then again, it is not impossibly difficult either.  Any half way decent VLSI design student should be able to take a photograph of a technology s/he is familiar with, and given a description of the input, output, control and supply lines, figure out  the function of various subsystems on the die.  Indeed, this is not an uncommon exercise performed during training (because it makes you think about design decisions made by other designers.  I could speculate that these chips are going to be manufactured using \\\"tamperproof\\\" carriers (unlikely - such techniques are *very* expensive and this thing is supposed to be relatively cheap to produce), or that there will be some legal or legislative framework to prevent publication of the algorythm (unlikely - please correct me if I am wrong but aren't these supposed to be sold internationally?).  I suppose that the most likely reason the algorythm is remaining secret for the moment is that some idiot bureaucrat, untrammeled by the realities of the situation, decided that \\\"well, we should keep it a secret because it is supposed to be secret, isn't it?\\\"  Just some random thoughts... \",\"      Of course; sorry for the misunderstanding.  I was referring to the fact that far more aeronautical development took place in the '30's.  For much of the '20's, the super-abundance of Jennies and OX-5 engines held down the industry.  By 1926, many of the obsolete WWI aircraft had been retired and Whirlwind had their power/weight ratio and reliability up to the point where long-distance flights became practical.  It's important to note that the Atlantic was flown not once but THREE times in 1927:  Lindbergh, Chamberlin and Levine, and Byrd's _America_.  \\\"When it's time to railroad, you railroad.\\\"     Not off the top of my head; I'll have to dig out my reference books again. However, I will say that the most common arrangement in Prince Henry the Navigator's Portugal was for the prince to put up part of the money and merchants to put up the rest.  They profits from the voyage would then be shared.     The problem is that the amount of prize money required to inspire a Moon Base is much larger than any but a handful of individuals or corporations can even consider putting up.  The Kremer Prizes (human powered aircraft), Orteig's prize, Lord Northcliffe's prize for crossing the Atlantic (won in 1919 by Alcock and Brown) were MUCH smaller.  The technologies required were within the reach of individual inventors, and the prize amounts were well within the reach of a large number of wealthy individuals.  I think that only a gov't could afford to set up a $1B+ prize for any purpose whatsoever.   Note that Burt Rutan suggested that NASP could be built most cheaply by taking out an ad in AvWeek stating that the first company to build a plane that could take off and fly the profile would be handed $3B, no questions asked. \",\" Press conference at 1PM ...   Interestingly, Keenan's co-coach (or is it his \\\"Number One\\\"?) on Team Canada at the World Championships is Roger Neilsen.

In short, virtually every board manufacturer cheats on the test by writing things in the driver that is there only to make the board appear faster on the WinBench suite.  So the WinBench score has no bearing in reality to how cards stack up on real world tasks.  In the last PC-Magazine they benchmarked some of the new accelerators, and admitted that many of them 'cheated' on WinBench.  Interestingly, they 'allowed' one type of cheating behaviour (caching for bitblt operations, no matter how unreal), yet did not allow a couple of other types of cheating behaviour that some of the cards used.  At least one card was eliminated from the \\\"Editor's Choice\\\" because of cheating on the benchmark.\",\"   I've got a used one for sale.

Traditionally, they have used pictures, words, demonstrations,     music and dance to communicate imagery.  However, expressing     complex notions such as God and infinity or a seemingly well     defined concept such as a flower can present challenges which far     exceed their technical skills.      The explosive use of computers as visualization and expression     tools has compounded this problem.  In hypermedia, multimedia and     virtual reality systems vast amounts of information confront the     observer or participant.  Wading through a multitude of     simultaneous images and sounds in possibly unfamiliar     representions, a confounded user asks: \\\"What does it all mean?\\\"      Since image construction, transmission, reception, decipherment and     ultimate understanding are complex tasks, strongly influenced by     physiology, education and culture; and, since electronic media     radically amplify each processing step, then we, as electronic     communicators, must determine the fundamental paradigms for     composing imagery for understanding.      Therefore, the purpose of this conference is to bring together a     breadth of disciplines, including, but not limited to, the     physical, biological and computational sciences, technology, art,     psychology, philosophy, and education, in order to define and     discuss the issues essential to image understanding within the     computer graphics context.

MILITECH(tm) is yet another oil additive. But the demonstration of this product really impressive, if it didn't cheat.  The setup of the demo is fairly simple. A cone shaped rotor is half submerged in a small oil sink, filled with motor oil. The rotor is powered by an electronic motor. A metal pad is pressed against the rotor using the torque wrench until the rotor stopped by friction.  The torque that is needed to stop rotor is read from the torque wrench.  Before MILITECH was added, the rotor was stopped with about 60 lb-ft of torque (You pick the brand of oil, no difference). Once MILITECH was  added to the oil, the rotor could not be stopped even with 120+ lb-ft of torque.   Here is the good part: even after the salesman emptied the oil sink,  you still could not stopped the rotor with the thin film remained  on it.  They say you need only add 2oz per quart of oil every 15k miles. A 16 oz bottle is $25.  I still have my doubts. If this product is really so great, why it was so little known? The salesman said it is widely used in military. I didn't believe it.  The demo was so impressive, that I bought a bottle against my common sense.  Has anyone heard of or actually used this product?

Besides, it's REAL bad on the rear tire.\",\" <lots more deleted>  I think the hangup with digital scopes is that you have to know so much more about them and how they work on a scope-by-scope basis, and some of the functions are typically presented, in my opinion, in a counter-intuitive fashion (HP has made some strides in their 54600 series, IMO). Automatic setups are fine for simple, repetitive waveforms, but can give you some crazy results on more complex events where you need to understand how the scope is actually measuring/processing the event. For example, is the scope in \\\"equivalent time\\\" or in \\\"real time\\\" sampling mode (equivalent time being a mode where samples are built-up slowly by adding a delay to the trigger event each sweep)? What was the scope's actual sampling rate at the time? How is the data being massaged after capture but before display, etc. One common misconception is the speed of the scope.  Is the HP scope you're using really a 100 MHz scope? Or is it a 20 MHz sample rate scope (~5 MHz single shot significance) whose front end including S/H can support 100 MHz waveforms (important for equivalent time sampling)? The 100 MHz input in this case really only helps you when your waveform is repetitive, or on a single sample, when you get lucky and hit a transient event during a sample time.  So, there are a lot more variables in understanding how to get useful information from a digital scope. I prefer an analog scope for general use and the digital for events where I need storage for later analysis or comparison, when the event is within the capability of the scope. Now, for the price of true 100 MHz digital scopes to fall...  --  --------------------------------------------------------------------        Dave Medin   Phone: (205) 730-3169 (w)     SSD--Networking    (205) 837-1174 (h)     Intergraph Corp.

(for the humor impared :{P PPhhhhhtttttt!)\",\"  Let us explore this interesting paragraph point by point, sentence by sentence.   1) We are talking about origins, not merely science.  Origins of what?  Are we speaking of the origins of life, the human species, the universe, physical law, biological diversity or what?  2) Science cannot explain origins.  This is a false statement unless it is carefully qualified.  It depends on what origins we are talking about.  3) For a person to exclude anything but science from the issue of origins is to say that there is no higher truth than science.  Again, this is a false statement.  To begin with, the notion of \\\"higher truth\\\" is distinctly dubious.  Many people believe that there are ways to ascertain truth that are not in the repetoire of science; they even believe that there are ways that are more reliable and certain.  Many believe that there are truths that cannot be expressed using the language of science.  Let it be so.  These truths are neither \\\"higher\\\" or  \\\"lower\\\"; they are simply true.  More to the point, restricting one's discussion of origins to science does not reject other sources of knowledge; it simply restricts the scope of discussion.  4) This is a false premise.  If this is intended as asserting that the previous sentence was false then (4) is actually true.  However the context identifies it as another false [or at least theologically unsound] statement.  5) By the way, I enjoy science.  On the evidence Mr. Rawlins lacks sufficient understanding of science to enjoy science in any meaningful sense.  One might just as well say that one enjoys literature written in a language that one cannot read. However one cannot mark this sentence as false -- to follow the analogy, perhaps he likes the pretty shapes of the letters.  6) It is truly a wonder observing God's creation.  Let us not quibble; count this one as true.  7) Macroevolution is a mixture of 15 percent science and 85 percent religion [guaranteed within three percent error :) ]  Still another false statement.  However one can make it come out true with the following contextual modification:  \\\"Macroevolution, as misunderstood by Rawline, is a mixture of 15 percent of what Rawlins erroneously thinks of as science, and 85 percent of what Rawlins erroneously thinks of as religion.\\\"  -----  It is distinctly noticeable that Mr. Rawlins fails miserably to touch on truth except when he reports personally on what he feels.  [I do him the justice of assuming that he is not misinforming us as to his personal reactions.]  One can account for this by the hypothesis that he has an idiosyncratic and personal concept of truth.\",\" Yes.  But this is *irrelevant*.  You're talking about averages, when we have lots of information about THIS PLAYER IN PARTICULAR to base our decisions on.  I might as well say \\\"We know that very, very few people are more than 7 feet tall, so chances are that Manute Bol is really only 6 foot 4.\\\"   Why isn't Lopez likely to hit that well?  He hit that well last year (after adjusting his stats for park and league and such); he hit better (on an absolute scale) than Olson or Berryhill did.  By a lot.  As for rushing...  If there really is a qualitative difference between the minors and the majors that requires a period of adjustment (and I don't believe there is), then wouldn't you rather waste Lopez's 22-year old good season than his 23-year old very good season or his 24-year-old excellent season?  The sooner you get him acclimated, the more of his prime you get to use.   The point was not that 17 AB is a significant sample, but rather that he hadn't done anything in spring training to cause even a blockhead manager to question whether his minor league numbers were for real, or to send him down \\\"until he gets warmed up\\\".   Most players are *never* ready for the bigs.  What does this have to do with Javy Lopez?   See above.     But I could apply the same reasoning to Frank Thomas or Barry Bonds.  Most players aren't that good, so they probably won't be that good this year either.   And demonstrated inabilities to hit their way out of a soap bubble.   Not superstars, not stars, not even good players.  Maybe average, if we're being charitable.   Ummm.  Justice is a very fine hitter.  Pendleton might have another big year in his bat, but he might also spend the season in Hamstring Hell.  Gant is a big question mark.  The Bream/Hunter platoon is decent (not excellent) and has rotten OBP or SLG (depending on who's in).  Blauser is a very valuable bat... for a shortstop.    Wanna bet?  The difference between Lopez's bat and Olson/Berryhill could be 20 or 30 runs over the course of the season.  Given a choice between a player with experience and a player who can play, I'll take the latter every time.   Just like Keith Mitchell did?   That was me, and you so far your only counter-proposal is that they really don't understand how good Lopez is, or overvalue experience, or some combination of the two.  I think my interpretation was more flattering to the organization.

It's because it is obvious that the US government has put a lot of money behind this program and it will support it. Thus, most corporations will try to get their piece from the pie by supporting it too. The same good old greed.

WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SATURN V PLANS      Despite a widespread belief to the contrary, the Saturn V blueprints     have not been lost. They are kept at Marshall Space Flight Center on     microfilm.      The problem in re-creating the Saturn V is not finding the drawings, it     is finding vendors who can supply mid-1960's vintage hardware (like     guidance system components), and the fact that the launch pads and VAB     have been converted to Space Shuttle use, so you have no place to launch     from.      By the time you redesign to accommodate available hardware and re-modify     the launch pads, you may as well have started from scratch with a clean     sheet design.       WHY DATA FROM SPACE MISSIONS ISN'T IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE      Investigators associated with NASA missions are allowed exclusive access     for one year after the data is obtained in order to give them an     opportunity to analyze the data and publish results without being     \\\"scooped\\\" by people uninvolved in the mission. However, NASA frequently     releases examples (in non-digital form, e.g. photos) to the public early     in a mission.       RISKS OF NUCLEAR (RTG) POWER SOURCES FOR SPACE PROBES      There has been extensive discussion on this topic sparked by attempts to     block the Galileo and Ulysses launches on grounds of the plutonium     thermal sources being dangerous. Numerous studies claim that even in     worst-case scenarios (shuttle explosion during launch, or accidental     reentry at interplanetary velocities), the risks are extremely small.     Two interesting data points are (1) The May 1968 loss of two SNAP 19B2     RTGs, which landed intact in the Pacific Ocean after a Nimbus B weather     satellite failed to reach orbit. The fuel was recovered after 5 months     with no release of plutonium. (2) In April 1970, the Apollo 13 lunar     module reentered the atmosphere and its SNAP 27 RTG heat source, which     was jettisoned, fell intact into the 20,000 feet deep Tonga Trench in     the Pacific Ocean. The corrosion resistant materials of the RTG are     expected to prevent release of the fuel for a period of time equal to 10     half-lives of the Pu-238 fuel or about 870 years [DOE 1980].

IMPACT OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE ON THE OZONE LAYER      From time to time, claims are made that chemicals released from     the Space Shuttle's Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) are responsible     for a significant amount of damage to the ozone layer. Studies     indicate that they in reality have only a minute impact, both in     absolute terms and relative to other chemical sources. The     remainder of this item is a response from the author of the quoted     study, Charles Jackman.      The atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effects on the     stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups, and was     organized by Dr. Michael Prather, NASA/Goddard Institute for Space     Studies.  The three groups involved Michael Prather and Maria Garcia     (NASA/GISS), Charlie Jackman and Anne Douglass (NASA/Goddard Space     Flight Center), and Malcolm Ko and Dak Sze (Atmospheric and     Environmental Research, Inc.).  The effort was to look at the effects     of the space shuttle and Titan rockets on the stratosphere.      The following are the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine:         Industrial sources:    300,000,000 kilograms/year    Natural sources:     75,000,000 kilograms/year    Shuttle sources:   725,000 kilograms/year      The shuttle source assumes 9 space shuttles and 6 Titan rockets are     launched yearly. Thus the launches would add less than 0.25% to the     total stratospheric chlorine sources.      The effect on ozone is minimal:  global yearly average total ozone would     be decreased by 0.0065%. This is much less than total ozone variability     associated with volcanic activity and solar flares.      The influence of human-made chlorine products on ozone is computed     by atmospheric model calculations to be a 1% decrease in globally     averaged ozone between 1980 and 1990. The influence of the space shuttle and     Titan rockets on the stratosphere is negligible.  The launch     schedule of the Space Shuttle and Titan rockets would need to be     increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about     the same effect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons     do at the present time.      Theoretical results of this study have been published in _The Space     Shuttle's Impact on the Stratosphere_, MJ Prather, MM Garcia, AR     Douglass, CH Jackman, M.K.W. Ko and N.D.

HOW LONG CAN A HUMAN LIVE UNPROTECTED IN SPACE      If you *don't* try to hold your breath, exposure to space for half a     minute or so is unlikely to produce permanent injury. Holding your     breath is likely to damage your lungs, something scuba divers have to     watch out for when ascending, and you'll have eardrum trouble if your     Eustachian tubes are badly plugged up, but theory predicts -- and animal     experiments confirm -- that otherwise, exposure to vacuum causes no     immediate injury. You do not explode. Your blood does not boil. You do     not freeze. You do not instantly lose consciousness.      Various minor problems (sunburn, possibly \\\"the bends\\\", certainly some     [mild, reversible, painless] swelling of skin and underlying tissue)     start after ten seconds or so. At some point you lose consciousness from     lack of oxygen. Injuries accumulate. After perhaps one or two minutes,     you're dying. The limits are not really known.

HOW THE CHALLENGER ASTRONAUTS DIED      The Challenger shuttle launch was not destroyed in an explosion. This is     a well-documented fact; see the Rogers Commission report, for example.     What looked like an explosion was fuel burning after the external tank     came apart. The forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the     astronauts, never mind destroy their bodies, according to the Kerwin     team's medical/forensic report.      The astronauts were killed when the more-or-less intact cabin hit the     water at circa 200MPH, and their bodies then spent several weeks     underwater. Their remains were recovered, and after the Kerwin team     examined them, they were sent off to be buried.       USING THE SHUTTLE BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT      You can't use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low Earth orbit     because it can't get there. It is big and heavy and does not carry     enough fuel, even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tanks.      Furthermore, it is not particularly sensible to do so, because much of     that weight is things like wings, which are totally useless except in     the immediate vicinity of the Earth. The shuttle orbiter is highly     specialized for travel between Earth's surface and low orbit. Taking it     higher is enormously costly and wasteful. A much better approach would     be to use shuttle subsystems to build a specialized high-orbit     spacecraft.      [Yet another concise answer by Henry Spencer.]       THE \\\"FACE ON MARS\\\"      There really is a big rock on Mars that looks remarkably like a humanoid     face. It appears in two different frames of Viking Orbiter imagery:     35A72 (much more facelike in appearance, and the one more often     published, with the Sun 10 degrees above western horizon) and 70A13     (with the Sun 27 degrees from the west).      Science writer Richard Hoagland has championed the idea that the Face is     artificial, intended to resemble a human, and erected by an     extraterrestrial civilization. Most other analysts concede that the     resemblance is most likely accidental. Other Viking images show a     smiley-faced crater and a lava flow resembling Kermit the Frog elsewhere     on Mars. There exists a Mars Anomalies Research Society (sorry, don't     know the address) to study the Face.      The Mars Observer mission will carry an extremely high-resolution     camera, and better images of the formation will hopefully settle this     question in a few years. In the meantime, speculation about the Face is     best carried on in the altnet group alt.alien.visitors, not sci.space or     sci.astro.      V. DiPeitro and G.

The  federal protection of individual rights supersedes the non-feasance of the state. Something similar has long been traditional ( well he's queer so I beat him up...) for gays   As Anatole France said; \\\"The law in its impartial majesty forbids the rich as well as the poor from sleeping under bridges.\\\"  Equality of law can be construed in any number of ways. For example the fact that all property thefts, regardless of value, are not punished equally is an inequality which protects those who have a lot of money from having it stolen. You could easily define equality to regard the property in terms of it's significance for the owner. This would a form of equality that would be skewed toward poorer people.  In fact, most anti-gay bashing laws are constructed to offer equal  protection. They make it an offense to damage people based on a  motivation of hatred for sexual orientation. Thus the law in its impartial majesty protects hets as well as gays from being bashed.

McConkie's views have been controversial (e.g. \\\"The Seven Deadly Heresies\\\" has made me a heretic!  ;-) at best, or erroneous at worst (\\\"blacks not to receive the priesthood in this dispensation\\\").  I respect him as someone who has made his valuable contribution to the church, but I personally do NOT rely on his personal interpretations (his book \\\"Mormon Doctrine\\\" is oftentimes referred to as \\\"McConkie's Bible\\\" in mormon circles) on mormon doctrine.  I rather look to official (doctrinal) sources, and... to Hugh Nibley's books! (The last comment is an lds-insider reference.)  Summarizing: McConkie was a wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more to the kingdom of God than I have, but whose views are by no means dogma or accepted doctrine, some of it clearly belongs to personal interpretation and speculation.  But having said this, I find McConkie (even in his most biased and speculative moments) far more thought-provoking than the trash coming from your proverbial pen.

The hard part is getting the radioactives to put in it.  Have you ever read Tom Clancy's _The Sum of All Fears_?

For some non fiction, read Tom Clancy's article _Five Minutes Till Midnight_.  It shows how a terrorist group could construct a nuke using Neptunium, a low grade radioactive waste product dumped in toxic waste sites and forgotten about.

Otherwise, they are following a law put into effect by the Church, and only the above Chruches really recognize any power of the Chruch to do so.  Andy Byler  [You will note that nothing in the FAQ said anything about the Church establishing or changing a law.  The argument against the Sabbath is that it is part of the ceremonial law, and like the rest of the ceremonial law is not binding on Christians.  This argument is based on Paul's letters, Acts, and in a more general sense, Jesus' teachings.  Further, most people argue that Scripture shows worship occuring on Sunday, and Paul endorsing it.  I understand that these points are disputed, and do not want to go around the dispute one more time.  The point I'm making here is not that these arguments are right, but that the backing they claim is Scripture.  Accepting the principle of \\\"sola scriptura\\\" does not commit us to obeying the entire Jewish Law.  Acts 15 and Paul's letters are quite clear on that.  I think even the SDA's accept it.  The disagreement is on where the Bible would have us place the line.  By the way, Protestants do give authority to the church, in matters that are not dictated by God.  That's why churches are free to determine their own liturgies, church polity, etc.  If you accept that the Sabbath is not binding on Christians, then the day of worship falls into the category of items on which individual Christians or (since worship is by its nature a group activity) churches are free to decide.\",\"you Need gs252ini.zip and 24*.zip, and 25*.zip font files.

WordPerfect encryption has been shown to be very easy to break.   The method uses XOR with two repeating key streams: a typed password   and a byte-wide counter initialized to 1+<the password length>. Full   descriptions are given in Bennett [BEN87] and Bergen and Caelli   [BER91].    decrypt WordPerfect document files and I think I have a solution.    There is a software company named: Accessdata (87 East 600 South,   Orem, UT 84058), 1-800-658-5199 that has a software package that will   decrypt any WordPerfect, Lotus 1-2-3, Quatro-Pro, MS Excel and Paradox   files. The cost of the package is $185. Steep prices, but if you   think your pw key is less than 10 characters, (or 10 char) give them a   call and ask for the free demo disk. The demo disk will decrypt files   that have a 10 char or less pw key.''  * How do I break a Vigenere (repeated-key) cipher?    A repeated-key cipher, where the ciphertext is something like the   plaintext xor KEYKEYKEYKEY (and so on), is called a Vigenere cipher.   If the key is not too long and the plaintext is in English, do the   following:     1. Discover the length of the key by counting coincidences.   (See Gaines [GAI44], Sinkov [SIN66].) Trying each displacement of   the ciphertext against itself, count those bytes which are equal.    If the two ciphertext portions have used the same key, something   over 6% of the bytes will be equal. If they have used different   key, then less than 0.4% will be equal (assuming random 8-bit bytes   of key covering normal ASCII text). The smallest displacement which   indicates an equal key is the length of the repeated key.    2. Shift the text by that length and XOR it with itself. This   removes the key and leaves you with text XORed with itself. Since   English has about 1 bit of real information per byte, 2 streams of   text XORed together has 2 bits of info per 8-bit byte, providing   plenty of redundancy for choosing a unique decryption. (And in fact   one stream of text XORed with itself has just 1 bit per byte.)    If the key is short, it might be even easier to treat this as a   standard polyalphabetic substitution. All the old cryptanalysis   texts show how to break those. It's possible with those methods, in   the hands of an expert, if there's only ten times as much text as key.   See, for example, Gaines [GAI44], Sinkov [SIN66].  * How do I send encrypted mail under UNIX? [PGP, RIPEM, PEM, ...]    Here's one popular method, using the des command:      cat file | compress | des private_key | uuencode | mail    Meanwhile, there is a de jure Internet standard in the works called   PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail). It is described in RFCs 1421 through   1424. To join the PEM mailing list, contact pem-dev-request@tis.com.   There is a beta version of PEM being tested at the time of this   writing.    There are also two programs available in the public domain for encrypting   mail: PGP and RIPEM.  Both are available by FTP.  Each has its own   newsgroup: alt.security.pgp and alt.security.ripem.  Each has its own FAQ   as well.    PGP is most commonly used outside the USA since it uses the RSA algorithm   without a license and RSA's patent is valid only (or at least primarily)   in the USA.    RIPEM is most commonly used inside the USA since it uses the RSAREF which   is freely available within the USA but not available for shipment outside   the USA.    Since both programs use a secret key algorithm for encrypting the body of   the message (PGP used IDEA; RIPEM uses DES) and RSA for encrypting the   message key, they should be able to interoperate freely.  Although there   have been repeated calls for each to understand the other's formats and   algorithm choices, no interoperation is available at this time (as far as   we know).  * Is the UNIX crypt command secure?    No. See [REE84]. There is a program available called cbw (crypt   breaker's workbench) which can be used to do ciphertext-only attacks   on files encrypted with crypt. One source for CBW is [FTPCB].  * How do I use compression with encryption?    A number of people have proposed doing perfect compression followed by   some simple encryption method (e.g., XOR with a repeated key).    Unfortunately, you can only compress perfectly if you know the exact   distribution of possible inputs. For all practical purposes it's   impossible to describe ``the typical English text'' beyond coarse   characteristics such as single-letter frequencies. You can build up   more and more sophisticated models of your inputs, but if the enemy   has a slightly more accurate model, he'll be able to find some   redundancy in your compressed output.    Note that nearly all practical compression schemes, unless they   have been designed with cryptography in mind, produce output that   actually starts off with high redundancy. For example, the output of   UNIX compress begins with a well-known three-byte ``magic number''   that can serve as an entering wedge for cryptanalysis.      This is not to say that compression before encryption is inherently a   bad idea; it just has to be done very, very carefully, and by no means   removes the need for strong encryption.    Compression after encryption is silly.  * Is there an unbreakable cipher?    Yes. The one-time pad is unbreakable; see part 4. Unfortunately the   one-time pad requires secure distribution of as much key material as   plaintext.    Of course, a cryptosystem need not be utterly unbreakable to be   useful. Rather, it needs to be strong enough to resist attacks by   likely enemies for whatever length of time the data it protects is   expected to remain valid.  * What does ``random'' mean in cryptography?    Cryptographic applications demand much more out of a pseudorandom   number generator than most applications. For a source of bits to be   cryptographically random, it must be computationally impossible to   predict what the Nth random bit will be given complete knowledge of   the algorithm or hardware generating the stream and the sequence of   0th through N-1st bits, for all N up to the lifetime of the source.    A software generator (also known as pseudo-random) has the function   of expanding a truly random seed to a longer string of apparently   random bits.  This seed must be large enough not to be guessed by   the opponent.  Ideally, it should also be truly random (perhaps   generated by a hardware random number source).    Those who have Sparcstation 1 workstations could, for example,   generate random numbers using the audio input device as a source of   entropy, by not connecting anything to it.  For example,   cat /dev/audio | compress - >foo    gives a file of high entropy (not random but with much randomness in   it).  One can then encrypt that file using part of itself as a key,   for example, to convert that seed entropy into a pseudo-random   string.    When looking for hardware devices to provide this entropy, it is   important really to measure the entropy rather than just assume that   because it looks complicated to a human, it must be \\\"random\\\".  For   example, disk operation completion times sound like they might be   unpredictable (to many people) but a spinning disk is much like a   clock and its output completion times are relatively low in entropy.  * What is the unicity point (a.k.a. unicity distance)?    See [SHA49]. The unicity distance is an approximation to that amount   of ciphertext such that the sum of the real information (entropy) in   the corresponding source text and encryption key equals the number   of ciphertext bits used. Ciphertexts significantly longer than this   can be shown probably to have a unique decipherment. This is used to   back up a claim of the validity of a ciphertext-only cryptanalysis.    Ciphertexts significantly shorter than this are likely to have   multiple, equally valid decryptions and therefore to gain security   from the opponent's difficulty choosing the correct one.    Unicity distance, like all statistical or information-theoretic   measures, does not make deterministic predictions but rather gives   probabilistic results: namely, the minimum amount of ciphertext   for which it is likely that there is only a single intelligible   plaintext corresponding to the ciphertext, when all possible keys   are tried for the decryption. Working cryptologists don't normally   deal with unicity distance as such. Instead they directly determine   the likelihood of events of interest.    Let the unicity distance of a cipher be D characters. If fewer than   D ciphertext characters have been intercepted, then there is not   enough information to distinguish the real key from a set of   possible keys. DES has a unicity distance of 17.5 characters,   which is less than 3 ciphertext blocks (each block corresponds to   8 ASCII characters). This may seem alarmingly low at first, but   the unicity distance gives no indication of the computational work   required to find the key after approximately D characters have been   intercepted.    In fact, actual cryptanalysis seldom proceeds along the lines used   in discussing unicity distance. (Like other measures such as key   size, unicity distance is something that guarantees insecurity if   it's too small, but doesn't guarantee security if it's high.) Few   practical cryptosystems are absolutely impervious to analysis; all   manner of characteristics might serve as entering ``wedges'' to crack   some cipher messages. However, similar information-theoretic   considerations are occasionally useful, for example, to determine a   recommended key change interval for a particular cryptosystem.   Cryptanalysts also employ a variety of statistical and   information-theoretic tests to help guide the analysis in the most   promising directions.    Unfortunately, most literature on the application of information   statistics to cryptanalysis remains classified, even the seminal   1940 work of Alan Turing (see [KOZ84]). For some insight into the   possibilities, see [KUL68] and [GOO83].  * What is key management and why is it important?    One of the fundamental axioms of cryptography is that the enemy is in   full possession of the details of the general cryptographic system,   and lacks only the specific key data employed in the encryption. (Of   course, one would assume that the CIA does not make a habit of telling   Mossad about its cryptosystems, but Mossad probably finds out anyway.)   Repeated use of a finite amount of key provides redundancy that can   eventually facilitate cryptanalytic progress. Thus, especially in   modern communication systems where vast amounts of information are   transferred, both parties must have not only a sound cryptosystem but   also enough key material to cover the traffic.    Key management refers to the distribution, authentication, and   handling of keys.    A publicly accessible example of modern key management technology   is the STU III secure telephone unit, which for classified use   employs individual coded ``Crypto Ignition Keys'' and a central Key   Management Center operated by NSA. There is a hierarchy in that   certain CIKs are used by authorized cryptographic control   personnel to validate the issuance of individual traffic keys and   to perform installation/maintenance functions, such as the   reporting of lost CIKs.    This should give an inkling of the extent of the key management   problem. For public-key systems, there are several related issues,   many having to do with ``whom do you trust?''  * Can I use pseudo-random or chaotic numbers as a key stream?    Chaotic equations and fractals produce an apparent randomness from   relatively compact generators. Perhaps the simplest example is a   linear congruential sequence, one of the most popular types of random   number generators, where there is no obvious dependence between seeds   and outputs. Unfortunately the graph of any such sequence will, in a   high enough dimension, show up as a regular lattice. Mathematically   this lattice corresponds to structure which is notoriously easy for   cryptanalysts to exploit. More complicated generators have more   complicated structure, which is why they make interesting pictures---   but a cryptographically strong sequence will have no computable   structure at all.    See [KNU81], exercise 3.5-7; [REE77]; and [BOY89].  * What is the correct frequency list for English letters?    There are three answers to this question, each slightly deeper than   the one before. You can find the first answer in various books:   namely, a frequency list computed directly from a certain sample of   English text. Of course any such list will be ``correctly'' computed,   but exactly which list you get depends on which sample was taken.    The second answer is that the question doesn't make sense. What do   you mean by ``English letters''? The ``English language'' is not a   fixed, finite, closed object that can be exactly characterized. It   has changed over time; it is different between different authors.   Any particular message will have different statistics from those of   the language as a whole.    The third answer is that yes, no particular message is going to have   exactly the same characteristics as English in general, but for all   reasonable statistical uses these slight discrepancies won't matter.   In fact there's an entire field called ``Bayesian statistics'' (other   buzzwords are ``maximum entropy methods'' and ``maximum likelihood   estimation'') which studies questions like ``What's the chance that a   text with these letter frequencies is in English?'' and comes up with   reasonably robust answers.    So make your own list from your own samples of English text. It will   be good enough for practical work, if you use it properly.  * What is the Enigma?    ``For a project in data security we are looking for sources of   information about the German Enigma code and how it was broken by   the British during WWII.''    See [WEL82], [DEA85], [KOZ84], [HOD83], [KAH91].  * How do I shuffle cards?    Card shuffling is a special case of the permutation of an array of   values, using a random or pseudo-random function.  All possible output   permutations of this process should be equally likely.  To do this, you   need a random function (modran(x)) which will produce a uniformly   distributed random integer in the interval [0..x-1].  Given that   function, you can shuffle with the following [C] code: (assuming ARRLTH   is the length of array arr[] and swap() interchanges values at the two   addresses given)    for ( n = ARRLTH-1; n > 0 ; n-- ) swap( &arr[modran( n+1 )], &arr[n] ) ;    modran(x) can not be achieved exactly with a simple (ranno() % x) since   ranno()'s interval may not be divisible by x, although in most cases the   error will be very small.  To cover this case, one can take ranno()'s   modulus mod x, call that number y, and if ranno() returns a value less   than y, go back and get another ranno() value.   * Can I foil S/W pirates by encrypting my CD-ROM?    Someone will frequently express the desire to publish a CD-ROM with   possibly multiple pieces of software, perhaps with each encrypted   separately, and will want to use different keys for each user (perhaps   even good for only a limited period of time) in order to avoid piracy.    As far as we know, this is impossible, since there is nothing in standard   PC or workstation hardware which uniquely identifies the user at the   keyboard.  If there were such an identification, then the CD-ROM could be   encrypted with a key based in part on the one sold to the user and in   part on the unique identifier.  However, in this case the CD-ROM is one   of a kind and that defeats the intended purpose.    If the CD-ROM is to be encrypted once and then mass produced, there must   be a key (or set of keys) for that encryption produced at some stage in   the process.  That key is useable with any copy of the CD-ROM's data.   The pirate needs only to isolate that key and sell it along with the   illegal copy.   * Can you do automatic cryptanalysis of simple ciphers?

Anyone else catch ESPN's piece about prospects and the relationship between age, career length, MVPs and Hall of Fame members? It was part of their preseason special. Basically, they looked  at players that had amassed 1000 plate appearances (or ABs) by the time they were 24, and noticed some interesting things.     For starters, they found out such players comprised the majority of MVPs in the history of the game. They also found out such players represented the majority of the players in the hall of fame. The kicker, though, was that they actually did some number-crunching and found that such players' careers lasted much longer than the careers of players not in that group. They also   found that these players produced at both a greater level of performance and produced over twice the raw totals (HRs, etc) of the other players. The first group outhit the second something like .282 to .260 in raw BA, and blew away the second group in such categories as HRs, 2Bs, RBIs, etc.     It was the most impressive thing I've seen on ESPN in recent memory.

Jeff\",\"Stuff deleted...\",\" Yes, absolutely, though I'd make the observation in a more general sense of all observations are made by human beings and therefore made with various biases.   But here your message leaves talk of hypothesis and gets back, once again,  to equating the business of science with the end result, the gizmo produced.   My point isn't so much whether or not you have a novel paradigm but *how*  you come about developing it.   Perhaps you'd admit that this is an oversimplification on your part (the topic of the philosophy of science is made for them, I'm making them too) but I think that it also summarizes popular misconceptions of science and the  business of doing science.  Biomedical research doesn't make any basic  assumptions that aren't the same as any other discipline of scientific research.  That is, that you make empirical observations, form an hypothesis and test it.  Modern medicine has much more to do with biochemistry than  \\\"the old Newtonian model of the world\\\".  And I doubt that many psychologists would appreciate being put outside this empirical \\\"world view\\\".  Psychology also has more to do with biochemistry than spoon bending.    Oversimplified, of course, but a good example.  This is an empirical observa- tion.  It was then tested, though perhaps not by Aristotle, and eventually  found wanting.  In the meantime, some folk will  have continued to believe in the spontaneous generation of animal life.   There's nothing at all surprising about this, it's the way the gathering of knowledge works.  There are probably more than a few things in my own  discipline of molecular biology that will be found to be totally off-base, even idiotic, to someone in the future.  These future people won't have come to these relevations because they had suddenly gone all Zen-like and had  a vision in an LSD trip.  Someone will have thought of something new and  tested it.  This is the bit that people who seem to relish misrepresenting science and research can't seem to wrap their minds around.  Science is a  creative process.  What I think of as factual and good research can be totally turned on its head tommorrow by new results and theories.  \",\"  I don't know, but I'm as willing to speculate as anyone.  Several people have suggested that the chips use public-key cryptography. Another possibility is to use Diffie-Hellman key exchange, or some other algorithm which has a similar effect.  DH allows both ends to agree on a session key which they use with symmetric cryptography (something like DES) for the encryption.  How could the \\\"back door\\\" keys work in this system?  I can see a few possibilities.  One is that the DH-like algorithm has the property that the session key can be deduced by an eavesdropper who knows the back door keys for one (or possibly both) communicants.  Perhaps the random numbers used in the DH are seeded by the back door key, or some such.  Another possibility, as was suggested here earlier, is that the chips simply broadcast the session key, encrypted with the chip's own internal secret key.  In this system the back door keys are secret keys usable for decrypting this session key broadcast.  Actually the chip's secret key doesn't need to be a public key in this usage, but can be identical to the secret back-door key.  (This proposal seems most straightforward to me.)  Still another possibility is that the encryption algorithm used for the message itself has a \\\"dual key\\\" property, that possession of either of two keys can be used to decrypt it.  One key would be the session key from the DH exchange, and the other would be the back door key for the chip.  It's worth noting that one of the proposals Dorothy Denning raised during her amazingly prescient on-line discussion last November and December was a variation on Diffie-Hellman in which a third party would participate in deriving the session keys.  This doesn't quite fit into what we know of how Clipper works but it hints that those who had early knowledge of Clipper (or whose thinking was somehow synchronized with Clipper designers) may have had Diffie-Hellman on their minds.\",\"  I believe we still remember Masada, where Jews killed themselves rather than being captured by the Romans.

I'm pretty much oblivious to any current firmware problems, so you'll have to get it from someone else.  However, I can tell you to stay clear of any board which uses the Rockwell MPU (as opposed to the DPU) for an internal implementation. This is because the MPU used \\\"speed buffering\\\" instead of having a 16550 interface.  Without the 550 interface, the number of interrupts are still the same and thus may get dropped under multitasking conditions (like in windows).  As far as I know, the \\\"speed buffering\\\" works OK for external modems if a 550 is used on the internal serial port board.  Hope this helps... Tom \",\"AAAHHHH!!!!!

As for 'Cyprus', In 1974, Turkiye  stepped into Cyprus to preserve the lives of the Turkish population  there. This is nothing but a simple historical fact. Unfortunately,  the intervention was too late at least for some of the victims. Mass  graves containing numerous bodies of women and children already showed  what fate had been planned for a peaceful minority.  The problems in Cyprus have their origin in decades of  oppression of the Turkish population by the Greek Cypriot  officials and their violation of the co-founder status of  the Turks set out in the constitution. The coup d'etat  engineered by Greece in 1974 to execute a final solution  to the Turkish problem was the savage blow that invoked  Turkiye's intervention. Turkiye intervened reluctantly and  only as a last resort after exhausting all other avenues  consulting with Britain and Greece as the other two signatories  to the treaty to protect the integrity of Cyprus. There simply  was not any expansionist motivation in the Turkish action at  all. This is in dramatic contrast to the Greek motivation which  was openly expansionist, stated as 'Enosis,' union with Greece.  Since the creation of independent Cyprus in 1960, the Turkish  population, although smaller, legally had status as the co-founder of the republic with the Greek population.  The Greek Cypriots, with the support of 'Enosis'-minded Greeks in the mainland, have consistently ignored that status and portrayed the Island as a Greek island with a minority population of Turks. The Turks of Cyprus are not a minority in a Greek Republic and they found the only way they could show that was to assert their  autonomy in a separate republic.  Turkiye is not satisfied with the status quo. She would rather not be involved with the island. But, given the dismal record of brutal Greek oppression of the Turkish population in Cyprus, she simply cannot leave the fate of the island's Turks in the hands of the Greeks until the Turkish side is satisfied with whatever accord the two communities finally reach to guarantee that history will not repeat itself to rob Turkish Cypriots of their rights, liberties and their very lives.

The sort of criticism leveled at an organisation such as this along the lines of \\\"ideological manipulation and cultural interference\\\" is probably no more than Christianising and education - in this WBT will stand alongside the early Christian missionaries to parts of Africa, or those groups who worked among native Americans a couple hundred years ago.

What is probably the most convincing is the anti-Christian literature put out by the Jewish councils in the second century.  There are enormous quantities of detailed arguments against Christianity, many of the arguments still being used today.  Despite volumes of tracts attacking Christianity, not one denies the existance of Jesus, only of his activities.    I find this considerably more compelling than Josephus or the harmony of the gospels (especially considering that Matthew and Luke probably used Mark as a source).\",\"$400included shipping  \",\"I have a line on a Ducati 900GTS 1978 model with 17k on the clock.

FACT:  It is unlawful to distribute code implementing RSA without a license to do so from PKP, whether or not one is charging for it.  Furthermore, any use of RSA, other than for research purposes allowed under US patent law, is similarly unlawful.  Therefore, the \\\"average citizen\\\" cannot use RSA to encrypt message traffic in the US without a license from PKP.  There is no licensed, freely available product in the US that uses RSA encryption other than RSAREF (and hence RIPEM), at least as far as I am aware.  If you know of another, please post it here.   FACT:  The last contact I had with RSA Data Security, Inc was with some guy trying to sell me a license (unsolicited, I might add) for TIPEM. Cost: $15K plus 2-5 percent royalties.

FACT:  There are no restrictions (yet!) on the use of cryptography under US law, although this is beginning to look like it will change.

Further striking bigoted and racist attitude of  certain Greeks still exists in our day. Most Greeks insist even  today, that the 537 year-old capital of the Ottoman Empire should  be called not by its rightful name of Istanbul, but by its half  a millennium-old moniker 'Cons*(whatever).'  Everyone knows that New York City was once called 'New Amsterdam' but Dutch people do not persist on calling it that today. The name  of Stalingrad too is long gone, replaced by Volgagrad. China's Peking traded its name for Beiging long ago. Ciudad Trujillo of the Dominican Republic is now Santa Domingo. Zimbabve's old colonial capital Salisburry became Harrare. These changes have all been accepted officially by everyone in the world.  But, Greeks are still determined on calling the Turkish Istanbul  by the name of 'Cons*.'  How can one explain this total intransigence? What makes Greeks so different from other mortals? 18-year-old questionable democracy? Why don't they seem to reconcile with the fact, for instance, that Istanbul changed hands 537 years ago in 1453 AD, and that this predates the discovery of the New  World, by 39 years. The declaration of U.S. independence in 1776 will come 284 years later.  Shouldn't then, half a millennium be considered enough time for  'Cons*' to be called a Turkish city? Where is the logic in the  Greek reasoning, if there is any? How long can one sit on the  laurels of an ancient civilization? Ancient Greece does not exist,  any more than any other 16 civilizations that existed on the soil  of Anatolia.  These undereducated 'wieneramus' live with an illusion. It  is the same mentality which allows them to rationalize that Cyprus is a Greek Island. No history book shows that it ever was. It belonged to the Ottoman Turks 'lock, stock and barrel' for a period of well over 300 years.  In fact, prior to the Turks' acquisition of it, following bloody naval battles with the Venetians in 1570 AD, the island of Cyprus belonged, invariably, to several nations:  The Assyrians, the Sumerians, the Phoenicians, the Egyptians, the Ottoman Turks, of course in that order, owned it as  their territory. But, it has never been the possession of the government of Greece - not even for one day - in the history of the world. Moreover, Cyprus is located 1500 miles from the Greek mainland, but only  40 miles from Turkiye's southern coastline.  Saddam Hussein claims that Kuwait was once Iraqi territory and the Greek Cypriot government and  the terrorist Greek governments think that Cyprus also was once part of the Greek hegemony.  Those 'Arromdians' involved in this grandiose hallucination should wake up from their sweet daydreams and confront  reality. Again, wishful thinking is unproductive, only  facts count.  As for Selanik,    <<Those Jews who survived these assaults in Southeastern Europe fled   particularly to Salonica, whose Jewish population increased substantially   as a result, from 28,000 in 1876 to 90,000 in 1908, more than half the   total population, though even there increased persecution by local Greeks   led many Jews to flee elsewhere in the Ottoman Empire, particularly to   the great port of Izmir.    Despite all the pressure from Ottomans and foreign Jews alike, the ritual   murders and other assaults by Christians on Jews went on and on. Greek   efforts to decimate the Jewish population of Salonica culminated in 1912   and 1913, following Greek conquest of Salonica during the first Balkan War,   when many of its Jews, were either killed or terrorized into leaving...>>    <<Though Greece was obligated by the post World War I treaties to allow   Jews and other minorities to use their own languages in education and to   practice their religions without hindrance, a law was issued in 1923   which forbad all inhabitants from working on Sunday, stimulating a new   Jewish exodus as it was intended to do. Between 1932 and 1934 there was a   series of anti-Semitic riots in Salonica, with the Cambel quarter, where   most of the remaining Jews lived, being burned to the ground. This   was followed by regulations requiring the use of Greek and prohibiting   Hebrew and Judea-Spanish in the Jewish schools. A start was made also   on expropriating the land of the principal Jewish cemetery in Salonica   for use by the new University in order to derive the Jews out [47]. By   killing and driving out large numbers of Jews, the Greeks left a   substantial Greek majority in the city for the first time, and starting   Salonica Jewry on the way to its final decimation by the Nazis during the   occupation of Greece starting in 1941.    Salonica and Izmir of course were not the only places of refuge for   Jewish refugees entering the Empire during its last century of existence.   Istanbul, Edirne, and other parts of Rumelia and Anatolia received   thousands more. Nor were Jews the only refugees received and helped by   the government of the Sultan. Thousands of Muslims accompanied them in   flight from similar persecutions wherever Balkan christian states gained   independence or expanded. The Russian conquest of the Crimea and the   Caucasus starting in the late eighteenth century, and particularly during   and after the Crimean War, combined with the same independence movements   in Southeastern Europe that had caused so much suffering and flight among   its Jews caused thousands of helpless, ill, and poverty-stricken Muslim   refugees to accompany them into the ever shrinking boundaries of the   Ottoman Empire, with the Istanbul government struggling mightly but vainly   to house and feed them as best it could. From 1850 to 1864 as many as   800,000 Crimean Tatars, Circassians, and other Muslims from north and   east of the Black Sea had entered Anatolia alone, as many as 200,000 more   came during the next twenty years, while 474,389 refugees entered in 1876-   1877 as a result of the Ottoman wars with Russia and the Balkan states,   with an equal number gaining refuge in the European portions of the   Empire.>>  [47] Robert Mantran, 'La structure sociale de la communaute juive de   Salonqiue a la fin du dix-neuvieme siecle', RH no.534 (1980), 391-92;   Nehama VII, 762; Joseph Nehama (Salonica) to AIU (Paris) no.2868/2,   12 May 1903 (AIU Archives I-C-43); and no.2775, 10 January 1900 (AIU   Archives I-C-41), describing daily battles between Jewish and Greek   children in the streets of Salonica.

Points covered here are ones which are not covered in the \\\"Introduction to Atheism\\\"; you are advised to read that article as well before posting.  These answers are not intended to be exhaustive or definitive. The purpose of the periodic FAQ postings is not to stifle debate, but to raise its level. If you have something to say concerning one of these questions and which isn't covered by the answer given, please feel free to make your point.

Typical posting:  Why have a newsgroup about atheism?  Why do atheists organize in groups?   What is there to discuss?  Response:  Many things are discussed here, including:  * Whether it is reasonable to feign theism in order to avoid upsetting one's   family * Prayer in schools * Discrimination against atheists * Sunday trading laws * The Satanic Child Abuse myth * Whether one should be an overt atheist or 'stay in the closet' * How religious societies prey (sic) on new college students * How to get rid of unwanted proselytizers * Whether religion is a danger to society and/or the individual * Why people become atheists  Of course, inevitably alt.atheism tends to attract evangelical Christians looking for someone to convert.  Most readers of the newsgroup don't  want to be preached to, although a few seem to derive perverse pleasure  from tearing apart particularly ill-considered or uninformed postings.  ------------------------------  Subject: Hitler was an atheist!  Typical posting:  Hitler was an atheist, and look at what he did!  Response:  Adolf Hitler was emphatically not an atheist.  As he said himself:     The folkish-minded man, in particular, has the sacred duty, each in    his own denomination, of making _people_stop_just_talking_    superficially_of_God's_will,_and_actually_fulfill_God's_will,_and_    not_let_God's_word_be_desecrated._[orig. ital.]     For God's will gave men their form, their essence, and their    abilities.  Anyone who destroys His work is declaring war on the    Lord's creation, the divine will.  Therefore, let every man be    active, each in his own denomination if you please, and let every    man take it as his first and most sacred duty to oppose anyone who    in his activity by word or deed steps outside the confines of his    religious community and tries to butt into the other.     [...]     Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will    of the Almighty Creator: _by_defending_myself_against_the_Jew,_I_am_    fighting_for_the_work_of_the_Lord._[orig. ital.]            -- Adolf Hitler, from \\\"Mein Kampf\\\", trans. Ralph Mannheim.  Of course, someone bad believing something does not make that belief wrong.  It's also entirely possible that Hitler was lying when he claimed  to believe in God.  We certainly can't conclude that he's an atheist,  though.  ------------------------------  Subject: The Bible proves it  Typical posting:  In the Bible it says that...  Response:  Most of the readers of alt.atheism feel that the Bible is of questionable accuracy, as it was written thousands of years ago by many authors who were recording oral tradition that existed many years before.  Thus, any claimed 'truth' in it is of questionable legitimacy.  This isn't to say that The Bible has no truth in it; simply that any truth must be examined before being accepted.  Many of the readers of this group also feel that because any passage is subject to \\\"interpretation\\\", any claim that a passage 'means' one thing and one thing only is not legitimate.  Note that this feeling tends to extend to other books.  It is also remarkable to many atheists that theists tend to ignore other equally plausible religious books in favour of those of their own religion.  ------------------------------  Subject: Pascal's Wager  Typical posting:  If you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing -- but if you don't believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you will go to hell. Therefore it is foolish to be an atheist.  Response:  This argument is known as Pascal's Wager.  It has several flaws.  Firstly, it does not indicate which religion to follow.  Indeed, there are many mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out there.  This is often described as the \\\"avoiding the wrong hell\\\" problem.  If a person is a follower of religion X, he may end up in religion Y's version of hell.  Secondly, the statement that \\\"If you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing\\\" is not true.  Suppose you're believing in the wrong God -- the true God might punish you for your foolishness. Consider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine in favour of prayer.  Another flaw in the argument is that it is based on the assumption that  the two possibilities are equally likely -- or at least, that they are of  comparable likelihood.  If, in fact, the possibility of there being a God  is close to zero, the argument becomes much less persuasive.  So sadly the argument is only likely to convince those who believe already.  Also, many feel that for intellectually honest people, belief is based on  evidence, with some amount of intuition.  It is not a matter of will or  cost-benefit analysis.  Formally speaking, the argument consists of four statements:    1. One does not know whether God exists.   2. Not believing in God is bad for one's eternal soul if God does      exist.   3. Believing in God is of no consequence if God does not exist.   4. Therefore it is in one's interest to believe in God.  There are two approaches to the argument.  The first is to view 1 as an assumption, and 2 as a consequence of it.  One problem with this approach, in the abstract, is that it creates information from no information.  This is considered invalid in information theory.  Statement 1 indicates one has no information about God -- but statement 2 indicates that beneficial information can be gained from the absolute lack of information about God.  This violates information entropy -- information has been extracted from no information, at no \\\"cost\\\".  The alternative approach is to claim that 1 and 2 are both assumptions.  The problem with this is that 2 is then basically an assumption which states the Christian position, and only a Christian will agree with that assumption. The argument thus collapses to \\\"If you are a Christian, it is in your interests to believe in God\\\" -- a rather vacuous tautology, and not the way Pascal intended the argument to be viewed.  The biggest reason why Pascal's wager is a failure is that if God is omniscient he will certainly know who really believes and who believes as a wager.  He will spurn the latter... assuming he actually cares at all whether people believe in him.  ------------------------------  Subject: What is Occam's Razor?  Typical posting:  People keep talking about Occam's Razor.  What is it?  Response:  William of Occam formulated a principle which has become known as Occam's  Razor.  In its original form, it said \\\"Do not multiply entities  unnecessarily.\\\"  That is, if you can explain something without supposing the existence of some entity, then do so.  Nowadays when people refer to Occam's Razor, they generally express it  more generally, for example as \\\"Take the simplest solution\\\".  The relevance to atheism is that we can look at two possible explanations  for what we see around us:  1. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, which came into being as a result of natural processes.  2. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, and  there is also a God who created the universe.  Clearly this God must be  of non-zero complexity.  Given that both explanations fit the facts, Occam's Razor might suggest  that we should take the simpler of the two -- solution number one. Unfortunately, some argue that there is a third even more simple solution:  3. There isn't an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there.   We just imagine that there is.  This third option leads us logically towards solipsism, which many people  find unacceptable.   ------------------------------  Subject: Why it's good to believe in Jesus  Typical posting:  I want to tell people about the virtues and benefits of my religion.  Response:  Preaching is not appreciated.  Feel free to talk about your religion, but please do not write postings that are on a \\\"conversion\\\" theme.  Such postings do not belong on alt.atheism and will be rejected from alt.atheism.moderated (try the newsgroup talk.religion.misc).  You would doubtless not welcome postings from atheists to your favourite newsgroup in an attempt to convert you; please do unto others as you would have them do unto you!  Often theists make their basic claims about God in the form of lengthy analogies or parables.  Be aware that atheists have heard of God and know the basic claims about him; if the sole purpose of your parable is to tell atheists that God exists and brings salvation, you may as well not post it, since it tells us nothing we have not been told before.  ------------------------------  Subject: Why I know that God exists  Typical posting:  I *know* from personal experience and prayer that God exists.  Response:  Just as many theists have personal evidence that the being they worship exists, so many atheists have personal evidence that such beings do not exist.  That evidence varies from person to person.  Furthermore, without wishing to dismiss your evidence out of hand, many people have claimed all kinds of unlikely things -- that they have been abducted by UFOs, visited by the ghost of Elvis, and so on.  ------------------------------  Subject: Einstein and \\\"God does not play dice\\\"  Typical posting:  Albert Einstein believed in God.  Do you think you're cleverer than him?  Response:  Einstein did once comment that \\\"God does not play dice [with the universe]\\\".  This quotation is commonly mentioned to show that Einstein believed in the Christian God.  Used this way, it is out of context; it refers to Einstein's refusal to accept the uncertainties indicated by quantum theory. Furthermore, Einstein's religious background was Jewish rather than Christian.  A better quotation showing what Einstein thought about God is the following: \\\"I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists, not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings.\\\"  Einstein was unable to accept Quantum Theory because of his belief in an objective, orderly reality; a reality which would not be subject to random events and which would not be dependent upon the observer.  He believed that QM was incomplete, and that a better theory would have no need for statistical interpretations.  So far no such better theory has been found, and much evidence suggests that it never will be.  A longer quote from Einstein appears in \\\"Science, Philosophy, and Religion, A Symposium\\\", published by the Conference on Science, Philosophy and Religion in Their Relation to the Democratic Way of Life, Inc., New York, 1941.  In    \\\"The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events    the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side    of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature.  For him    neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an    independent cause of natural events.  To be sure, the doctrine of a    personal God interfering with natural events could never be    *refuted* [italics his], in the real sense, by science, for this    doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific    knowledge has not yet been able to set foot.     But I am convinced that such behavior on the part of representatives    of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal.  For a doctrine    which is to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark,    will of necessity lose its effect on mankind, with incalculable harm    to human progress.  In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers    of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal    God, that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past    placed such vast power in the hands of priests.  In their labors they    will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable    of cultivating the Good, the True, and the Beautiful in humanity    itself.  This is, to be sure, a more difficult but an incomparably    more worthy task...\\\"     \\\"It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religous convictions,    a lie which is being systematically repeated.  I do not believe in a    personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly.    If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the    unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our    science can reveal it.\\\"  The latter quote is from \\\"Albert Einstein: The Human Side\\\", edited by Helen  Dukas and Banesh Hoffman, and published by Princeton University Press.   Also from the same book:    \\\"I do not believe in immortality of the individual, and I consider ethics    to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind     it.\\\"  Of course, the fact that Einstein chose not to believe in Christianity does  not in itself imply that Christianity is false.  ------------------------------  Subject: Everyone worships something  Typical posting:  Everyone worships something, whether it's money, power or God.  Response:  If that is true, everyone is a polytheist.  Theists care just as much about those things that atheists care about.  If the atheists' reactions to (for example) their families amount to worship then so do the theists'.  ------------------------------  Subject: Why there must be a causeless cause  Typical posting:  Sets of integers that have a lower bound each have a smallest member, so chains of causes must all have a first element, a causeless cause.  Response:  The set of real numbers greater than zero has a definite lower bound, but has no smallest member.  Further, even if it is true that there must be a causeless cause, that does not imply that that cause must be a conscious supernatural entity, and especially not that any such entity must match the description favoured by any particular religion.  ------------------------------  Subject: The universe is so complex it must have been designed  Typical posting:  The presence of design in the universe proves there is a God.  Surely you don't think all this appeared here just by chance?  Response:  This is known as the Argument From Design.  It is a matter of dispute whether there is any element of design in the universe. Those who believe that the complexity and diversity of living creatures on the earth is evidence of a creator are best advised to read the newsgroup talk.origins for a while.  There is insufficient space to summarize both sides of that debate here. However, the conclusion is that there is no scientific evidence in favour of so-called Scientific Creationism. Furthermore, there is much evidence, observation and theory that can explain many of the complexities of the universe and life on earth.  The origin of the Argument by Design is a feeling that the existence of something as incredibly intricate as, say, a human is so improbable that surely it can't have come about by chance; that surely there must be some  external intelligence directing things so that humans come from the chaos deliberately.  But if human intelligence is so improbable, surely the existence of a mind capable of fashioning an entire universe complete with conscious beings must be immeasurably more unlikely?  The approach used to argue in favour of the existence of a creator can be turned around and applied to the Creationist position.  This leads us to the familiar theme of \\\"If a creator created the universe, what created the creator?\\\", but with the addition of spiralling  improbability.  The only way out is to declare that the creator was not created and just \\\"is\\\" (or \\\"was\\\").  From here we might as well ask what is wrong with saying that the universe just \\\"is\\\" without introducing a creator?  Indeed Stephen Hawking, in his book \\\"A Brief History of Time\\\", explains his theory that the universe is closed and finite in extent, with no beginning or end.  The Argument From Design is often stated by analogy, in the so-called  Watchmaker Argument.  One is asked to imagine that one has found a watch on the beach.  Does one assume that it was created by a watchmaker, or that it evolved naturally?  Of course one assumes a watchmaker.  Yet like the  watch, the universe is intricate and complex; so, the argument goes, the  universe too must have a creator.  The Watchmaker analogy suffers from three particular flaws, over and above  those common to all Arguments By Design.  Firstly, a watchmaker creates  watches from pre-existing materials, whereas God is claimed to have  created the universe from nothing.  These two sorts of creation are  clearly fundamentally different, and the analogy is therefore rather weak.  Secondly, a watchmaker makes watches, but there are many other things in  the world.  If we walked further along the beach and found a nuclear  reactor, we wouldn't assume it was created by the watchmaker.  The argument  would therefore suggest a multitude of creators, each responsible for a  different part of creation.  Finally, in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that  the watch is not part of nature because it is ordered, and therefore  stands out from the randomness of nature.  Yet in the second part of the  argument, we start from the position that the universe is obviously not  random, but shows elements of order.  The Watchmaker argument is thus  internally inconsistent.  ------------------------------  Subject: Independent evidence that the Bible is true  Typical posting:  The events of the New Testament are confirmed by independent documentary evidence.  For example...  Response:  The writings of Josephus are often mentioned as independent documentary evidence.  Early versions of Josephus's work are thought not to have mentioned Jesus or James; the extant version discusses John in a non-Christian context.  Many scholars believe that the original mentioned Jesus and James in passing, but that this was expanded by Christian copyists.  Several \\\"reconstructions\\\" of the original text have been published to this effect.  Much information appears in the Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius (about 320 C.E.).  It is worthless as historical material because of the deliberate falsification of the wily Eusebius who is generally acknowledged as 'the first thoroughly dishonest historian of antiquity.' It is Eusebius who is generally given the title of authorship for this material.  Aside from the New Testament, the biographical information about Jesus is more well-documented.  For further information, please consult the Frequently Asked Questions file for the newsgroup soc.religion.christian.  ------------------------------  Subject: Godel's Incompleteness Theorem  Typical posting:  Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible for the Bible to be both true and complete.  Response:  Godel's First Incompleteness Theorem says that in any consistent formal  system which is sufficiently expressive that it can model ordinary  arithmetic, one can formulate expressions which can never be proven to be  valid or invalid ('true' or 'false') within that formal system.  (Technically speaking, the system must also be recursive; that is, there must be a decision procedure for determining whether a given string is an axiom within the formal  system.)  Essentially, all such systems can formulate what is known as a \\\"Liar  Paradox.\\\"  The classic Liar Paradox sentence in ordinary English is \\\"This  sentence is false.\\\"  Note that if a proposition is undecidable, the formal  system cannot even deduce that it is undecidable.  The logic used in theological discussions is rarely well defined, so claims that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible to prove or disprove) the existence of God are worthless in isolation.  One can trivially define a formal system in which it is possible to prove the existence of God, simply by having the existence of God stated as an axiom.  This is unlikely to be viewed by atheists as a convincing proof, however.  It may be possible to succeed in producing a formal system built on axioms that both atheists and theists agree with.  It may then be possible to show that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem holds for that system.  However, that would still not demonstrate that it is impossible to prove that God exists within the system.  Furthermore, it certainly wouldn't tell us anything about whether it is possible to prove the existence of God generally.  Note also that all of these hypothetical formal systems tell us nothing about the actual existence of God; the formal systems are just abstractions.  Another frequent claim is that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that a religious text (the Bible, the Book of Mormon or whatever) cannot be both consistent and universally applicable. Religious texts are not formal systems, so such claims are nonsense.  ------------------------------  Subject: George Bush on atheism and patriotism  Typical posting:  Did George Bush really say that atheists should not be considered citizens?  Response:  The following exchange took place at the Chicago airport between Robert I. Sherman of American Atheist Press and George Bush, on August 27 1988. Sherman is a fully accredited reporter, and was present by invitation as a member of the press corps.  The Republican presidential nominee was there to announce federal disaster relief for Illinois.  The discussion turned to the presidential primary:   RS: \\\"What will you do to win the votes of Americans who are atheists?\\\"   GB: \\\"I guess I'm pretty weak in the atheist community.  Faith in       God is important to me.\\\"   RS: \\\"Surely you recognize the equal citizenship and patriotism of       Americans who are atheists?\\\"   GB: \\\"No, I don't know that atheists should be considered as citizens,       nor should they be considered patriots.  This is one nation under       God.\\\"   RS: \\\"Do you support as a sound constitutional principle the separation       of state and church?\\\"   GB: \\\"Yes, I support the separation of church and state.  I'm just not       very high on atheists.\\\"  UPI reported on May 8, 1989, that various atheist organizations were still angry over the remarks.  The exchange appeared in the Boulder Daily Camera on Monday February 27, 1989.  It can also be found in \\\"Free Enquiry\\\" magazine, Fall 1988 issue, Volume 8, Number 4, page 16.  On October 29, 1988, Mr. Sherman had a confrontation with Ed Murnane, cochairman of the Bush-Quayle '88 Illinois campaign.  This concerned a lawsuit Mr. Sherman had filed to stop the Community Consolidated School District 21 (Chicago, Illinois) from forcing his first-grade Atheist son to pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States as \\\"one nation under God\\\" (Bush's phrase).  The following conversation took place:    RS: \\\"American Atheists filed the Pledge of Allegiance lawsuit yesterday.       Does the Bush campaign have an official response to this filing?\\\"    EM: \\\"It's bullshit.\\\"    RS: \\\"What is bullshit?\\\"    EM: \\\"Everything that American Atheists does, Rob, is bullshit.\\\"    RS: \\\"Thank you for telling me what the official position of the Bush       campaign is on this issue.\\\"   EM: \\\"You're welcome.\\\"  After Bush's election, American Atheists wrote to Bush asking him to retract his statement.  On February 21st 1989, C. Boyden Gray, Counsel to the President, replied on White House stationery that Bush substantively stood by    \\\"As you are aware, the President is a religious man who neither supports    atheism nor believes that atheism should be unnecessarily encouraged or    supported by the government.\\\"  For further information, contact American Atheist Veterans at the American Atheist Press's Cameron Road address.  ------------------------------  Subject: I know where hell is!  Typical posting:  I know where Hell is!  Hell is in Norway!  Response:  There are several towns called \\\"Hell\\\" in various countries around the world, including Norway and the USA.  Whilst this information is mildly amusing the first time one hears it, readers of alt.atheism are now  getting pretty fed up with hearing it every week.  ------------------------------  Subject: Biblical contradictions wanted  Typical posting:  Does anyone have a list of Biblical contradictions?  Response:   American Atheist Press publish an atheist's handbook detailing Biblical contradictions. See the accompanying posting on Atheist Resources for details.  There is a file containing some Biblical contradictions available from the archive-server@mantis.co.uk. See the contacts file for more information.  ------------------------------  Subject: The USA is a Christian nation  Typical posting:  Because of the religious beliefs of the founding fathers, shouldn't the United States be considered a Christian nation?  Response:  Based upon the writings of several important founding fathers, it is clear that they never intended the US to be a Christian nation.  Here are some quotes; there are many more.    \\\"What influence, in fact, have ecclesiastical establishments had on society?    In some instances they have been seen to erect a spiritual tyranny on the    ruins of the civil authority; on many instances they have been seen    upholding the thrones of political tyranny; in no instance have they been    the guardians of the liberties of the people.  Rulers who wish to subvert    the public liberty may have found an established clergy convenient    auxiliaries. A just government, instituted to secure and perpetuate it,    needs them not.\\\"       - James Madison, \\\"A Memorial and Remonstrance\\\", 1785    \\\"I almost shudder at the thought of alluding to the most fatal example of    the abuses of grief which the history of mankind has preserved--the Cross.    Consider what calamities that engine of grief has produced!\\\"       - John Adams, in a letter to Thomas Jefferson    \\\"History I believe furnishes no example of a priest-ridden people    maintaining a free civil government.  This marks the lowest grade of    ignorance, of which their political as well as religious leaders will    always avail themselves for their own purpose.\\\"        - Thomas Jefferson to Baron von Humboldt, 1813    \\\"I cannot conceive otherwise than that He, the Infinite Father, expects or    requires no worship or praise from us, but that He is even infinitely    above it.\\\"        - Benjamin Franklin, from \\\"Articles of Belief and Acts of Religion\\\",         Nov. 20, 1728  ------------------------------  Subject: The USA is not a Christian nation  Typical posting:  Is it true that George Washington said that the United States is not in any sense founded upon the Christian religion?  Response:  No.  The quotation often given is in fact from Article XI of the 1797 Treaty of Tripoli (8 Stat 154, Treaty Series 358):     Article 11     As the government of the United States of America is not in any sense    founded on the Christian Religion, -- as it has in itself no character of    enmity against the laws, religion or tranquility of Musselmen, -- and as    the said States never have entered into any war or act of hostility    against any Mehomitan nation, it is declared by the parties that no    pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption    of the harmony existing between the two countries.  The text may be found in the Congressional Record or in treaty collections such as Charles Bevans' \\\"Treaties and Other International Agreements of the United States of America 1776-1949\\\", vol. 11 (pp. 1070-1080).  The English text of the Treaty of Tripoli was approved by the U.S. Senate on June 7, 1797 and ratified by President John Adams on June 10, 1797.  It was recently discovered that the Arabic version of the treaty not only lacks the quotation, it lacks Article XI altogether.  The person who translated the Arabic to English was Joel Barlow, Consul General at Algiers, a close friend of Thomas Paine -- and an opponent of Christianity.  It is possible that Barlow made up Article XI, but since there is no Arabic version of that article to be found, it's hard to say.  In 1806 a new Treaty of Tripoli was ratified which no longer contained the quotation. \",\"      What  evidence  indicates that Gamma Ray bursters are very far away?  Their distribution is very isotropic and the intensity distribution, crudely speaking, indicates we're seeing an edge to the distribution.     Given the enormous  power,  i was just wondering,  what if they are    quantum  black holes or something  like that  fairly close by?     Why would they have to be at  galactic ranges?     Now, in the good old days before GRO data, it was thought the gamma bursters were neutron stars in the galaxy, it was expected that GRO would confirm this by either showing they were a local population (within a few hundred light years) or that they were in the galactic halo. (Mechanism was not known but several plausible ones existed) (also to be fair it was noted that the _brightest_ burster was probably in the LMC, suggesting theorists might be wrong back then...)  As the Sun is not at the center of the galaxy a halo population should show anisotropy (a local disk population is ruled out completely at this stage) - to avoid the anisotropy you have to push the halo out, the energy then gets large, the mechanism of getting NS out that far becomes questionable, and we should start to see for example the Andromeda's bursters.  The data is consistent with either a Oort cloud distribution (but only just) - but no one can think of a plausible source with the right spectrum. Or, it can be a cosmological distances (hence isotropy) and the edge is \\\"the edge of the Universe\\\" ;-) If at cosmological distances you need very high energy (to detect) and a very compact source (for spectrum), ergo a neutron star colliding with another neutron star or black hole. Even then getting the spectrum is very hard, but conceivable.   If we know anything about physics at that level, the bursters are not due to quantum black holes or cosmic strings, wrong spectrum for one thing.  The situation is further complicated by recent claims that there are two classes of sources ;-)  [in the colliding NS they'd actually probably fit relatively easily into the NS-NS and NS-BH collision scenarios respectively]     my own pet theory is that it's  Flying saucers  entering    hyperspace :-)     but the reason i am asking is that most everyone assumes  that they    are  colliding nuetron stars  or  spinning black holes,  i just wondered    if any mechanism could exist  and place them  closer in.  If you can think of one, remember to invite me to Stockholm...\",\" you can say that again. how does $23 for a new thermostat sound?\",\"    John, The problem here is that you have taken one peice of my response, without bothering to connect it with the other parts.  I have repeatedly noted that one needs to take the problematic historcity of acts and then examine the work of John Dominic Crossan and Burton Mack.  Once you have taken the time to examine recent developments in biblical scholarship, I think you will  grasp more clearly what I am saying.     Certainly this is an issue as I think the situation in Waco shows most  clearly.  If all that is required is that people are willing to die for a belief for it to be true, then surely David Koresh is the son of God.  No, the spurrious arguement that the resurrection had to be true for people to be willing to die must be put to rest.  The other problem is that it is so  monologocentric.  Even if the resurrection was a big deal (which it doesn't seem to have been for either Q, Thomas, or even John to a certain degree) there are a lot of other things which the Early Christians could have been doing together that would have been worth dying for.  It is my belief that even the idea of a mixed race community, which brought down regional/national boundaries in the name of koinonia could have been enough for people to be willing to die.  Radical communties do that (e.g. Jonestown, Waco, Warsaw, etc) But my original point was that roman persecution (which is the only persecution we have documented proof of) was not about whether a carpenter came back from the dead.  Such a claim was not unique nor particularly abhorent to the roman or greek mind.  My point is that avoidance of military and civic duty (i.e. emperor worship) would have been much more problematic -- which has nothing to do with the resurrection at all.  When nero used christians as human  torches to light up his dinner party it wasn't because the believe in a  risen savior, it was because they were supposedly involved in incest and cannablism.  The argument that christians were martyred for the resurrection just cannot stand up to critical examination.\",\"from Dean:  Yes, you're right.

Anybody who plays the way he does, does not belong in the NHL. There have been cheap shot artists through the history of the game, but a lot of them have been talanted players. Bobby Clarke, Kenny Linsemen, Pie McKenzie, Chris Chelios etc.. but nobody has been out right as dirty a cheapshot coward as Ulf. Violence in hockey has got to be curbed and players like (Should have been a Women) Samuelson don't belong. When players like Ulf, who's main purpose is to injure the better players in the league is allowed to continue, and the league won't stop it, the players should. A Christian Pro 1000 aluminum stick directed at his ugly head should do the trick nicely. If the Bruins get a chance to meet Pittsburgh in the near future, you can bet Neely will have his day. The sight of watching Ulf turtle up like the coward he is, is worth almost as much as a Stanely Cup. This wimp of a player almost ruined the career of one the best right wingers in the game. If you are to remove Ulf Samuelson from the lineup, the Penguins would not even notice he's gone. He's an eyesore on the game of hockey. \",\"  While I agree with much of this post, one point seems mis-directed...   And when controlled for usage of oil, gas, etc. energy efficiency in all countries turns out to be identical :-)  To take population density as an example, one way to reduce energy used in transportation is surely to concentrate the population in dense urban areas (though this might, of course, have other disadvantages, possibly even relating to energy use).  The fact that Japan is forced to do this by the nature of the country, while the US is not, does not mean that people in the US would be unable to do this if given sufficient motive to conserve energy.\",\" Imprecise. This description   1. ignores the role of the ballast,  2. misrepresents the heating effects in the starter.  The bimetalic strip cools down immediately after the contacts short circuit, because the neon discharge stops, and much less heat is generated from the I^2R loss in the metal as compared to the neon discharge.  The starter contacts open before the tube fires.  Actually, the tube fires as a result of the back-emf generated in the ballast because of this immediate opening of the starter's contacts.  A capacitor is connected in parallel with the contacts to prevent excessive arcing during the firing.  The neon reionizes but does not draw sufficient current to prevent firing of the tube itself.\",\" Look how long the Maple Leafs and Nordiques used similar logic....  Not that they fielded bad teams solely to field bad teams, but the Maple Leafs (and a certain dead man who was in charge) were one of the cheapest teams in the history of the sport.

They have MAJOR fan problems, namely that on occasion some of them don't make it home from the match!  The soccer fans tend to be fanatical, much like the Montreal fans who firebomb the players and coaches houses when they play pathetically.   -JPC  -- \",\"As of yet, there has been no description of the general principles behind the Clipper proposal. For example, is this a public key system or a private key system? If the latter, then I don't see how the system could work (given that the keys are tied to the device and not the person).  Further, the escrowed 80-bit keys are split into two 40-bit chunks. I would guess that the availability of one of these 40-bit chunks and a reasonable key-search machine, would allow you to read the traffic. I'm not suggesting that this is a deliberate weakness of the system, but it does make you think. Of course, this is easily fixable by  giving out two 80-bit chunks which could be x-ored to generate the  real 80-bit key.\",\"     I've had my Duo 230 for a few weeks now and suffer from both of the above problems. I reinstalled my system software twice in an effort to combat the problems - thinking they were system software problems. Initially reinstalling the system seemed to help but not anymore.

I've called the apple hotline (800 SOS-APPL) three times already and finally they agreed something is astray after my Duo's screen would go dim and the hard drive spun down by itselft and put itself to sleep.

This is in response to a question about the Immaculate Conception.  I explained it, but left justification up to our Catholic readers.  --clh]  There is no direct reference in the Holy Scripture except for the mention of Mary's _blessedness_/full of grace in the \\\"Annunciation\\\" by Angel Gabriel in Luke 1:26-28   And in the 6th month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto  a city of Galilee, named Nazareth.  To a virgin espoused to a  man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's  name was Mary.  And the angel came unto her and said, _\\\"Hail,  thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed  art thou among women.\\\"_  Now, now, hold that line of thought - \\\"the Lord is with Mary & blessed art thou among women\\\" - while you read on....  In the book, \\\"First Lady of the World, A Popular History of Devotion to Mary\\\" by Peter Lappin:  The _Immaculate Conception_ matter is really far more complicated than the _Assumption_.  This arose in 430 AD.  It is quite possible that the feast of _Mary's Conception_ under the title \\\"The Conception of Saint Anne\\\", originally commemorated the _physical miracle_ of a woman _beyond the age_ of child bearing, conceiving a daughter, just as Elizabeth had conceived John the Baptist.  A transfer in emphasis from the physical miracle wrought in Anne to the miracle of grace wrought by God in the soul of Mary was _logical_.  Mary is the incorruptible timber \\\"out of which was hewn the _tabernacle_ of Christ's sinless body\\\"; she is \\\"God's Eden, in whom there is no tree of knowledge, and no serpent that harms.\\\"  Her perfect beauty and spotlessness find their exemplar in Christ, her purity in that of the Father.  At the time of the Council of Ephesus, she was hailed as \\\"innocent, without blemish, immaculate, inviolate, spotless, holy in soul and body, who was blessed as a lily from among thorns, unlearned in the evil ways of Eve\\\". ... At the end of the thirteenth century, an Irish Franciscan, John Duns Scotus (1266-1308),...God maintained that it was a  greater thing for Him to preserve His (the Son) mother from all sin _than to use His power to clease her from it later_. ...  Now let's go to the discussion of baptism and original sin. From \\\"Pocket Catholic Cathechism\\\" by John A. Hardon:  Baptism - Concupiscence Remains after Baptism. Concupiscence or the tendency to sin remains in the baptized but since it is left to provide trial, it has no power to injure those who do not consent and who by the grace of Christ Jesus, manfully resist (Canon 5).  Original gifts of Adam and Eve before their fall: In the light of the foregoing, we see that our first parents were originally gifted three times over: -They had the natural gifts of human beings especially the  power to think and to choose freely. -The had the _preternatural_ gifts of bodily immortality  and of integrity, or the internal power to control desires. -They had the _supernatural_ gifts of sanctifying grace,  the virtues of faith, hope, and charity and the corresponding  title to enter heaven. By their disobedience, they lost the _supernatural and preternatural_ gifts entirely, and were weakened (without losing) their natural capacity to reason and to choose freely.  Baptism restores the _supernatural_ life lost by Adam's sin.  It _does not_ restore the _preternatural_ gifts but gifts as a title to a glorified restoration of our bodies on the last day...  Going back to _Immaculate Conception_ (I am not sure if this interpretation is in any other books but it may be another contribution to the 'puzzle'):  Given the miracle of St. Anne bearing a child at a non-childbearing age, AND Christ was not yet born  AND _there was no baptism yet_ on Mary's birth but STILL, the Angel Gabriel's greetings was: \\\"Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you. Blessed art thou amongst women\\\".  Even Mary was confused about this greeting.  Mary could very well have possessed all of the _treefold original gifts above_ given to our first parents (Adam and Eve before their sin):     Hail Mary (Example of praise given by the Angel Gabriel)     Full of grace (natural, preternatural, supernatural)     The Lord is with you (At those times, God would                 definitely want to be with those He                 has made _blessed_)     Blessed art thou amongst women (that says it all)  At the conception, God made Mary _full of grace and blessed_ as the 'tabernacle' for the coming body of Christ and so,  Immaculate Conception of Mary is true and Mary still has maintained her Immaculate Heart. \",\"First, I thank collectively all people who have given good answers to my questions. In my follow-up to Jason Smith's posting, I will address some issues that have caused misunderstanding:     Yes, to some degree. There was an excellent discussion in sci.skeptic on the nature of scientific work two weeks ago, I hope it did not escape your notice.   The correct word is 'likely'. There is no way to be sure our models and theories are absolutely correct. Theories are backed up by evidence, but not proved - no theory can be 'true' in a mathematical sense.  However, theories are not mere descriptions or rationalisations of phenomena. It is extremely important to test whether theories can _predict_ something new or not yet observed. All successful theories science has come up with have passed this test, including the Big Bang theory of cosmic evolution, the theory of natural selection etc. It does not mean they _must_ be correct, but they are not mere 'best fits' for the data.     Well, yes, if you want to _believe_ in them. This is not what science requires - take a good look at the theory and the evidence, see if the theory has made any successful predictions, and use your reason. Disbelievers are not punished.    This is what puzzles me - why do we need to have faith in _anything_? My fellow atheists would call me a weak atheist - someone who is unable to believe, ie, fails to entertain any belief in God.   Yes, I know that one can't believe without God's help; Luther makes this quite clear in his letter to Erasmus. I'm afraid this does not change my situation.      (deletions)    No, it is not, although it does look like one. This is a true dichotomy, either something exists, or nothing exists. If nothing exists, nobody would ask why. If something exists, it is possible to ask why, but actually no existing being could give an answer.   Imagine, for a moment, that the nobodies in non-existence could also ask: \\\"Why nothing exists?\\\" This is equivalent to my counter-question, \\\"why nothing exists in nothingness\\\".   Now, \\\"why anything exists\\\" is equivalent to \\\"why something exists in somethingness\\\".  _This_ is what I meant with my tautology, my apologies for the poor wording in my previous post.   I do indeed think there probably _is_ no reason for being, or existence, in general, for reasons I stated above. However, they will still leave open the question \\\"why this, and not that\\\", and this is where theistic explanations come in.  Science cannot give reasons for any _particular_ human being's existence.   This is a deep philosophical question - is determinism true, or not? Also, is God deterministic or not? I tend to think this question has no meaning in His case.   If I am for a reason, I've yet failed to see what it would be.  From our perspective, it looks like 'I' exist for truly random reasons. I just rolled two dice - why did I get 6 and 1? How can I believe there is any better reason for my existence?   Yes, I am satisfied with this reason, until I find something better. My 15 years of Christianity were of no help in this respect, I have to admit, but I am patient.    No, it doesn't, but I think an existing God cannot know why He exists, for an answer to this question is not knowable. Of course, this should not be any obstacle to belief in His existence.   It is impossible to know unknowable things. However, the question  \\\"why do I exist, in particular\\\" is _not_ an invalid question - this is not what I said. But from our perspective, it is impossible to tell, and I can't just believe in any given explanation instead of another, especially since I found I was deluding myself.    I think \\\"pre-existence\\\" is an oxymoron. There is no time 'outside' of this spacetime (except in some other universe), and from that  perspective, our universe never was. It exists only for those who are inside it.    No. The validity of the question has to be discussed separately; I think philosophy is of great help here. What can be known, and what is not knowable?   This is a very good question. In trying to answer this, and numerous other questions that bothered me, I finally found nothing to base my faith on.   I think it would be honest if we all asked ourselves, \\\"why do I believe\\\" or \\\"why I don't believe\\\".   Petri \",\"(please respond via email!)  Has anybody actually seen the Tek color space stuff working?  I'm not having any luck with either the xtici editor from export.lcs.mit.edu or with O'Reilly's ftp-able example xcms from ftp.uu.net.  The O'Reilly example fails for almost every set of inputs because XcmsTekHVCQueryMaxV returns a smaller value than XcmsTekHVCQueryMinV does (which makes no sense to me).  The xtici editor fails in XcmsStoreColors, apparently because the mathematical manipulations of the color specs results in invalid values.  So you can't actually edit any colors.

I know it is very contrary to the American NRA ethos of the right to bear arms, but Christians should rely on the strength of God to protect them.  Note that I say *should*.  We are inherently insecure but I feel that that is not proper justification to be armed to the teeth.  A Christian should not have to rely on physical weapons to defend himself.  A Christian should rely on his faith and intelligence. For instance, I have the faith that God will protect me but God also gave me the intelligence to know not to go walking down that dark alley at night.

It is my habit to check my articles before and after their submission for errors.  In my last article I stated:     I was wrong. I admit that I do not have a handle on Greek grammar, and thus confused \\\"kleros\\\", the second to last word in Acts 1:17 as being the plot of land discussed.  In actuality it is \\\"chorion\\\", which is the last word Acts 1:18.  Unfortunately my Greek dictionary does not discuss \\\"chorion\\\" so I cannot report as to the nuances of the word.   I don't know if someone else would have caught this, though I am sure that someone would be able to do so, but I have an aversion to disseminating mistakes, especially when someone else might use that mistake to prove a point\\\"   _____________________________________________________________________   MY REPLY... Vary noble of you Dave.  I didn't want to have to go to x number of sources to show you wrong.  (Although I am researching CHORION a little).   DB... \\\"Of course the only other reference Mr DeCenso has given is Bullinger.  And Bullinger uses such ridiculous exegisis that when I accused Mr DeCenso of actually believing Bullinger, he replied that I misquoted him:   of > my response to see what I REALLY said in my posting of this article.    [Actually Mr DeCenso, you said that there was \\\"benefit\\\" to our argument, in   that it caused to to rediscover Bullinger's exegisis.  I did not realize   that you would find such garbage beneficial, unless you were convinced by   it].\\\"   MY REPLY... Thank you for correcting your restating of my points.   DB... \\\"and Mr DeCenso also replied:     Thus I apologize for thinking that even Mr DeCenso could find such \\\"drek\\\" convincing....he should specify which parts of Bullinger he finds convincing and quit hiding behind a disingenuous mask of \\\"This is what Bullinger believed, not necessarily what I believe.\\\" So which is it Mr DeCenso? Do you find the exegisis convincing or not?)\\\"   MY REPLY... One of my purposes in debating these alleged contradictions with you and others is to diseminate many different views of possible reconciliations raised by various Bible scholars and students alike.  When I present MY VIEWS, I will clearly distinguish them from now on.   DB... \\\"Of course without Archer and Bullinger we find that Mr DeCenso has presented no Greek exegisis at all, and Mr DeCenso has made a big thing about my not referring back to the actual Greek.  Thus we find this demand on his part for quality Greek exegisis to be a hypocritical requirement.\\\"   MY REPLY... Good point.  But in your declaring that these passages are contradictory, you have produced only superficial reasonings and observations. Nor have you dug deeper.  I'm glad you have begun in this post.  I will begin Greek studies on these passages in more depth than I thought necessary, as well.   DB... \\\"It would be appropriate to look at what Mr DeCenso has actually USED as evidence.  Now we know what he claims for a standard, as he has stated it often enough:     But are these actual standards he has used, or simply empty hyperbole.  Let's see, he has used (a), and since he is trying to reconcile it to other passages, we see that he has also used (b).  On the other hand he has presented no use of:   (d) historical context                or (e) historical content                or (f) other pertinent historical info   or (g) cultural context                  or (h) cultural content                  or (i) other pertinent cultural info     or (j) grammatical construction          or even (k) Hebrew and Greek word studies [remember, Archer and Bullinger don't count]   Thus we find his vaunted criteria for exegisis is just empty mouthings.\\\"   MY REPLY... Question:  Do you find such criteria important?  If so, do you plan on starting to use them to the best of your ability, or will you continue to present shallow observations (I don't mean this in a bad way). At this point in our _debates_, I have not found it necessary to present a total exegetical analysis of these passages, since we seem to keep beating around the bush and not getting into the core of the verses.  I do not believe it necessary to use many of the above criteria to refute your arguments re: Judas in Acts and Matthew, but I will do my best from this point on to use several of the above criteria, since you desire me to.  I hope you will also. It will greatly enhance our study of these passages.   DB... \\\"The only thing he has actually used, beyond the passage itself, is any other passage.  Thus Mr DeCenso should be honest and note that most of his list is red herring and his only real criteria seems to be:     MY REPLY... The reason is simple...you are mistating the passages.  You claim that the PASSAGES contradict one another; I do not see the PASSAGES contradicting one another. (1) They may very well be complimentary, as many scholarly sources mention; (2) Matthew may not be presenting Judas' death, as you claim.  But we'll look at your defense of this later.   Also, the \\\"reward of iniquity\\\" in the Acts PASSAGE may not be the 30 pieces of silver in Matthew's PASSAGES.  (Although you have a valiant attempt later at stating why you believe it is).   At this beginning stages in our debates, we are laying some Scriptural groundwork, which will be expanded upon through deeper exegesis.   DB... \\\"Of course the only reason I can see to so drastically reinterpret a passage as he has done with Judas' death, is to make it agree with another passage so that both could be considered correct.\\\"   MY REPLY... One of the reasons I have given a different exegetical view of the passages is that you seem to think the majority of scholarship is wrong in concluding these passages are complimentary.  However, I see no problem in Tony Rose's explanation of Judas' death...   _____________________________________________________________________   HOW WOULD YOU EXPLAIN THE INACCURACY BETWEEN JUDAS HANGING HIMSELF IN MATTHEW 27:5 AND \\\"FALLING HEADLONG HE BURST OPEN\\\" =============================================================   This question of the manner in which Judas died is one with which we are constantly confronted in our travels. Many people point to the apparent discrepancy in the two accounts as an obvious, irreconcilable error. Some have gone so far as to say that the idea of an inerrant Bible is destroyed by these contradictory accounts. However, this is not the case at all. Matthew relates that Judas hanged himself, while Peter tells us he fell and was crushed by the impact. The two statements are indeed different, but do they necessarily contradict each other? Matthew does not say that Judas did not fall; neither does Peter say that Judas did not hang himself. This is not a matter of one person calling something black and the other person calling it white. Both accounts can be true and supplementary. A possible reconstruction would be this: Judas hanged himself on a tree on the edge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom. After he hung there for some time, the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and Judas fell down the ledge, mangling his body in the process. The fall could have been before *or* after death as either would fit this explanation. This possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the valley of Hinnom is examined.  From the bottom of the valley, you can see rocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular. There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom. Therefore, it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks on this way down, tearing his body open. It is important to remember that we are not told how long Judas remained hanging from the tree or how advanced was the decomposition of his body before his fall. Louis Gaussen relates a story of a man who was determined to kill himself. This individual placed himself on the sill of a high window and pointed a pistol at his head. He then pulled the trigger and leaped from the window at the same time. On the other hand, a person could say that this man took his life by shooting himself, while another could rightly contend he committed suicide by jumping form the tall building. In this case, both are true, as both are true in the case of Matthew's and Peter's accounts of the death of Judas. It is merely a situation of different perspectives of the same event.   _____________________________________________________________________   Your only reason for rejecting this is, I believe, your attempt to discredit inerrancy.

DB... \\\"At present though, Mr DeCenso only asks two questions of me:     Actually I find question (1) to be a rather stupid request, but I will answer it because he now restricts himself to two points.  First I would point out that hanging is a very efficient manner for ending a life.  In fact it is a bit of a fluke when someone survives hanging (except in fantasy cowboy movies), and even then it usually referred to as an attempted hanging.\\\"   MY REPLY... I work at an agency that investigates child abuse and neglect.  Today, I got a call re: a child that attempted suicide by hanging himself because his mother is on crack.  He failed in his attempt and is in a child's psych ward at a local hospital.  Hanging attempts are not always successful.   To assume that because most hangings are successful, this one was also is \\\"begging the question\\\", if I may quote you.   [Last night, listening to _The Bible Answer Man_ broadcast, The Christian Research Institute's show, one of the scholars on there used several of these terms that you use.  I am not all that familiar with them.  The man on the BAM show teaches Comparative Religion and Logic.  It was interesting]   DB... \\\"This is so prevalent that, so that to say a man hung himself with no other qualifiers is synonymous with stating that he killed himself.\\\"   MY REPLY... Qualifiers are important at times, as we'll see in an OT passage I'll mention below. Does hanging ALWAYS have this outcome?  Did Matthew, who is the only source we have re: Judas hanging himself, state that Judas died as a result?  To say it's synonymous means it has the same meaning as.  A boy (age 14) hung himself.  But he lived.  This is only one of probably thousands of documented cases we can discover.

Also, is it possible that the sources you read may be wrong, or lying, or deceived in other parts of their books?  If so, should we do, as we have done with Archer, toss them to the side and not value anything they say, including their \\\"interpretation\\\" of the hanging of Judas?  I am sure _you_ would find some errors and maybe even some deception in those sources.   You also noted they \\\"interpreted\\\" the hanging as meaning he died.

[^^^ above, mine] No you can't only conclude this, although, as Tony says, this was a highly probable outcome.  But Matthew does not state death as being a result.   The Greek word is APAGCHO.  Matthew 27:5 is it's only occurrence in the New Testament.   In the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the OT used at the time of Jesus), it's only used in 2 Samuel 17:23 : \\\"Now when Ahithophel saw that his advice was not followed, he saddled a donkey, and arose and went home to his house, to his city. Then he put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died; and he was buried in his father's tomb.\\\"             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   Notice that not only is it stated that Ahithophel \\\"hanged himself\\\" [Gr. Sept., APAGCHO], but it explicitly adds, \\\"and died\\\".  Here we have no doubt of the result. In Matthew, we are not explicitly told Judas died.   Also, there is nothing in the Greek to suggest success or failure.  It simply means \\\"hang oneself\\\".   DB... \\\"But Mr DeCenso, you are more than welcome to disagree and show more reputable                                                                      ^^^^^^^^^ Christian scholars that insist that the hanging was not successful.\\\"   MY REPLY... [^^^above, mine] \\\"Reputable\\\"?  You mean ones that have never erred? As far as   insisting that the hanging was unsuccessful, that can't be done, even by me. ^^^^^^^^^   As I said in an earlier post...   _____________________________________________________________________ Although I still agree with Tony's exegesis as being the most probable explanation regarding Judas' death (taking into account several criteria), I've recently noticed some new things in Matthew.   MAT 27:5-8 Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed, and went and hanged himself. But the chief priests took the silver pieces and said, \\\"It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because they are the price of blood.\\\" And they consulted together and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in. Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.   First of all, notice that the text does not say that Judas died as a result of hanging. All it says is that he \\\"went and hanged himself.\\\" Luke however, in Acts, tells us that \\\"and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out.\\\" This is a pretty clear indication (along with the other details given in Acts - Peter's speech, the need to pick a new apostle, etc.) that at least after Judas' fall, he was dead. So the whole concept that                                                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Matthew and Luke both recount Judas' death is highly probable, but not clear ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ cut. ^^^ _____________________________________________________________________   I also wrote...   _____________________________________________________________________ MY REPLY...   Here we have a stickler, Dave, that I have to say I just recently noticed. Let's look at the passage in Matthew:   MAT 27:4 saying, \\\"I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.\\\" And they said, \\\"What is that to us? You see to it!\\\"   MAT 27:5 Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed, and went and hanged himself.   MAT 27:6 But the chief priests took the silver pieces and said, \\\"It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because they are the price of blood.\\\"   MAT 27:7 And they consulted together and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in.   MAT 27:8 Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.   Notice verse 5...\\\"Then he...went and hanged himself.\\\" Matthew does not say Judas died, does it?  Should we assume he died as a result of the hanging?                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ What does Acts say? ACT 1:18 (Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out.   ACT 1:20 \\\"For it is written in the book of Psalms: 'Let his dwelling place be desolate, And let no one live in it'; and, 'Let another take his office.'   Here we may have a graphic explanation of Judas' death....So, my line of reasoning to dispel your contradiction myth re:the \\\"two\\\" accounts of Judas' death is this...Matthew doesn't necessarily explain how Judas died; he does                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ say Judas \\\"hanged himself\\\", but he didn't specifically say Judas died in the hanging incident.               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ However, Acts seems to show us his graphic demise.  Therefore, there is no contradiction between Matthew and Acts re: Judas' `death'.   .......   MY REPLY... ...we do know from Matthew that he did hang himself and Acts probably records his death.  Although it's possible and plausible that he fell from the hanging and hit some rocks, thereby bursting open, I can no longer assume that to be the case.  Therefore, no contradiction.  Matthew did not say Judas died as a                                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ result of the hanging, did he?  Most scholars believe he probably did, but...? ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ______________________________________________________________________   I quoted all that to show that I highly regard the scholars' explanations, but in looking at the texts initially, we can't assume Judas died.  It is, however, highly probable.                            ^^^^^^   DB... \\\"By the way, while all agree that Judas died from the hanging, the books had different ways of dealing with the contradiction we are discussing.  One simply ignored it entirely and simply referred back to Matthew's version as the correct version in both Matt and Acts.  \\\"The Biblical Knowledge Commentary\\\" suggested the hypotheses that Judas hung and then when he rotted, his belly exploded (which doesn't explain his headlong fall), or that his branch or rope broke, and he fell to his death and his gut gushed out (which doesn't explain how a hanging man, would fall headlong rather than feet first).\\\"   MY REPLY... The outcome of any fall is dependent upon many factors...how high the person was suspended before the fall, any obstructions such as tree branches that may have deviated the fall, how steep an incline of rocky surfaces the victim fell upon, thus possibly rolling or bouncing of several rocks, etc.  In a superficial examination of the Acts passage and the Matthew passage, we are not given a lot of info on the geographical specifics, but Tony in the above quoted post gave us some...   _____________________________________________________________________ A possible reconstruction would be this: Judas hanged himself on a tree on the edge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom. After he hung there for some time, the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and Judas fell down the ledge, mangling his body in the process. The fall could have been before *or* after death as either would fit this explanation. This possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the valley of Hinnom is examined.  From the bottom of the valley, you can see rocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular. There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom. Therefore, it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks on this way down, tearing his body open. _____________________________________________________________________   DB... Now truthfully, I do not see what is comforting about Matthew confusing the source of the Potter's field prophesy, but on the other hand the author is correct: Matthew does make that confusion.  Of course a Biblical inerrantist who claim that every word of the Bible is guaranteed true by God, will have to thereby add one more contradiction to the death of Judas (ie: where the prophesy of the Potter's field came from).\\\"   MY REPLY... Please, when we are done with this study on his death, remind me to discuss this with you.   DB... As to your second question Mr DeCenso, you ask how we could be sure that the money with which Judas purchased the land, was indeed for the betrayal, rather than some other source.  I would point out that in Acts, where it specifically mention \\\"the reward of iniquity\\\" [Acts 1:18], it also specifically mentions what act of iniquity they were talking about (ie: Acts 1:16 \\\"...concerning Judas who was guide to those who arrested Jesus.\\\").  Now I would point out that when the Bible describes an act of \\\"iniquity,\\\" and then immediately discusses \\\"*the* reward of iniquity,\\\" it would be rather inane to suggest that it was an action of iniquity other than the one discussed.\\\"   MY REPLY... Dave, we are getting somewhere, aren't we!   ACT 1:15 And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples (altogether the number of names was about a hundred and twenty), and said, ACT 1:16 \\\"Men and brethren, this Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus; ACT 1:17 \\\"for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry.\\\" ACT 1:18 (Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out. ACT 1:19 And it became known to all those dwelling in Jerusalem; so that field is called in their own language, Akel Dama, that is, Field of Blood.) ACT 1:20 \\\"For it is written in the book of Psalms: 'Let his dwelling place be desolate, And let no one live in it'; and, 'Let another take his office.'   Notice that in verse 16, the word \\\"iniquity\\\" is not used.  Rather, it states that Judas \\\"became a guide to those who arrested Jesus\\\". But the writer DID NOT stop there...vs. 17, \\\"for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry.\\\"  What part did Judas play in their ministry?          ^^^^^^ JOH 12:6 This he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and had the money box; and he used to take what was put in it. JOH 13:29 For some thought, because Judas had the money box, that Jesus had said to him, \\\"Buy those things we need for the feast,\\\" or that he should give something to the poor.   So, now we know what part Judas played - he was a treasurer, per se. Right after Peter stated that Judas played a part in this ministry (treasurer, according to John), THEN Luke adds the parenthetical explanation of \\\"wages of iniquity\\\" - money that should have been put into the ministry, but was stolen by Judas to purchase a field.  I believe this is a better exegetical explanation of what the \\\"wages of iniquity\\\" are.  What do you think, Dave?   DB... \\\"Now since I have given you clear answers (and even references), perhaps you could unequivocally state what type of inerrantist you are (instead of asking me what type I think you are, as you did to Mr Joslin).\\\"   MY REPLY...

That makes them the best method of defense for the citizenry. Not everybody has the time to train with a gladius, you know, but for some reason those who prey on others seem to have more free time.  To extend this a bit further, you need only a certain level of competence to beat another with a range weapon.  Getting in their face with a weapon and winning is much more difficult, and requires more training time the average citizen just does not have.  I've spent a few years practicing with a sword.  I can take the common person armed with one (though self-defense isn't the reason I own one).  My kid sister would have an even chance of beating me, gun vs. gun, with only a month of training.  That makes firearms much better, in our eyes.   Excellent point.  Perhaps you aren't so naive after all?   Taken into consideration in what respect?  Though quite wrong, let's make it a blanket statement for weapons in general.  This has been taken into consideration.  We call use of them aggrivated assault, assault with a deadly weapon, assault with intent to kill, attempted murder, and a whole host of others, and tack on extra prison time.   In Norway I suspect it was about the only weapon available.  You conquered your land (among others) a full millenia before we were thought of, and shortly thereafter weapons weren't quite so common.  I suspect that a few world wars made a difference too, since in times of emergency weapons tend to be turned in or donated to needy causes.  I'm curious, though, were the weapons used in the crimes bought shortly before the crime, or were they aquired by other means?  Any requirements other than just registering the shotgun?   \\\"Come on down to honest Erik's Used Swords!

The time scale and the homogeneous culture are important.  Equally important is a basic philosophical difference in personal versus collective good. In America, the individual is more important than the masses.  Personal liberties are prized above all.  This is, sadly, changing of late, but I trust you notice how this call for freedom makes laws that restrict individuals for little collective benefit hateful to Americans.  I'd hazard a guess that, were America less interested in freedom and personal liberty and more interested in collective good we never would have sent our armed forces anywhere.  One poor effect of this culture we have is that we're looking out for ourselves and it is quite easy to identify with only a small segment of the population.

The Woman is the Church.  Catholics have always called our Church \\\"Holy Mother Church\\\" and our \\\"Mother.\\\"  An example would be from St. Cyprian of Carthage, who wrote in 251 AD, \\\"Can anyone have God for his Father, who does not have the Church for his mother?\\\"  Hence the image of the Church as a woman, holding a Cross and a Cup, which tell of the Crucifxition of Our Lord, and of the power of His Blood (the grail legend, but also, more significantly, it shows that \\\"This is the Cup of the New Covenant in my blood, which shall be shed for you and for many.\\\" (Luke 22.20), the Cup represents the New Covenant and holds the blood of redemption).  The fact that the woman is holding both and is said to have the whole world for her seat, is that the Catholic Church is catholic, that is universal, and is found throughout the world, and the Church shows the Crucifixtion and applies the blood of redemption to all mankind by this spread of hers, thorugh which the Holy Sacrafice of the Mass, can be said and celebrated in all the nations as Malachi predicted in Malachi 1.11, \\\"From the rising of the sun to its setting, my name is great among the gentiles, and everywhere there is sacrafice, and there is offered to my Name a clean oblation, for my Name is great among the gentiles, says the Lord of hosts.\\\"  And so we acknowledge what St. Paul wrote \\\"For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you show the Lord's death until he comes.\\\" (1 Corinthians 11.26)   You are quite right about the identification of \\\"Babylon the Great, Mother of all Harlots\\\" with Rome.

Thus I've never really believed in God and heaven, although I don't actually believe that they don't exist either - I'm sort of undecided, probably like a lot of people I guess.         Lately I've been thinking about it all a lot more, and I wondered how religious people can be so convinced that there is a God. I feel as though I want to believe, but I'm not used to believing things without proof - just as I can't believe that there definitely isn't a God, so I can't definitely believe that there is. I wondered if most of you were brought up by religious families and never believed any different. Can anyone help me to understand how your belief and faith in God can be so strong.          Another question that frequently crosses my mind is which religion is correct?? How do you choose a religion, and how do you know that the Christian God exists and the Gods of other religions don't?? How do you feel about people who follow other religions?? How about atheists?? And people like me - agnostics I suppose. Do you respect their religion, and accept their beliefs as just as valid as your own?? Isn't there contradiction between the religions?? How can your religion be more valid than any others?? Do you have less respect for someone if they're not religious, or if they follow a different religion than you would if they were Christian??          Also, how much of the scriptures are correct?? Are all events in the bible really supposed to have happened, or are they just supposed to be stories with morals showing a true Christian how to behave??          I generally follow most of the Christian ideas, which I suppose are fairly universal throughout all religions - not killing, stealing, etc, and 'Loving my neighbour' for want of a better expression. The only part I find hard is the actual belief in God.          Finally, what is God's attitude to people like me, who don't quite believe in Him, but are generally fairly 'good' people. Surely not believing doesn't make me a worse person?? If not, I find myself wondering why I so strongly want to really believe, and to find a religion.          Sorry if I waffled on a bit - I was just writing ideas as they came into my head. I'm sure I probably repeated myself a bit too.

Robert.  \",\" If you force me to do something, am I morally responsible for it?   Well, make up your mind.    Is it to be \\\"instinctive not to murder\\\" or not?   It's not even correct.    Animals of the same species do kill one another.   Sigh.   I wonder how many times we have been round this loop.  I think that instinctive bahaviour has no moral significance. I am quite prepared to believe that higher animals, such as primates, have the beginnings of a moral sense, since they seem to exhibit self-awareness.   So what?     Are you trying to say that some killing in animals has a moral significance and some does not?   Is this your natural morality>    Are you blind?   What do you think that this sentence means?   \\\"There must be the possibility that the organism - it's not   just people we are talking about - can consider alternatives.\\\"  What would that imply?

I think this is going to be a tough measure to fight, since the Government has invested a lot of resources in developing this high-profile initiative.  They are serious about it now.  It won't be as easy as it was defeating Senate Bill 266 in 1991.  Possible actions to take in response:  1)  Mobilize your friends to to all the things on this list, and more.  2)  Work the Press.  Talk with your local newspaper's science and technology reporter.  Write to your favorite trade rags.  Better yet, write some articles yourself for your favorite magazines or newspapers.  Explain why the Clipper chip initiative is a bad idea.  Remember to tailor it to your audience.  The general public may be slow to grasp why it's a bad idea, since it seems so technical and arcane and innocent sounding.  Try not to come across as a flaming libertarian paranoid extremist, even if you are one.   3)  Lobby Congress.  Write letters and make phone calls to your Member of Congress in your own district, as well as your two US Senators.  Many Members of Congress have aides that advise them of technology issues.  Talk to those aides.  4)  Involve your local political parties.  The Libertarian party would certainly be interested.  There are also libertarian wings of the Democrat and Republican parties.  The right to privacy has a surprisingly broad appeal, spanning all parts of the political spectrum.  We have many natural allies.  The ACLU.  The NRA.  Other activist groups that may someday find themselves facing a government that can suppress them much more efficiently if these trends play themselves out.  But you must articulate our arguments well if you want to draw in people who are not familiar with these issues.  4)  Contribute money to the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR), assuming these groups will fight this initiative.  They need money for legal expenses and lobbying.  5)  Mobilize opposition in industry.  Companies that will presumably develop products that will incorporate the Clipper chip should be lobbied against it, from within and from without.  If you work for a telecommunications equipment vendor, first enlist the aid of your coworkers and fellow engineers against this initiative, and then present your company's management with a united front of engineering talent against this initiative.  Write persuasive memos to your management, with your name and your colleagues' names on it.  Hold meetings on it.  6)  Publicize, deploy and entrench as much guerrilla techno-monkeywrenching apparatus as you can.  That means PGP, anonymous mail forwarding systems based on PGP, PGP key servers, etc.  The widespread availability of this kind of technology might also be used as an argument that it can't be effectively suppressed by Government action.  I will also be working to develop new useful tools for these purposes.   7)  Be prepared to engage in an impending public policy debate on this topic.  We don't know yet how tough this fight will be, so we may have to compromise to get most of what we want.  If we can't outright defeat it, we may have to live with a modified version of this Clipper chip plan in the end.  So we'd better be prepared to analyze the Government's plan, and articulate how we want it modified. \",\"Philadelphia                     1 2 4--7 Buffalo                          0 3 1--4 First period      1, Philadelphia, Recchi 52 (Galley, Lindros) 0:18.

The material in John (I'm not sure exactly what is referred to here, but I'll take for granted the similarity to the Matt./Luke \\\"Q\\\" material) IS different; hence, one could have almost any relationship between the two, right up to John getting it straight from Jesus' mouth.   The version of the \\\"usual theory\\\" I have heard has Matthew and Luke independently relying on Mark and \\\"Q\\\".  One would think that if Luke relied on Matthew, we wouldn't have the grating inconsistencies in the geneologies, for one thing.   This is the part that is particularly new to me.  If it were possible that you could point me to a reference, I'd be grateful.    Because it closes up the gap between (supposed) writing and the existing copy quit a bit.  The further away from the original, the more copies can be written, and therefore survival becomes more probable.     I'm not really impressed with the \\\"theology\\\" argument.  But I'm really pointing this out as an \\\"if\\\".  And as I pointed out earlier, one cannot make these arguments about I Peter; I see no reason not to accept it as an authentic letter.    The best analogy would be reporters talking to the participants, which is not so bad.

From a farm out in Boondock, Saskatchewan or Weedville, Alberta.   The inner city isn't the only place that is poor. I think the biggest barrier to hockey in the inner city is... no ICE to play on.          Stace \",\"Atan):   Well, Napoleon. It is your kind of people who are preventing peace  on the world. First of all, you didn't answer the question I asked at the end of my posting. And then you told me some bullshit throughout your posting which had no positive point about the issue, filled with hatred, and filled with emotions. Why am I doing this?

I'm not a lawyer and I don't even play one on TV, but intuitively there's something wrong with having one's words archived for possible future use against you.  This possibility frightens me more than any of the talk about the Clipper Chip, right to cryptography, etc.   I'm afraid it just might.  -nhy  -- \",\" To answer your irrelevant question, yes a person of color is human, but I still don't know what you mean by human being and you have merely begged the question without responding.  By trying to inject the notion of race into the discussion, you muddy the waters without adding any insight whatever.  The same parallel question could be \\\"Is a polydactyl person a human being?\\\"  You still have not answered what you mean by human being.  Please do so.   You won't answer the question and instead drag in irrelevancies. If you want a definition of human being that does not depend on the vagaries of law, but holds solid whatever the law may rule, provide it for me.   More irrelevancies.  As Larry Margolis pointed out, the law has made special exceptions in order to include fetuses, but does not follow your version of human being.  And as he pointed out, brain death is not a means of determining who has the rights of the living, but rather who has died.  There is a significant difference.  What I am wondering now is, has your argument so failed you that you feel it necessary to drag out irrelevancies and leave the thread you started?  You got answers to your questions when you began baiting me, if you recall, after you had made some ridiculous remarks about Adrienne Regard and, having been corrected, changed the subject with your remarks about having a discussion of substance.  If you really wanted a discussion of substance, why then do you disregard logic and substance in order to toss silly accussations, e.g. \\\"It really doesn't matter to you...\\\" If it matters to you, then why not define human being and seek some substance?  You're not going to convince a logical person of the rightness of your position unless you apply some logic and show some meaning to your words.   As others point out, one is sacrificed for the other depending on which has the better chance at survival.  Again, your analogy fails.  Not precedence, but possession makes a difference here. A woman's womb is indisputably her own.  Also, I see you ignore my statement that you would grant rights to a fetus that would not be granted a born human being.  Was that due to its inconvenience?   Is it?  Please cite a precedent and the basis of the ruling.   You simply assert things without any support.  Your analogy is not accurate and your assertions are unsupported.  Try this on for size.  It is not murder for one Siamese twin to kill the other in the womb.  There.  We now have equal arguments. But the idea is illogical.  For one Siamese twin to kill the other in the womb would likely be to kill itself as well.  The systems are dependent on each other for life.  I'm still struggling to see anything analagous here and failing to do so.   Your argument is from Fantasy Island.  Your comparison is a total failure, as I have demonstrated already, and has no basis in reality, neither legally nor medically.  And for you to assert that it is not a perfect comparison because of the impossible, that of coercion or oppression, is ridiculous.  As I said, you give the analogy too little credit for failure.  On the one hand you start this by saying you want to take a real, rather than a hypothetical, situation, then you fly off into Siamese twins murdering one another in the womb or coercing or oppressing each other in the womb when the reality of the situation you describe in now way matches your version.  As I said before, decisions are made regarding which twin lives and dies in situations where they cannot both survive.  And, furthermore, as I have already said, there is a difference between an equal claim to organs and a claim that is unequal.  You seem to be asserting that a fetus has a claim on a woman's womb.  When the fetus is born, what happens to its claim?  And by what reason do you assert its claim?   You haven't answered the question.  The situations are not analagous.   Again you avoid the question.  Dependence can be transferred, and it is not as slow as you seem to think.   Yes, and I'd hate to have been the one to tell Dr Gunn's children that he was murdered by a religious, \\\"pro-life\\\" fanatic.  Please do try to stay relevant.   Clever comeback.  I congratulate you on the readiness of your wit.  What happened to that claim to bodily organs where life is at stake? Why does this parent now have an indisputable right to his or her kidney when previously the parent did not, by your standards?  What is different about the two situations?  I see I have to spell this out for you since the meaning was too subtle for you.  In the one case you do not recognize a difference between a fetus and a born child (you ask why a born child cannot be abandoned but a fetus can), and in this case you recognize a significant difference between the fetus and born child where the lives of the two are at stake.  You can't have it both ways.  Action and inaction are irrelevant to the principle, but you are wrong about the inaction anyway.  Ask any of the numerous women who post here and have borne children how inactive their pregnancy was.  To have a healthy, live child, a woman does more than hang out, eat as she chooses, plays volleyball like she always did, drinks at parties with her friends, etc.  She behaves very differently, and the provision of her resources to a fetus may be no more voluntary than the beating of her heart, but it is far from inactive.\",\"SOMEONE PLEASE BUY THESE BOOKS!!!!!

Steve, let's say you have the talent and inclination to fix up and resell cars.  Either you've gotten good enough at it in your spare time to bump up against these limits, or you would like to do it full-time but these stupid, arbitrary laws prevent you from starting out small and pulling yourself up.  So I'm protected from a hungry neighborhood competitor willing to take a low profit while working extra hard to fulfill my needs, and you're protected from doing what you want with your life.  Here's what I see libertarianism offering you:  Your money is truly yours; it belongs to you.  You can use it to buy a car. If you use it to buy a car, it is truly your car; it belongs to you.  You can use your money to fix up that car.  Since it is your car, you can sell that car.  Your life is truly yours; it belongs to you.  It matters not if someone thinks that it's \\\"wrong\\\" for you to buy and sell 10 cars within 12 months rather than, say, 9 cars.  They may dissaprove, but it is not their life or their money, it is your life and your money.  My money is truly mine; it belongs to me.  I can use it to buy a car. Perhaps your car.  Perhaps that 10th car, the one that someone, somewhere dissaproves of you selling and, presumably, of me buying.  That someone could go to the government and insist that the government make us stop it.  But the government would be powerless to stop us from doing what we like with our own property, in the abscence of fraud or agression. And it would be powerless to stop us from associating with each other.  This does not seem to me to be a utopian dream, but basic human decency and common sense.  A real grass-roots example of freedom and liberty. And yes, not having a few people acting as our masters, approving or rejecting each of our basic transactions with each other, does strike me as a wonderful way to improve the human condition.\",\":  : I am a Mormon.

Sorry about that.  #8 LARRY DEPALMA  Season: 3rd Acquired: '91-92, free agent from Minnesota Grade:  I (C-/D+)  No netter/fan watching the Sharks, including me, knows where DePalma was at the end of the season; the Sharks appeared to still have his rights, but he wasn't in San Jose, he wasn't in Kansas City, and his name hasn't appeared on the waiver wire.  And that kind of invisibility was prevalent for the most part for DePalma.  After being called up October 30 against the Tampa Bay Lightning, DePalma had an excellent week, scoring 5 points in 3 games while playing good defense.  Unfortunately, the 27-year-old DePalma then disappeared the rest of the way, getting just 3 more points in 15 more games, and generally looked lethargic and uninterested on both ends of the ice.  He then was sent down to Kansas City, walked out from there, and was suspended and later reinstated when it was revealed that he was injured; he then promptly disappeared from the watching eyes of Shark Bytes (as the mailing list is now known to Sharks officials) faithful, and neither the Sharks nor we miss him.  #10 JOHAN GARPENLOV  Season: 3rd Acquired: '91-92, trade with Detroit for D Bob McGill and 8th round   pick in '92 entry draft from Vancouver Grade:  A/A-  After an early slump, Garpenlov was nothing short of inspirational the rest of the way, finishing with 66 points in 79 games, second highest total on the team, as he clicked well with team MVP Kelly Kisio and right wing Rob Gaudreau.  Kisio got most of the credit, but Garpenlov, finishing second in the MVP voting, clearly demonstrated his playmaking and scoring skills, as he was seen making excellent centering passes as well as finishing passes to him by putting the puck past opposing goaltenders, getting a club-high 14 power- play goals.  Contrary to his previous rep, Garpenlov also showed that despite his small size (5' 11\\\", 183 lbs.), he was willing to throw himself around when necessary, albeit not very successful yet.  He also still needs to work on his defense, although he improved tremendously throughout the season, and was actually quite a good penalty killer by the end of the season.  He will be a major key to the offense next year.  #15 DAVID BRUCE  Season: 5th Acquired: '91-92, from St. Louis in expansion draft Grade:  I (?)  After a banner '91-92, when he led the team in power-play goals (10) and was third in total scoring (38 points in 60 games), Bruce was bothered virtually all of this season with a groin injury, which kept him out of the lineup for all by 17 games this season.  Of course, it is difficult to speculate how well he would have done this season had he not been affected by the injury, but the 28-year-old Bruce was effective with a man up or a man short in the Sharks' first season, and was expected to be a strong offensive leader this season as well.  The injury appears serious, which is a shame, because otherwise he may have a much brighter future for now; instead, his future with the Sharks next season appears clouded.  #18 MARK PEDERSON  Season: 3rd Acquired: '92-93, trade with Philadelphia for C/LW Dave Snuggerud Grade:  I (B)  It is difficult for me to understand the Flyers' decision to unload Pederson, after a very good offensive season last season (40 points in 58 games), but after riding the pine early in the season, Pederson was summarily sent to the Sharks in exchange of the defensive-minded Snuggerud, and he finished with 41 games combined with the Flyers and the Sharks.  He was also limited by injuries this season, and this limited his production (17 points).  But when healthy, Pederson appears impressive, with a good scoring touch, good size (and the willingness to throw it around, although he's not considered a physical forward), and good speed.  He also does not appear to be a liability on defense, but the Sharks probably have to wait until next season to see how much, exactly, Pederson can do.  #20 JOHN CARTER  Season: 4th Acquired: '91-92, free agent from Boston Grade:  I (B+/B)  Carter was definitely one of the hardest workers on the team, and the hard work worked wonders, as at times he looked great on ice.  However, although he did look great at times, the fact that he received just 16 points (in 55 games) for his efforts is a sign that there is only so much his hard work can do, and the Sharks confirmed that by sending him to Kansas City with about 20 games left in the season.  Carter, who will turn 30 on May 6, always hussled, but as a result, was sometimes trapped too deep within the offensive zone while forechecking, but he was generally a credit on the defensive end, but he is probably of limited utility in that capacity, and he did not impress offensively, although he was one of the best Sharks at drawing penalties.  He is very unlikely to be back next season.  #28 JEAN-FRANCOIS QUINTIN Season: 1st Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  I (B+/B)  I don't understand why the Sharks didn't let Quintin play any more than the 14 games he played this season.  He was generally hard-working and creating opportunities offensively, and appeared, at age 23, ready for regular NHL duty, at least for a team like the Sharks, finishing with 7 points in those 14 games while not being a defensive liability.  Shoulder injury in training camp before the '91-92 season limited Quintin, the team's leading scorer in exhibition games despite sitting out the final two, to just 29 games with the Sharks and the Blades that season, but he looked impressive.  He should be a solid contender for regular duty next season.  #41 MARK BEAUFAIT  Season: 1st Acquired: 2nd round pick in 1991 supplemental draft Grade:  I (?)  After a all-star season at Kansas City, Beaufait got a cup of coffey with the Sharks late in the season when the Blades knocked down a playoff spot and the Sharks decimated with injuries, playing 5 games and scoring a goal for his only NHL point thus far.  Despite small size (5' 9\\\", 165 lbs.), Beaufait was not shy to throw himself around when necessary, and looked pretty good at times, although it's too early to judge him based on 5 NHL games, in which he played mostly left wing, away from his center position at Northern Michigan and Kansas City.  #42 JAROSLAV OTEVREL Season: 1st Acquired: 8th round pick in 1991 entry draft Grade:  I (?)  Like Beaufait, Otevrel also played away from his normal position when he was up for his cup of tea (7 games) midway through the season.  He was generally very much of a defensive liability, and did not show much offensively either, although that may be more indicative of the lack of ice time he got in those 7 games.  He may need another season to work on his defense, but once his defense is acceptable, he should be ready.  #44 MICHEL PICARD  Season: 1st Acquired: '92-93, trade with Hartford for LW Yvon Corriveau Grade:  I (B-/C+)  The 23-year-old Picard, although he perennially tore up the minors, seems to be close to being out of chances, for some reason, after being acquired by the Sharks but failing to impress the management in 25 games, scoring 4 goals for his only points, and he spent most of the rest of the way in Kansas City. He was not particularly strong defensively, and despite his offensive brilliance in the minors, he has failed thus far to score in the NHL, although he has been given limited opportunities.  He may be the Sharks' bait in the expansion draft.  #45 DODY WOOD  Season: 1st Acquired: 3rd round pick in 1991 entry draft Grade:  I (D+/D, although perhaps I shouldn't give a grade at all)  I have been accused of knocking on Wood too much. :-)  Then, it is probably no surprise to you that I am thoroughly unimpressed by Wood thus far, although 13 games is a small example.  He was generally a nonfactor on offense, was not particularly good defensively, and took too many silly penalties, losing many fights in the process and gathering 69 penalty minutes in those 13 games, projecting to to 446(!) in an 84-game season.  He's not ready, and needs at least another season at KC, where he can work on his fighting skills, if nothing else.  His relatively small size (5' 11\\\", 181 lbs.) does not give much possibility that he can survive, at this stage, as an enforcer.\",\"Windows Shareware Monthly (WSM) is an on-line forum for information about the newest and best Windows 3.x and NT shareware/freeware software.   WSM is a compilation of submissions from shareware/freeware authors in a single Windows .HLP (Help System) file.  All types of software may be submitted for entry in WSM - utilities, applications, games, programming tools, etc.  WSM benefits Windows shareware/freeware authors by allowing them to publicize their software releases, inform users of updated versions, and to increase their installed base of users.  Those searching for specific Windows software will benefit by having a complete list of available software available at their fingertips - complete with feature lists, current prices, and any other relevant information.  Windows software authors may submit entries to Windows Shareware Monthly in the following manner:  1. Compose a short summary of the function of the software.  Include all    special features which are unique to your product and which set it apart    from other programs in the genre.  Be sure to include specific details    such as: the current release version, where the software is available,    how much the registration fee costs, how much disk space is required, any    special requirements (e.g. sound card, or VBRUN200.DLL, etc.), how the    author may be contacted, etc.  Because text is highly compressible, the    summary may be as long as is necessary, however, it is best to keep it    short.  A good guideline is a single screenful of 12-point text at 640x480    resolution.  Order forms and other such addendum may be included if desired.    All submissions whould be in plain text (ASCII) format.  Formatting will    be exactly as it is submitted - I will simply cut and paste text files    into a Help Authoring system.  If you require special formatting     conventions - such as boldface text or italics, or a larger font size,    indicate so CLEARLY within the text file.  For best results, use Windows    NotePad to create the .TXT file.    2. Include up to 100k of Windows-format .BMP (bitmap) screen-shots which    display the workings or special features of each program.  Special cases    (rendering applications for example) which require 256-color bitmaps may    submit up to 250k of .BMP files - all other should observe the 100k limit    and use 16-color format.  For maximum compatiblity with the software which    will be used to create the WSM .HLP file (Stefan Olson's Help Writer's    Assistant for Windows), please save the bitmaps with Windows Paintbrush or    WinGIF.   3. Include a 16-color .BMP of the program's icon (.ICO file).  Many programs    are available to convert .ICO to .BMP format, or Windows Paintbrush may be    used.  The .BMP will be embedded in the summary text.  4. Double-check for spelling errors, formatting corrections, etc.    5. Compress the .TXT file, the .BMP of the program icon, and any additional    .BMPs into a single file using PKZIP (any version).  6. Submit the entry by UUENCODING the .ZIPfile, and e-mailing it to:        DAA7365@TAMUTS.TAMU.EDU     if submitting via the Internet or Compuserve. If submitting via America    Online, send a brief message indicating submission, and append the .ZIP    file, then e-mail to:     DiegoAA  7. If any changes are required, or a new version is released, complete    the above procedures again.  Send all submissions to the @TAMUTS address,    and any comments, suggestions, criticisms, to DAA7365@RIGEL.TAMU.EDU.  All entries received before the deadline will be included in the subsequent edition of WSM.  The editor will not be held responsible for any errors, and we reserve the right to make changes to the entries.  WSM is not limited to shareware/freeware software.  A special area will be devoted to commercially available Windows 3.x and NT software.  Commercial software authors should follow the same steps above, with the exception of the limitations on size - the .TXT file and .BMPs may be as large as required (and as large as is practical for transmission over phone lines).  There is no charge for the publishing of either shareware/freeware or commercial product entries.    Advertisements for computer hardware, software, bulletin boards, etc. may be submitted as well. Again, the same procedures apply, with the exception of the size limitations.  There is no charge for advertising space.  The first ten advertisements submitted each month will be included; subsequent submissions will not be included due to size constraints.  WSM is currently looking for persons willing to devote the time to author columns within WSM.  A C/C++ programing section, a Visual Basic section, and two Windows-specific opinion/advice columns are envisioned.  All work will be on a voluntary basis.  If you wish to aid WSM and author a monthly column on one of the above topics, please send us mail at DAA7365@TAMUTS.TAMU.EDU or DiegoAA on America Online.\",\"     Just a question.

This doesn't mean that environmentalism is wrong, any more than supporting peace in the Middle East is wrong because Jews and Muslims also work for it.    Nonetheless, paganism is certainly on the rise, and we as Christians should address this and look at what draws people from paganism to Christianity.  Like it or not, pagan religions are addressing needs that Christianity should be, and isn't.     I believe that paganism has hit upon some major truths that Christianity has forgotten.  This doesn't mean that paganism is right, but it does mean that we have something to learn from the pagan movement.   First, paganism respects the feminine.  Christianity has a long history of oppressing women, and many (if not most) male Christians are still unable to live in a non-sexist manner.  The idea that God is sexless, or that Christ  could have been a women and still accomplished his mission, is met with a great deal of resistance.  This insistance on a male-dominated theology (and the  male-dominated society that goes with it) drives away many young women who have had to put up with sexist attitudes in their churches.   Second, paganism respects the physical world.  This is an idea with great ramifications.  One of these is environmentalism--respect for our surroundings and our world.  Another is integration of sexuality.  Christianity has a long tradition of calling ALL sexual feeelings sinful and urging people to suppress and deny their sexuality.  This is too much--sex is clearly a part of human experience and attempting to remove it is simply not a feasible option.   Christianity has only begun to develop a workable sexual ethic, and paganism is an attractive option.   I'm not advocating that Christian doctrines (no sex before marriage, etc.) should be changed--just that Christians work toward a more moderate ethic of sexuality.  Denial of sexuality places as much emphasis on sex as unmoderated sexuality, and neither one does much to bring us closer to God.\",\"I've a curiousity --    Whenever a person is put on the 15-day, 30-day or 60-day,   the person is on the list longer than the specificed time    I've seen a person on the 15-day for maybe 4 months last year, I don't  remember what...

I inject on my legs and gut, and prefer the gut.  I can stick it in at a 90 degree angle, and barely feel it.  I'm not fat, just have a little gut.  My legs however, are muscular, and I have to pinch to get anything, and then I inject at about a 45 degree angle,and it still hurts.  The rate of absorbtion differs for subcutaneous and   muscular injections however--so if it's a daily thing it would be best not to switch places every day to keep consistencey.  Although some suggest switch legs or sides of the stomach for each shot, to prevent  irritation.  When you clean the spot off with an alcohol prep,  wait for it to dry somewhat, or you may get the alcohol in the puncture, and of course, that doesn't feel good.  A way to prevent irratation is to mark the spot that you injected.  A good way to do this is use a little round bandage and put it over the  spot.  This helps prevent you from injecting in the same spot, and spacing the sites out accuartely (about 1 1/2 \\\" apart.)  This is from experience, so I hope it'll help you.

That is, ignoring concerns about government intrusions into individual privacy, is the value of easy wiretaps to investigators greater than the cost to the communications industry, and their customers, to support this wiretap technology?    A rough estimate suggests that wiretaps are worth about five million dollars per year to U.S. law enforcement agencies.  (In 1990, 872 U.S. wiretaps led to 2057 arrests, while total police expenditures of $28 billion led to 11.25 million arrests [ref US Statistical Abstracts].) I'm working on estimating this wiretap benefit more accurately, but I'd like to ask hardware experts out there to help me with estimating the costs of the new proposed wiretap technology.

Put another way, the question I'm asking is, what if each police agency that wanted a particular wiretap had to pay for it, being charged their share of the full social cost of forcing communication to be wiretap compatible?  Would they choose to buy such wiretaps, or would they find it more cost-effective to instead investigate crimes in other ways?\",\"Speech by Pete Worden                                                Delivered Before the U.S. Space Foundation Conference                                                             Colorado Springs, Colorado                                                                   April 15, 1993        What a delightful opportunity to cause some trouble.  For providing me this forum I would sincerely like to thank the U.S. Space Foundation.  My topic today is the Single Stage Rocket Technology rocket or SSRT.  By I intend to speak of more.  How to lower the cost and make rapid progress.  SSRT is to my mind -- and I hope to convince you -- the erupting a new rallying cry for our generation in space -- Faster, Cheaper, and Better.       Faster, Cheaper, Better and SSRT represent the passing of a torch from one technical generation to another.  It is a new thing to be sure -- but it is also a relearning of old things from past masters.       When we rolled out the SSRT baby two weeks ago, so called experts told us it violates the laws of physics -- it made no sense.  For example, Dr. Eberhart Rachtin - former president of the Aerospace Corp., said of SSRT in the L.A. Times that it, \\\"defies the best principles of launching payloads into space.\\\"  Well Dr. Rachtin -- you've made us mad!  What are these principles that SSRT defies?       Well I'll tell you.  It violates the principle that you need a giant program office to build space hardware.  It violates the \\\"fact\\\" that it takes 20 years to build something new.  And it violates the truism that you cant do anything significant for less than many billions of dollars.       It took some of the last generation's experts to teach us some new/old lessons.  Werhner Von Braun's first rocket was not a Saturn V.  General Schriever's ICBM's didn't take ten years to demonstrate.  And the X-1 airplane didn't cost $1 billion.       It took one of the great engineers of the 1950's to remind us of these truths -- Max Hunter.  Max, to remind you, was a senior engineer in the Thor IRBM program, and old faster, better, cheaper success story.  Max has been persistent in a vision of a single stage reusable space launch system since the 1960's.  Because he knew it had to be done in affordable steps - Build a little, Test a little.       Next he persuaded us to do a technology demonstration.  We didn't solicit a bunch of requirements -- they'd just change every few years anyway.  [ not included in the speech -- The ALS/NLS has such ephemeral requirements that it would better known as \\\"Shape Shifter\\\" than \\\"Space Lifter.\\\"  We didn't spend a lot money -- this X-Rocket only cost $60 million.  When's the last time we even built a new airplane for that?  And it didn't take a lot of time to build -- McDonnell Douglas completed it in 18 months.  Finally, the government program office consisted of one very over-worked Air Force Major -- motivated in part by the threat that he'd get to ride on it in a strapped-on lawn chair if it ran over cost or schedule.       As I described what SSRT is -- and isn't keep in mind its only a first step.  There are several more steps -- and steps that can easily fail -- before the U.S. can field an SSTO.  But each step should follow the same principles -- a small management team -- a few years technology demonstration -- and a modest budget.       Let me show a few details on SSRT and how it might evolve: (See charts)       I'm embarrassed when my generation is compared with the last generation -- the giants of the last great space era, the 1950's and 1960's.  They went to the moon - we built a telescope that can't see straight.  They soft-landed on Mars - the least we could do is soft-land on Earth!       But we do have an answer.  We can follow their build a little, test a little philosophy to produce a truly affordable and routine access to space.  I know there are nay sayers among you -- those who say SSRT is a stunt.  It needs more thermal protection, the engines are wrong, it would be better to land horizontally, etc, etc.       I say to you -- we'll see you at White Sands in June.  You bring your view-graphs, and I'll bring my rocketship.  If we do what we say we can do, then you let us do the next step.  [ not included in the speech:  If we fail -- you still have your program offices, staff summary sheets, requirement analyses, and decade long programs.]\",\"com    On a DA revolver, you get another try on a misfire.  On a pistol where the trigger does not cock the hammer, like a Jennings, or an Astra M400, or a Glock, a misfire requires the slide be cycled to get the gun  to function.  Rather than a high capacity revolver, think of a Glock as an Astra M400  with no manual safety and a heavier trigger pull.\",\"Has anybody generated an X server for Windows NT?  If so, are you willing to share your config file and other tricks necessary to make it work?  Thanks for any information.\",\" I have the same problem.  I have looked at Motif++, WWL, InterViews, GINA++, and a few variations on the above.  I've also done a cursory examination of Rogue Wave's View.h++.  I like View.h++'s abstractions best of all of the toolkits I mentioned, but the resulting code looks little like Motif, and I have little confidence that this software will catch on or otherwise result in significant longevity for my code.  GINA++ allows you to write code which looks a great deal like Motif and also makes interesting use of inheritance, but the resulting code is almost too Motif-like, and is certainly not significantly less verbose than equivalent C code.  InterViews looks promising, but I haven't found a free version with Motif support, and I'm not confident how widely InterViews with Motif support will be adopted, and what (if any) specific Motif support will be available over time.  The other libraries produce code which is less Motif-like, but which does not make sufficient use of the features of C++ to simplify my coding task.  At this point, my inclination is to write my Motif manipulation routines in C, and invoke those routines from my C++ code using simple abstractions suited to my specific task.  Later, if OSF or some credible standards-setting body comes up with a C++ interface to Motif, I will change to that.  It does me no goo to write in C++ if my choice of interfaces leaves me with code which leaves me tied to an abstraction which is not consistent with the industry directions.  It's better to take a standard if inferior solution for now than to go with a slgihtly superior approach which will leave me with both useless code and useless skills a few years from now.  Views.h++ is the only library I'd consider right now, but in our environment, we'd end up spending nearly $5000 to use it, and I can't justify it when it's likely to cause short-term productivity decreases as we learn the new abstraction, and is unlikely to be a sufficiently long-lived solution for us to reap the benefits at the high end of the J curve.  - Brad\",\" How exactly would Ferreira accomplished this?

The article starts with \\\"A leader of the NASA team in charge of redesigning the planned space station said yesterday the job is tough and may be impossible.\\\" O'Connor is quoted saying whether it is possible to cut costs that much and still provide for meaningful research \\\"is a real question for me.\\\" O'Connor said \\\"everything is fair game,\\\" including \\\"dropping or curtailing existing contracts with the aerospace industry, chopping management of the space station program at some NASA facilities around the country, working closely with the Russian space station Mir, and using unmanned Titan rockets to supplement the manned space shuttle fleet.\\\"  O'Connor says his team has reviewed 30 design options so far, and they are sorting the serious candidates into three categories based on cost.  The Post says O'Connor described the design derived from the current SSF as a high cost option (I believe Kathy Sawyer, the Post writer, got confused here. I listened in on part of O'Connor's briefing to the press on Monday, and in one part of the briefing O'Connor talked about how the White House wants three options, sorted by cost [low, medium, and high]. In another part of the briefing, he discussed the three teams he has formed to look at three options [SSF derivative @ LaRC, modular buildup with Bus-1 @ MSFC, and Single Launch Core [\\\"wingless Orbiter\\\"] @ JSC. Later, in response to a reporters question, I thought I heard O'Connor say the option based on a SSF redesign was a \\\"moderate\\\" cost option, in between low & high cost options. Not the \\\"high cost\\\" option as Sawyer wrote).  The article goes on to describe the other two options as \\\"one features modules that could gradually be fitted together in orbit, similar to the Russian Mir. The other is a core facility that could be deposited in orbit in a single launch, like Skylab. That option would use existing hardware from the space shuttle - the fuselage, for example, in its basic structure.\\\"\",\"patrickd@wpi.WPI.EDU (Lazer) writes ...  Specs for the 68040 can fill a 500 page book.  Some highlights are... 32-bit address space w/ 32-bit data width.  18 32-bit integer registers  & 8 80-bit floating point registers.  8K copyback capable caches, 4-way set associative.  Typical 1.2 clocks/integer instruction.  5 clocks for a floating point multiply.  (interesting aside: the 68040 can multiply two 80-bit floating point numbers in less time than it can multiply two 32-bit integers)   More of the same but with multiple instruction dispatching.  Figure about 0.8 clocks per instruction typical (my guess).  But the Motorola guys are pretty bright, it may be less.   Call Motorola.  I'm not typing it all in.

Version 4.99c (actually beta v5.0) can be found anonymous ftp from hagar.ph.utexas.edu, in the pub/plplot  directory.    --Mark  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------    From the README file of version 4.99c:   This is the PLPLOT distribution.  PLPLOT is a scientific plotting package for  many systems, small (micro) and large (super) alike.  Despite its small size  and quickness, it has enough power to satisfy most users, including: standard  x-y plots, semilog plots, log-log plots, contour plots, 3D plots, mesh plots,  bar charts and pie charts.  Multiple graphs (of the same or different sizes)  may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each graph.  Different  line styles, widths and colors are supported.  A virtually infinite number of  distinct area fill patterns may be used.  There are almost 1000 characters in  the extended character set.  This includes four different fonts, the Greek  alphabet and a host of mathematical, musical, and other symbols.  The fonts  can be scaled to any size for various effects.  Many different output device  drivers are available (system dependent), including a portable metafile  format and renderer.   The PLPLOT package is freely distributable, but NOT in the public domain.  The PLPLOT source code, except header files and those files explicitly  granting permission, may not be used in a commercial software package without  consent of the authors.  You are allowed and encouraged to include the PLPLOT  object library and header files in a commercial package provided that: (1) it  is explicitly and prominently stated that the PLPLOT library is freely  available, and (2) the full copyrights on the PLPLOT package be displayed  somewhere in the documentation for the package.   We welcome suggestions on how to improve this code, especially in the form of  user-contributed enhancements or bug fixes.  If PLPLOT is used in any  published papers, please include an acknowledgment or citation of our work,  which will help us to continue improving PLPLOT.  Also, please remember that  as PLPLOT is not a commercial product, we cannot be expected to offer the  kind of support that a commercial product may.  There is great interest  in extending PLPLOT and fixing bugs, but the principal authors can only  afford to work on it part time.  Improvements will necessarily focus on  those which help us get our work done.   PLPLOT is written in C, enabling it to run on many platforms practically  without modification.  Fortran programs may use it transparently; stub  routines are provided to handle the C<->Fortran interface without any  modification of the user program.  C programs are required to include the  header file \\\"plplot.h\\\"; see the documentation for more details.   The main documentation for PLPLOT is in the doc/ directory in the form of  several TeX files; please consult this for additional information ('latex  plotdoc').  Unfortunately documentation tends to lag actual improvements to  the code, so don't be surprised if some known features are not explained  there.  Consult 'Changes.log' to see a list of recent changes.     At present, PLPLOT is known to work on the following systems:    Unix: SunOS    A/IX     HP-UX    Unicos    DG/UX    Ultrix    SysV    Linux    Amiga/Exec   MS-DOS   OS/2   NeXT   For more information on how to get or use PLPLOT on your system, see:   - appendices to the PLPLOT manual   - system-specific documentation in the appropriate sys/<system> directory.

Brian, why another excuse?    Peter wrote a bit of the Bible.  What Peter says about God is what the Bible says.      Consider the Bible a court recording.  Over the period of thousands of years, various people come up and testify of their experience with the living God.  Up comes Abraham the wealthy rancher.  Up comes Moses, once the high official of Egypt.  Up comes Elijah, a priest.  Up comes David, a mere shepherd who became King.  Up comes the pagan King  Nebuchanezzar.  Up comes the pagan King of Persia, Cyrus.  Up comes Nehemiah, cupbearer to the King of Persia.  Then Matthew, an IRS agent takes the stand.  Up comes Luke, an M.D.  Then Paul a Jew who use to kill Christians for fun.  Up comes John, a 17 year old boy.  Up comes Peter, a fishermen.  Up comes James, the brother of Jesus himself. Up comes hundreds of others.  You hear testimony from fishermen, IRS agents, priests, Kings.  The court hearing lasts thousands of years with people coming up and testifying about the God who calls himself \\\"I am.\\\"   While you are listening to all this stuff, you realize that King David could have never known John, Solomon could have never known Matthew, Nehemiah could have never known Peter.  You realize that all these people are independent witnesses, and so, you rule out collaboration.  Yet all of the witnesses tell of the same God.   Each testifier tells of his own experiences with the living God.  Each experience is different, but each experience has enough cross-over to unmistakenly reveal that each one of these people is talking about the very same God. What Daniel did not know about God, the 3rd Highest Official of Babylon, God revealed to John 600 years later--but with a different perspective.  No two testimonies are identical.  Each testimony dares to venture off what is already known.  Yet each witness's testimony, even though different from those prior, consistently describes harmoniously fitting facets of the character of the same God.    Now.  As we stare gazing at the computer, you got this seeming fanatic on the other end of the net, saying, I know this God  \\\"I am\\\".  He has revealed himself to me too.

I've never seen one that specifically provides the info that Davis insists that he has, so I'd love to have a cite.   Wrong.  There's one gun design where that can happen, and it is supposed to be carried with the hammer over an unloaded chamber. (Cocking the gun turns the cylinder so that a loaded cylinder is under the hammer.  In other words, it can be usefully carried in a safe manner.)  Other handgun designs don't have that property; if their trigger isn't pulled, the hammer can't hit the firing pin.   The breakdowns that I do have include the above category.  From them I can safely say that if Davis is right in ALL of his claims, a large negative number of people are killed by animals, because we know that the number of killings by wackos is reasonably large and that the number of accidents due to gun failures (which is a superset of the described circumstance) is near zero.   Please do.  Include a cite for those of us who like looking at context.  Make sure that your source excludes other types of accidents and suicides that are misreported.

Have you ever asked a physically blind person why he or she follows a seeing eye dog? The answer is quite simple--the dog can see, and the blind person cannot.   I acknowledge, as a Christian, that I am blind.  I see, but I see  illusions as well as reality.  (Watched TV lately?) I hear, but I hear lies as well as truth.  (Listen to your  radio or read a newspaper.)  Remember, all that tastes well is not healthy.  So, I rely one the one who can see, hear, and taste everything, and knows what is real, and what is not. That is God.   Of course, you may ask, if I cannot trust my own senses, how do I know whether what I see and hear about God is truth or a lie.  That is why we need faith to be saved.  We must force ourselves to believe that God knows the truth, and loves us enough to share it with us, even when it defies what we think we know.  Why would He have created us if He did not love us  enough to help us through this world?   I also do trust my experiences to some extent.  When I do things that defy the seeming logic of my experience,  because it is what my Father commands me to do, and I see the results in the long term, I find that He has led me in the proper direction, even though it did not feel right at the time.  This is where our works as Christians are important:  As exercises of the body make the body strong, excercises of faith make the faith strong.     As for you, no one can \\\"convert\\\" you.  You must choose to follow God of your own will, if you are ever to follow Him.  All we as Christians wish to do is share with you the love we have received from God.  If you reject that, we have to accept your decision, although we always keep the offer open to you.  If you really want to find out why we believe what we believe, I can only suggest you try praying for faith, reading the Bible, and asking Christians about their experiences personally.  Then you may grow to understand why we believe what we do, in defiance of the logic of this world.

They may say they are \\\"Christian\\\" but do their actions speak differently?  Do you believe what everyone tells you?  I don't.  I came to believe in God by my own investigation and conclusions. And ultimately by my own choice.  Salvation, however, was granted only through the grace of God.   To be a Christian is to model oneself after Jesus Christ as implied by the very name Christian.  If you say you believe in your head but do not feel in your heart, what does that say of your belief?   White supremists and Neo-Nazis are NOT any brand of Christian.  \\\"If you hate your whom you can see then how can you love God whom you cannot  see?\\\"  What does this belief entail?  Believing in Christ and having your sins forgiven in His name does NOT give a Christian a free licence to sin.  To repent of a sin is to ask forgiveness of that sin and TRY NOT to do it again.  I am a Christian, but if you lump me in with racists and accuse me of being such, then are you not pre-judging me?  BTW, I am of Chinese racial background and I know what it is to be part of a visible minority in this country.  I don't think that I would be favourably looked upon by these White supremist \\\"Christians\\\" as you call them.

They can do as they do and hide behind Christianity but I tell you that Jesus would have nothing to do with them.   No arguement there.   The only point I'm trying to make is that those who call themselves Christian may not be Christian.  I ask that you draw your own conclusions by what they do and what they say.  If they are not modelled after the example of Jesus Christ then they are NOT Christian.

The point that Darren raises is a very Lutheran viewpoint.   While reason is a gift from God, it is also infected by sin. Yet we do not reject reason entirely--and neither, I think,  does Darren.  We need reason, as Darren himself has pointed out, to comprehend God's revelation of himself in the Bible. But reason alone is not sufficient to comprehend and believe the Word.  We need, first and foremost, faith.  For \\\"the sinful mind is hostile to God.  It does not submit to God's law, *nor can it do so*\\\"  (Romans 8:7).  Luther accepted Scripture as the sole means of revelation (\\\"Sola Scriptura\\\"), but accepted the necessity of the use of reason (with faith) in comprehending that revelation. Yet Luther also said, regarding baptism, \\\"But mad reason rushes forth, and, because Baptism is not dazzling like the works which we do, regards it as worthless.\\\" (Large Catechism, Fourth part, Baptism).  To make matters more complicated, Luther was the sort of theologian that many  people would describe as an `absolutist'.  I've seen him  described as a `take no prisoners' theologian.  We might conclude, given these observations, that Luther was inconsistent or mad.  And surely at least some have come to that conclusion.  But it might be useful to recall that Jesus was also called mad.  And Peter felt compelled to defend himself and the apostles against a charge of drunkenness on Pentecost.  So we as Christians ought to be careful about rejecting Luther (or others)  as mad.  Rather, we should imitate the Bereans, who examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true (Acts 17:11).  The basis for the confidence with which Luther, Peter, Paul, and many others preached the gospel was not just reason, but faith and the Holy Spirit.  This is not faith divorced from reason, but a faith that guides, informs, and uses reason.  The Spirit enables us to know the truth and to proclaim it boldly.  God does not want us to preach the message that \\\"I think that Jesus might have risen from the dead\\\" but rather \\\"I know that my redeemer lives!\\\"  (Job 19:25).  The Christian does not side with Pilate in saying \\\"What is truth?\\\" but rather follows Christ, who said, \\\"In fact, for this reason I was born, and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth.  Everyone on the side of truth listens to me\\\" (John 18:37).  We can know the truth because God has promised us that we can know the truth.  Jesus said, \\\"If you hold to my teachings, you are really my disciples.  Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free\\\" (John 8:31,32).  The Proverbs urge us \\\"Buy the truth, and do not sell it.\\\" (Pr 23:23). The Psalmist prayed \\\"Do not snatch to word of truth from my mouth\\\" (Ps 119:43).  Evidently he believed that the word of truth was in fact `in his mouth'.    Yet we do indeed appear arrogant if our claim to the truth is motivated by self-glorification.  But if we present the truth as the teachings of Scripture, revealed by the  Spirit, and not our own invention, and if we stand ready to be proved wrong on the basis of Scripture, as Luther did, then we are not arrogant, but humble.  We should humbly trust in God's promise of truth, just as we trust in his promise of forgiveness.  REXLEX> It is only because of God's own revelation that we can be  REXLEX> absolute about a thing.  Darren> But how far does that get you?  Once God's revelation stops, Darren> and your own reasoning begins, possibility for error appears.  I agree that we must make a distinction between the clear teachings of Scripture, and the products of our own reason--even when such reasoning is based on Scripture.  However I think I would draw the line of distinction more `reasonably'  :-)  and less `academically' than you would.  Darren> For example, let's suppose that our modern Bible translations Darren> include a perfect rendering of Jesus words at the Last Supper, Darren> and that Jesus said, exactly, \\\"This is my body.\\\"  Darren> We'll presume that what he said was totally without error and Darren> absolutely true.  What can we be certain of?  Not much.  Darren> At the moment he stops speaking, and people start Darren> interpreting, the possibility of error appears.  Did he mean Darren> that literally or not?  We do not have any record that he Darren> elaborated on the words.  Was he thinking of Tran- or Con- Darren> substantiation?  He didn't say.   Darren is almost at the point of making a very Lutheran statement about the Lord's supper.  The Lutheran approach is to say that if Jesus said, \\\"This is my body,\\\" then that is what we should believe.  Other interpretations are rejected simply because they are not taught in Scripture.  Recall that Jesus' words do not stand alone on this subject.  We also have Paul's words in 1 Corinthians 11:17-34,--in which he passed on to us, what he received from the Lord.  In particular he said, \\\"For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.\\\"  By these words we should believe that the bread that we eat in the Lord's Supper really is bread (as well as the Lord's body)--as our senses in fact tell us.  Does this *prove* that tran-substantiation is false?  I suppose someone could say that Paul spoke metaphorically of the Lord's body as bread, simply because that is the way the body appears when we eat it.  But this thought is found nowhere in Scripture.  So we reject it.  Thus the primary reason for rejecting tran-substantiation is not that we can prove it false, but that it is simply not found in Scripture.  [side remark] I've been told that the Lutheran doctrine on real presence is con-substantiation.  But it has been non-Lutherans who have told me this.  We tend not to use the word.  I almost think that this is used more by professors of comparative religion, who need labels to compare Catholic, Lutheran and Reformed teachings on the Lord's Supper.  But almost every church wants to call their own teaching \\\"real presence\\\" because that was the traditional teaching of  the church. [end side remark]  Darren> When Christians speak as if they believe their own reasoning Darren> can never lead them astray -- when we implicitly claim that we Darren> are infallible -- the non- Christians around us rarely believe Darren> that implicit claim.  Witnessing is hardly going to work when Darren> the person you are talking to believes that you are either too Darren> foolish to recognise your own limits, or intentionally trying Darren> to cover them up.  This is precisely why Christians should not rely on rationalizations in their witnessing.  It is far better to take the approach, \\\"I'd like to show you what Scripture says.

For example, incorrect English constructs such as \\\"its raining\\\" or \\\"it's window id\\\" annoy me. However, there comes a time when popular usage starts to dictate the way things really are in the world. Indeed, the fact that X won out over NeWS was really down to popular opinion (I know, we all think it's(!) technically superior as well!).  On a related topic, who is to say that \\\"color\\\" is more or less correct than \\\"colour\\\" - being Irish, and hence using English English as opposed to American English, I always use the latter except, of course, for API terms such as \\\"XAllocColor\\\" and \\\"colormap\\\".  In a world that uses the term \\\"Windows\\\" to refer to Microsoft Windows, perhaps the time has come to accept \\\"X Windows\\\" as a valid term for X. I think that this is a more concise and uncluttered term than, say, \\\"the X Window System\\\" and, let's face it, almost everyone uses it. Ultimately, we all need product sales to more than just X-literate people. In this respect, product recognition is important and a short, snappy, descriptive title (\\\"X\\\" is positively obscure) will help when dealing with the average punter (it's sad - I thought I was a software engineer!). Indeed it is unfortunate that X did not become popularly known as Windows and let MS worry about whether it should be called \\\"Microsoft Windows\\\" or \\\"the Microsoft Window System\\\" or how about just plain \\\"Microsoft\\\"!  To summarise (or should that be \\\"summarize\\\") the point of this message: I think there are far more pressing issues facing the X community than worrying about subtle distinctions in the naming of the window system (or should that be \\\"windowing system\\\"). Whatever gets recognised is fine by me. I agree that one should be careful in interpreting what trade papers say. However, I would be reluctant to come to this conclusion purely on the basis of how they name the X Window System. \",\"the blood of the lamb.

Thanks !  \",\"  Here at Lewis and Clark College we have recently installed a Digital Film system (based on the Mac Quadra) that does non-linear, full digital editing.  If you're considering such a system, here are the pros and cons:  For the educational environment, this system is excellent.  We use it to produce a variety of educational materials for disemination on our local network.  Because this programming is going to be viewed on other Macs, the image quality is not as important as the ability to directly export the video to the Net.  We also use it to produce orientiation and promotional video programs for use by the Lewis & Clark community.  Since these programs are not meant for commercial or broadcast use, image quality is not critical.  The Digital Film system, for those of you who are uninitiated, is an A/B roll digitizing system on one $5000 JPEG compression card.  It was promoted as an inexpensive online editing system with SVHS quality.  SuperMac, the maker of the card, is trying to achieve this quality level, but as yet, has been unable to deliver.  Our system produces \\\"near VHS\\\" quality at 30 fields per second (640x480 overscan).  The card repeats every other field to get 60 fields per second.  This results in a kind of Super 8 film look that some find distracting.  If you can get past this problem, you'll find the Adobe Premier editing  software quite enjoyable with which to work.  It produces thousands of different effects from crystalize filters to DVE transitions to color matting.  Because of its non-linear nature, editing is fast and easy.

The all pertain to opportunites for abuse, and conclusions based on what I have seen the membership of this group (except for two notable persons) agree to.  If anything bad is possible by the government in theory, it almost always ends up happening in fact.  So the key is to make abuse IMPOSSIBLE.  Question authority, and remember power DOES corrupt.  I think one has to regard this whole idea in the sense that it WILL be expanded to include other data forms, such as data transfer and stored data. and as such should be treated as if it were expanded (or such expansion will be almost impossible to stop, using Clipper as a precident). There was a hint of that in the proposal, remember.  That said, please bear with me, I am not very articulate, so I take more words to say what others could say much more briefly.  Thank you.   As I suggested this is NOW.  The hint is in the proposal that this or similar proposals are being considered for other forms of encryptions such as data transfer, data files, and such, largely dependent on how this thing is accepted or flies.  I think one would be wise to treat this in the manner one would when (not if) it gets expanded to other areas than cellular phones.  I think this is guaranteed to happen, if this proposal gets by.  Salami politics.  It has been and is used in several other areas, it is certain to be used here.  Government is not going to easily give up on the idea that they should be able to eavesedrop whenever they want to.  'Court order required' has proven to be a rather flimsy guarantee.  If the case warrants, they can always sieze the material, and force one to give the key, or sit in jail forever on periodically renewed contempt charges.  So it is not denying the justice system the information, nor the ability to lock someone up if guilty (or refuses to divulge the means to access the info - this is not protected under the Fifth - one can be forced to perform ACTS that would result in divulging incriminating evidence).  So, blocking restrictions on private encryption is not preventing LEGITIMATE law enforcement - it does make ILLEGITIMATE law enforcement a bunch more difficult.  Especially fishing expeditions without the target's knowlege.  Don't give up the right to be safe from that - that should be non-negotiable, and Clinton and Co. know it (which is probably why they quietly developed this thing, figuring if they get it this far, they can ram it on through).  How come those consulted could be roughly described as \\\"us insiders\\\"?  They cannot quietely IMPLIMENT it though, when they ban other schemes to ensure its exclusive use.  Hence the nice PR document to try and reassure everyone. Don't buy into it.  Has government really earned that kind of trust, past or future?  To be secure and free, one must keep government honest and the only way to do that is to make abuse IMPOSSIBLE, not 'unlikely' or 'difficult'.   So what?  One could use information gained by re-use of the keys (saved after the last case was finished) or other means (master key, backdoor, easily broken algorithm) to find other evidence which, given to a judge, would authorize a tap which wouldn't have been possible otherwise.  This has been the more common manner of abuse of wiretaps in the past...  For local cops, this might be workable to keep them honest, but the Feds have a workaround somehow, BET on it.  Does anyone really believe for example, that the government will use a scheme NSA cannot listen in on scanning for keywords - either easily defeated in realtime or via a 'master key'?  I sure don't.  This whole thing sounds like something to eliminate the need to use old-fashioned police work to build a case.  In the past, eavesdropping was rather easy (with or without a court order).  I think the Law Enforcement community has become a bit spoiled, and will resist changes that require them to revert to using old-fashioned detective work.  I just find it somewhat surprising coming from a bunch that cares so much about civil and individual rights, that \\\"puts people first\\\".  The question is \\\"put people first\\\" to WHERE?  With the innards not being revealed, how is one to be sure there DOESN'T exist a 'master key' for use by NSA, etc (so they can do their keyword scan, etc on conversations they routinely monitor, without a specific court order)?   Remember, the cellular phone limitiation is only TEMPORARY. Bet on it.  And so far I have not heard about police telling people that they have been tapped and nothing incriminating was found.  What is to keep them from simply keeping the keys on file for 'next time'? After awhile, they would have quite a collection.  Kept especially for folks they deem 'disruptive'.  And if they get only one key, that would reduce the search space a lot, unless it is an RSA scheme.  Remember Nixon years?  Need for court orders really slowed them down, didn't it?  And unless the escrow accounts are not government controlled (fat chance! I see one ending up being under, say Treasury, the other under Justice :-)) it could be worth some serious bucks to some folks to get keys to a competitor's Clinton Clipper (or descendent when this idea is expanded to be used for all non-government encryption).  Enough bucks would get one the keys or the innards for this algorithm.  Perhaps not an important concern, but given past government behavior and the other problems...   What will one do when it is expanded to data storage encryption?  You can BET that if Clipper is accepted, that will be next on the agenda. It is even hinted at in the proposal - read it carefully...  Expect the argumet \\\"well, if you got nothing to hide...\\\"  Fine. Then using that argument, one should not object to video cameras being installed in every room of one's home.  Granted - an exteme expansion of the idea but the principle holds.  Private stuff should remain private, even from a govt fishing expedition.  And laws/rules may change in the future as to 'safeguards'.  When it comes to the Fed Government, safeguards are pretty meaningless, if they want to do/get something.  Don't work so hard to give up some rather treasured rights, or establish bad precidents, please.  The price could be hell to pay, later.   People would fight laws forbidding more NOW, but in, say two years, because we have this 'crisis' situation which MUST be addressed by some 'drastic action', just this added reasonable restriction will only bother those who have someting to hide... etc.  Please don't buy into it.  If the Clinton Clipper is so very good, why not make its algrithm public so many people can exchange ideas and examine it, rather than a few isolated 'respected experts' (respected by whom?  for what?  Perhaps a certain professor who likes key banks would be one of the selected experts... this does seem to expand on some ideas the person was advocating, if I recall :-).  How would anybody know that what the experts examine is the same as what will end up being used in the Clipper Chip, if it is kept secret?   Perhaps the Clipper will use a crippled version (with a 'master key' provision), or features not present in the version subjected for study and evaluation by the experts.  And who chooses the expertes?  The government?  No conflict of interest there... :-)  And isn't it a REQUIREMENT for any decent encryption scheme that it NOT have its effectiveness reduced by having the algrorithm widely known? I was lead to believe that one should assume the other side has everything you have, except for the key(s)... I recall ideas presented to this group are rejected if a requirement exists the algorithm be secret...

The excuse that other countries have these restrictions is not acceptable:  Other countries do not have our Bill of Rights and Constitution (which the people, not the governments, of those other countries often regard with envy - what we have as rights they have as revokable privileges).  And if we expect to retain those rights and protections, we must not allow them to be gutted because we just GOTTA have this thing to 'fight crime'.  We have allready have our Bill of Rights pretty much torn to shreds.  We should not permit more weakining for yet another 'noble cause', instead we should be trying to repair the damage.  Our crime problem may have a number of causes, but \\\"too many rights and safeguards\\\" is not a signifigant one.  A broken court system and poor police work are a much more signifigant cause as having \\\"too many rights\\\" (disregarding addressing the root causes for crime, etc).  BTW - those who suggest that this is just an attack on Clinton, believe this:  I would be going ballistic reagardless WHO seriously proposed this thing.  It is just another step in a gradual erosion of our rights under the Constitution or Bill of Rights.  The last couple of decades have been a non-stop series of end-runs around the protections of the Constitution.  It has to stop.

Thanks for any comments. \",\" I don't know the exact meaning of UART, but I think it is something like Universal Arithmetic Receiver Transmitter. Normally, the older boards have a 8250 or 16450 UART on board. Those chips generate an IRQ for every char they received. The 16550 UART has an internal 16 byte buffer, so - with the right software installed - it generates an IRQ every 16 chars.    If you ran dos, you don't need a 16550, because dos runs only ONE task at a time and the whole cpu-power could be used for the transfer. But if you are running a multitasking OS such as OS/2, Unix, etc. ( windows ? :-) ), the cpu cannot work the whole time with one task.   The result are lost characters or broken transmissions because of timeouts.   NO. The only diffrence is that internal modems have the UART on board, whereas external modems are connected to the computer over a serial port which has the UART on board.   I use a Zyxel1496B with a 16550UART under COHERENT 4.0. I'm very satisfied with it but I think that nearly everyone is satisfied with his own modem.

Anyway...)   The basis for our (the catholic church's) belief in the assumption of Mary, body and soul, into heaven is that, to put it simply, the apostles  and all the early generation Christians believed it.  In fact, throughout their ministry the apostles kept in close contact with Mary, and 11 of the 12 were present when she died.  Only Thomas was missing--when he arrived several days later, he asked to be shown her body, and moved with pity, Peter and several of the other apostles brought him to her tomb.  When they arrived the seal was still unbroken.  They broke the seal, entered, and the body was missing.  There was no sign that anyone had entered, forcibly or otherwise, and everything else was laid out exactly as it had been left.  The apostles present all believed that Mary was assumed into heaven--and the apostles TAUGHT this in their   preaching (of course, this does not appear in any of the texts currently  considered part of the bible, but it does appear in other writings left behind by several of them.)  Basicaly, as an apostolic church (ie. founded by the apostles), we believe that the teachings of the apostles, whether written down in the bible or written down in other sources, is true, providing that the authenticity of those other sources can be confirmed.  At least in the case of the assumption of Mary, the authenticity is quite clear.\",\" Could it be Public Missile, Inc in Michigan?  From the description of ad here, it sounds like they're talking about \\\"High Power Rocketry\\\", an outgrowth of model rocketry.  This hobby uses non-metallic structural compoments and commerically manufactured engines ranging in impulse classification from G to P.  The hobby has been flourishing from early 1980s and is becoming increasing popular. Technically this is not consider amateur rocketry.  Any rocket with a liftoff weight greater than 3.3 pounds OR using a total impulse of G or greater, REQUIRES an FAA waiver to launch. Typically, a group of people get an FAA waiver for specified period of time (ie week, weekend, etc.) at a designated site and time, and all of the launches are then covered under this \\\"blanket waiver\\\". There is also a \\\"High Power Safety Code\\\" which designates more specific rules such as launch field size, etc.  Finally, in order to purchase any of the larger (Class B) rocket  motors you need to certified through either the National Association of Rocketry or Tripoli Rocketry Association.

Except when someone else has cooked a meal for me, I only eat fruit, vegetables, and whole grain or bran cereals.  I estimate I only get about 5 to 10 percent of my calories from fat.  Very little sugar or salt.  Very high fiber.  Most Americans get about 10 grams.  25 to 35 are recommended.  I get between 50 and 150.  Sometimes 200.  (I've heard of people taking fiber pills.  It seems unlikely that pills can contain enough fiber to make a difference.  It would be about as likely as someone getting fat by popping fat pills.  Tablets are just too small, unless you snarf down hundreds of them daily.)  My \\\"clean your plate\\\" conditioning works *for* me.  Eating the last 10% takes half my eating time, and gives satiety a chance to catch up, so I don't still feel hungry and go start eating something else.  I don't eat when I'm not hungry (unless I'm sure I'll get hungry shortly, and eating won't be practical then).  I bike to work, 22 miles a day, year round.  Fast.  I also bike to stores, movies, and everywhere else, as I've never owned a car. I estimate this burns about 1000 calories a day.  It also helps build and maintain muscle mass, prevent insulin resistance (diabetes runs in my family), and increase my metabolism.  (Even so, my metabolism is so low that when I'm at rest I'm most comfortable with a temperature in the 90s (F), and usually wear a sweater if it drops to 80.)  Cycling also motivates me to avoid every excess ounce.  (Cyclists routinely pay a premium for cycling products that weigh slightly less than others.  But it's easier and cheaper to trim weight from the rider than from the vehicle.)  There's no question in my mind that my metabolism is radically different from that of most people who have never been fat.  Fortunately, it isn't different in a way that precludes excellent health.  Obviously, I can't swear that every obese person who does what I've done will have the success I did.  But I've never yet heard of one who did try it and didn't succeed.   I'm sure everyone's weight cycles, whether or not they've ever been fat. I usually eat extremely little salt.  When I do eat something salty, my weight can increase overnight by as much as ten pounds.  It comes off again over a week or two. --  Keith Lynch, kfl@access.digex.com\",\"I've never had quicken but I did use MYM in it's early days.

I would beg to differ with you here.  The properly-formed conscience can be trusted virtually ALL the time.  I am not so sure, though, about something so materialistic as the human brain.  Does that mass of tissue possess anything trustworthy?  Your observation would probably be valid if we were discussing the \\\"mind\\\" of an animal, but the human being is only half animal, as it were; and half spiritual.   ?At the moment he stops speaking, and people start interpreting, the ?possibility of error appears.  Did he mean that literally or not?  We do ?not have any record that he elaborated on the words.  Was he thinking of ?Tran- or Con- substatiation?   He didn't say.  We interpret this passage ?using our brains; we think and reason and draw conclusions.  But we know ?that our brains are not perfect: our thinking often leads us wrong.  (This ?is something that most of us have direct experience of.  8-)  Now you have hit on the purpose of the Church.  It is by necessity the infallible interpreter of divine revelation.  Without the Church,           Christianity would be nothing more than a bunch of little divisive sects.   ?Unless you are infallible, there are very few things you can be certain ?of.  To the extent that doctrines rely on fallible human thinking, they ?cannot be certain.  This argument of yours regarding the certainty of an observation or a conclusion is not necessarily substantiated by experience.  It reminds me of the theoretical physicist who said that you can never be certain of a measurment because the sensor interferes with the field you are trying to measure.  Now, the experimental physicist will reply that although the measurement can never be made with absolute certainty, he is able to determine the certainty with which the measurement can be made, and this knowledge is often sufficient to render the measurement useful enough to allow evidence of the true condition of the field under observation. Therefore, although our minds are finite and susceptible to error, our competence in arriving at inductive insights gives confidence in our ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true, even in areas not subject to the experimental method.   ?Darren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu ?\\\"If any substantial number of  [ talk.religion.misc ]  readers read some ?

I pointed out that I did, in fact, agree that both Robert Weiss and Jim Meritt took quotes out of context.  Hence, I find it difficult to understand why Jim thinks I am a hypocrite.  Needless to say, I don't have time to reply to *every* article on t.r.m. that takes a quote out of context.    I asked Jim the following:  Jim replied by saying   But today we find four articles from Jim, one of which has the subject \\\"Silence is concurrence\\\":     Which is, of course, a complete red herring.  Taking quotes out of context isn't a crime.  I don't have time to read every article on t.r.m., and I'm certainly under no obligation to reply to them all.  Does \\\"silence is concurrence\\\" imply that Jim thinks that because I didn't respond to Weiss' articles I must condone Weiss' taking quotes out of context?  Jim doesn't want to give a direct answer to this question; read what he has written and decide for yourself.   But back to the context of my conversation with Jim.  Jim's next  gambit was to claim that he was using inductive logic when he concluded that I was being a hypocrite.  I challenged him to provide the details of that logic that led him to an incorrect conclusion. Today we find another obscure article (posting it twice didn't help make it more clear, Jim), titled \\\"Inductive Logic\\\":   More red herrings.  Could Jim mean that he has read an uncountably large number of my articles?  Could Jim mean that because I \\\"axed\\\" his articles, but not Weiss' articles, he wants to conclude inductively ... Well, I can't see where he is going with this.  But I can help him with his induction.  I've written roughly 80 articles since January.  The vast majority of them are discussions with Frank DeCenso and other inerrantists, where I take the position that they are making bad arguments.  Some are discussions with Jim Meritt where I take the position that he is making bad arguments (a straw man argument earlier, and taking quotes out of context more recently.)

There is a protocol limitation that restricts a given Display to at most 255 Screens.  I know of no server that handles multiple Displays on a single invocation, unless possibly my kludges to the R4 server can be looked upon as such; on a TCP-based system there is necessarily a limit of 65535 Displays per machine, but this is not a limitation inherent to X.

Unless I am badly mistaken, Rohit is suggesting that protecting boys from men is different than protecting girls from men. There are situations in which boys and girls are apart from members of the *opposite* sex (due to social convention or whatever) and thus are safe (in at least some sense). These same situations don't (necessarily) protect the children from abuse by members of the *same* sex.

The difference now is that such strains have become virulent.  In the old days, such TB was weak.  It didn't spread to other people very easily and just infected the one person in whom it developed (because of non-compliance with medications).  Non-compliance and development of resistant strains has been a problem for a very long time.  That is why we have like 9 drugs against TB.  There is always a need to develop new ones due to such strains.  Now, however, with a virulent resistant strain, we are in more trouble, and measures to assure compliance may be necessary even if they entail force.  --  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gordon Banks  N3JXP      | \\\"Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and geb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon.\\\" \",\"I want to get rid of alot of comics that I have.

A button widget, when pressed, will cause a new item to be drawn in the Window.  This action clearly should not call XCopyArea()  (or equiv) directly; instead, it should register the existence of the new item in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler that handles \\\"regular\\\" expose events (e.g. window manager-driven exposures) take care of rendering the new image.  Using an expose event handler is a \\\"proper\\\" way to do this because at the time the handler is called, the Xlib Window is guaranteed to be mapped.  The problem, of course, is that no expose event is generated if the window is already visible and mapped.  What we need to do is somehow \\\"tickle\\\" the Window so that the expose handler is hit with arguments that will enable it to render *just* the part of the window that contains the new item.\",\"...

If the gift of tounges were the ability to be understood by everyone, no matter what languages they know, there would be no need for the gift of interpretation, and I Corinthians 14 would not have had to have been written.     That's a pretty harsh assumption to make about a several million Christians world wide.  Sure, there are some who want glory for themselves who speak in tounges, just as there are among those who do not have this gift.  There were people like this in the Corinthian church also.  that does not mean that there is no true gift or that all who speak in tounges do it for their own glory in the sight of men.

I would just add to Phil's very infomative discussion the following caveat: the fifth amendment applies ONLY in crinial cases.  (\\\"...nor shall any person . . . be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself...\\\"). Thus if the father sued for custody of the children, the case would be civil and the defendant mother would not have fifth amendment protection. Oddly enough, her refusal to give information in a civil case can lead to criminal contempt charges (thus landing her in jail.)  The interesting part of all this is that in a murder trial, the woman CAN plead the fifth as  to the location of the child--this is routine.  A \\\"computer crime\\\"  prosecution thus would seem to be fertile ground for this kind of defense,  where a suit by a party injured by \\\"hackers\\\" would not.  If I am accused,  for example, of sending encrypted kiddie porn over the nets the fifth should  protect my key.  If I am accused of sending copyrighted material, however, it proabably will not (copyright infringement not being a \\\"crime\\\" in the technical sense.)

Their cheer quickly turned into a roar, and finally, the sellout crowd of 17,816 rose as one to rock the old barn at 5700 Oakland Avenue in a salute to the playoff-bound Blues.  The scoreboard had just flashed the news from Detroit -- Red Wings 5, Stars 3. With the North Stars' loss, the Blues officially clinched fourth place and the final playoff spot in the Norris Division. Good thing, because the Blues quit playing.  They held a 5-1 lead over Tampa Bay when the Detroit-Minnesota final appeared with 3 minutes 52 remaining in the second period. They promptly went to sleep and barely held on for a 6-5 victory that nearly slipped away at the buzzer. Tampa's Bob Beers tipped in a pass from Shawn Chambers, but officiating supervisor John D'Amico and video goal judge Rich Schweigler ruled that the shot had gone into the net after time had expired.  ``I'm glad I didn't see it go in at the end,\\\" Blues coach Bob Berry said.  If the goal had counted, he'd have been more upset than he was by the Blues' disappearance in the final 24 minutes. Holding on for the victory and making the playoffs tempered Berry's anger.  ``It wasn't pretty at the end,\\\" he said. ``We played 36, 37 great minutes, as good as we played all year. It slipped away at the end. It shouldn't have, but it did.\\\"  Still, the Blues won, prompting another ovation from the crowd at game's end. Despite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil this season, the Blues still made the playoffs. They'll meet the Chicago Blackhawks in a best-of-seven Norris Division semifinal, beginning at noon Sunday at Chicago Stadium.  The Blues finished the regular-season with a record of 37-36-11 for 85 points, their fourth consecutive plus-.500 season. Minnesota finished three points behind in fifth place, with a record of 36-38- 10 for 82 points. Tampa Bay, which played spoiler last week by tying the Blues 2-2 at Tampa, ended its first season with a record of 23-54-7 for 53 points.  The poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyous Blues locker room. Instead, the mood was one of relief and some disappointment.  ``It's a shame we let down,\\\" said Kevin Miller, one of three Blues to score two goals. Brendan Shanahan and Bob Bassen were the others. ``There was no need for a letdown. If we'd have kept working, it would have ended 6-2 and everyone would be happy.\\\"  Instead, a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs. ``We won, and that's all that matters,\\\" said Brett Hull, scoreless and minus-3 for the night. ``Once we got up 4-0, it was really tough to play.\\\"  Some players didn't have a problem.  ``Just because the score was announced, our line didn't quit,\\\" said Rich Sutter, who played with Bassen and Miller. ``We still had a game to play. You can't allow five goals like we did, that's not right.  ``It was disappointing to see what was going on.\\\"  Bassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the Blues' effort. Somehow, he missed the announcement of Minnesota's loss.  ``I didn't know it was final,\\\" he said. ``I was kind of looking around on the bench. I didn't realize it was a final for some reason. We're in the playoffs, and that's great, but it's a little disappointing to play like we did at the end.\\\"  The letdown was precisely the reason that Berry had instructed the scoreboard operators to keep the Minnesota-Detroit score off of the board. The score showed 0-0 until it first popped up with Detroit leading 4-2 in the third period. The Blues already led 4-0 at the time.  ``I told them I didn't want to see the score, I didn't want to know the score,\\\" Berry said. ``I felt we had to win the game, and that's the approach we took.\\\"  If Minnesota took a lead, Berry feared, the pressure of having to win might bother the Blues. If Detroit led, he worried, the Blues might quit.  Until the announcement, the Blues played splendidly. Shanahan got the crowd going at 10:44 of the first period, scoring his 50th of the season. Then, Miller and Bassen took charge late in the period.  With the teams playing four on four, Miller broke in on left wing, deked defenseman Roman Hamrlik and beat former Blues goalie Pat Jablonski with the rebound of his own shot with 21.6 seconds remaining in the period.  Then, just 10.5 seconds later, Bassen rifled a long slap shot past Jablonski after defenseman Rick Zombo intercepted a Tampa pass in the neutral zone.  Bassen made it 4-0 just 14 seconds into the second period, scoring on the  rebound of Bret Hedican's shot. The goal gave him his first two-goal game of the season and reminded him of a special friend.  Last year, Bassen befriended young Oliver Mulvihill, who died of a rare form of cancer at age 6 on Feb. 23.  ``I was thinking of my buddy Oliver,\\\" Bassen said. ``He's in heaven now, and I know he was watching. I know he's happy.\\\"  Miller increased the Blues lead to 5-0 on a break-away goal set up by Zombo at 11:09. Then, Steve Maltais broke Curtis Joseph's shutout just 18 seconds later, making it 5-1.  Less than a minute after the North Stars' final was announced, Tim Bergland scored and cut the lead to 5-2. But Shanahan scored his 51st, converting a pass from Nelson Emerson with 21.3 seconds remaining in the  second period.  Then, it was all Lightning. Adam Creighton scored 40 seconds into the third period, prompting Berry to rest the overworked Joseph. Guy Hebert allowed goals to Shawn Chambers and Danton Cole in a span of 1:21 midway through the third period.  The goals by Chambers and Cole made Shanahan's second goal stand up as the winner. ``We were in there,\\\" Shanahan said. ``The game was over. We were in.\\\"\",\"Was the ABC coverage of the Kings/Flames game supposed to be the way it was shown in BC with CBC overriding the ABC coverage?

VESA-compliant applications should have no trouble setting these modes. (But I'm forwarding your posting to our Software group, just in case.  Can't be too careful.)  Not that I doubt that YOUR applications are failing to run; lots of stuff depends on figuring out which exact SVGA they're looking at, and don't use VESA calls (VESA is still pretty new). Every new chip set confuses them.   I think we go to AT LEAST 76 Hz at 1024x768x8, and maybe more (and it's a function of the RAMDAC speed, not the Power 9000). We need to fix the problems you've noted (they were already on the list).

Working by analogy, you can build up a new monitor definition that has the right combinations of refresh rates for your monitors.  Keep a backup copy of the file!  Once you've built a new version of the P9000RES.DAT file, run the P9000 installation program, INST, and your new choices should show up.  (This assumes you have the WEITEK v. 2.2 drivers. You can tell the rev number by looking at the modification time of the driver: 02:20 is version 2.20.  Microsoft uses this gimmick, too.)

Neil Smith                             WEIRD SCIENCE  Everyone knows how to tell when a politician is lying:  his lips  move.  What may not be equally obvious is that there are  politicians and then there are politicians -- and that the phrase  \\\"political science\\\" is subject to more than one interpretation.    Years ago, we heard how \\\"scientists\\\" were worried that a new Ice  Age might be coming, and later on that \\\"nuclear winter\\\" -- smoke  and dust thrown into the atmosphere by full-scale international  unpleasantness -- was a possibility.  Something like that may even  have killed the dinosaurs.    What we didn't hear was that no actual data supported any of this,  that real-world events (the burning of Kuwaiti oil fields) tended  to discredit it, that mostly it was propaganda meant to weaken  values that made America the most successful culture in history,  and that the dinosaurs probably died of something like the Plague  when continents drifted together, exposing them to new germs.    We miss a lot like this, unless we listen closely.  Prince William  Sound, site of the famous oil spill, and Mount St. Helen's weren't  supposed to recover from their respective disasters for at least  100 years.  That turned out not to be true, although you'd never  know it from watching network nightly news or CNN.  It doesn't fit  their agenda to inform us that the earth is vast and resilient, and  that nature is rougher on herself than we could ever be.    But for once, the media aren't entirely to blame.  As ignorant of  science as they are of everything, they trust \\\"scientists\\\" to  unscrew the inscrutable.  The trouble is that today's \\\"scientists\\\"  have agendas of their own.    Nobody in government, that wellspring of scientific wherewithal, is  going to offer grants to an investigator who states truthfully that  there is no respectable evidence for \\\"global warming\\\".  The money  and power for bureaucrats and politicians lie in mass transit, and  they hate the automobile -- blamed as a major cause of the mythical  crisis -- as a source of privacy and freedom they find intolerable.    The same appears true of \\\"acid rain\\\", a deliberate hoax cooked up  by the Environmental Protection Agency (which hates private  industrial capitalism almost as much as it does your car) and  foisted on real scientists through trickery which has depended on  specialists in different fields not talking to each other much.    The list goes on, always with a common, disreputable thread.   \\\"Ozone depletion\\\", for which evidence is even more suspect and  contradictory than for acid rain or global warming, is no more than  a last, desperate attempt to indict private capitalism in an era  when state central planning and the command economy have failed and  can only find this final, withered leg to teeter on.    Decades of anti-nuclear alarmism, resting on foundations of myth  and panic-mongering, have failed to erase the fact that nuclear  power is the safest, cleanest, most efficient source of energy  known to mankind -- and more to the point, that the greater amount  of energy there is available to any individual in society, the  freer that individual -- and his society -- become.    Honest studies on the effects of individual gun ownership and  self-defense on crime -- conducted by investigators who began as  ideological opponents to those concepts, but which show massive  reductions in the latter to be the result of the former -- have  been suppressed, most recently by the California state government.    And what the media didn't say about recent EPA \\\"discoveries\\\" on the  effect of \\\"secondhand smoking\\\" is that, although some harm to non- smokers may have been detected, it was less (by an order or two of  magnitude) than that associated with frying bacon a couple times a  week or keeping a pet bird.  It's enough to make you wonder whether  there was ever anything to the claim that smoking causes cancer.    That, of course, is the real threat represented by politically  correct science.  The world is a dangerous place.  It would be nice  to know the hazards.  I've never believed smoking to be a healthy  practice, but, given a lack of credibility on the part of today's  science, how am I to decide what to do about it?  Nicotine is  highly addictive, to that much I can attest from experience.  Yet  the stress of quitting may be riskier than to continue.  There  isn't any way to tell, thanks to the corrupting influence of  government money on the scientific establishment.    Two centuries ago, the Founding Fathers spared us certain agonies  to which every other nation in the world has been subject at one  time or another, by creating a legal barrier between politics and  religion.  Each time some short-sighted individual or group has  tried to lower the barrier (most recently over the issue of  abortion), blood -- real human blood, hot and smoking in the street  -- has wound up being shed.    Real human blood is being shed over scientific issues, as people's  lives are ruined through the loss, to agencies like the EPA, of  livelihood, or property it may have taken a lifetime to accumulate,  to diseases caused by toxins associated with burning fossil fuels  for electrical power, or thanks to bans on things like cyclamates,  when they die from the effects of obesity.    What we need now, if we hope to survive as a civilization for two  more centuries, is another barrier, a Constitutional separation of  state and science -- including medicine.  Knowledge is valuable;  real science won't languish for lack of funding.  The money will  simply come from contributors unwilling to pay for lies, and  everyone will benefit.    L.

Please reply to:  crane@coral.bucknell.edu  Thanks,\",\" I have the a CD-Technology drive with the Toshiba mechanism, and it is supposedly the fast and best now.  It has an access of 200ms and a data transfer rate 300Kb/sec.  It is multisession photo-cd compatible.  It is available from educorp for $599, the CD-Technology one, and comes with two mail in coupons for two free CDs.  I'm not sure if the cd's are good, since I've only had the drive a little less than a month and had the cd's shipped to my home address in california instead of here in maryland.  The CD-technology drive has a separate power supply separated from the drive, which supposedly gives it a longer life, and keeps it cleaner with no fan to attract dust.  A Toshiba brand drive is also available, but I think the CD-Technology is better, since you get the same mechanism, and at a slightly lower price with two free CDs.  The Apple 300/330i Drive, Sony Mechanism, is around a 300ms access time I think, and a data transfer rate of 300Kb/sec.  I know it is the slowest of the three mentioned here.  It is not widely available, except through the apple catalog, which is bad at a price of only $599.  It is also multi-session photo cd compatible. I think the external model comes with 7 free cds, some of which are pretty good.  The NEC drive has been out the longest.  it has an access time of 280ms and a data transfer rate of 300Kb/sec.  it is available from many vendors around $600 dollars, including Educorp.  It wasn't multi-sesssion photo-cd compatible before, but I hear that the current version that is shipping is.  Owners of the older drives can get an upgrade.  It does not come with any free cd's unless you buy it in a bundle.  Of the three CD-Rom drives above, i think the best choices would be the Apple drive and the CD-technology(toshiba) drive.  The apple drive for it's compatibility with apple products and the cd-technology(toshiba) for it's speed and performance.   BTW, the models of the drives are:  Apple: AppleCD 300 or AppleCD 300i (internal)  CD-Technology:  CD-T3401 (the Toshiba brand name model I'm not sure, but it is also something like with 3401)  NEC:  CDR-74   I'm very happy with my drive.  And have had no compatibility problems whatsoever.  If I am wrong about any of the above, do correct me, but I am pretty sure of myself, even when I think I'm not.  Also, some of you out there might notice that I have the same last name as the president of CD-Technology which happens to be in southern california, my hometown.  However, I AM NOT a relative nor do I know the guy.  Liu is just a common chinese name, especially in southern california, with the enormous chinese community.

Here's the outcome from the research (condenced versions, copyright San Jose Mercury news):  ---   Bombings in the two largest cities in southern Lebanon killed 11 people and  wounded 80 others. A car bomb blew up in Tyre, killing 10 people and wounding  75. A man was killed and five others seriously wounded in an explosion in  Nabatiye. ---   An Israeli navy patrol boat attacked and sank a rubber guerrilla boat off  southern Lebanon early today, killing the two men aboard, the army command  said.         It said in a communique that a Dvora patrol boat opened fire on the  motorized rubber dinghy north of Tyre after identifying it as hostile. The army  said no one on the Israeli boat was injured. The affiliation of the slain  guerrillas was not immediately known. ---   Rival factions of the guerrilla group led by terrorist mastermind Abu Nidal  battled Sunday in Tyre, Lebanon, with machine guns and rocket-propelled  grenades, killing at least four people and wounding 15, police said. ---  Lebanon's mainstream Shiite Muslim militia said Thursday that it had  uncovered a network of tunnels in a southern Lebanese village where it said pro- Iranian kidnappers had held Western hostages.         Officials of the militia, Amal, led local journalists through the catacomb- like alleys and showed them two cells with iron doors at the village,  Kawthariyet al Siyad, near Tyre, the ancient port city, about 40 miles south of  Beirut.         The officials said they were certain that U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R.  Higgins was detained there shortly after he was seized by gunmen on a road  outside Tyre in February 1988. -------------- ...anyway, I counted 20 articles during these 3 years of reporting. I also found out the possible reason why the numbers for the inhabitants of the city is defined between 14000 and 24000. It seems that Tyre is one of the places where people from Libanon flee to during more extensive bombings, so there's a constant flow of refugees entering and leaving Tyre (articles mentioned thousands of people entering and leaving this place).

Cheers, Kent \",\"    There is a library of map projections in:      charon.er.usgs.gov  in\",\" My votes (FWIW):  Team MVP: Pat Verbeek. He fans on 25% of goal mouth feeds, but he still has  36 goals after a terrible start and has been an examplary (sp?) team captain throughout a tough couple of seasons. Honorable mention: Nick Kypreos and Mark Janssens. Probably more appropriate in the unsung heroes category than MVP, but Kypreos (17 goals, 320+ PIM) has been the hardest working player on the team and Janssens is underrated as a defensive center and checker. I guess I place a greater emphasis on hard work than skill when determining value.  Biggest surprise: Geoff Sanderson. He had 13 goals and 31 points last season as a center, then moved to left wing and has so far put up 45 goals and 80+ points. He now has a new Whaler record 21 power play goals, most all coming from the right wing faceoff circle, his garden spot. Honorable mention: Andrew Cassels and Terry Yake. The kiddie quartet of Sanderson, Poulin, Nylander, and Petrovicky have been attracting the most attention, but Cassels is just 23 and will score close to 90 points this season. He has quite nicely assumed the role of number one center on the team and works very well with Sanderson. Yake bounced around the minors for a number of seasons but is still 24 and will put up about 20 goals and 50 points this season. Yake, like Sanderson, started performing better offensively once he was converted from center to wing,  although lefty Sanderson went to the left wing and righty Yake went to the right side.  Biggest disappointment: Hands down, John Cullen. Cullen had a disasterous 77 point season last year, his first full season after The Trade. Cullen started the season off of summer back surgery, and fell flat on his face (appropriate, since he spent all of his Whaler career flat on his ass, and whining about it). Cullen scored just 9 point on 19 games, was a clubhouse malcontent, commanded the powerplay to a 9% success percentage (>21% with Sanderson), and sulked his way out of town. Worst of all, his 4 year, $4M contract had three years left to run, so no one would give up any more than the 2nd round draft pick the  Maple Leafs offered to Hartford. Honorable mention: Steve Konroyd, also subpar after signing a 3 year, $2.1M contract; Eric Weinrich, who showed flashes of competence, but overall has played poorly; Jim McKenzie, who was a much better hockey player two seasons ago than he is now; and Frank Pietrangelo, who only seemed to play well when Sean Burke was out for an extended period and he got to make a number of starts in a row.\",\"We need a good concave ->convex polygon conversion routine.

Maybe I've misjudged you, Russell.  Anyone who agrees with something  I say can't be all bad.  ;-)  Seriously, I'm not sure whether I misjudged you or not, in one respect.   I still have a major problem, though, with your insistence that science  is mainly about avoiding mistakes.  And I still disagree with your  contention that nobody who doesn't use methods deemed \\\"scientific\\\"  can possibly know what's true and what's not.     Okay, so let's see if we agree on this: FIRST of all, there are degrees  of certainty.  It might be appropriate, for instance, to demand carefully  controlled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth (to the  extent that there is any such thing) the effectiveness of a certain  treatment. On the other hand, highly favorable clinical experience, even  if uncontrolled, can be adequate to justify a *preliminary* judgement that a treatment is useful.  This is often the best evidence we can hope for from investigators who do not have institutional or corporate support. In this case, it makes sense to tentatively treat claims as credible but to reserve final judgement until establishment scientists who are qualified and have the necessary resources can do more careful testing.  SECONDLY, it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of  evidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal.     I come to this dispute about what science is  not only as a mathematician but as a veteran of many arguments in sci.psychology (and occasionally in sci.med) about NLP (Neurolinguistic Programming).  Much of the work done to date by NLPers can be better categorized as informal exploration than as careful scientific research.  For years now I have been trying to get scientific and clinical psychologists to just take a look at it, to read a few of the books and watch some of the videotapes (courtesy of your local university library).  Not for the purpose of making a definitive judgement, but simply to look at the NLP methodology (especially the approach to eliciting information from subjects) and look for ideas and hypotheses which might be of scientific interest.  And most especially to be aware of the *questions* NLP suggests which might be worthy of scientific investigation.  Over and over again the response I get in sci.pychology is  \\\"If this hasn't been thoroughly validated by the accepted form of empirical research then it can't be of any interest to us.\\\"    To me, the ultimate reducio ad absurdum of the extreme \\\"There've got to be controlled studies\\\" position is an NLP technique called the Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure.  Simple phobias (as opposed to agoraphobia) may not be the world's most  important psychological disorder, but the nice thing about them is that  it doesn't take a sophisticated instrument to diagnose them or tell  when someone is cured of one.  The NLP phobia cure is a simple  visualization which requires less than 15 minutes.  (NLPers claim that it can also be used to neutralize a traumatic memory, and hence is useful in treating Post-traumatic Stress Syndrome.)  It is essentially a variation on the classic desensitization process used by behavioral therapists.  A subject only needs to be taken through the technique once (or, in the case of PTSD, once for each traumatic incident).  The process doesn't need to be repeated and the subject doesn't need to practice it over again at home.  Now to me, it seems pretty easy to test the effectiveness of this cure.  (Especially if, as NLPers claim, the success rate is extremely high.)   Take someone with a fear of heights (as I used to have).  Take them up  to a balcony on the 20th floor and observe their response.  Spend 15  minutes to have them do the simple visualization.  Send them back up to  the balcony and see if things have changed.  Check back with them in a  few weeks to see if the cure seems to be lasting.  (More long term  follow-up is certainly desirable, but from a scientific point of view  even a cure that lasts several weeks has significance.  In any case,  there are many known cases where the cure has lasted years.  To the best  of my knowledge, there is no known case where the cure has been reversed  after holding for a few weeks.)  (My own cure, incidentally, was done with a slightly different NLP technique, before I learned of the Fast  Phobia/Trauma Cure.  Ten years later now, I enjoy living on the 17th floor of my building and having a large balcony.)    The folks over in sci.psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to make this simple test.  They claim that only an elaborate outcome study will be satisfactory --- a study of the sort that NLP practitioners,  many of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice, can ill  afford to do.  (Most of them are also just plain not interested, because  the whole idea seems frivolous.  And since they're not part of the scientific establishment, they have no tangible rewards to gain  from scientific acceptance.)   The Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure is over ten years old now and the clinical  psychology establishment is still saying \\\"We don't have any way of  knowing that it's effective.\\\"    These academics themselves have the resources to do a study as elaborate  as anyone could want, of course, but they say  \\\"Why should I prove your  theory?\\\"  and  \\\"The burden of proof is on the one making the claim.\\\"   One academic in sci.psychology said that it would be completely  unscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn't  been described in a scientific journal.  (It's described in a number of  books and I've posted articles in sci.psychology describing it in as much  detail as I'm capable of.)    Actually, at least one fairly careful academic study has been done (with  favorable results), but it's apparently not acceptable because it's a doctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal.  To me, this sort of attitude does not advance science but hinders it.   This is the kind of thing I have in mind when I talk about \\\"doctrinnaire\\\"  attitudes about science.    Now maybe I have been unfair in imputing such attitudes to you, Russell.   If so, I apologize.    -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems  less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \",\"       Yes, please create the group alt.raytrace soon!!

This article does NOT claim that the GCA of 1968 is a \\\"verbatim  translation\\\" of a Nazi law.  What it says is that in another place -- the book they're talking about -- they compare the two things section by section.  The implication is that the similarities are devastating. In the next sentence, they talk about how in that book they reproduce  the German text of the Nazi law, together with its translation.  Not  surprisingly, a reader could easily conflate these two things into a  single idea:  that the American GCA is a literal translation of the Nazi law; and sure enough, that's what the whole thing has mutated into,  urban-folklore style.  2.  The article goes to great pains to establish that Senator Dodd had a  copy of the Nazi law, either from his time on the Nurnberg prosecution  team or later.  This fact is considered highly incriminating, but I don't  understand why.  The author repeats several times that he is simply unable  to imagine how anyone could come into possession of the original text; and  yet in a paragraph towards the end, he explains it perfectly:  \\\"If Dodd got his copy of the original German text of the Nazi Weapons Law during his time at Nurnberg, it likely was part of a collection of documents, for example, issues of the Reichsgesetzblatt [the German law registry].\\\"  Bingo.  Exactly.    Dodd had a *book*, with a series of Nazi laws in it, including the one under discussion.  All of the stuff about \\\"Why would a U.S. congressman have a copy of a Nazi law?\\\" melts away, by the author's admission.  He then continues:  \\\"But if he acquired the original German text of the  Nazi Weapons Law after his service at Nurnberg, he must have done so  for a very specific reason...\\\"  But there's absolutely no reason to  think that this is the case.  In fact, as a \\\"senior member of the U.S.  team that helped to prosecute Nazi war criminals\\\", it seems to me that he would have *had* to have a copy.  All arguments about whether  the Nazi Weapon Law is really of historical interest (as it obviously is, certainly according to the author here), or whether Dodd personally prosecuted the Interior Minister who signed it, can be put aside as red  herrings.  3.  Having established that Dodd owned a copy of the original German text, the JPFO article then tries to draw sinister implications from the fact that he  asked to have it translated.  The problem is, in the context of the charge  levelled at Dodd, these two things work *against* each other.  People ask  to have things translated when they *don't know what they mean*.  If Dodd  took it upon himself to preserve the Nazi law with idea of someday introducing  it into American law, surely by 1968 he would have know what it *meant*,  wouldn't he?     Anyway, this precise charge -- the main one that I questioned in an earlier posting -- is just silly.  Why would Dodd need the exact translation for this purpose?  Is the idea that the gun controllers, despite being presumably bent on disarming the populace with the goal of eventually destroying all civil liberties, needed a crib sheet?  Didn't they have any idea how to do it on their own?     Once again, the author provides a perfectly acceptable answer to his own question: \\\"Dodd may have offered his copy of the Nazi Weapons Law to show that the specific proposal did not resemble anything in the  Nazi law.\\\"  In fact, since the law and its translation *were* entered into the Congressional Record, under the heading of documents \\\"concerning the history of Nazism and gun confiscation\\\", Dodd's motivation isn't a  mystery:  he asked for the translation in order to put it in the CR.  4.  Even this article makes it clear that the part of the Nazi law that was added *by* the Nazi regime is only a small part of that law.   Registration of guns, for instance, was begun in 1928, and thus NOT a \\\"Nazi-inspired\\\" idea.  The parts of the Nazi law that parallel the  1968 GCA include handgun control of some sort, and the identification  of certain weapons as sporting weapons.  The JPFO then goes on to list  other parts of the Nazi law, forbidding ownership of weapons by Jews; of course, there are no such provisions in the American GCA.  Nevertheless, in a rhetorical move guaranteed to muddy the waters, immediately after the  discussion of the anti-Jewish parts of the law, the JPFO article continues,  \\\"Given the parallels between the Nazi Weapons Law and the GCA'68...\\\" -- so  as to get maximum emotional mileage out of that aspect of the law.\",\"  \\\"Assuming\\\"? Also: come on, Brad. If we are going to get anywhere in  this (or any) discussion, it doesn't help to bring up elements I never  addressed, *nor commented on in any way*. I made no comment on who is  \\\"right\\\" or who is \\\"wrong\\\", only that civilians ARE being used as cover  and that, having been placed \\\"in between\\\" the Israelis and the guerillas, they *will* be injured as both parties continue their fight.    [The *purpose* of an army's use of military uniforms   is *to set its members apart* from the civilians so that   civilians will not be thought of by the other side as  \\\"combatants\\\". So, what do you think is the \\\"meaning behind\\\",   the intention and the effect when an \\\"army\\\" purposely   *does not were uniforms but goes out of its way to *look   like civilians'? *They are judging that the benefit they will   receive from this \\\"cover\\\" is more important that the harm  that will come to civilians.*  This is a comment on the Israeli experience and is saying that the guerillas *do* have some responsibility in putting civilians in \\\"the middle\\\" of this fight. By putting on uniforms and living apart from civilians (barracks, etc.), the guerillas would significantly lower the risk to civilians.   But if the guerillas do this aren't *they* putting themselves  at greater risk? Absolutely, they ask themselves \\\"why set   ourselves apart (by wearing uniforms) when there is a ready-made   cover for us (civilians)? That makes sense from their point of   view, BUT when this cover is used, the guerillas should accept   some of the responsibility for subsequent harm to civilians.   I agree with you here. I have always thought that Israel's bombing sortees and bombing policy is stupid, thoughtless, inhumane AND ineffective. BUT, there is no reason that Israel should passive wait  until attackers chose to act; there is every reason to believe that \\\"taking the fight *to* the enemy\\\" will do more to stop attacks.   As I said previously, Israel spent several decades \\\"sitting passively\\\" on its side of a border and only acting to stop these attacks *after* the attackers had entered Israeli territory. It didn't work very well. The \\\"host\\\" Arab state did little/nothing to try and stop these attacks  from its side of the border with Israel so the number of attacks were considerably higher, as was their physical and psychological impact  on the civilians caught in their path.    This is just another \\\"selectively applied\\\" statement.   The reason for this drawn-out impasse between Ababs/Palestinians and Israelis is that NEITHER side is willing to accept the Word of the other. By your criteria *everyone* should stay away from the negotiations.  That is precisely why the Palestinians (in their recent PISGA proposal for  the \\\"interim\\\" period after negotiations and leading up to full autonomy) are demanding conditions that essentially define \\\"autonomy\\\" already. They DO NOT trust that Israel will \\\"follow through\\\" the entire process and allow Palestinians to reach full autonomy.   Do you understand and accept this viewpoint by the Palestinians?  If you do, then why should Israel's view of Arabs/Palestinians  be any different? Why should they trust the Arab/Palestinians' words? Since they don't, they are VERY reluctant to give up \\\"tangible assets  (land, control of areas) in exchange for \\\"words\\\". For this reason, they are also concerned about the sorts of \\\"guarantees\\\" they will have  that the Arabs WILL follow through on their part of any agreement reached.  Absolutely, so are the Arabs/Palestinians asking FIRST for the Israelis \\\"word\\\" in relation to any agreement? NO, what is being demanded FIRST is LAND. When the issue is LAND, and one party finally gets HOLD of this \\\"land\\\", what the \\\"other party\\\" does is totally irrelevent. If I NOW have possession of this land, your words have absolutely no power; whether Israel chooses to keeps its word does NOT get the land back.   While the \\\"major armaments\\\" (those allowing people to wage \\\"civil wars\\\") have been removed, the weapons needed to cross-border attacks still remain to some extent. Rocket attacks still continue, and \\\"commando\\\" raids only require a few easily concealed weapons and a refined disregard for human life (yours of that of others). Such attacks also continue.   Bat guano. The situation you call for existed in the 1970s and attacks were commonplace.   There is NO WAY these groups can be effectively \\\"disarmed\\\" UNLESS the state is as authoritarian is Syria's. The only other way is for Lebanon to take it upon itself to constantly patrol the entire border with Israel, essentially mirroring Israel's border secirity on its side. It HAS TO PROVE TO ISREAL that it is this committed to protecting Israel from attack from Lebanese territory.  That's what I said, ok? But, doesn't that mean that Syria has to \\\"take over\\\" Lebanon? I don't think Israel or Lebanon would like that. What both \\\"sides\\\" need is to receive something \\\"tangible\\\". The Arabs/ Palestinians are looking for \\\"land\\\" and demanding that they receive it prior to giving anything to Israel. Israel has two problems: 1) if it gives up real *land* it IS exposing itself to a changed geostrategic situation (and that change doesn't help Israel's position), and 2) WHEN it gives up this land IT NEEDS to receive something in return to compensate for the increased risks\",\"Tonigth a TV journal here in Brasil announced that an object, beyond Pluto's orbit, was found by an observatory at Hawaii.

I had mentioned before that there is a report commissioned by the UN to study the Litani river, it is  still in draft form.  The Israeli gov't also commissioned a study on the river that was done by Dr. Ben Wolfe. The Litani starts in the Bekaa valley in Lebanon, flows Southward, then West across South Lebanon and discharges into the Mediterranean near the city of Tyre. There are other rivers such as the Hasbani and the Wazzani that start in Lebanese territory than join the Jordan river.   The most mentioned plan was one that would divert water from the Litani into these, then the water would flow naturally into the Lac De Houle.  BUT there is no evidence of any diversion structure (which would need to be at least 3 km long).  The area is mountainous, inaccessible and occupied by Israel so I have not seen any independent  reports of the existence of any diversion structure there. Another often mentioned diversion is through deep wells. It is also rumored that Israe has 600 m wells tapping into deep aquifers and drawing water on the Israeli side of the border.  If such wells are indeed under use they would be costly to operate  (high energy costs) and the Lebanese and Israeli gov't should  agree on the distribution of water from shared aquifers as part of an overall peace plan and the bilateral negociations on \\\"regional issues\\\".

Being a PhD-student at David Chaum's cryptography-group, our group has a long history in research in the field of privacy-protecting cash systems.  The report is called CS-R9323.ps.Z, contains 77 pages, and can be retrieved from  ftp.cwi.nl   (192.16.184.180)  from the directory pub/CWIreports/AA. The postscript-file is suitable for 300dpi laserprinters.  ==================================================================== ABSTRACT (from coverpage): We present a new off-line electronic cash system based on a problem, called the representation problem, of which little use has been made in literature thus far. Our system is the first to be based entirely on discrete logarithms.  Using the representation problem as a basic concept, some techniques are introduced that enable us to construct protocols for withdrawal and payment that do not use the cut and choose methodology of earlier systems. As a consequence, our cash system is much more efficient in both computation and communication complexity than any such system proposed previously.    Another important aspect of our system concerns its provability. Contrary to previously proposed systems, its correctness can be mathematically proven to a very great extent. Specifically, if we make one plausible assumption concerning a single hash-function, the ability to break the system seems to imply that one can break the Diffie-Hellman problem.     Our system offers a number of extensions that are hard to achieve in previously known systems. In our opinion the most interesting of these is that the entire cash system (including all the extensions) can be incorporated in a setting based on wallets with observers, which has the important advantage that double-spending can be prevented in the first place, rather than detecting the identity of a double-spender after the fact. In particular, it can be incorporated even under the most stringent requirements conceivable about the privacy of the user, which seems to be impossible to do with previously proposed systems. Another benefit of our system is that framing attempts by a bank have negligible probability of success (independent of computing power) by a simple mechanism from within the system, which is something that previous solutions lack entirely. Furthermore, the basic cash system can be extended to checks, multi-show cash and divisibility, while retaining its computational efficiency. ====================================================================  Cryptographers are challenged to try to break this system!    I made a particular effort to keep the report as self-contained as possible.  Nevertheless, if you have any questions, please e-mail to me and I will try to reply as good as I can.

From LA Times, Friday, April 9, 1993.  P. A1.    EVIDENCE OF ADL SPY OPERATION SEIZED BY POLICE    By Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer    SAN FRANCISCO -- Police on Thursday served search warrants on the  Anti-Defamation League here and in Los Angeles, seizing evidence of a  nationwide intelligence network accused of keeping files on more than  950 political groups, newspapers and labor unions and as many as  12,000 people.    Describing the spy operation in great detail, San Francisco  authorities simultaneously released voluminous documents telling how  operatives of the Anti-Defamation League searched through trash and  infiltrated organizations to gather intelligence on Arab-American,  right-wing and what they called \\\"pinko\\\" organizations.    Representatives of the Anti-Defamation League, a well-known  organization in the U.S. Jewish community dedicated to fighting  anti-Semitism, declined detailed comment Thursday but denied breaking  any laws.    Police allege that the organization maintains undercover operatives to  gather political intelligence in at least seven cities, including Los  Angeles and San Francisco.    Groups that were the focus of the spy operation span the political  spectrum, including such groups as the Ku Klux Klan, the White Aryan  Resistance, Operation Rescue, Greenpeace, the National Assn. for the  Advancement of Colored People, the United Farm Workers and the Jewish  Defense League.  Also on the list were Mills College, the board of  directors of San Francisco public television station KQED and the San  Francisco Bay Guardian newspaper.    People who were subjects of the spy operation included former  Republican Rep. Pete McCloskey, jailed political extremist Lyndon H.  LaRouche and Los Angeles Times foreign correspondent Scott Kraft, who  is based in South Africa.    Authorities said much of the material collected by the groups was  confidential information obtained illegally from law enforcement  agencies.  They also alleged that data on some individuals and  organizations was sold separately to the South African government.    In addition to allegations of obtaining confidential information from  police, the Anti-Defamation League could face a total of 48 felony  counts for not properly reporting the employment of its chief West  Coast spy, Roy Bullock, according to the affidavit filed to justify  the search warrant.    The Anti-Defamation League disguised payments to Bullock for more than  25 years by funneling $550 a week to Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I.  Hochman, who then paid Bullock, according to the documents released in  San Francisco.  Hochman, a former president of the Jewish Federation  Council of Greater Los Angeles and one of the state's leading tax  attorneys, will be out of the city until late next week and could not  be reached for comment, his office said.    Until 1990, Hochman, a former U.S. prosecutor, also was a member of a  panel appointed by then-Sen. Pete Wilson to secretly make initial  recommendations on new federal judges in California.  Hochman is a  former regional president of the Anti-Defamation League.    The league, which initially cooperated with police, has denied  repeatedly that its intelligence-gathering operation broke any laws.  League officials will not confirm or deny whether Bullock was an  employee and have said they simply traded information with police  departments about people who might be involved in hate crimes.    But in an affidavit filed to obtain warrants for Thursday's searches,  San Francisco police alleged that \\\"ADL employees were apparently less  than truthful\\\" in providing information during an earlier search  conducted without a warrant.    David Lehrer, executive director of the Los Angeles ADL office, said  the organization has not violated the law.  \\\"There is nothing  nefarious about how we operate or what we have done,\\\" he said.  \\\"Our  record speaks for itself.\\\"    The police affidavit contends that Lehrer had sole control of a secret  fund used to pay for \\\"fact-finding operations.\\\"  Lehrer, according to  the documents, signed checks from the account under the name L.  Patterson.    An ADL official said the account was used to pay for subscriptions to  a wide variety of extremist publications that might balk at sending  them directly to the Anti-Defamation League.    Bullock, 58, who has been collecting intelligence for the ADL for  nearly 40 years, defended his efforts during a lengthy interview with  San Francisco police.  He said that he gathered names from many  sources and entered them into his computer under headings such as  \\\"Skins\\\" and \\\"Pinkos,\\\" but that did not necessarily mean that they were  under surveillance.    \\\"I might never see or call up on 99% of them again,\\\" Bullock said.  \\\"And it doesn't mean anything that they're in the files.  It's not a  threat to anyone's civil rights that a name appears in my files under,  say, 'Pinko.'\\\"    In recent years, Bullock worked closely with San Francisco Police  Officer Tom Gerard, who fled to the Phillippines last fall after he  was questioned by the FBI in the case.    A former CIA employee, Gerard supplied Bullock with criminal records  and Department of Motor Vehicles information such as home addresses,  vehicle registration, physical characteristics and drivers license  photographs.    Using files gathered for the Anti-Defamation League, Gerard and  Bullock also provided information to the South African government,  receiving $16,000 over four years, the documents show.    The file on Times staff writer Kraft, which was apparently sold to the  South African government, provides some insight into the hit-and-miss  nature of the spy operation.    The file notes that Kraft's articles \\\"appear frequently in The Times  and are well researched and written,\\\" but little else about the file  is accurate.  The brief entry confuses The Times' Kraft with another  Scott Kraft and provides the South African government with the wrong  Kraft's physical description, photograph and other personal  information.    Nevertheless, the documents provide illuminating details of how  Bullock for decades infiltrated all manner of organizations, from  skinheads to left-wing radicals, searching regularly through the trash  of target groups.  Using Anti-Defamation League funds, he also ran his  own paid informants under code names such as \\\"Scott\\\" and \\\"Scumbag.\\\"    He worked closely with police officers up and down the coast,  exchanged information with the FBI and worked with federal agencies,  including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.    It was Bullock's work as a paid informant for the FBI -- while spying  on behalf of the Anti-Defamation League and the South African  government -- that proved his undoing. The FBI learned that he was an  agent of a foreign government and began investigating, leading to the  probe of the Anti-Defamation League's intelligence network.  The  Anti-Defamation League employed undercover operatives to gather  information in Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Washington,  Chicago, St. Louis and Atlanta, according to the affidavit and  investigators.  Joining San Francisco police in searching league  offices and a Los Angeles bank were investigators from the office of  San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith and the state Franchise Tax  Board.  The Los Angeles Police Department, which earlier refused to  cooperate with the investigation, was informed of the searches in Los  Angeles but not invited to participate.  Investigators suspect that  some confidential information in the Anti-Defamation League files may  have come from Los Angeles police officers.        From Los Angeles Times, Saturday, April 10, 1993.  P. A23.    ADL VOWS TO COOPERATE WITH SPY INVESTIGATION    By Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer.    SAN FRANCISCO -- The Anti-Defamation League defended its record as a  civil rights group Friday and said it will cooperate with authorities  who are investigating whether the organization collected confidential  police information on citizens and groups.    But San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith said that Anti-Defamation  League employees involved in intelligence gathering could face many  felony counts of receiving confidential files, eavesdropping, tax  violations and conspiracy.    Police have accused the Anti-Defamation League of not being truthful  about its spying operations, which collected information on more than  12,000 individuals and 950 political groups across the political  spectrum.    Hundreds of pages of documents released by prosecutors Thursday show  that the ADL maintained a nationwide intelligence network and kept  files on political figures.    Even so, Smith suggested that if the Anti-Defamation League shut down  its spy operation, prosecutors would take that into account when  deciding what charges to file.    In a statement released in Washington, National Director Abraham H.  Foxman described the ADL as \\\"a Jewish defense agency which has fought  to protect all minorities from bigotry and discrimination for 80  years.\\\"    Foxman said the organization is regarded as a credible source on  extremist groups and has a tradition of routinely providing  information to police, journalists, academics, government officials  and the public.  It has never been the policy of the ADL to obtain  information illegally, he said.    \\\"Like other journalists, in order to protect the confidentiality and  physical safety of its sources, ADL will not comment on the nature or  identity of any source of information,\\\" Foxman said.    The Anti-Defamation League refused to acknowledge that one of its  longtime employees, Roy Bullock, was anything more than \\\"a private  individual who is alleged to be an ADL 'informant.'\\\"    Among the documents released by prosecutors were detailed statements  showing how the ADL funneled weekly payments to Bullock through  Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I. Hochman.    \\\"Roy would penetrate organizations and needed this arrangement to be  distanced from ADL,\\\" Hochman told a San Francisco police investigator.  Hochman could not be reached Friday at his home or office for comment.    Despite the Anti-Defamation League's assertion that it will cooperate  with authorities, San Francisco police said the group did not turn  over all pertinent documents during a voluntary search of the group's  offices in Los Angeles and San Francisco last fall.    A second round of searches Thursday, this time with search warrants,  produced a vast quantity of records, primarily dealing with financial  transactions, Smith said.  Further searches may be necessary and it  will be at least a month before any charges are filed, he said.    \\\"The investigation, of course, will go wherever the facts lead us,\\\"  the district attorney said.\",\"  Excuse me?

Your logic certainly applies to standard investment strategies.  However, the concept of a prize for a difficult goal is done for different reasons, I  suspect.  I'm not aware that Mr Orteig received any significant economic  benefit from Lindbergh's flight.  Modern analogies, such as the prize for a human powered helicopter face similar arguments.  There is little economic benefit in such a thing.  The advantage comes in the new approaches developed and the fact that a prize will frequently generate far more work than the  equivalent amount of direct investment would.

H. Welbon)]         For many atheists, the lack of belief in gods is secondary to an epistemological consideration:  what do we accept as a reliable way of knowing?  There are no known valid logical arguments for the existence of gods, nor is there any empirical evidence that they exist.  Most philosophers and theologians agree that the idea of a god is one that must be accepted on faith.  Faith is belief without a sound logical basis or empirical evidence.  It is a reliable way of knowing?   There is probably nothing else most people would accept in the absence of any possibility of proof.  Even when we agree to take someone elses word \\\"on faith\\\", we just mean that having found this person to be reliable in the past, we judge him likely to be a reliable source now. If we find faith less reliable than logic and empirical evidence everywhere else, why assume it will provide reliable knowledge about gods?   The difference between the atheist and the theist is fundamentally then one of whether or not faith is held to be a reliable way of knowing, rather than, as some agnostic posters would have it, whether ones faith is in gods or no gods.  The theist believes that faith is an acceptable basis for a belief in gods, even if he rejects faith as reliable at other times, for example in his work as a scientist.  The atheist believes that only logic and empirical evidence lead to reliable knowledge.  Agnosticism seems to me a less defensible position than theism or atheism, unless one is a sceptic in regards to all other knowledge.  Without evidence, why should we believe in gods rather than Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny?   I would also like to point out as others have that the atheist doesn't require absolute knowledge of the lack of gods.  I don't believe that there is any such thing as absolute knowledge.  Atheism is the best and simplest theory to fit the (lack of) facts and so should be held until contrary evidence is found.\",\"  As far as I know, they did; my new Mac came with one yesterday...

We do some calculations based on the image of the hole on the screen.  However, the calculations are mathematically highly complex, and must assume that the object's hole projects an image (resembling an ellipse if the tube is not parallel to the screen) in the centre of the screen.  However, it is unlikely that the object is placed so conveniently.    Firstly, we must transform the major and minor axis of the ellipse.  I cannot know what the angle between the tube and screen is.  Do I have to assume that they are parallel to do the transformation?  How do I do this transformation?  Secondly, there is a distortion of the image due to the screen being planar (the source--screen distance increases as we move away from the centre of the screen).  How can I compensate the ellipse's axis for this image distortion?  So, please can anyone give us a few pointers here?  How do we transform the image so it appears as it would if it were in the centre of the screen, and how do I deal with distortion due to the shape of the screen?

Or is it all hypothetical?\",\"                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^          The \\\"used to kill\\\" is the heart of the misinformation.  It's one of those technically accurate phrasings that conveys the wrong impression. What Mr. Quiqley is more than aware of, I'm sure, is that when people read this they think violent arguments where one member of the family grabs a gun and shoots another, thereby creating a tragic situation which could easily have been avoided had the gun not been there, or a tragic accident, especially involving a child.         Unfortunately, that's not the way things stack up.  The majority of that 43 \\\"times\\\" (37 I believe) are suicides.  That is, someone  intentionally took a firearm and shot themselves intending to kill  themselves.  And why it's popular to try and blame suicides on guns, the evidence doesn't support this.  Internal studies, as well as comparative studies with other countries, indicate that cultural factors far outweigh whether a person will kill themselves or not. (Japan, for instance, has a slightly higher rate than the U.S.  There people jump off buildings.)         According to the National Crime Survey, 40% of violent crime is commited by \\\"non-strangers,\\\" which mistakenly has been generalized regarding the King County study to mean, \\\"Friends and family.\\\"  That is, Mr. Quigley, and others who quote this statistic, are banking on the mental image that a \\\"Friend, family member, or child,\\\" equates to a loving relationship, and that it was cut short in a moment of anger.  Unfortunately, all too often husbands beat and kill wives, children assault parents, or vice-versa.  Most rapes are commited by  someone known to the victim, for instance.  Essentially, that a gun was used against a \\\"friend\\\" or family member doesn't mean they weren't trying to hurt the other person.  Crime is highest among poor urban families, and those are also the areas most \\\"at risk\\\" for family problems, especially violent ones.  A son in a gang may not be as loving toward his parents if they disapprove than a suburban kid might.         Finally, it hinges on the fallacy that a dead intruder is the only value of a self-defense firearm.  Using the minimum figures I worked out using the NCS I got about an 80:1 ratio between deadly self-defenses (justifiable homicides) and with-gun self-defenses. Between the FBI Uniform Crime report and the NCS there's an enormous amount of data and anybody with the calculator can crunch the numbers. As such it is incorrect to assume that a dead body is the only valid means of determining the success of such a defense, since according to the NCS (which has been considered by many to seriously under-report defenses) there were far more successful with-gun defenses than intruders killed.         Not it also confines itself to the home, where attack by a \\\"friend or family member\\\" is far, far more likely, and excludes any defense which occurs outside the home.  (I believe a large number occur in businesses.)          I have not seen the exact data for this, so I can't comment.  I will point out Canada's and Japan's suicide rate as indications that culture far more than firearm availability affect suicide rates.         There was also a comparative study between Canada (for what it's worth, considering the difficulty of comparing across cultural lines) published in the New England Journal of Medicine (I can get the exact cite if you need it) that concluded that restrictive firearm laws  would not significantly impact the over-all suicide rate. \",\" Chelios is by far the MVP on Chicago...

If the answer is yes then what freedom we have in this country is truly gone and its time to get out the guns or the lawyers (depending upon which causes more damage and to whom).

The Jester\",\"Can a theist be truly objective?  Can he be impartial      when questioning the truth of his scriptures, or      will he assume the superstition of his parents      when questioning?   I've often found it to be the case that the theist      will stick to some kind of superstition when      wondering about God and his scriptures.  I've      seen it in the Christian, the Jew, the Muslim,      and the other theists alike.  All assume that      their mothers and fathers were right in the      aspect that a god exists, and with that belief      search for their god.       Occasionally, the theist may switch religions or      aspects of the same religion, but overall the      majority keep to the belief that some \\\"Creator\\\"      was behind the universe's existence.  I've      known Muslims who were once Christians and vice      versa, I've known Christians who were once      Jewish and vice versa, and I've even known      Christians who become Hindu.  Yet, throughout      their transition from one faith to another,      they've kept this belief in some form of higher      \\\"being.\\\"  Why?       It usually all has to do with how the child is      brought up.  From the time he is born, the      theist is brought up with the notion of the      \\\"truth\\\" of some kind of scripture-- the Bible,      the Torah, the Qur'an, & etc.  He is told      of this wondrous God who wrote (or inspired)      the scripture, of the prophets talked about in      the scripture, of the miracles performed, & etc.      He is also told that to question this (as      children are apt to do) is a sin, a crime      against God, and to lose belief in the scrip-      ture's truth is to damn one's soul to Hell.      Thus, by the time he is able to read the      scripture for himself, the belief in its \\\"truth\\\"      is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a      matter of course.       But it doesn't stop there.  Once the child is able      to read for himself, there is an endeavor to      inculcate the child the \\\"right\\\" readings of      scripture, to concentrate more on the pleasant      readings, to gloss over the worse ones, and to      explain away the unexplainable with \\\"mystery.\\\"      Circular arguments, \\\"self-evdent\\\" facts and      \\\"truths,\\\" unreasoning belief, and fear of      hell is the meat of religion the child must eat      of every day.  To doubt, of course, means wrath      of some sort, and the child must learn to put      away his brain when the matter concerns God.      All of this has some considerable effect on the      child, so that when he becomes an adult, the       superstitions he's been taught are nearly      impossible to remove.       All of this leads me to ask whether the theist can      truly be objective when questioning God, Hell,      Heaven, the angels, souls, and all of the rest.      Can he, for a moment, put aside this notion that      God *does* exist and look at everything from      a unbiased point of view?  Obviously, most      theists can somewhat, especially when presented      with \\\"mythical gods\\\" (Homeric, Roman, Egyptian,      & etc.).  But can they put aside the assumption      of God's existence and question it impartially?

What brings us these:     fears of being shamed by what others will think or say about us?         which, in contrary, could be pleasing to God?     fears of being humbled?     fears of being judged as wrong (wrt mainstream standard of what is right)? Why can't we tolerate non-believers' mockery or ridicule of us for the   sake of peace, love and obedience to God?  The humbling lessons left to us   by martyrs and saints?

What makes us go blind to the truth that God is All Powerful and that He can   not be binded by what people wrote and have written about Him in all ages? Why is our faith in God limited?  By all the words and literature we muster? What prevents us from going *beyond* being saved and extend God's rich love   to others who are not?  Why are our eyes not wide open to see that He continuously sees our faith, hope   and love which glorify Him and so He gives us indications of His    acknowledgements with signs/miracles (ordinary/common or divinely inspired)    everywhere?  Isn't that like an atheist/agnostic's view that all these   are just ordinary here on earth and not caused by anything supernatural?  Why then does the Holy Mother comes back to remind us:   \\\"We must really __accept that prayer__ changes the course of things and that   with prayers __even wars can be prevented__.\\\" but then she continues:   \\\"You often have an egotistic attitude.  Dear children, in these days you   have prayed very much, __but your hands have remained empty__.\\\" Why hesitate in proclaiming what needs to be done:   \\\"prayer, conversion, peace, penance, fasting, the Holy Mass, living life   as what the Gospel brings.\\\"? Why not do so?  How?  To the world?   \\\"Start in your family.  Be a good example.  Live the Word.\\\" Why worry if it is going to be of good use to many?   \\\"The fruits, __leave them to the Lord__, do not worry about anything or    anyone but entrust yourself to the Lord.\\\"  Although the Holy Mother does not insist because:   \\\"You are free; I bow before the freedom which God gives you.\\\" but she follows this with:   \\\"You are surprised because I say to you: Decide for God and yet, see how   you have lived this day.\\\" Why does she constantly conveys:   \\\"Take this life toward God in the way as to __experience__ the Lord Himself   in your __behavior__ and __not only__ when you pray\\\" or one time when we    decide that we are saved, or talk/write about God, etc. The Holy Mother warns:   \\\"Satan (the serpent) is always trying to dissuade you to turn you away from   my peace plan and prayer.\\\"  (Rev 12:17, the dragon became angry with the woman   and went off to wage war against the rest of her offsprings, those who keep   God's commandments, and bear witness to Jesus.)  Do you have fear or hate for God's current messenger of true peace, love and   our motherly protector from the anti-Christ? The one who is being apprehensive of communism, wars, famine and other evils   that the serpent brings upon us?  This obedient and blessed new Eve? The mother who warns us so we can be prepared and be strong against Satan? Haven't there been renewed faith, hope, love, peace and obedience wherever   this messenger has shared her blessings and graces that God has given her   in good purpose? Why do we choose to be blind? Why fear the truth that God has been giving us a chance and sharing Christ's   ever-forgetting forgiveness to us through the obedient mother? The mother who has been consecrated the task __to reverse__ the disobedient   harm and example done by the ancient Eve. She has been preparing the new Eden with her Immaculate Heart. The new Eden as sanctuary (the womb) for the next coming and judgement of the    righteous by our Lord, Jesus Christ; when The Lamb marries His bride. Shouldn't we give her a hand in her exhaustive job of preparing us for the   second coming of her Son as she has been conceived without sin to bear   the Son of God in her womb? Why fear true peace, love and renewed faith and obedience to God that Mary   faithfully brings to God's children?  She has been protecting the flock   (the rest of the offsprings) from the greedy dragon so as to present more    righteous members for her Son's coming. Not all apparitions and miracles that resulted from them are worthy   of belief.  With prayer and guidance from the Holy Spirit and, of course,   approval of our Church authorities, we should be aware of the true and   divinely inspired ones; specifically, the ones which aligns with the   Scripture.     Also, our Lady reminds us of recommendation of __silence__ in our prayers:   \\\"If you speak unceasingly in your prayers, how will you be able to hear   God?  Allow Him room to answer you, to speak to you.\\\"   She encourages us (with motherly nurturing) to continue in exuberant  faith, hope and love to Jesus, constantly.  NOT with mere emotions,  but with deep, constant obedience to Jesus, her Beloved Son and acknowledgement of our need to have Him as part of our lives.  Let's not wait to the last minute to renew our faith and the life that God wants us to live; when there won't be enough time or when it will be late.                                                        Nowadays, Mary says,  \\\"Pray, pray, pray for peace...reconciliation, my children.\\\" Have peace within yourself first before you can promote peace to others.  For without peace, you can not fully accept my Son.\\\"                                                                          And you think she's just an ordinary lady.  Not to me.  She's our good Mother/messenger from God and she is so nice enough to share God's kingdom to us through her Son and experience it.  With Mary, we are assured that The Lamb always succeeds.  ----- Note:  All enclosed in quotes are from \\\"Latest News of Medjugorje\\\"        Number 10, June, 1991 by Fr.

Certainly the people who use the population for cover are *also* to blaim for dragging the innocent civilians into harm's way.  Are you suggesting that, when guerillas use the population for cover, Israel should totally back down? So...the easiest way to get away with attacking another is to use an innocent as a shield and hope that the other respects innocent lives?   Your damn right Israel insists on some sort of \\\"demilitarized\\\" or \\\"buffer\\\" zone. Its had to put up with too many years of attacks from the territory of Arab states and watched as the states did nothing. It is not exactly surprizing that Israel decided that the only way to stop such actions is to  do it themselves.   What? So the whole bit about attacks on Israel from neighboring Arab states  can start all over again? While I also hope for this to happen, it will only occur WHEN Arab states show that they are *prepared* to take on the  responsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attacks on Israel from their  soil. They have to Prove it (or provide some \\\"guaratees\\\"), there is no way Israel is going to accept their \\\"word\\\"- not with their past attitude of  tolerance towards \\\"anti-Israel guerillas in-residence\\\".  Good lord, Brad. What in the world goves you the idea that UN troops stop anything? They are ONLY stationed in a country because that country allows them in. It can ask them to leave *at any time*; as Nasser did in '56 and '67. Somehow, with that \\\"limitation\\\" on the troops \\\"powers\\\" I don't think that Israel is going to be any more comfortable. Without a *genuine* commitment to peace from the Arab states, and concrete (not intellectual or political exercises in jargon) \\\"guarantees\\\" by other parties, the UN is worthless to Israel (but, perhaps useful as a \\\"ruse\\\"?).   Perhaps you are aware that, to most communities of people, there is the feeling that it is better that \\\"many of us die fighting against those who attack us than for few to die while we silently  accept our fate.\\\" If,however, you call on Israel to see the sense of  suffering fewer casualties, I suggest you apply the same to Palestinian, Arab and Islamic groups.   From Israel's perspective, \\\"concessions\\\" gets it NOTHING...except the  realization that it has given \\\"something\\\" up and now *can only  hope* that the other side decides to do likewise. Words *can be taken back* by merely doing so; to \\\"take back\\\" tangible items (land, control of land) requires the sort of action you say Israel should stay away from.   Israel put up with attacks from Arab state territories for decades  before essentially putting a stop to it through its invasion of Lebanon. The entire basis of that reality was exactly as you state above: 1) Israel  would express outrage at these attacks and protest to the Arab state  involved, 2) that state promptly ignored the entire matter, secure  in the knowledge that IT could not be held responsible for the acts  committed by \\\"private groups\\\", 3) Israel would prepare for the next  round of attacks. What would Israel want to return to those days (and don't be so idiotic as to suggest \\\"trust\\\" for the motivations of present-day Arab states)?  Ah, ok...what is \\\"different\\\" about the present situation that tells us that the Arab states will *not* pursue their past antagonistic  policies towards Israel? Now, don't talk about vague \\\"political factors\\\" but about those \\\"tangible\\\" (just like that which Israel gave up) factors that \\\"guarantee\\\" the responsibility of those states. Your assessment of \\\"difference\\\" here is based on a whole lot of assumptions, and most states don't feel confortable basing their existence on that sort of thing.   It has not. Without the support, and active involvement, of Syria, Lebanon would not have been able to accomplish all that has occurred. Once Syria leaves who is to say that Lebanon will be able to retain  control? If Syria stays thay may be even more dangerous for Israel. Tim\",\"  Oops! Quite right.

Source: 'The Times,' 3 March 1992  MASSACRE UNCOVERED....  By ANATOL LIEVEN,  More than sixty bodies, including those of women and children, have  been spotted on hillsides in Nagorno-Karabakh, confirming claims  that Armenian troops massacred Azeri refugees. Hundreds are missing.  Scattered amid the withered grass and bushes along a small valley  and across the hillside beyond are the bodies of last Wednesday's  massacre by Armenian forces of Azerbaijani refugees.  From that hill can be seen both the Armenian-controlled town of  Askeran and the outskirts of the Azerbaijani military headquarters  of Agdam. Those who died very nearly made it to the safety of their  own lines.  We landed at this spot by helicopter yesterday afternoon as the last  troops of the Commonwealth of Independent states began pulling out.  They left unhindered by the warring factions as General Boris Gromov,  who oversaw the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, flew to Stepanakert  to ease their departure.  A local truce was enforced to allow the Azerbaijaines to collect their  dead and any refugees still hiding in the hills and forest. All the  same, two attack helicopters circled continuously the nearby Armenian  positions.  In all, 31 bodies could be counted at the scene. At least another  31 have been taken into Agdam over the past five days. These figures  do not include civilians reported killed when the Armenians stormed  the Azerbaijani town of Khodjaly on Tuesday night. The figures also  do not include other as yet undiscovered bodies  Zahid Jabarov, a survivor of the massacre, said he saw up to 200  people shot down at the point we visited, and refugees who came  by different routes have also told of being shot at repeatedly and  of leaving a trail of bodies along their path. Around the bodies  we saw were scattered possessions, clothing and personnel documents.  The bodies themselves have been preserved by the bitter cold which killed others as they hid in the hills and forest after the massacre.  All are the bodies of ordinary people, dressed in the poor, ugly  clothing of workers.  Of the 31 we saw, only one policeman and two apparent national  volunteers were wearing uniform. All the rest were civilians,  including eight women and three small children. TWO GROUPS,  APPARENTLY FAMILIES, HAD FALLEN TOGETHER, THE CHILDREN CRADLED  IN THE WOMEN'S ARMS.  SEVERAL OF THEM, INCLUDING ONE SMALL GIRL, HAD TERRIBLE HEAD  INJURIES: ONLY HER FACE WAS LEFT. SURVIVORS HAVE TOLD HOW THEY  SAW ARMENIANS SHOOTING THEM POINT BLANK AS THEY LAY ON THE GROUND.

I am the heartless bleeding heart?  You are not making sense. You seem to have no concern that someone would keep children inside this  compound when they had 51 days to let them out.  That sounds pretty heartless  to me.  I just heard on the news that some of the survivors regret they hadn't  stayed in the inferno to prove their loyalty to Koresh.  This makes me  sad and sick.   Have you ever heard of Jonestown? The sad thing is the people inside the compound were the authority  worshipers and their only authority was Koresh/Howell.   If these  people were able to think for themselves, there would likely be a lot  more survivors today.  Koresh preached a fiery apocalypse as early as  last year.   By all means, the FBI should be investigated, too.

JPEG (pronounced \\\"jay-peg\\\") is a standardized image compression mechanism. JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, the original name of the committee that wrote the standard.  JPEG is designed for compressing either full-color or gray-scale digital images of \\\"natural\\\", real-world scenes. It does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line drawings.  JPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it handle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG respectively.  JPEG is \\\"lossy\\\", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't quite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably the fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details of light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are invisible to the eye.  A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small files if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image archives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you aren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.   [2]  Why use JPEG?  There are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store 24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.  Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a 2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the size ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)  If your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have to convert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even with a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image than to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using JPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply.  It's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file.  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.  The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet posting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel (16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have only 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as black-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed in section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably more appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.   [3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?  JPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images, GIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first things to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.  As a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or gray-scale images of \\\"realistic\\\" scenes; that means scanned photographs and similar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit display hardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)  GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors, such as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels that are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by GIF.  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without introducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form. (In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they should be avoided in JPEG files.)  JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels adjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly often in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is particularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high. If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it.  Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and subtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it. The same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).  Plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG. You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale images.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images of up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.  If you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you should convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do. (Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only applies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from a GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG can only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify converting anyway.  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself. If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be prepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not convert well.   [4]  How well does JPEG compress images?  Pretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have handy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three files are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG software described in section 6B.  File    Size in bytes  Comments  ship.ppm 1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits     or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead) ship.ppm.Z  963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress     compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note.     Other text-oriented compressors give similar results. ship.gif  240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif     Most of the savings is the result of losing color     info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)  ship.jpg95  155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)     This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,     at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs. ship.jpg75   58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)     You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this     from the original, even with both on-screen at once. ship.jpg50   38406  cjpeg -Q 50     This has slight defects; if you know what to look     for, you could tell it's been JPEGed without seeing     the original.  Still as good image quality as many     recent postings in Usenet pictures groups. ship.jpg25   25192  cjpeg -Q 25     JPEG's characteristic \\\"blockiness\\\" becomes apparent     at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).     Still, I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were     of poorer image quality than this. ship.jpg5o    6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)     Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or     indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:     the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !  In this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smaller than a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the GIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical ratio for real-world scenes.   [5]  What are good \\\"quality\\\" settings for JPEG?  Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings.  \\\"Quality 95\\\" does NOT mean \\\"keep 95% of the information\\\", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary; it's not a percentage of anything.  The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting (smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another, but here are some rules of thumb.  The default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for experimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a file two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.  If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to go down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you might need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation. The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG. The default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to 95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).  If you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are prepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is about right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as \\\"op art\\\".  (Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG software described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other JPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different quality scale.  Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just \\\"high\\\"/\\\"medium\\\"/\\\"low\\\"-style choices.)   [6]  Where can I get JPEG software?  Most of the programs described in this section are available by FTP. If you don't know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article \\\"How to find sources\\\". (If you don't have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the same article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can get it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with \\\"send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\\\" in the body.  The \\\"Anonymous FTP List FAQ\\\" may also be helpful --- it's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in the news.answers archive.  NOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple months old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.   [6A]  If you are looking for \\\"canned\\\" software, viewers, etc:  The first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one kind of system.  If you don't see what you want for your machine, check out the portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over Internet; but some commercial programs are listed too.  X Windows:  John Bradley's free XV (version 2.00 and up) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and other image formats.  It's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu or ftp.cis.upenn.edu.  The file is called 'xv-???.tar.Z' (where ??? is the version number, currently 2.21); it is located in the 'contrib' directory on export or the 'pub/xv' directory at upenn.  XV reduces all images to 8 bits internally, which means it's not a real good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you'll still get only 8-bit color).  Also, you shouldn't use XV to convert full-color images to JPEG, because they'll get color-quantized first. But XV is a fine tool for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG. CAUTION: there is a glitch in versions 2.21 and earlier: be sure to check the \\\"save at normal size\\\" checkbox when saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.  Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package, also available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z. This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The ImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped displays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the basic free JPEG software.  Both of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple image viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest release, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage, said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original. (The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4 decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next xloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said to do the right thing with 24-bit displays.   MS-DOS:  This covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.  One good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files. The current version, 2.4a, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca (129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg24a.zip.  This is a good basic viewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is not flashy, but it's functional.  Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview.  The current version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU and a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and OS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit on the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do). You may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a bit tricky; read the directions carefully!  A shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is also much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use --- more keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a little slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than screen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both are faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip. Requires a VESA graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zip or vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in VESA driver, so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains that the driver is missing.)  A second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around the net for a while, but I don't know any stable archive location for it. The current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway. The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.  The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest revision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good: it's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is poor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see a good JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.  Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can't get *any* of them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you have hi-color hardware, don't use GIF as the intermediate format; try to find a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right thing with hi-color displays.)  The Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS compilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will convert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.  Handmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF. These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in particular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietary JPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format files are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version 2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip. NOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is not readable on non-PC platforms.  Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation package, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI formats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images. A demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.1 is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch161.zip.  NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet's key archive site for PC-related programs is Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20 runs a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document refers to directory (eg) \\\"msdos/graphics\\\" at Simtel20, that really means \\\"pd1:<msdos.graphics>\\\".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should expect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several Internet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives; most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA mirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files in (eg) \\\"/pub/msdos/graphics\\\".  If you have no FTP capability, you can retrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in comp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA, consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.  Microsoft Windows:  There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images. (Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware, due to Windows' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion programs described above inside a Windows DOS window.)  The newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0 is available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip. Requires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers. But it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing...  JView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the decompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can't create new JPEG files, and it doesn't view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it's an excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip. (Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites, including wuarchive.wustl.edu.)  WinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files; it can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter. It has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and slideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow 286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version, which is roughly 25% faster.)  ColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising contender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it has no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the current version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file pub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will be appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)  DVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen mode, not in a window.  OS/2:  The following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151). Note: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator is not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip     32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4. /pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip     16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc11.zip     Image Archiver 1.01: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.     Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip     PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows     (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview84.zip     PMView 0.84: JPEG/GIF/BMP viewer.  GIF viewing very fast, JPEG viewing     fast if you have huge amounts of RAM, otherwise about the same speed     as the above programs.  Strong 24-bit display support.  Shareware, $20.  Macintosh:  Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation, which is part of the QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed. To use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running System 6.0.7 or later.  (If you're running System 6, you must also install the 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get QuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx. (As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0 in several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However, some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)  Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is not the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for details.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format. Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.  The first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images that are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can convert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big improvement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and QuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can view large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it's the only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a typical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down to fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people like this behavior, some don't.  Overall, JPEGView's user interface is very well thought out.  GIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and PICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest version is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later. GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can load and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it's faster with QuickTime.) Note: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try converting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.  JPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx. This will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing. You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.  Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF converter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this program, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.  Apple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and GIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx. Requires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it's really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime. Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display, and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an unsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not intend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called PICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash it, as it's even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much cleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that Picture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)  Storm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter. This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but it will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on older systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can't use it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a downloaded image file to 'JPEG' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.  If your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance), GIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you don't want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.  More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not all can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version 2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG plug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded JPEG file to 'JPEG' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.  Amiga:  (Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at amiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this archive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good choice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)  HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a general image manipulation tool.  It's cheap (shareware, $20) and can read several formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version is available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger than 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.  Rend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM, and GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even capturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The current version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is supposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under AmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)  Viewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.  If you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages that support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24 and Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and ImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting, effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are distributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro), from ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation software for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another well-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.  The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file AmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.  The Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many based on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks to a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without so much as notifying the authors).  Among these are \\\"AugJPEG\\\", \\\"NewAmyJPEG\\\", \\\"VJPEG\\\", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion, anything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space it's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.  Atari ST:  The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc, from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo. These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.  I have not heard of any free or shareware JPEG-capable viewer for Ataris, but surely there must be one by now?  Pointers appreciated.  Acorn Archimedes:  !ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view JPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG, although this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.  Recent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle JPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be found on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by registering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede, The Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).  There's also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write functionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image format conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not necessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST, Cambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.   Portable software for almost any system:  If none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free JPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You'll also need a viewer program. If your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a display with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa or PPM 24-bit image files.  There are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every day.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find the available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case, purchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether the product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can handle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are not and never will be compatible with anyone else's files.   [6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:  Free, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent JPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code, documentation, and some small test files is available from several places. The \\\"official\\\" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9 or 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release is jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don't forget to retrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP. If you are on a PC and don't know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may prefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on CompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip. If you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest comp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34. (If you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ article \\\"How to find sources\\\", referred to at the top of section 6.)  The free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG \\\"JFIF\\\" format and image files in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats. The core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other programs, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have tested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.  We have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use. Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products. We do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in product literature (see the README file in the distribution for details). We hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with anything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.  The Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you'd like to contribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.   [7]  What's all this hoopla about color quantization?  Most people don't have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware. Typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display 256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors.  This process is called \\\"color quantization\\\".  (This is something of a misnomer, \\\"color selection\\\" would be a better term.  We're stuck with the standard usage though.)  Clearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most images, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at the very lowest JPEG quality settings).  Since JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display on 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for *all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what comes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors. This happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a little differently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets \\\"smeared\\\" into a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to display a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image source.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.  (Incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see posted images described as \\\"256-color JPEG\\\".  This tells me that the poster (a) hasn't read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF. JPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but number of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG.)  On the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to 256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its palette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.) For purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to. This is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you're stuck with the sender's quantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image. Furthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantization algorithm, you're out of luck.  For this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware. JPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's display hardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in this area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG images you already have.  With a GIF, you're stuck forevermore with what was sent.  It's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA display, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it's also due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average GIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!  Finally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display hardware already: 15-bit \\\"hi-color\\\" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on workstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already obsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their display.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively. Thus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images in a machine-independent fashion.   [8]  How does JPEG work?  The buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine transforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy coding.  This article's long enough already, so I'm not going to say more than that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ. This is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files /pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in using the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.   [9]  What about lossless JPEG?  There's a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the final output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG algorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few implementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.  Saying \\\"-Q 100\\\" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image. What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say \\\"-sample 1x1\\\" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial JPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)  Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG algorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye, but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.  At this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG provides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees bit-for-bit accuracy.  If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the JBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG lossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with 6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a Huffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.   [10]  Why all the argument about file formats?  Strictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms; it does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations.  Since we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of official standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to \\\"do their own thing\\\", and as a result their programs aren't compatible with anybody else's.  The closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work that's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined two JPEG-based file formats:   * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a \\\"low-end\\\" format that transports     pixels and not much else.   * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is     a \\\"high-end\\\" format that will let you record just about everything you     ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is     a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,     because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different     and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It's not likely that adding JPEG to the     mix will do anything to improve this situation. Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of JPEG-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards.  I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in picture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the TIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well defined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported \\\"lowest common denominator\\\"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.  A particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTime software for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped inside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and QuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are available to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor that handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF by hand; see section 11 for details.  Another particular case is Handmade Software's programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and Image Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF format.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by HSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be used for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This applies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF format by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format files, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)   [11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?  If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read, it's likely to be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:  1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,     followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'JFIF'.  2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a     \\\"raw JPEG\\\" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---     it's worth a try, anyway.  3.  HSI files start with 'hsi1'.  You're out of luck unless you have HSI     software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they     won't decompress properly with non-HSI programs.  4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred     bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for 'JFIF').  Strip off     everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.  5.  Anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are     lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.     If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),     try stripping off everything before that.  In uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is   \\\"begin\\\" line  M_]C_X ...  whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with   \\\"begin\\\" line  M:'-I ...  If you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of downloading non-JFIF files.   [12]  What about arithmetic coding?  The JPEG spec defines two different \\\"back end\\\" modules for the final output of compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed. The choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the file-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)  Unfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the JPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi. Thus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses from these companies.  (The \\\"fair use\\\" doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best.)  At least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify the potential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not* be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.  There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future.  Stay tuned for further details.   [13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?  It would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could decompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially. Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered image loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the first time around.  The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an identical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current free JPEG software.  It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation output.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.) One of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.  In any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original quality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation. (If you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move. If you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but that's a mighty limited capability!)  The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format (PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are ready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot of compression/decompression time this way :-).   [14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?  As stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original full-color data the GIF was made from, it's far better to make a JPEG from that.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from, here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality.  The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to make sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF; that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in section 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors don't convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality will be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)  Experience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best candidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation. Don't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don't expect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created directly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through JPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file, not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).  Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color border around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts (\\\"ghost\\\" edges).  Do yourself a favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows system, XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this.)  cjpeg's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but for GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher Q setting may not be necessary.)  Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually \\\"dithered\\\" to fool your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store. If you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The trouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency color noise; and JPEG can't compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it). To get around this, you want to \\\"smooth\\\" the GIF image before compression. Smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of the compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image than you'd get without smoothing.  With the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing capability is built in.  Try \\\"-smooth 10\\\" or so when converting GIFs. Values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular fine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong smoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image, which you don't want.  If you are an image processing wizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as pnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg's built-in smoother is a LOT faster than pnmconvol...  The upshot of all this is that \\\"cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10\\\" is probably a good starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the image, you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.   ---------------------  For more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in particular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net. \",\" Hello net.

I don't think \\\"extra-scientific\\\" is a very useful phrase in a discussion of the boundaries of science, except as a proposed definiens.  Extra-rational is a better phrase.  In fact, there are quite a number of well-known cases of extra-rational considerations driving science in a useful direction.  For example, Pasteur discovered that racemic acid was a mixture of enantiomers (the origin of stereochemistry) partly because he liked a friend's crank theory of chemical action.  The friend was wrong, but Pasteur's discovery stood.  A prior investigator (Mitscherlich), looking at the same phenomenon, had missed a crucial detail; presumably because he lacked Pasteur's motivation to find something that distinguished racemic acid from tartaric (now we say: d-tartaric) acid.  Again, Pasteur discovered the differential fermentation of enantiomers (tartaric acid again) not because of some rational conviction, but because he was trying to produce yeast that lived on l-tartaric acid.  His notebooks contained fantasies of becoming the \\\"Newton of mirror-image life,\\\" which he never admitted publically.  Perhaps the best example is the discovery that DNA carries genes.  Avery started this work because of one of his students, and ardent Anglophile and Francophobe Canadian, defended Fred Griffiths' discoveries in mice.

I walked by, and they were showing real-time video capture using a (Radious or SuperMac?) card to digitize and make right on the spot quicktime movies.  I think the quicktime they were using was the old one (1.5).     They digitized a guy talking there in 160x2xx something.  It played back quite nicely and in real time.  The guy then expanded the window (resized) to 25x by 3xx (320 in y I think) and the frame rate decreased enough to notice that it wasn't 30fps (or about 30fps) anymore.  It dropped to like 15 fps.  Then he increased it just a bit more, and it dropped to 10<->12 fps.      Then I asked him what Mac he was using... He was using a Quadra (don't know what model, 900?) to do it, and he was telling the guys there that the Quicktime could play back at the same speed even on an LCII.     Well, I spoiled his claim so to say, since a 68040 Quadra Mac was having a little bit of trouble.  And this wasn't even from the hardisk!  This was from memory!

Scalping is illegal but nonetheless present outside the Arena.  Best  strategy, given that you don't mind missing the Anthem (which is OK if B.E. Taylor decides to come back ever again :) ) is to wait until 7:40 or 7:45, when the game is rolling; the scalpers are at this point desperate to sell and will reduce to near or at face value to get rid of their tickets.       Playoffs are a little different in that good seats will go early on;  what's left at 7:45 may be nosebleed material (D, E sections).  Others can add on their opinions as well.\",\" Absolutely.

It is also closer to 4 m in diameter.   You've hit on the real kicker, however. The Centaur is pressure stabilized.  It cannot hold up its own weight without pressure in the tanks. Additionally,  the pressure difference between the two tanks must be maintained to ~+/- 5 psi.  That is rather tight to be rocking and rolling on the train. The pressure  stabilization is how centaur achieves the performance. On numerous occasions (when I was there 88-91) the AF wanted to see what it would take to make  a non-pressure stabilized centaur. The answer -- a centaur not worth launching.   The Atlas/Centaur does not require on-pad integration, however the T4/Centaur does. I believe the on-pad integration is to a great extent due to the  cleanliness requirements and PFL configuration, so maybe something can be  done there........    The addition of LOX/LH facilities is critical as the centaur tops off as it  lifts off. A LHe facility is also needed. I don't know what the proton uses  for fuel, but since they are derived from ICBM's I would suspect that they  use storable propellants which don't have the ullage problem that cryo's  do. If there is no cryo at the sight at all, the addition of these systems  could be big $$, not to mention the real tech transfer issues involved with  providing centaur GSE to Russia.

The Bible does not have a  message -- it has messages.  And some of those are messages of repentance and giving, to turn the other cheek, and do unto the least of these.  But some of the messages are the complete opposite.  Like the isrealites order to  wipe out other tribes including women and children down to cattle, and  punished severely when they were less than complete about the job.  Like jews who are said to have cried out in Matthew, \\\"His blood be upon our heads and our childrens heads\\\" A verse quoted in every pogrom from the crusades to the holocaust.  Have these been misunderstood?  I think not.  They have only been understood too clearly.  It is essential that christians grasp firmly the good the bible teaches, the meek carpenter from Nazareth is a potent  symbol for how we should be, his teachings we must take to heart, but we cannot ignore the other material in the bible which is not to our liking and say those who live by that have misread it.  To say that is only to chose a point of interpretation and declare it normative.  Such can be done with the same legitmacy by anyone.  Instead we must let the text critique the text. Understanding that there is both good and bad in our sacred corpus, we test all things and hold fast to that which is good.   At the risk of sounding heretical (well ok, more heretical) I don't think that doubt is something which requires forgiveness, it is something which requires introspection and reflection.  If that is a sin, then there can be no salvation, for doubt is an inescapble part of being human.  Consider Job.  His friends had no doubt. Whereas Job had no doubt in himself but doubted the wisdom and justice of God.  When God finally did appear he  rebuked the friends and had job make sacrifices for them.

Chris  \",\"Howdy,  I'm a little new to this newsgroup, but I would like to tap some of the knowledge and expertise available here.  The Subject:  After-market cruise controls  The Background: I recently broke my ankle in a road-bicycling accident (4 places, five  screws, yuk! :-( ).  In two weeks I will be returning to Texas (my home) from my school (BYU) in Provo, Utah.  As you can imagine, trying to drive nearly 1300 miles with a broken right ankle isn't just the epitome of a good time.  My car does not have a cruise control, so I would have to do all the pedalling (ha ha) with my messed-up ankle.  My question: What is the general opinion of after-market cruise control units?  I realize that a cheap CC (cruise control) from, say, Pep Boys, isn't going to be as good as a factory or professionally installed unit (if there is such a thing).  And I uderstand that I probably can't expect much in the way of accuracy, looks and that sort of thing;  But anything's gotta be better than trying to drive with a hosed ankle.  I have a 1984 Jeep Cherokee, 4 speed, standard, 4*4, 2.5L engine with kettering(sp?) ignition (y'know, distributor cap, rotor, that set-up--not electronic.  Maybe you could've guessed it being an '84, but I'm just trying to give information as completly as I can).  I found a CC unit for 80 bucks.  It seems to use the vehicles vacuum system  instead of an electric servor/motor.  Is this good or bad?  If I did buy this CC, which vacuum hose should I tap?  It has two speed sensors:  One magnetic, and one that gets a signal from the  negative side of the distributor, kinda like a tach pick-up, or so I understand.  I can use either one.  Which is best?  The manual says (I read it in the store today) that the magnetic/axle set-up is more accurate, but harder to install.  Is there really a big difference?  It has a sensor for the brake pedal, just like other CCs, but does NOT have a sensor for the clutch pedal.  So if I wasn't paying real close attention I might push the clutch in while the cruise is trying to get the speed up.  Which would wind the engine up kinda high until I got my wits about me and turned  the thing off.  I'm pretty coordinated, so this doesn't bother me, if it were for my girlfriends car, *then* it would bother me, but I'm ok with it.  The installation also calls for an attachment to a steady-on brake signal and a switched-on brake signal.  I think I can get a switched brake signal from the correct side of the brake light blade fuse.  Am I right?  But I'm not sure where to get the steady-on brake signal, or, for that matter, what exactly it is?  Any ideas as to what the manufaturer wants and where to get it?  I think I can figure the other things out.  Like how to hook-up the negative side tach-type sensing gizmo and the cabin control unit, and the ground and all that miscellaneous business.  But I need a little help with:   1.  Is it worth the money and safety risk (if any) for such a      device?  2.  Is there any particularly good after-market CC?  3.  Are \\\"professionally\\\" installed CCs signifacantly better and      worth the cabbage?  4.  If the unit I saw (sorry, no manufacturer or model number, just      that it is at Pep Boy and its $80) is sufficient for my simple       needs, how do I get the thing installed properly (specifically,      the questions above)?  My father and I built a \\\"Veep\\\" (Volkswagen powered Jeep CJ-2A) when I was in high school, so I consider myself fairly good with tools, electronics, and cars.  So the installation doesn't scare me.  I just want to be certain that I get the thing installed correctly as my Cherokee is just a wee bit more complicated than my Veep. :-)  I appreciate your time in reading my post, and I would appreciate any expertise or opinion anybody has on the subject.

The study notes in my Bible offer three possible meanings for verse 20. Apparantly it's not as clear to Charles Ryrie as it is to you.  2 Timothy 3:16-17 All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work.  Galations 1:11-12 For I would have you know, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man.  For I neither received it from man,  nor was I taught it, but I receieved it through a revelation of Jesus Christ.  When I read these passages, it was not immediately clear to me what every phrase meant.  I had stop and think about the possible connotations of words, what the intent of the author may have been, wonder if the translator used the correct English word to convey the  same meaning: I had to interpret.  If you want to believe that your  are not interpreting Scripture as you read, there's probably nothing  I can say to change your mind.  But I think it's naive to think that  our culture, experiences, education, do not affect everything we read.   In college, I took an entire course in Biblical interpretation.

None of the above are relevant in my case except the last two maybe (no applications were running, the system software was re-installed, I have no additional hardware). I have found that clearing PRAM appears to help for a while at least (hold down command option P and R on startup). Unfortunately the problem returns suggesting that PRAM is being corrupted by something (system software bug ? - I don't have any non-issue inits in my system). Apparently the Power Manager can be reset by \\\"holding the reset and interrupt buttons while powering up\\\" - Apple's advice - but since the Duo does not have an interrupt button I'm not sure what they mean in this case.

The Roman Empire lasted until 1453, with its transfered capital in Constantinople.  The main reason for it's fall was not so much the sack of Constantinople by the men of the 4th Crusade (who were not Christians - they had been excommunicated down to the last man after attacking the Christian city of Zara in Croatia), but rather the disastorous defeat in the battle of Mazinkert.  After the Turks breached the frontier, it was only a matter of time before the Empire fell, the inability of the Empire to hold onto the rim of Anatolia, with the Ottomans and Rum Seljuks in the middle should be quite obvious to any student of history.  The sack of Constantinople only hastened the inevitable along.  For if the Greeks had wanted to save their empire, why would they not cooperate with the Crusaders when they came to do battle with the Saracens in the 1st-3rd Crusades?  Because of their obstinacy over cooperating with people they considered heretics, even though those \\\"heretics\\\" were fighting for the cause of the Empire and Christendom in doing battle with the Turkish hordes in Anatolia, Edessa, Lebanon, Palastine, and Syria, the some hordes who were to later sack Constantinople, and overrun a third of Europe (the Balkans, Hungary, the Ukraine, the Caucasus, etc.)\",\" There was a Volvo owner that had $3000 dollars worth of improvements to the  looks of the car by hail :). \",\"]I wrote the slash two blues for a bit of humor which seems to be lacking ]in the MOA Owners News, when most of the stuff is \\\"I rode the the first ]day, I saw that, I rode there the second day, I saw this\\\"   I admit it was a surprise to find something interesting to read in  the most boring and worthless mag of all the ones I get.  ]any body out there know were the sense if humor went in people? ]I though I still had mine, but I dunno...

I thought I should, this charge was so constant, so gritted my teeth and    went inside.   The place was cool but reeked of sodden ashes, and was dark at first, for   its stone walls had only window slits. Rags strewed the mud floor around an   iron tripod over embers that vented their smoke through roof beams black   with soot. All looked bare and empty, but in an inner room flies buzzed. As   the door swung shut behind me I saw they came from a man's body lying face   up, naked but for its grimy turban. He was about fifty years old by what   was left of his face - a rifle butt had bashed an eye. The one left slanted,   as with Tartars rather than with Turks.

Anyone keelhauled  so long and furiously I'd never heard. Then abruptly Dro broke into   laughter, quick and simple as child's. Both were a cover for his sense  of guilt, I thought, or hoped. For somehow, despite my boast of irreligion,  Christian massacring 'infidels' was more horrible than the reverse would  have been.   From daybreak on, Armenian villagers poured in from miles around.....  The women plundered happily, chattering like ravens as they picked over  the carcass of Djul. They hauled out every hovel's chattels, the last   scrap of food or cloth, and staggered away, packing pots, saddlebags,   looms, even spinning-wheels.   'Thank you for a lot, Dro,' I said to him back in camp. 'But now I must   leave.'...We shook hands, the captain said 'A bientot, mon camarade.'

Hundreds of feet   down, the fog held, solid as cotton flock. 'Djul lies under that,' said   Dro, pointing. 'Our men also attack from the other sides.'   Then, 'Whee-ee!' - his whistle lined up all at the rock edge. Bayonets  clicked upon carbines. Over plunged Archo, his black haunches rippling;  then followed the staff, the horde - nose to tail, bellies taking the  spur. Armenia in action seemed more like a pageant than war, even though   I heard our Utica brass roar.   As I watched from the height, it took ages for Djul to show clear. A tsing  of machine-gun fire took over from the thumping batteries; cattle lowed,  dogs barked, invisible, while I ate a hunk of cheese and drank from a snow  puddle. Mist at last folded upward as men shouted, at first heard faintly.  The came a shrill wailing.   Now among the cloud-streaks rose darker wisps - smoke. Red glimmered about  house walls of stone or wattle, into dry weeds on roofs. A mosque stood in  clump of trees, thick and green. Through crooked alleys on fire, horsemen  were galloping after figures both mounted and on foot.   'Tartarski!' shouted the gunner by me. Others pantomimed them in escape  over the rocks, while one twisted a bronze shell-nose, loaded, and yanked  breech-cord, firing again and again. Shots wasted, I thought, when by  afternoon I looked in vain for fallen branch or body. But these shots and  the white bursts of shrapnel in the gullies drowned the women's cries.   At length all shooting petered out. I got on my horse and rode down toward  Djul. It burned still but little flame showed now. The way was steep and   tough, through dense scrub. Finally on flatter ground I came out suddenly,  through alders, on smoldering houses.

Between   the breasts one clot, too small for a bullet wound, crusted her homespun   dress.   The next was a boy of ten or less, in rawhide jacket and knee-pants. He   lay face down in the path by several huts. One arm reached out to the   pewter bowl he'd carried, now upset upon its dough. Steel had jabbed   just below his neck, into the spine.

The OT game winner came from Dimitri Yushkevich, just his 5th of the season and his first game winner. The FLYERS never led up until that point in the game. For the Whalers, the loss marked an NHL record 9th OT loss this season.  Roster move:  Gord Hynes was called to to play in place of Ryan McGill  Injuries:  Ryan McGill injured his hand in a fight 4/15 and was scratched.  Lines:  Eklund-Lindros-Recchi Beranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen Lomakin-Butsayev-Conroy Faust-Acton-Brown  Galley-Bowen Yushkevich-Hawgood Carkner-Hynes  Dominic Roussel  Game Summary:  I didn't get TV coverage of the game, and since it was stormy in these parts I didn't have the best radio coverage either. Here's the box score followed by a few things I did pick up:  First Period:  Hartford, Nylander 10, 8:51  Philadelphia, Recchi 53 (Lindros, Brind'Amour), 19:59.8 (pp) Penalties - Verbeek, Har (holding), :55; Carkner, Phi (roughing), 13:53; Houda, Har (interference) 18:43  Second Period:  Hartford, Burt 6 (Cunneyworth, Kron), 2:00  Philadelphia, Bowen 1 (Eklund, Recchi), 7:09  Hartford, Nylander 11 (Zalapski, Sanderson), 9:38 Penalties - Galley, Phi, major-game misconduct (spearing) :58; Verbeek, Har major-game misconduct (spearing), :58; Brown, Phi (tripping), 3:22; Zalapski, Har (tripping), 15:51; Brind'Amour, Phi (slashing), 19:50  Third Period:  Hartford, Kron 14 (Sanderson, Cassels), 1:24 (pp)  Philadelphia, Beranek 15 (Lomakin, Yushkevich), 3:11  Philadelphia, Faust 2 (Brind'Amour, Roussel), 3:38 Penalties - Houda, Har (tripping), 4:20; Hawgood, Phi (holding), 5:30  Overtime:  Philadelphia, Yushkevich 5 (Faust), 1:15. Penalties - None  Power Play:  Philadelphia 1 of 4, Hartford 1 of 4  Goalies:  Philadelphia, Roussel 14-11-5 (30 shots - 26 saves)  Hartford, Lenarduzzi, 1-1-1 (38 - 33)  On the first Hartford goal, Gord Hynes misplayed the puck at the FLYERS blue line and Nylander stripped him and took off.  The Recchi goal was a 2 on 1 with Lindros.  The Bowen goal was just a puck he threw at the net, got a good carom and it ended up behind the goalie.  On the second Nylander goal he got three whacks at the puck before it went in. This is the most frustrating part of the FLYERS defense. Take the body, and if they get one shot and beat you fine. Don't give them another chance. Carkner, Galley and McGill are all terrible about this, I'll bet money at least one of them was the closest FLYER to the play.  That's all I have, my radio got bad after that and I was lucky to know who it was that scored, much less how.  From what I heard, Roussel had a very strong game. After the game, Gene Hart asked Bobby Taylor to pick the three stars of the season rather than of the game. It was Garry Galley #3 for his career high point total (I'm surprised that a former goalie wouldn't look closer at his defensive play), Tommy  Soderstrom #2 for his team record tying 5 shutouts in only about 1/2 a season and, Mark Recchi #1 for his all time high team single season scoring mark. But here's the odd part. He couldn't decide between Lindros and Recchi for number 1. If he picks Recchi as #1 after he had a hard time choosing between him and Lindros, doesn't that make Lindros #2????  What? You wanna know my three stars of the season? Well, since you asked...  #1 Eric Lindros. Eric dominates a game simply by stepping out onto the ice. The difference between the team's record with him and without him is no accident. I believe that the team could have been almost as successful without Recchi. There is no question that this team is significantly better with Eric Lindros on it, and I think that he will deservedly wear the 'C' on his jersey next season.  #2 Tommy Soderstrom. 5 shutouts was second in the league to only Ed Belfour, and Tommy didn't have a Chris Chelios (booo) in front of him. He also didn't play a complete season due to heart problems (sentimental edge here, my family has a history of heart problems). There's no question in my mind that Tommy Soderstrom is this teams goalie of the future, and if Roussel complains again about being number 2 look for him to be traded within 2 years.  #3 Mark Recchi. Again, you can't argue with an all-time team high single season scoring mark. There are an awful lot of teams that didn't have a single player get as many points. Plus, Mark is the only FLYER to play the entire season. Not a tough choice.  Honorable mentions: Rod Brind'Amour topped his single season high point total which he set last year. The difference was that he wasn't on the top line this year and didn't get as much playing time. Then again, he didn't get the defensive attention that he got last year from the other team either.  Dimtri Yushkevich was the teams most consistent defenseman. Yes, he made rookie mistakes, but he was usually fast enough to make up for them. I have a feeling that with his shot he'll score a few more points next year without giving up anything in his own zone, and I suspect that he'll be the teams top defenseman in years to come.  Garry Galley was the team's point leader from defensemen. Again, there are some things you just can't argue with. And he battled with chronic fatigue syndrome, he certainly deserves kudos for only missing one game, and that was against his wishes under doctors orders. But his defensive play often negates his offensive contribution. A little more caution, and a little bit smarter in his own end will make him a much more important part of the team next year.  Brent Fedyk was the leagues biggest improvement over last years point total. But consistency became a problem for him.

They finished 17th overall, will draft 10th in next years entry draft (Quebec had the 1st rounder, though). They scored as many goals as they allowed, 319.  The 8 straight wins is the most since they won 13 in a row in 1985.  I will be sending out final stats as soon as I get the issue of the Hockey News that contains them, since there are no more games for me to go to I have no other way of getting them.

Maybe you missed it amidst the flurry of responses? Yet again, the use of this newsgroup is hampered by people not restricting their posts to matters they have substantial knowledge of.  For cites on MSG, look up almost anything by John W. Olney, a toxicologist who has studied the effects of MSG on the brain and on development.  It is undisputed in the literature that MSG is an excitotoxic food additive, and that its major constituent, glutamate is essentially the premierie neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain (humans included).  Too much in the diet, and the system gets thrown off.  Glutamate and aspartate, also an excitotoxin are necessary in small amounts, and are freely available in many foods, but the amounts added by industry are far above the amounts that would normally be encountered in a ny single food.  By eating lots of junk food, packaged soups, and diet soft drinks, it is possible to jack your blood levels so high, that anyone with a sensitivity to these compounds will suffer numerous *real* physi9logical effects.

Also the Mets (my other least  favorite team) loss to the Rockies made this this a great day and a  great start to the weekend as the Cardinals are on the ESPN tonight.  Big Lee Smith is having a great start and the Cardinals seem to be hitting in the clutch even though they have had a few games with lots of hits and not many runs.  Hopefully with the coaches stress on situational hitting in spring training, the runners LOB will be lower this year (probably due to the high strikeout numbers by Jose and Lankford and Zeile's off year).  I don't know why all the fuss about the Fillies.  The media and all the  Filly fans on r.s.b forget who is right behind them in the standings.   Give the Wild Thing a week or two before he starts blowing some games  and we'll see who is in first then.  I believe the Cardinal pitching  staff is more complete than the Filly staff and that will make the difference.

Building a brute force machine to test 2^40 possible keys if you have the other half from one escrow agent is EASY.  (One chip, one test per microsecond gives you one break every two weeks, and that break gives you all messages involving that phone.)     The XOR scheme so that the files from one escrow agent gives you nothing is an improvement, but notice that XORing with (truely random) bit strings allows for an arbitrary number of escrow agents.  Using + for XOR, SK for the escrowed key, and A and B for two random bit strings, hand SK+A+B, SK+A, and SK+B to three escrow agents.  It is possible to come with an encoding scheme to match any escrow pattern, for example 3 of 4, such that fewer cooperating escrow agents gives the cracking agency no benefit.  --       Robert I.

This complexity has led to some programs' poor TIFF writers making some very bizarre files, other programs' inability to load TIFF images (though they'll save them, of course), and a general inability to interchange images between different environments despite the fact they all think they understand TIFF.  As the saying goes, \\\"It's not me I'm worried about- it's all the abuse of TIFF over the years, and I chalk it all up to the immense (and unnecessary) complexity of the format.  In the words of the TIFF 5.0 spec, Appendix G, page G-1 (capitalized emphasis mine):  \\\"The only problem with this sort of success is that TIFF was designed to be powerful and flexible, at the expense of simplicity.  It takes a fair amount of effort to handle all the options currently defined in this specification (PROBABLY NO APPLICATION DOES A COMPLETE JOB), and that is currently the only way you can be >sure< that you will be able to import any TIFF image, since there are so many image-generating applications out there now.\\\"   If a program (or worse all applications) can't read >every< TIFF image, that means there are some it won't- some that I might have to deal with.

Jews often paid far more than fair market value for the land they bought.    You know, Sam, when people start talking about an International Jewish conspiracy, its really begins to sound like anti-Semitic bull.   The reason there is no conspiracy here is quite simple. Zionists made no bones about what was going on.  There were conferences, publications, etc, all talking about creating a National home for the Jews.    [...]   Because you've never heard of it, its dead?  The fact is, you claimed Israel had to give arabs rights because of (non-existant) International aid.  Then you see that that argument has a hole you could drive a truck through, and again assert that Israel is only democratic within the (unexplained) constraints of one ethnic group. The problem with that argument is that Arabs are allowed to vote for whoever they please.  So, please tell me, Sam, what constraints are there on Israeli democracy that don't exist in other democratic states?   I've never heard anything about the Khazakistani arab population.  Does that mean that they have no history or roots?  When I was at Ben Gurion university in Israel, one of my neighbors was an Israeli arab.

David,    As an economist, I'm sure you can see the flaws in this logic. If the (naive) market is flooded with proprietary, but weak, encryption, then truly strong  encryption will be unable to compete. Suppose the govt had a secret TV broadcast standard, and then sold TVs below cost. Private industry has a better standard, but it's not as widespread due to the govt early flooding of the market with cheap proprietary sets.

Steve -- \",\" PC Magazine, January 12, 1993 had a review of several personal finance management programe, as did PC-Computing, January 1993.  PC World, December 1992 also had articles about Quicken and Managing Your Money. I can email you copies of these articles if you can't find them at your library.  I've been using Managing Your Money for several years, and I have several friends who use Quicken, though I've not used it myself.  My overall impression is that Quicken is a financial accounts manager while Managing Your Money will help you more completely manage your finances.  Here are some features that I believe Managing Your Money and Quicken share:   The ability to keep records for each of your financial accounts:  checking, savings, charge, cash, or brokerage.  You can reconcile  your account statements with the records the program keeps.   The ability to make a budget and track your spending against that  budget.   A Checkfree module which will allow you to use the Checkfree bill  paying service to pay your bills via your modem.    The ability to print checks on your printer.   The ability to keep loan records and set up automatic loan payments.   The ability to import stock quotations to keep your brokerage accounts  up to date.  I know Managing Your Money can do this automatically  via modem.  Quicken probably can as well, but I'm not sure about it.   The ability to export tax information to popular tax preparation  programs.   Here are some features that I believe Managing Your Money has that Quicken does not:   A tax prediction module.  This looks at your accounts and budget to  predict your tax liability for the coming year.  It's usefull to fine  tune your withholding so Uncle Sam doesn't get his due too early.   An insurance and vital records module.  This is a place to keep  records of your insurance policies as well as other vital records.  It can also compute your life expectancy.   A financial analysis module.  This computes compound interest,   effects of inflation, loan payments term or interest, yield to  maturity for bonds, savings account yields, days between dates, and  loan amortization schedules.  It also has functions to help you   decide whether to refinance your mortgage, whether you can afford  a particular home, whether a particular rental property is a good  investment, whether you should buy lease or rent, and whether  a particular investment's cash flow is adequate for your situation.  This module can also help you plan for retirement and for helping  your kids with their tuition.     A net worth module.  This is a place to record all your assets  and liabilities.  Your net worth can be computed from this   information.  Any assets or liabilities recorded in other modules  are automatically included here.   A \\\"desk\\\" module.  This includes a small word processor, a card file  you can use to store names, addresses, phone numbers and other vital  information about friends and associates, a perpetual calander, a  rudimentary calculator, a to-do list, a reminder list, an appointment  list, and a place to record your phone calls (for those who need to  track such things).  Your appointments, reminders and to-do list  can be made to display automatically when you start the program.  There are probably some things listed above that Quicken has, but I'm almost sure that Quicken doesn't do everything I've listed.  If I'm wrong, I'm sure hordes of Quicken devotees will flame me to a crisp.  One thing that Quicken has that Managing Your Money does not yet have is a  Windows version.  MECA software is rumored to be working on a Windows version of Managing Your Money for release late this year.\",\" Well Sweden and Australia, and lord knows wherever else used to drive on the \\\"wrong\\\" side of the road, so the export market might have been larger then than just the UK.   By the 1920s, there was a very active \\\"good roads\\\" movement, which had its origins actually in the 1890s during the bicycle craze, picked up steam in the teens (witness the Linclon Highway Association, 1912 or so, and the US highway support act (real name: something different) in 1916 that first pledged federal aid to states and counties to build decent roads. Also, the experience of widespread use of trucks for domestic transport during WW 1 convinced the government that good raods were crucial to our national defense.  Anyway, by the 20s there were plenty of good roads, at least around urban areas, and they were rapidly expanding into the countryside.  This was the era, after all, of the first auto touring fad, the motel, the auto camp ground, etc. Two good books on the subject spring to mind - Warren Belasco \\\"America on the Road\\\" (title may not be exact - author is) and another called \\\"The Devil Wagon in God's Country\\\" author I forget.  Also, any of John Flink's  or John Bell Rae's auto histories.  As to placement of the steering wheel being arbitrary, by the early teens there were virtually no American cars that did not have the wheel on the left.  In the early days, cars had the wheel on the left, on the right, and even in the middle, as well as sometimes having a tiller instead of a wheel.  This was standardized fairly early on, though I don't know why.

ISA has no bus arbitration, so if two busmastering cards in 1 ISA system try to do DMA xfers on the same DMA channel the system will lock or  crash.(I forget)  Their are 8 DMA channels in an ISA system. 0-7. 0-3 are 8-bit & 4-7 are 16-bit.  The system uses DMA 0, a SoundBlaster uses DMA 1.  I could buy a busmastering XGA-2 video card & a busmastering SCSI HA.  In order for them to work properly, I would have to find out what DMA channel the XGA-2 card uses and then simply configure the SCSI HA to use a different DMA channel for its DMA xfers.  I don't know if multiple DMA xfers can go on at the same time on ISA. I'm not sure if they can on EISA systems either.

Of course if there is some reason why you need to always know the state of modifiers even if your windows don't have the keyborads focus you can always ask for KeyPress events from the root window.  Then you get all the KeyPresses and you always know what have been pressed.   I think this is just a question of how to implement XLookupString. You can always write another function that interprets the KeyPresses as you like.

If you don't have an XUSERFILESEARCHPATH environment variable then set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to be the directory where the BuilderXcessory file is. You can do this using the setenv command under csh. Note that the name ends in .ad so you will have to set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to {BX}/%N.ad to get the app-defaults to load correctly.     To make sure the the app-defaults file can be read by all the users, make sure that a copy of or a link to the app-defaults file exists in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults or  /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults, depending on how your system is set up.     Once you have taken care of this set the *systemDirectory resource to be the directory in which you have installed BX.  For example let's say I've installed BX in /t then my system directory resource should be set like this :  *systemDirectory: /t/builderXcessory\",\"Just a little something I found while reading the Village Voice, which is not noted for its sports coverage, but occasionally the print some interesting features.

Yes (2) What CPU is in the Mac Portable? A low power version of the 68000  running at 15.87 Mhz. (3) Does the Mac Portable run system 7? Yes, although it does use up a  lot of memory. (4) Is memory still availabe for the Portable? There are several vendors  that still make RAM for the Portable. There are two options: Some vendors  sell memory that plugs into the RAM Slot inside the portable. Others sell  memory that plugs into the Processor Direct Slot. Either way, the most  memory you can address is either 8 or 9 megabytes, depending on whether  the Portable is Backlit or not. King Memory and Peripherials in Irvine  California is the cheapest place I know of for Portable memory. 2MB -  $140, 4 MB, $250, and 7 MB $415. I still see several ads in macuser that  are selling 4 MB modules for $450. Wide variety in pricing here. (5) What is the internal HD? Its a Conner CP-3045 40 MB HD with an  average access time of about 25 ms. (6) Is the screen better that the PB 100? Heavens yes! The PB 100 is a  backlit PASSIVE matrix screen which means it fades out on you if you move  your head a few degrees left or right. The Portable has a backlit or  non-backlit ACTIVE Matrix screen which I think is a joy to read.  Other things to consider - Where to get the portable and how much to pay  for it? A good supplier has been SelectTerm in Mass. They were willing to  sell a 2MB Non-backlit Portable with an internal 2400 bps modem for about  $650. Or a 4 MB Backlit Portable with an internal 2400 bps modem for  about $900.   The answer is call around for a good while or you'll pay too much.

I have an appl. which uses 1 window to draw in.  Since I give the user the capability of scaling and zooming as well as allowing the window to be resized, I made a translation table for the Expose & Configure events. The Expose event calls my redraw method while the Configure event calls my rescale method.  The rescale method invokes a \\\"fake\\\" Expose event (actually just calls the redraw w/ an appropriate Expose struct) to draw the data.  Quest 1. When the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R4 (running in either R4 or R5 env.) I get multiple (>4) redraws when the window gets uncovered or the size is changed.  I assume I'm getting cascading events.  Is that right? Any suggestions as to how to handle/trap events in a better way?  Quest 2. When the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R5 I get no Expose events whatsoever.  Do events and/or translation tables act differently in R5?

Game is so different here in Europe compared to NHL. North-ame- ricans are better in small rinks and europeans in large rinks. An average european player from Sweden, Finland, Russian or Tsech/Slovakia is a better  skater and  puckhandler than his NHL colleague. Especially defenders in NHL are mainly slow and clumsy. Sel{nne has also said that in the Finnish Sm-league game is more based on skill than in NHL. In Finland he couldn't get so many  breakaways because defenders here are an average much better skaters than in NHL. Also Alpo Suhonen said that in NHL Sel{nne's speed accentuates because of clumsy defensemen.

Josh.\",\" Every city and suburban police officer I've seen around the Twin Cities in the last two years has carried a semi-auto of some type (different brands though I haven't seen any Glock's).   With regard to this discussion:  We are getting dangerously far from the usual rantings of t.p.g, and close to the realm of r.g, but I'd like to put my two cents worth in.  While there's nothing wrong with a revolver (especially a  large frame S&W in .357 magnum - my favorite) there are valid advantages to semi-autos.  I suggest reading Massad Ayoob's (I know, some people can't stand him and think he's full of bull, but I think that in general his material is very valid and useful) book _The Semi Auto Pistol in Police Work_ (or something  like that).  He defines a number of ways that semi-auto's are different, and that \\\"different is good\\\".  The main advantage is not in increased firepower, but in  more accurate followup shots when you go to single action mode.  There is also a certain \\\"propriatory nature\\\" of each gun that takes some familiarity to  learn.  This may have diminished with time as more criminals become familiar with different models of semi-autos, but it was cited as stopping or at least slowing down criminals who had grabbed a police officers gun.   Yes, but this is best done with a two hand hold.  With a single hand you either pull the gun far off target to cock, or must fire double action.  The DA semi auto has the same advantages plus is always SA after the first shot.    I'm not sure if this is meant to be different from your first point.  In a DA semi-auto you can pull the trigger again to try dropping the hammer on the same round - an advantage you don't have in a revolver where the next trigger pull will always go to the next round (discussing this point now).  This is fine with a dud but what about a hangfire situation?  Granted it's very rare, but your round will now go off confined in the cylinder with no place to go.  Slingshotting the slide on a misfire takes very little time.    Actually with modern revolver designs incorporating hammer blocks this is not necessary or usually recommended.  A revolver would have to fall hard enough and at the right angle to actually break the hammer and driver the firing pin into the round to set it off.   The best speedloader users, especially those using the spring loaded speed loaders are very fast.  A problem is that ejecting the spent cases is a two handed job where dropping the expended magazine is one handed.  This means that while you can be inserting a fresh magazine as soon as the old one clears the gun, with a speed loader you have to go through more motions that will always  take more time.  You also don't have the advantage of tactical reloads (replacing a partial magazine to bring you back to full capacity - the partial magazine can still be used if needed later).     Yes, the time to recognize the problem is just as important as the time to clear it.  Really though, in either a revolver or semi-auto the odds of an actual misfire with factory ammo are awfully small.  You are more likely to get a jam in a semi-auto but even these are exceptionally rare with modern quality guns (Sigs, Glocks, et.al.).     All common semi-auto's can be carried with a round in their chamber without any safety problems.  While I put that out as a statement that I believe, I should say that this applies to all of the ones I've looked at.  For the DA semi's it's no different from the revolver situation:  The guns all have hammer or firing pin blocks.  They also have a safety.  Because there's no real advantage carrying one of these cocked and locked you have the same safety and speed of employment as a revolver, plus the advantage of SA followup shots.  I'm not familiar with SA semi-autos except for the 1911-A1.  I admit that I was initially skeptical about carrying this cocked and locked, but after examining the design, trying to defeat the safeties (gun unloaded of course), and  shooting it a lot, I see no inherent safety problems with it, especially in a thumbreak holster with the strap under the hammer.  This design also gets you more speed for an accurate first shot than a revolver.   Yeah, the infamous Glock.  I still can't figure out how it's worse than a revolver for safety.  If you don't pull the trigger it doesn't go off.  I imagine that if all your revolver shooting was done double action then you could pull the Glock trigger far enough to fire before you realized it.  In addition, if you had developed that nasty habit of keeping your finger on the trigger when holstering your gun and relying on your thumb on the hammer to remind you to take it off before you blew off your foot then you'd have problems when the hammer wasn't there.   I think this is even okay for a riot (as long as it's a small one B^)).   I have the poor man's Beretta (Taurus 99) and consider it inferior as a carry weapon to the Springfield .45 (oops, 9mm vs. 45 arguments are relegated to r.g).  You are right, though.  If you don't hit what you aim at then the shooter/gun combination has failed.  I don't ascribe failures in the the fire real fast with a wonder-nine scenario you mention to the gun.  This is a shooter failure, whether through lack of discipline or lack of training.    9mm's are becoming more popular with crooks too, though the .38 does still lead the list.  And like I said, around here semi-auto's seem the rule for the street cop.  Don't know about the State Patrol however, they may still carry the \\\"Highway Patrolman\\\".

Thank you for the reproach, I really do appreciate it.  I'll try to get better.  Rob, at the same time, I have also learned that some people respond to the gentle approach while others respond only at a harsh rebuke.  Brian K., so far, only responds to the latter.  And I am glad he responds at all.   In both cases of approach,  my intention is to be loving.  I am making no excuse for myself if I am coming across condesending.  I apologize for that.  Rob, sometimes Brian K. comes across as honest. I know this.  But Brian K.  vasillates back and forth.  One post looks honest; the next is an excuse.  Now he wants me to explain the universe in 50 words or less.   I think Brian Kendig is really trying but he is too comfortable with his set of excuses.    I just want Brian K. to be honest with himself.  If he really wants to know, he will ask questions and stop asserting irrelevant excuses which have nothing to do with my God.   I wish Brian would read the Bible for himself and come to his own decisions without being sidetracked with the temptation to mock God.  From my perspective Rob, when I look at Brian Kendig, I see a man standing out in the middle of a highway.  Off into the distance I  see a Mack truck heading right for him, but Brian K. is faced away from the oncoming truck.  He doesn't see it.   Here's is how I see the dialog:   Me:  \\\"Brian K, please step aside before you get run over.\\\"   BK:  \\\"There is no truck.\\\"  Me:  \\\"Turn around at look.\\\"  BK:  \\\"No.\\\"  Me:  \\\"Look!  You will be healthier if you do take a look at      the oncoming truck.\\\"  BK:  \\\"No. Explain to me why trucks exist.\\\"  Me:  \\\"Turn around or you will run over.\\\"  BK:  \\\"No. I won't because I like hiking and tomorrow is Tuesday.\\\"  Me:  \\\"You blind fool!  Why do you choose ignorance? You have nothing       to lose if you look.  But if do not look, you will certainly lose your life.\\\"       I do not want to see you squashed all over the road.  BK:  \\\"It is my life to lose.  I rather not look.       Besides, a truck running over me will not harm me.\\\"       And by the way, I really have an open mind.\\\"   So is my motivation to belittle Brian, or to love Brian the best I know how?     I do not wish to single Brian Kendig out.  Because millions if not billions of people fall into the same category.  Perhaps all people fall have fallen into this category at one time in their lives.  I have. I can now see the truck behind Brian.  My hope is that Brian will look and will see the ramifications of the truck coming towards him.  My hope is that Brian will want to step out of the way.  My fear, though,  is that Brian will instead choose to glue himself to the middle of the highway, where he will certainly get run over.  But if he so chooses, he so chooses, and there is nothing I can do beyond that to change his mind.   For it is his choice.   But at this very moment, Brian hasn't gotten even that far.  He is still at the point where he does not want to look.  Sure he moves his eyeball to appease me, but his head will not turn around to see the entire picture.  So far he is satisfied with his glimpse of the mountains off in the distance. \",\"When I use telix (or kermit) in WIN 3.1, or use telix after exiting windows to dos, telix can not find the serial port.

The name of the company is Secure Communicatiions Technology (Information will be given at the end of this message on how to contact them).     Basically they are disturbed about the announcement for many reasons that we are. More specifically however, Mr. Bryen of Secure Communications brought to light many points that might interest most of the readers.     His belief is that AT&T was made known of the clipper well before the rest of the industry. This is for several reasons, several of which are:   - A company of AT&T's size could never be able to make a decision to use    the new chip on the SAME DAY it was announced.   - Months ago they proposed using their own chip for AT&T's secure telephone    devices. AT&T basically blew them off as being not interested at all.    This stuck them as strange, until now...      Also I spoke with Art Melnick, their cryptographer, he expressed several concerns over the new Clipper Chip:    - The obvious backdoor will be able to let many people decrypt the code.    - Once the key is released to authorities the security of the crypto     system is lost forever. These keys can end up in the hands of any agency     of the government.    - The fact that the escrowed keys never change means that the algorithm     is vulnerable over time to an attacker.    - The classified algorithm may hide another backdoor. But he feels that     it is probably to keep people from forging fake serial numbers, or     changing the keys themselves.    - Additionally he feels that the NSA has probably spent enough time and     money in working on a way to keep this chip from being reversed     engineered, that he feels that reverse engineering it will be very     difficult to do. He feels that they have developed a suitable technique     to protect the chip from this attack. Also he feels that the chip is     hardware encoded with the algorithm and not microcoded onto the chip.  Additonally I spoke with Mr. Melnick about their algorithm. He couldn't tell me much about their new agorithm because it hasn't been patented yet. However he told me a little:   - The algorithm will be released for public review after patents have been    granted for it. This is so the crypto community can see that it is    secure.   - The algorithm is called NEA for New Encryption Algorithm.    The details were sketchy because now it is held as a trade secret    until the patent was issued, but I was told that it will incorporate    the following:      - It will have fast encryption of data (Exact specs not given, but       Mr. Melnick stated \\\"Much faster than what an RS-232 can put out.\\\")      - It is a symmetric cipher, just like IDEA and DES.      - It will use 64 bit data blocks for encryption (like DES and IDEA).      - The key length was not given to me, but Mr. Melnick states that       it is _adujustable_ and is \\\"More than adequate for security.\\\"      - The algorithm is written in C and Assembler in software form, and       can be ported to many platforms (Unlike the the Clipper Chip which       is hardware ONLY and cannot be made into software) This I       consider a definite plus for the NEA for widespread use.      - The algorithm will accomodate public key distribution techniques       such as RSA or Diffie-Hellman. This will also be supported in the       hardware chip.      - Right now the projected cost of the NEA chip will be about 10 dollars       for each!! (Clipper will run 25 each chip [that is if it is produced       enough, which probably won't happen]).      - They currently sell a program called C-COM that uses the algorithm       and a special streaming protocol that does not divide the encrypted       data into \\\"blocks.\\\" This could prevent plaintext attacks if you know       what the block header is. This program operates at all supported       RS-232 speeds and uses the software implementation of the algorithm.      - Most importantly: IT DOES NOT HAVE A BACKDOOR!!    Right now the company is afraid that the new clipper chip will put them out of business. This is a very real possibility. So they really need help in stopping the clipper chip from becoming a standard. If you want to contact them, they can be reached at..

Seems to me the evidence from Great Britain is pretty convincing that  drug legalization is a good idea.  Even such a noted conservative as William F. Buckley supports it.

Here are some observations gained from painful experience:    1. Reactions to chiggers vary greatly from person to person.      Some people get tiny red bites.  Others (like me) are more      sensitive and get fairly large swollen sore-like affairs.    2. Chigger bites are the gift that keeps on giving.  I swear      that these things will itch for months.    3. There is a lot of folklore about chiggers.  I think most of      it is fiction.  I have tried to do research on the critters,      since they have such an effect on me.  The only book I could      find on the subject was a *single* book in UNC's special      collections library.  I have not yet gone through what is      required to get it.    4. Based on my experience and that of my family members, the old      folk remedy of fingernail polish simply doesn't work.  I recall      reading that the theory upon which it is based (that the chiggers      burrow into your skin and continue to party there) is false.  I      think it is more likely that the reaction is to toxins of some      sort the little pests release.  But this is speculation.    5. The *best* approach is prevention.  A couple of things work well.      A good insect repellent (DEET) such as Deep Woods Off liberally      applied to ankles, waistband, etc. is a good start.  There is      another preparation called \\\"Chig Away\\\" that is a combination of      sulfur and some kind of cream (cortisone?) that originally was      prepared for the Army and is not commercially available.  In      the summer I put this on my ankles every morning when I get      up on weekends since I literally can't go outside where we      live (in the country) without serious consequences.  (They      apparently don't like sulfur much at all.  You can use sulfur      as a dust on your body or clothing to repel them.)    6. No amount of prevention will be *completely* successful.  Forget      the fingernail polish.  I have finally settled upon a treatment      that involves topical application of a combination of cortisone      creme (reduces the inflamation and swelling) and benzocaine      (relieves the itch).  I won't tell you all the things I've tried.      Nor will I tell you some of the things my wife does since this      counts as minor surgery and is best not mentioned (I also think      it gains nothing).    7. The swelling and itching can also be significantly relieved      by the application of hot packs, and this seems to speed recovery      as well.  Doctors seem not to care much about chiggers.  The urban and suburban doctors apparently don't encounter them much.  And the rural doctors seem to regard them as a force of nature that one must endure.  I suspect that anyone who could come up with a good treatment for chiggers would make a *lot* of money.\",\"     You haven't fully explained the atheist position.  Many theists believe that there is \\\"no proof of the existence of God\\\" but choose to believe in him anyway.

This isn't a problem with me (everybody needs to have a faith) but if you believe that you can provide a \\\"purely  logical\\\" argument for the nonexistence of God, I'd really like to see it.

Displaying all 256 levels synchronized to the 60Hz display took about 10 seconds. After experimenting with different aperture settings and screen brightnesses we found a range that worked well, giving respectable contrast. The quality of the images was pretty good. There were no visible contrast bands.  To minimize the exposure time the display program built 255 different 1 bit frames. The first contained a dot only for pixels that had value 255, the second only for pixels that had value 254, etc. These frames were stored using a sparse data structure that was very fast to 'or' onto the screen in sequence. Creating these frames sometimes took 5-10 minutes on that old Mac, but the camera shutter was closed during that time anyway. And yes, we wrote directly to the screen memory. Mea culpa.  Our biggest problem was that small images were displayed in the top left corner of the screen instead of the center. It took an extra week to have the film developed and printed, because the processors took the trouble to manually move the all images into the center of the print.

Immerse yourself in it for a minute, and then completely            dissolve in the bath water 1 pound of SUN-evaporated SEA-salt            (regular salt won't work.) and 1 pound of fresh baking-soda.

Among other things, the SEA-salt & Soda Bath neutralizes            the accumulated effects of X-rays, etc., as described in the            book \\\"Born To Be Magnetic, Vol. 2\\\", by Frances Nixon, 1973.                 PRECAUTIONS: Only the ONE person using each bath should            prepare it and drain it.           For at least 30 minutes after taking the bath, stay away            from, and even out of sight of, other people.

To help prevent cancer, eat several almonds every day.                  To help cure cancer, eat several OUNCES of almonds per                 day.

HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE.  Dilute twelve(12) drops of 3%                 hydrogen-peroxide in a glass of pure water (preferably                 DISTILLED) and drink it.  Do this once or twice per day,                 hours before or after eating or drinking anything else.                  Apply 3% hydrogen-peroxide directly to skin cancers                 several times per day.                Use hydrogen-peroxide ONLY if you are taking a good                 daily dose of some of the various anti-oxidants                 described above.                  VITAMIN & MINERAL SUPPLEMENTS are more effective, and                 much less expensive, when COMBINED together in MEGA                 doses into SINGLE tablets made from NATURAL sources.                  Cancer cells can NOT live in a strong (100,000 Maxwell)                 NORTH MAGNETIC FIELD, especially if it is pulsating on                 and off.  [A strong south magnetic field is an                 aphrodisiac.]  In my opinion, ALL types of ionizing-                radiation treatments for cancer should be REPLACED with                 daily 30-minute doses of pulsating 100,000-Maxwell NORTH                 magnetic fields.                  Properly made and operated RADIONICS/PSIONICS MACHINES                 can both diagnose and cure all forms of cancer, as well                 as most other medical problems.

I'm gearing up to    do another one.  I'd some info from you. If you were to move    onto a space colony to live permanently, how big would the colony have    to be for you to view a permanent move as desirable?  Specifically,     How many people do you want to share the colony with?       What physical dimensions does the living are need to have?        Assume 1g living (the colony will rotate).  Assume that you can leave    from time to time for vacations and business trips.  If you're young    enough, assume that you'll raise your children there.  I didn't get a lot of responses, and they were all over the block. Thanx muchly to all those who responded, it is good food for thought.

Hm.  I am not all that great at figuring it out.  But I would maximize the percentage of colony-space that is accessible to humans.  Esecially if there were to be children, since they will figure out how to go everywhere anyways. And everyone, especially me, likes to \\\"go exploring\\\"...I would want to be able to go for a walk and see something different each time...  =============================================================================  For population, I think I would want a substantial town -- big enough to have strangers in it.  This helps get away from the small-town \\\"everybody knows everything\\\" syndrome, which some people like but I don't.  Call it several thousand people.  For physical dimensions, a somewhat similar criterion:  big enough to contain surprises, at least until you spent considerable time getting to know it.  As a more specific rule of thumb, big enough for there to be places at least an hour away on foot.  Call that 5km, which means a 10km circumference if we're talking a sphere.

But I believe the statement I was reacting to was that since the american accounts of events are not fully like the Israeli accounts, the Americans are biased. I just thought that the Israelis had more motivation for bias.  The UN has tried many times to condemn Israel for its gross violation of human rights. However the US has vetoed most such attempts. It is interesting to note that the U.S. is often the only country opposing such condemnation (well the U.S. and Israel). It is also interesting to note that that means other western countries realize these human rights violations. So maybe there are human rights violations going on after all.  \",\"Hello,    way back in the mists of time, I had a set of patches written by Richard Caley (I believe to the standars distribution, patch level 6) which added regular expressions in the .tvtwmrc file, multiple icon regions, squeezable icons, and f.deleteordestroy function.

Like many politicians he cared      Less about ideals          than results      Less about ends          than means      Less about anything          than keeping his job               (and his head).  We might call him A bit brutal Though `firm' would be kinder (And no doubt Stalin, who let nobody go, laughed at his laxness) He didn't like his job; perhaps he no longer hoped for better (Nor feared worse, except regarding his head).  And when these wily Jews With their heads-I-win, tails-you-lose      conundrums Brought forth their madman, His first impulse was to play the Roman: ``I find nothing wrong with him,   See to it yourselves.''  But when they mentioned `King' and `Caesar' His heart froze.  If he killed their madman     He'd start a riot          and lose his job              (and his head)  If he saved the King of the Jews     He'd piss off Caesar          and lose his job              (and his head)  And when his wife told him to have    Nothing to do with the righteous lout She didn't tell him anything    He hadn't already figured out.

His ass is covered---if Herod has no problem, Caesar certainly won't.  The fool can be king of whatever world he wants as long as it's not Caesar's.  ``I'm letting him go,'' he said with a shout. (Looks like he'll last this one out....)  The crowd's reaction puzzled him.   They really wanted him dead. They didn't want the King of the Jews,   They wanted Barabbas instead (And, as Josephus records, they got him)  Oh well, he thought, They all look the same to me. And we'll get Barabbas next time.

For instance, if you put a bullet into a gun that was thought to contain blanks, and someone was killed with such a gun, the person who actually performed the action isn't the murderer (but I guess this is actually made clear in the below definition).   What do you mean by \\\"reasonable?\\\"  [...]  Yes, it is bad to include the word being defined in the definition.  But, even though the series is recursively infinite, I think the meaning can still be deduced.   [math lesson deleted]  Okay, let's look at this situation:  suppose there is a longstanding feud between two families which claim that the other committed some travesty in the distant past.  Each time a member of the one family kills a member of the other, the other family thinks that it is justified in killing a that member of the first family.  Now, let's suppose that this sequence has occurred an infinite number of times.  Or, if you don't like dealing with infinities, suppose that one member of the family goes back into time and essentially begins the whole thing.  That is, there is a never-ending loop of slayings based on some non-existent travesty. How do you resolve this?  Well, they are all murders.  Now, I suppose that this isn't totally applicable to your \\\"problem,\\\" but it still is possible to reduce an uninduced system.  And, in any case, the nested \\\"murderer\\\" in the definition of murder cannot be infintely recursive, given the finite existence of humanity. And, a murder cannot be committed without a killing involved.  So, the first person to intentionally cause someone to get killed is necessarily a murderer.  Is this enough of an induction to solve the apparently unreducable definition?  See, in a totally objective system where all the information is available, such a nested definition isn't really a problem.\",\"     I think this is mostly the fault of the people who write up the literature and price lists being confused themselves. Since there are two possible processor configurations and one of the them doesn't have an FPU it does seem to be an option, even though it really isn't.       Well, then allow me to end your confusion. The C650 ONLY come with an LC040 in the base 4/80 configuration. If you are not getting this configuration then you are getting an FPU.       Good question. I have been wondering that since Feb. 10th.        This is possible, but an option is something that you are supposed to be able to request when you want it. What Apple has done is given the buyer a CHOICE between configurations and not an OPTION.       This is not unclear at all. In fact Apple has included in the ROMs of those machines with LC040s code to recognize the presence of the full 040's FPU and use it. Thereby making the upgrade as easy as switching chips. You pop the LC040 out and pop in a full '040.       They did? I think I would double-check this. It has been stated countless times in this newsgroup by two of the Centris hardware designers that the LC040 and the full '040 are pin compatible and that the C610 can be upgraded to a full '040.\",\"    [flame-bait, pure and simple]   \",\"I am looking for a source for a 4 circuit Sequence flasher.

Burleigh Grimes went from 20+ wins and an ERA of 3 or so in '24 to 13-19 and an ERA around 4 in '25.  He pitched well for several more years.  Carlton won 13 and lost 20 the year after his 27-10 record. (Source: Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract.)      And let's not forget John Tudor, who started 1-5 and finished 21-6 in 1985.  He had a pretty bad ERA when you take Busch Stadium into account at the start of the season.        If I recall, he had a 4.50 ERA in the 1st half and a 3.50 ERA in the 2nd half of last year.        Hmmm, 21 runs in 11 innings.  Suppose he starts 30 more games, and winds up w/200 innings pitched.  If he allows 4 runs a game in the next 189 innings, he'll have a 4.75 ERA or so at the end of the year. (I think I have his totals right.) This is going to be hard to come back from.        My 1st hunch is that Morris is very gutsy, and that he may be pitching through an injury and not telling anyone.  My 2nd guess is that he will be banished to the bullpen the remainder of the season after a few more starts. (Perhaps when Stewart comes off the DL?  Or will Danny Cox, who went 3 or 4 scoreless innings against the Tribe today, start for Morris?  He looks like a really good one.  Gaston is scrambling to find starters, I'd imagine.

The central point I made is that local/state police agencies attempting to play by the rules and get warrants, legit escrowed keys, etc., may find themselves at the mercy of bureaucratic inertia and agency infighting at the federal level.    I disagree that this would assist civil liberties by hobbling the cowboy cops.  It would be a strong incentive, as Vesselin points out, for more police agencies to \\\"go rogue\\\" and try to get keys through more efficient     Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on         a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation         encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to         decipher the message?     A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a                                                        ^^^^^^^^^^         court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.         ^^^^^^^^^^^  The clear implication is that there are \\\"legal\\\" authorizations other than a court order.  Just how leaky are these?  (And who  knows what's in those 7 pages that authorized the NSA?).  There may well arise a black market of sorts _within_ police agencies, in which keys are traded.  Furthermore, the police will be in an excellent position to carry out this kind of thing without being caught.  They already have a communication infrastructure with secure portions.  There are a few laws that I know of, that limit citizens' rights to access police communications (or use the information they get).  It may be very difficult to prove police misuse -- the fact that you have such evidence may itself be evidence that YOU have broken some other law.  Throw in private detectives, who have even fewer policy/constitutional restrictions.  Also consider mercenaries who've \\\"retired\\\" from intelligence agencies.  William Gibson must be loving it.  Great story material.  Don't think it'll happen?    Well, consider e.g. the Michigan State Police, generally a very professional organization, which for years kept \\\"Red Files\\\" on thousands of suspected  commies, knowing full well it was not consititutional.  The standards of evidence were just about zero: people were in the file because they happened to park near a place where, say, a US-China People's Friendship rally was happening -- the police went around writing down license plate numbers.  If you happened to be visiting a friend who lived near the  meeting place, well, the state police wound up filing you as a subversive. (They were eventually found out and a court ruled against carrying on any more such nonsense.  I believe thay may have had to destroy the tapes as well.)  Even with well-meaning cops (and I'm sure there are many), there will  be strong pressure to bend the constitutional safeguards.  We don't need to assume corrupt or unbalanced officers -- it will all be in the interest  of enforcing sensible laws, saving lives, and protecting property.   Compromises will be made by well-meaning officers, facing what (to them)  will be a moral dilemma.  Clipper will make criminals out of cops.  Do we want to do this to our police forces?\",\"I'd *desparately* prefer it if we didn't rehash the same arguments that went on ad infinitum last time.  That's especially true for sci.crypt.  For that matter, I've created alt.privacy.clipper, since the traffic is appearing in *many* different groups right now.  I'm going to focus here on some technical aspects of the plan, hence my followup to sci.crypt.  Frankly, if you're not an absolutist, your feelings may turn on some of these issues.  For example -- with an 80-bit key, simply splitting it into two 40-bit pieces is much less acceptable than other schemes, because it means that if just one repository is, shall we say, overly pliable, a would-be eavesdropper would need to recover just 40 more bits of key.  I need not point out in this newsgroup that that's pretty easy to do by exhaustive search. A slightly more complex scheme -- XOR-ing the key with a random number, and then with its complement -- would produce two 80-bit subkeys, neither of which is useful alone.  That variant is much more resistant to attack.  Clearly, one can get even more sophisticated, to protect the subkeys even more.  Other thoughts...  Some people have noted the size and complexity of the databases necessary.  But the id strings the phones emit could be their back door key, double-encrypted with the escrow repositories' public keys.  For that matter, they could do that only with session keys, and have no back door at all.  In that case, the FBI would have to bring every intercept to the repositories to be decrypted.  This would answer many of the objections along the lines of ``how do you make sure they stop''.  We can even combine that with a variant of the digital telephony back door -- have the switch do the tap, but with a digitally-signed record of the time, phone number, etc, of the call.  That provides proof to the escrow agents that the tap was done in compliance with the terms of the warrant.  I can suggest other variations, too.  Suppose each Clipper chip had 100 public key pairs.  Each would be used ~10 times, after which you'd need more keying material.  (Not a bad idea in any event.)  This could be used to enforce time limits, or rather, usage limits, on each warrant; the keys the repository agents would deliver wouldn't last for very long.  I suspect that the cryptographic algorithm itself is secure.  Apart from the obvious -- why push a weak algorithm when you've already got the back door? -- I think that the government is still genuinely concerned about foreign espionage, especially aimed at commercial targets.  This scheme lets the spooks have their cake and eat it, too.  (I've heard rumors, over the years, that some factions within NSA were unhappy with DES because it was too good.  Not that they couldn't crack it, but it was much too expensive to do so as easily as they'd want.)  They're keeping the details secret so that others don't build their own implementations without the back door.\",\"I've been intently following the MAG thread while waiting for mine to arrive in the mail.

What I am saying is that Roussel can be a #1 netminder.  The GAA difference is less than half a goal per game (less than that after last night), their save percentages are close, and their records are similar.  And with that, I just don't see how you can label Roussel as the most disappointing player on the Flyers this season.  You say Soderstrom played against better competition.  That may very well be, but there is no way of knowing how Roussel would have performed in those games.  Besides, against the better scoring teams like Pittsburgh, the defense is more keyed up than they are against San Jose.   But I'm not just judging Roussel on that game alone.  I've seen him play for the past two seasons in Philly and before that in Hershey.  It's just my opinion, but I think he's got what it takes.  Of course, I thought that about Mark LaForest, too.  But I never did about Wendell Young.  So I'm batting .500 in judging Hershey talent since the Hextall-era.  As for the Rangers game, you can say he was saved by a mistake by the offensive player if you like.  But Rou had his leg in position to make the save.  If he didn't, it wouldn't have mattered if the Rangers player didn't get the puck up or not.  It would have been a goal.  On a breakaway that's what the goalie wants to do, take away as much as possible and force the shooter to beat him.   I seem to remember Roussel doing an excellent job against Pittsurgh on opening night to give the Flyers a tie against the two-time defending champs.  And not to take anything away from Soderstrom because he was senational in that game agains the Habs.  But you can't tell me that a Montreal player had an open net to shoot at some point during that game and just flat out missed it.  Mistakes, both on offense and defense are part of the game.  Or there'd never be shutouts.  Anyway, I'm happy the Flyers have both Soderstrom and Roussel and I'm not going to argue about it anymore.  Besides, with the current 7-game winning streak and expectations soaring for next year, I don't want to piss you off to the point that you don't sell me any tickets next season:-).\",\"  The lengthy article you quote doesn't imply this.  It only states that it is somehow POSSIBLE, not that it is in any way likely.  This is akin to an article saying that it is POSSIBLE that the USAF has several captured UFOs, without supporting the liklihood of such an assertion.   In other words, they were telling a pesky reporter to keep guessing.  Israel maintains this same attitude about nuclear weapons it may or may not have.  The US maintains the same attitude about the presence of nuclear weapons on specific naval craft.  By refusing to acknowledge the existence of such weapons on specific ships, US warships have, I believe, become unwelcome in New Zealand, which has declared itself a nuclear-free-zone.     The USAF has never officially admitted to having any UFOs, either.   This is stated as a fact without supporting evidence.  It would've been more convincing if your reporter had come up with just one name of someone who is sitting in jail, lost to the world, as he suggests. Maybe Elvis, or JFK, somebody.    Let's put it this way: If Israel has put people away without publicizing their arrests or the legal proceedings against them, how has their disappearance been explained?  People have relatives, friends and colleagues, you know.  Israel is not known as a place where people are made to vanish.  Would you care to give us a list of people whose whereabouts are unknown?

An option in the menu contained in the Xterm runs a Fortran subroutine that creats a Tektronics-mode Xterm for displaying some graphics.  Typing a <RET> while the Tektronics-mode Xterm (future reference to this will be \\\"Tek-term\\\") is active makes the Xterm read future keystrokes but does not shift input focus to the Xterm (I'm basing that statement on the fact that the border of the  Tek-term stays the highlighted color and that the Tek-term stays on top of Xterm.  If what I'm describing isn't input focus, let me know.)    The xterm can be brought to the top by clicking the mouse button on it.  Subsequent selections from the Xterm of the menu item that displays graphics  highlihts the border and displays the updated graphics, but does not move  the Tek-term to the top.

Whichever of the windows that is active is always on top of the         inactive one.      2.

I'd like to get some information about this chip. \",\"I live in the San Francisco Bay Area, and word has it that something similar is on its way here.  Since we apparently don't have the sensor base you folks have, they're installing cameras at strategic points along the freeways (initial tests are going to be in the Santa Clara area I'm told), with the video being piped into a command center they're building somewhere in the East Bay.  I'm not sure if frame grabbers or cheap labor will be used to interpret the data, but large multi-colored status displays will show the various routes using different colors to represent the various average speeds for each stretch of highway.  An announcer will sit in front of the status 'wall', and will relay continuous verbal traffic status to those who want to receive it.  They're apparently also looking into licensing a low-AM frequency to be dedicated to providing continuous audio from this system.  In the mean time, they'll set up large incandescent display boards along the test stretch to provide commuters with data on traffic conditions up ahead.  My understanding is that the system is subsidized as a pilot program, and information from it will be available free of charge.  Perhaps the LA system is similarly free or provided at an obviously subsidized rate (read \\\"cheap\\\").  We also have the traffic reports that are broadcast on the SAP audio channel of television channels 2 and 36.  These are verbal reports, qualified with a identification tone to tell in-vehicle receivers like the 'Auto Talk' that the information coming next is applicable to a given area.  In LA, they're probably using some other TV channels, but the concept is the same.  Try setting your stereo TV or VCR to receive the SAP audio channel, and go station jumping to find out which one is broadcasting this information. I believe this program is also subsidized, making the in-vehicle receivers cheap to purchase (and without having to incur monthly fees to use it).  Since the makers of these in-vehicle receivers don't have to pay for the broadcast (this may not be completely true), they likely have no investment in keeping the system up and running when the Cal Trans stuff hits the airwaves.  You may have a nifty little TV audio receiver in your car, nothing more, when this happens.

I am programming  in Turbo C 3.0 and my program is rather large (model large too).  I keep  getting errors that I am running out of memory after a while of running the  program. When I compile the program, it says I have 4.45 meg of RAM so  I can't seem to explain why it crashes.  All it is doing is running in a loop while the operator is idle and after a while of sitting, it will screw up all the variables. This leads me to believe that my stack is filling up and overflowing.    Does the program take memory up when it is calling void functions that do not return anything??   I have been working on this problem for days and I would really appreciate any responce.

In comparison, in  the United States, reported cases of gonorrhea in 1992 continued an overall  decreasing trend (1). This report summarizes an analysis of the increase in  gonorrhea in Colorado in 1992 and characterizes trends in the occurrence of  this disease from 1985 through 1992.       In 1992, 4679 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the Colorado Department  of Health (CDH) compared with 3901 cases reported in 1991. During 1992,  reported cases increased 22.7% and 17.5% among females and males, respectively  (Table 1). Similar increases occurred among blacks, whites, and Hispanics  (15.6%, 15.1%, and 15.9%, respectively); however, the number of reported cases  with race not specified increased 88% from 1991 to 1992 and constituted 9.7%  of all reported cases in 1992. Although the largest proportional increases by  age groups occurred among persons aged 35-44 years (80.4%) and greater than or  equal to 45 years (87.7%), these age groups accounted for only 11.0% of all  reported cases in 1992. Persons in the 15-19-year age group accounted for the  largest number of reported cases of gonorrhea during 1992 and the highest age  group-specific rate (639 per 100,000).       Reported cases of gonorrhea increased 32.9% in the five-county Denver  metropolitan area (1990 population: 1,629,466) but decreased elsewhere in the  state (Table 1). Half the cases of gonorrhea in the Denver metropolitan area  occurred in 8.4% (34) of the census tracts; these represent neighborhoods  considered by sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)/acquired immunodeficiency  syndrome (AIDS) field staff to be the focus of gang and drug activity.       When compared with 1991, the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed among  men in the Denver Metro Health Clinic (DMHC, the primary public STD clinic in  the Denver metropolitan area) increased 33% in 1992, and the number of visits  by males to the clinic increased 2.4%. Concurrently, the number of cases  diagnosed among women increased by 1%. Among self-identified heterosexual men,  the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed at DMHC increased 33% and comprised  94% of all cases diagnosed in males, while the number of cases diagnosed among  self-identified homosexual men remained low (71 and 74 in 1991 and 1992,  respectively).       Four selected laboratories in the metropolitan Denver area (i.e., HMO,  university hospital, nonprofit family planning, and commercial) were contacted  to determine whether gonorrhea culture-positivity rates increased. Gonorrhea  culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories contacted increased  23%-33% from 1991 to 1992, while the rate was virtually unchanged in the  fourth (i.e., nonprofit family planning).       From 1985 through 1991, reported cases of gonorrhea among whites and  Hispanics in Colorado decreased; in comparison, reported cases among blacks   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 14 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  increased since 1988 (Figure 1). During 1988-1992, the population in Colorado  increased 9.9% for blacks, 9.8% for Hispanics, and 4.5% for whites. In 1992,  the gonorrhea rate for blacks (1935 per 100,000 persons) was 57 times that for  whites (34 per 100,000) and 12 times that for Hispanics (156 per 100,000)  (Table 1). Among black females, reported cases of gonorrhea increased from  1988 through 1992 in the 15-19-year age group; among black males, cases  increased from 1989 through 1992 in both the 15-19-and 20-24-year age groups.

Surveillance and Information Systems Br,  Div of Sexually Transmitted Diseases and HIV Prevention, National Center for  Prevention Svcs, CDC.   Editorial Note: The increase in reported gonorrhea cases in Colorado in 1992  may represent an overall increase in the occurrence of this disease or more  complete reporting stimulated by visitations to laboratories by CDH  surveillance staff during 1991-1992. The increases in confirmed gonorrhea  cases at DMHC and in culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories  suggest a real increase in gonorrhea rather than a reporting artifact.  However, the stable culture-positivity rate in the nonprofit family planning  laboratory (which serves a network of clinics statewide) indicates that the  gonorrhea increase did not uniformly affect all segments of the population.       One possible explanation for the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in  Colorado may be gang- and drug-related sexual behavior, as implicated in a  recent outbreak of drug-resistant gonorrhea and other STDs in Colorado Springs  (2). Although the high morbidity census tracts in the Denver metropolitan area  coincide with areas of gang and drug activity, this hypothesis requires  further assessment. To examine the possible role of drug use -- implicated  previously as a factor contributing to the national increase in syphilis (3-6)  -- the CDH STD/AIDS program is collecting information from all persons in whom  gonorrhea is diagnosed regarding drug use, exchange of sex for money or drugs,  and gang affiliation.       The gonorrhea rate for blacks in Colorado substantially exceeds the  national health objective for the year 2000 (1300 per 100,000) (objective  19.1a) (7). Race is likely a risk marker rather than a risk factor for  gonorrhea and other STDs. Risk markers may be useful for identifying groups at  greatest risk for STDs and for targeting prevention efforts. Moreover, race- specific variation in STD rates may reflect differences in factors such as  socioeconomic status, access to medical care, and high-risk behaviors.       In response to the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in Colorado,  interventions initiated by the CDH STD/AIDS program include 1) targeting  partner notification in the Denver metropolitan area to persons in groups at  increased risk (e.g., 15-19-year-old black females and 20-24-year-old black  males); 2) implementing a media campaign (e.g., public service radio   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 15 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  announcements, signs on city buses, newspaper advertisements, and posters in  schools and clinics) to promote awareness of STD risk and prevention targeted  primarily at high-risk groups, and 3) developing teams of peer educators to  perform educational outreach in high-risk neighborhoods. The educational  interventions are being developed and implemented with the assistance of  members of the target groups and with input from a forum of community leaders  and health-care providers.

Child safety seats and safety  belts can substantially reduce this loss (2). From 1977 through 1985, all 50  states passed legislation requiring the use of child safety seats or safety  belts for children. Although these laws reduce injuries to young children by  an estimated 8%-59% (3,4), motor-vehicle crash-related injuries remain a major  cause of disability and death among U.S. children (1), while the use of  occupant restraints among children decreases inversely with age (84% usage for  those aged 0-4 years; 57%, aged 5-11 years; and 29%, aged 12-18 years) (5). In  addition, parents who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to  use restraints for their children (6). To characterize the association between  adult safety-belt use and adult-reported consistent use of occupant restraints  for the youngest child aged less than 11 years within a household, CDC  analyzed data obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System  (BRFSS) during 1988 and 1989. This report summarizes the findings from this  study.       Data were available for 20,905 respondents aged greater than or equal to  18 years in 11 states * that participated in BRFSS -- a population-based,  random-digit-dialed telephone survey -- and administered a standard Injury  Control and Child Safety Module developed by CDC. Of these respondents, 5499  (26%) had a child aged less than 11 years in their household. Each respondent  was asked to specify the child's age and the frequency of restraint use for  that child. The two categories of child restraint and adult safety-belt use in  this analysis were 1) consistent use (i.e., always buckle up) and 2) less than  consistent use (i.e., almost always, sometimes, rarely, or never buckle up).  Data were weighted to provide estimates representative of each state. Software  for Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) (7) was used to calculate point estimates  and confidence intervals. Statistically significant differences were defined  by p values of less than 0.05.       Each of the 11 states had some type of child restraint law. Of these, six  (Arizona, Kentucky, Maine, Nebraska, Rhode Island, and West Virginia) had no  law requiring adults to use safety belts; four (Idaho, Maryland, Pennsylvania,  and Washington) had a secondary enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., a  vehicle had to be stopped for a traffic violation before a citation for nonuse  of safety belts could be issued); and one state (New York) had a primary  enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., vehicles could be stopped for a  safety-belt law violation alone). In nine states, child-passenger protection   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 17 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  laws included all children aged less than 5 years, but the other two states  used both age and size of the child as criteria for mandatory restraint use.  The analysis in this report subgrouped states into 1) those having a law  requiring adult safety-belt use (law states), and 2) those without such a law  (no-law states).       Overall, 21% of children aged less than 11 years reportedly were not  consistently restrained during automobile travel. Both child restraint use and  adult restraint use were significantly higher (p less than 0.05, chi-square  test) in law states than in no-law states (81.1% versus 74.3% and 58.7% versus  43.2%, respectively).       High rates of restraint use for children aged less than or equal to 1  year were reported by both adults indicating consistent and less than  consistent safety-belt use (Figure 1). Adults with consistent use reported  high rates of child-occupant restraint use regardless of the child's age  (range: 95.5% for 1-year-olds to 84.7% for 10-year-olds). In comparison, for  adults reporting less than consistent safety-belt use, the rate of child- occupant restraint use declined sharply by the age of the child (range: 93.1%  for 1-year-olds to 28.8% for 10-year-olds). When comparing children of  consistent adult safety-belt users with children of less than consistent adult  safety-belt users, 95% confidence intervals overlap for the two youngest age  groups (i.e., aged less than 1 and 1 year).       Reported child-occupant restraint use in law states generally exceeded  that in no-law states, regardless of age of child (Table 1). In addition,  higher adult educational attainment was significantly associated with  increased restraint use for children, a factor that has also been associated  with increased adult safety-belt use (8).   Reported by: National Center for Injury Prevention and Control; National  Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC.   Editorial Note: The findings in this report are consistent with others  indicating that adults who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely  to employ occupant restraints for their children (6,9). Because these  nonbelted adults are at increased risk of crashing and more likely to exhibit  other risk-taking behaviors, children traveling with them may be at greater  risk for motor-vehicle injury (10).       Educational attainment of adult respondents was inversely associated with  child restraint use in this report. Accordingly, occupant-protection programs  should be promoted among parents with low educational attainment. Because low  educational attainment is often associated with low socioeconomic status, such  programs should be offered to adults through health-care facilities that serve  low-income communities or through federal programs (i.e., Head Start) that are  directed at parents with young children.       Injury-prevention programs emphasize restraining young children. In  addition, however, efforts must be intensified to protect child occupants as   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 18 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  they become older. Parents, especially those with low educational attainment,  those who do not consistently wear safety belts, and those from states that do  not have mandatory safety-belt use laws, should be encouraged to wear safety  belts and to protect their children by using approved child safety seats and  safety belts. Finally, the increased use of restraints among children may  increase their likelihood of using safety belts when they become teenagers --  the age group characterized by the lowest rate of safety-belt use and the  highest rate of fatal crashes (5).

SURVEILLANCE FOR AND COMPARISON OF BIRTH DEFECT PREVALENCES                                IN TWO GEOGRAPHIC                          AREAS -- UNITED STATES, 1983-88        Problem/Condition: CDC and some states have developed surveillance  systems to monitor the birth prevalence of major defects.       Reporting Period Covered: This report covers birth defects surveillance  in metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia, and selected jurisdictions in California for  the years 1983-1988.       Description of System: The California Birth Defects Monitoring Program  and the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program are two population- based surveillance systems that employ similar data collection methods. The  prevalence estimates for 44 diagnostic categories were based on data for 1983- 1988 for 639,837 births in California and 152,970 births in metropolitan  Atlanta. The prevalences in the two areas were compared, adjusting for race,  sex, and maternal age by using Poisson regression.       Results: Regional differences in the prevalence of aortic stenosis, fetal  alcohol syndrome, hip dislocation/dysplasia, microcephalus, obstruction of the  kidney/ureter, and scoliosis/lordosis may be attributable to general  diagnostic variability. However, differences in the prevalences of arm/hand  limb reduction, encephalocele, spina bifida, or trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) are  probably not attributable to differences in ascertainment, because these  defects are relatively easy to diagnose.       Interpretation: Regional differences in prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy  termination may affect prevalences of trisomy 21 and spina bifida. However,  the reason for differences in arm/hand reduction is unknown, but may be  related to variability in environmental exposure, heterogeneity in the gene  pool, or random variation.       Actions Taken: Because of the similarities of these data bases, several  collaborative studies are being implemented. In particular, the differences in  the birth prevalence of spina bifida and Down syndrome will focus attention on  the impact of prenatal diagnosis.

INFLUENZA -- UNITED STATES, 1988-89       Problem/Condition: CDC monitors the emergence and spread of new influenza  virus variants and the impact of influenza on morbidity and mortality annually  from October through May.       Reporting Period Covered: This report covers U.S. influenza surveillance  conducted from October 1988 through May 1989.       Description of System: Weekly reports from the vital statistics offices  of 121 cities provided an index of influenza's impact on mortality; 58 WHO  collaborating laboratories reported weekly identification of influenza  viruses; weekly morbidity reports were received both from the state and  territorial epidemiologists and from 153 sentinel family practice physicians.  Nonsystematic reports of outbreaks and unusual illnesses were received  throughout the year.       Results: During the 1988-89 influenza season, influenza A(H1N1) and B  viruses were identified in the United States with essentially equal frequency  overall, although both regional and temporal patterns of predominance shifted  over the course of the season. Throughout the season increases in the indices  of influenza morbidity in regions where influenza A(H1N1) predominated were  similar to increases in regions where influenza B predominated. Only 7% of  identified viruses were influenza A(H3N2), but isolations of this subtype  increased as the season waned, and it subsequently predominated during the  1989-90 season. During the 1988-89 season outbreaks in nursing homes were  reported in association with influenza B and A(H3N2) but not influenza  A(H1N1).       Interpretation: The alternating temporal and geographic predominance of  influenza strains A(H1N1) and B during the 1988-89 season emphasizes the  importance of continual attention to regional viral strain surveillance, since  amantadine is effective only for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A.       Actions Taken: Weekly interim analyses of surveillance data produced  throughout the season allow physicians and public health officials to make  informed choices regarding appropriate use of amantadine. CDC's annual  surveillance allows the observed viral variants to be assessed as candidates  for inclusion as components in vaccines used in subsequent influenza seasons.  Authors: Louisa E.

Copyright 1993, The University of Arizona                   High Tech Assisted Reproductive Technologies  Following the birth of the first in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF- ET) baby in 1978, a host of assisted reproductive technologies have been  developed that include IVF-ET, gamete intrafallopian tube transfer (GIFT),  embryo cryopreservation (freezing) and gamete micromanipulation. Together,  these technologies are referred to as the high-tech assisted reproductive  technology (ART) procedures.   Ovulation induction, sperm insemination and surgery for tubal disease and/or  pathology still are the mainstays of the therapies available for infertility  management. However, when these fail, it almost always is appropriate to  proceed with one of the ART procedures.   Therefore, in addition to a comprehensive basic and general infertility  service at The University of Arizona Center for Reproductive Endocrinology and  Infertility, there is a program of Assisted Reproduction that specializes in  ART procedures. This program serves as a tertiary provider for those patients  in the state of Arizona whose infertility problems cannot be resolved by the  traditional therapies.   The following article (on back) describes the ART procedures available in our  Center, clarifies appropriate applications for each, and considers the  realistic expectations for their success. Procedures included are:   o in vitro  o fertilization - embryo transfer (IVF-ET),  gamete intrafallopian tube    transfer  o (GIFT),  cryopreservation of human embryos and  gamete micromanipulation.  This article also considers ongoing research in our program that is directed  towards improved success of these technologies.

This technology involves biopsying the preimplantation human embryo and then  subjecting the biopsied cells to genetic analysis using either DNA  amplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization.   There are recent reports of the successful application of DNA amplification by  other centers, for example, for diagnosis of the genes for cystic fibrosis and  hemophilia. We hope to apply and further focus fluorescent in situ  hybridization technology for probing the X chromosome, the identification of  which will provide a scientific basis for counselling patients who exhibit  sex-linked disorders.   The considerable clinical application of such technology lies in the fact that  it circumvents the need for prenatal diagnosis, in addition to the possibility  of a subsequent termination of affected fetuses, in order to avoid the birth  of affected children.

In Vitro Fertilization - Embryo Transfer is the core ART procedure of our  Assisted Reproduction Program.  This procedure involves retrieval of  unfertilized eggs from the ovary, their insemination in vitro in a dish, and  the culture of resultant embryos for 1 or 2 days, before they are transferred  to the patient's uterus. All cultures are maintained in an incubator under  strictly controlled atmospheric and temperature conditions. Before being  processed for use in insemination, semen samples are evaluated in our  andrology laboratory using both subjective light microscopy and computer-  HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 25 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  assisted semen analyses. To ensure an adequate number of eggs with which to  perform IVF-ET, or indeed, GIFT, follicular development is typically  stimulated, with gonadotropins (perganol, metrodin), gonadotropin releasing  hormone (GnRH, Factrel, lutrepulse) and/or GnRH analogues (lupron, Depo  lupron, synarel). Occasionally, however, IVF-ET is accomplished with eggs  obtained in non-stimulated cycles. While some programs utilize laparoscopic  egg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia,  we undertake the less costly approach of ultrasound-guided retrieval in our  Infertility Unit, with the patient sedated.        Couples who resort to IVF-ET exhibit such pathologies as tubal  deficiencies, ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, and/or mild forms of male  factor infertility.  According to the United States IVF Registry, the overall  success rate for IVF-ET nationwide has stabilized at about 14 percent per  cycle. Results from our program, involving 86 patients who have undergone 173  IVF-ET cycles, reflect a comparable success rate.       Nevertheless, the overall incidence of success with this procedure is  disconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiological  factors that limit achievement of a higher percentage of pregnancies.  Well  recognized predictors of outcome include patient age, response to exogenous  ovarian stimulation, quality of sperm and number of repeated IVF-ET cycle  attempts. However, among these, age is the single most significant determinant  of conception. Therefore, it is critical that such patients are referred to an  Assisted Reproduction Program at the earliest opportunity following failure of  traditional therapies.       The underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has not  been clearly delineated beyond recognition that: 1) the number of eggs  available for retrieval declines markedly with age; 2) fertilization rates  significantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over 40 years;  and 3) provided the appropriate hormonal background is present, age is  unrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy. Ongoing research in our  Center, therefore, is investigating physiological changes in the egg that may  be impacted by age. We have determined that more than 50 percent of eggs that  fail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal, and that a significant  proportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age. Currently,  the only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from a donor. Our  program has initiated recruitment of volunteer egg donors to satisfy the needs  of a list of recipients interested in this form of therapy.        GIFT - This high-tech ART procedure is performed in the operating room,  usually with the use of a laparoscope and, in contrast to IVF-ET, involves  introducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the Fallopian  tube (an average of 3 eggs/tube). Under these circumstances, fertilization  occurs in vivo and, if excess eggs are retrieved, the remainder undergo IVF,  with subsequent options for embryo transfer in that cycle, or freezing for  transfer in a subsequent cycle. This ART procedure is applied to cases in   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 26 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  which there is at least one patent Fallopian tube but the couple has such  pathologies as ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, male factor infertility  and/or idiopathic infertility.          The data reported in the United States IVF Registry for 1985 through 1990  indicate that the overall success rate with GIFT is higher than that obtained  with the IVF-ET technique (range of clinical pregnancies for GIFT is 24 to 36  percent and for IVF-ET 14 to 18 percent). In view of this fact, one might  expect more patients to be treated with GIFT than IVF-ET. However, in our  program we have taken into account three basic concerns which, while  substantially reducing the number of GIFT cycles performed, benefit the  patient. These concerns are: 1) the increased costs associated with performing  a procedure in the operating room; 2) the risks, albeit minimal, of undergoing  general anesthesia; and 3) the considerable benefits to be accrued from  obtaining direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the eggs,  and the developmental competency of resultant embryos.       The increased success with GIFT undoubtedly reflects the artificial  environment provided by the laboratory in the IVF-ET procedure. Between  January 1, 1991, and December 31, 1992, we have performed a total of 12 GIFT  cycles, with an overall success rate of 20 percent.       Embryo cryopreservation, or freezing, is applied in our program when  embryos result from residual GIFT eggs or from non-transferred IVF embryos.  This procedure not only provides patients with a subsequent opportunity for  success at much reduced costs, but also circumvents the legal and ethical  issues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos. Therefore, as stipulated  by the American Fertility Society ethical guidelines for ART programs, from  both a practical and an ethical standpoint, all Assisted Reproduction programs  should have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys.       Gamete Micromanipulation - This ART procedure, which is still very new,  is applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen but  who have severe male factor infertility (less than 10 million sperm/ml in  combination with fewer than 20 perccent motile sperm, and/or less than 10  percent sperm with normal morphology). We are currently developing the  procedure of sub-zonal insertion (SZI), which entails injecting sperm under  the coating around the egg, the barrier normally penetrated by the sperm  through enzymatic digestion.       Available data from SZI programs world-wide indicate that only 5 to 10  percent of SZI cycles result in a pregnancy. This statistic undoubtedly  relates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the sperm.  Therefore, we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniques  for the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation. Such  efforts are unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that this technology  offers the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patients to  establish conception.

[1]  Born 1964 Secretary-Typist Azsantekmontazh Trust Sumgait Construction and Installation Administration Secretary of the SMU Komsomol Organization  Resident at Building 17/33B, Apartment 15 Microdistrict No. 3 Sumgait [Azerbaijan]   On the 27th my sister Marina and I went to the movies the seven o'clock show, at the theater that is across from the City Party Committee, about 50 yards  away. The SK theater. They were showing an Argentinian film, \\\"The Abyss.\\\"  Before the film we noticed about 60 to 70 people standing near the podium at  the City Party Committee, but they were silent, there's no conversation  whatsoever, and we couldn't figure out what was going on. That is, we knew it  was about Karabagh, but what it was exactly, what they were talking about, if  someone gave a speech or not, we didn't know. We bought our tickets. There  were 30 or 40 people in the theater. This was a very small number for that  large movie theater. The film started. About 30 minutes later they stopped the film. A crowd burst in. About 60 people. They came up onto the stage. Well  mostly they were young people, from 16 to 23 years old. They demanded that an  Armenian woman come up onto the stage. They used foul language and said that  they were going to show what Azerbaijanis were capable of, what they could do  to Armenian girls. I thought that's what they meant because they had demanded  a girl specifically. Marina and I were sitting together. I told her to move  over, there were some Russian girls sitting nearby. So that if someone  recognized me or if something happened, they would take me, and not Marina.  It got quiet, 2 or 3 girls jumped up to run out, but the door was closed--it's only opened at the end of the   show--and they returned to their seats.  Everyone in the theater was looking at one another, Russians, Azerbaijanis,  people of various nationalities. But no one reacted at all, no one in the  auditorium made a sound. They were silent, looking at one another, and  gradually started to leave. Some guy, a really fat one, says, \\\"OK, we've  scared them enough, let's leave.\\\" They leave slowly, pompously. It seemed to  me that those people were not themselves. Either they had smoked a bunch of  \\\"anasha\\\", or had taken something else, because they all looked beastly, like  they were ready to tear anyone apart. Then it was all over, as though nothing  had happened at all. The film started up again, it was one of those cheerful  films which should have only brought pleasure, made you happy to be alive. We  could barely sit to the end. So it had started at seven it was over by nine,  and it was dark . . .  Marina and I were walking home, Lenin Street, that's the center of town. Lenin Street was packed, just packed with young people. They were shouting,  something about Karabagh and something about Armenians. We weren't especially  listening, because the way we were feeling we didn't know if we were going to  make it home or not, and just what had happened anyway? Public transportation  wasn't running. Incidentally, when we came out of the theater we saw police,  policemen standing there. The director of the movie theater was looking at the doors, because when they were leaving they had broken the glass, the doors  there are basically all glass. Everything was broken. He stood there grief- stricken, but looking as though nothing really big had happened, like some  naughty boys had just broken them quite by accident, with a slingshot. Well,  since he looked more or less calm I decided that, nothing all that super  serious had happened. We went out very slowly; we wanted to catch a bus, we  live literally one stop away. We didn't want to go on foot, not because it was dark, but because something might happen. We flagged down a cab, but the  driver didn't want to take us. We told him we live near the bus station, and  he said he'd take us to the bus station and not a yard farther. I said, well,  OK . . .  So we got into the cab and managed to get there. Something incredible was  happening at the bus station. There was a traffic jam. Public transportation  was at a standstill and everyone was shouting \\\"Ka-ra-bagh,\\\" they're not going  to give up Karabagh. I go home and tell my family what's going on, and there's immediate panic in the house. Mamma says, what should we do? Like the end had  come, they were going to come, kill us, that's it . . . Somehow we managed to  cheer ourselves up: Nothing that bad could happen. Where are we living anyway, just what kind of social order do we have? Somehow we manage to calm Mamma  down. And we went to bed. But no one could sleep. Everyone made as though  nothing had happened.  That was on Saturday. In short, the day went by. We didn't go anywhere and  didn't call our relatives. No one did anything. Because . . . life goes on. That day I realized something was approaching, but what exactly, I couldn't guess.  On the 28th everything was like it was supposed to be, we lived like we always had. There were five of us at home: Mamma, Papa and us, three sisters: Lyuda,  Marina, and I. My sister Lyuda was in Yerevan at the time. We sat at home and  no one went out. Later we learned that a demonstration had started that  morning. It all started . . . They were smashing up stores. We were sitting at home and didn't know anything about it. Then a girlfriend of mine, Lyuda  Zimogliad, came by at around three o'clock I think. We worked together, we did our apprenticeships together, she's a Russian girl. She said that something awful was happening in town. I asked, \\\"Don't they want Armenians? Well what  are they after, if they're already in that state?\\\" She says, no, nothing like  that, it's just a demonstration, but it's awful to watch it. Somehow, it feels like a war has broken out. Public transportation has been stopped . . . The  cabs, the buses, well it's just a nightmare.  Then Papa decides to go to the drugstore, my mother was having allergy  problems at the time . . . He left the house and our neighbor, Aunt Vera, asked him, \\\"Where are you going? Stop! There are such terrible things going on in the courtyard; aren't you afraid to go out?\\\" Papa didn't know what she was talking about. She simply pushed him back into the entryway. He came home  and told Mamma. Mamma said, \\\"Well, if Aunt Vera was talking like that it means that something is really going on.\\\" But we didn't go see her, she's a Russian, she lives across from us. I had to see my friend out. Around five o'clock I  tell Lyuda, \\\"Ok, look, it's time for you to go, it's late already, I'll see  you out.\\\" Mamma says, \\\"You don't need to go, it's too late already, you can  see what the situation in town is.\\\" So we decided to stay home. Dinner was  ready. Mamma says, \\\"Let her eat with us, then she can go.\\\" We sat down at the  table. But no one was hungry, no one was in the mood, we just put everything  out on the table to calm ourselves down, and make it appear that we're eating. We turned on the television, and the show \\\"In Fairy-Tale Land\\\" was coming on.  We cleared the table.  We hear some noise out in the courtyard. I go out on the balcony, but I can't  see what's going on, because the noise is coming from the direction of the bus station, and there is a 9-story building in the way. There is mob of people  . . . I can't figure out what's happening. They're shouting something, looking somewhere, I can't make out what is going on. I go down to a neighbor, she's  an Azerbaijani; we've been friends of her family for about 25 years. I go down to look from their place. I see people shouting, looking at the 5-and 9-story  buildings near the bus station. Just then soldiers set upon them, about 20  people, with clubs. The mob runs off in different directions. I even see  several people from our building. They are looking and laughing . . . I decide that means it's not all that bad if they are laughing: it means they're not  killing anyone. But now the crowd suddenly dashes toward the soldiers. One of  the soldiers cannot manage to get away, they start stomping on him with their  feet, everyone's kicking him . . . I become ill and go home, and explain in  general terms that horrible things are going on out there . . .  can't speak . . . Well, they've probably killed that soldier, the way that crowd is . . . If each of them kicked him just once . . . They took his club away from him and started to beat him with it. But it was far away and I couldn't see if he got up and left or not.  I become terrified and go home and say, \\\"Lyuda, don't go anywhere, stay at our place, because if you go out they could kill you or . . . \\\" Then the crowd  runs over closer toward our building and stands at the 12-story building and  starts shouting something. We go out onto the balcony. All of our neighbors  are also out on theirs, too. Everyone is standing, staring. The mob is  shouting and about 5 minutes later comes running toward our building. As it  turns out, at the 12-story building the Azerbaijani neighbors went down and  kept them from coming in. There's only one entryway there, they could stop  them.  They all run up to our building. Mamma immediately starts closing the windows, afraid that they might throw stones. They have stones and they break the  windows, all of them. There are very many people. We have a large courtyard,  and it's packed with people. They spill up to the first floor so they don't  crush each other. They crawl up on trees, posts, and garages. It's just a huge cloud of people. They break and burn the motorcycle of the Armenian Sergey  Sargisian, from our building. We close the windows and immediately hear  tramping in our entryway. They come up to our fifth floor with a tremendous  din and roar. It's incomprehensible. Mamma told me later that they were  shouting Father's name, \\\"Grisha, open the door, we've come to kill you!,\\\" or something like that. I don't remember that, I was spaced out, kind of. Mamma  says, \\\"Into the bedroom, quickly!\\\" In the bedroom we have two tall beds, part  of our dowry; Mamma says, \\\"Hide there, they probably won't come in there,  they'll ask something, say something, and leave.\\\" She says, \\\"We'll tell them  that we live alone here.\\\" I can't imagine that my parents will stand out in  the hall alone talking with some sort of beasts . . . I go to them and say  that I'll stand together with them, I'll talk with them if they come, maybe I  can find a common language with them, all the more so if they know me: I speak  Azerbaijani more or less, and I can find out what they want. I told Marina and Lyuda to hide under the bed, and my sister Lyuda, I can't remember if I told  her anything or not.  Then . . . they open the door: it's like they blew on it and it broke and fell right into the hall. The crows bursts in and starts to shout: Get out of here, leave, vacate the apartment and go back to your Armenia; things like that. I tell them, \\\"What has happened, speak calmly. One of you, tell me, calmly, what has happened.\\\" In Azerbaijani, they say, \\\"Get out of the apartment, leave.\\\" I  say, \\\"OK. Go downstairs. We'll gather everything we need and leave the  apartment.\\\" I realize that it is senseless to discuss any sort of rights with them, these are animals. They must be stopped. The ones standing in the doorway, the young guys, say, \\\"There are old people and one girl with them. Too bad!\\\" They take two or three steps back. It seems as though I have pacified them with our exchange. Then someone in the courtyard shouts,  commanding them: \\\"Don't you understand what you are saying? Kill them?\\\"  And that was it! That was all it took. They grab Papa, carry him into one room, and Mamma and me into another. They put Mamma on the bed and start  undressing her, beating her legs. They start tearing my clothes, right there,  in front of Mamma. I don't remember where they went, what they did, or how  much time passed. I had the feeling that they beat me on the head, on my body, and tore my clothes, all at the same time, I don't even know what I said. The  atrocities started. I was savagely raped in that room. They argued among  themselves who would go first.  Later, I remember, I came to. I don't know if I'm dead or alive. Someone comes in, someone tall, I think, clean-shaven, in an Eskimo dogskin coat, balding.  He looks around at what's happening. At that instant everything stops. It  seems to me that he is either their commander or . . . that somehow everything depends on him. He looks and says, \\\"Well, we're done here.\\\" They are beating Mamma on the head. They break up the chairs and beat her with the chair legs  . . . She loses consciousness, and they decide that she's dead. Papa . . . was out cold. They want to throw Lyuda off the balcony, but they can't get the  window open. Apparently the window frames are stuck after the rain and the  windows can't be opened. They leave her next to the window. She was thinking  about being thrown out the window and passed out. She's not a real strong  person anyway . . . He looks at me and sees that I'm saying something, that I'm still twitching. Well, I start saying the opposite of what I should be,  which is humbling myself and pleading. I start shouting, cursing . . . they  don't get any entreaty out of me. I  already know that I'm dead, why would I  humble myself before anyone? And he says that if that's what I think, since my tongue is so long . . . maybe he thinks that I still look quite appealing  . . . In short, he commands that I be taken outside.  I no longer saw or remembered what was happening to Marina and Lyuda, I don't  know if they are alive or not. They take me outside. They are dragging me by  my arms, by my legs. They are hitting me against the wall, the railings,  something metal . . . While they are carrying me someone is biting me, someone else is pinching me . . .I don't even know. I think, my God, when will death  come? If only it were sooner . . . Then . . . they carry me out, throw me near the entryway . . . and start kicking me. I lose consciousness . . . What  happened after that, how many people there were, I don't remember.   I come to after a while, I don't remember how long. A neighbor is bringing me  clothing. I'm entirely covered with blood, she puts a dress on me. I remember  that I said the same words over and over again: \\\"Mamma, what happened, Mamma,  what have they done to us, where are we, whose house are we at?\\\" I can't make  sense out of anything. There is a guy standing over me, I sort of know him, he served in Afghanistan, his name is Igor, he brought me indoors. When they all  went to the third entryway and killed a person there, Igor gathered his  courage, took me into his arms, and brought me to the neighbors', even though  he's small-minded, he put himself at risk. Igor Agayev is Azerbaijani; he  served in Afghanistan. There are three brothers. The older brother also served there, I think; now he's stationed here, on the border, in Armenia. Igor  brought me to the neighbors', and then helped me come to my senses, saying,  \\\"Karina, I know you, calm down, I'm not one of them.\\\" How do I know who's who  and what's what? I come to, and they clean me up. I was covered in blood. Then Papa . . . I saw Papa, I saw Mamma. And Marina, too . . . Igor was there when  they dragged Marina and Lyuda out from under the bed . . . Marina . . . Lyuda  said that she was Russian, they said, we'll let you go, we aren't touching the Russians, go. And while they are dragging Marina out she decides she's going  to tell them she's Azerbaijani. Igor immediately grabs Marina's and Lyuda's  hands, because he knows Marina, and knows that she is Armenian and is our  sister, and takes her to the second floor to a neighbor's and starts pounding  on the door so she will open up. She opens the door and Igor pushes them in  there. So they survived.  My sister Lyuda lost consciousness after the bandits started stealing things. While they were going downstairs, taking things downstairs, then coming back  up again, Lyuda seized the opportunity and crawled under the bed and stayed  there. Then, when she was herself again, she found a torn night shirt and put  it on, and some sort of robe and went to a neighbor's on the fourth floor, the one whose apartment I had watched the crowd from, the friend of ours, and  knocked on the door. The neighbor opened and said, \\\"I'm not going to let you  in the apartment because I'm afraid of them. But I'll give you some stockings  and we'll leave the building.\\\" Lyuda says, \\\"I'll stay at your place because of what's going on, they keep going up and down the stairs.\\\" It was just for a  moment, just a moment in life, but the neighbor wouldn't consent. Lyuda came  back to our place and lay under the bed . . .  I came to. Mother was there. I can't remember my supervisor's telephone  number, but something had to be done. Somehow I remembered and called, and he  came to get us. He didn't have any idea what was going on. He thought we were  simply afraid, he didn't know that they were killing us and that we had passed between life and death. He came and got us and took us to the police precinct. There they looked us over. I was having trouble walking, my lungs hurt badly,  it was hard to breathe . . .  My supervisor's name is Urshan Feyruzovich Mamedov. He's the head of our  administration. They took us there. When we were leaving, I saw a great number of buses full of soldiers at the entrance to town. The buses were ordinary  passenger buses. There were very many soldiers. We left around eleven, right  after eleven. If these people could stop what was happening they could save a  great many lives . . . Because the crowd was moving on, toward the school, and what was going on there . . . I think everyone know not only in Sumgait, not  only in Yerevan. Because there they murdered them all one after the next,  without stopping. After us.  I think 14 people died in Microdistrict No. 3, and 10 to 12 of them were from Buildings 4, 5, and 6. In our building one person died, and one old woman died from Building 16, that's the building in front of ours. There young  Azerbaijani men stopped the mob and wouldn't let it into their building.  Incidentally, when we were at the neighbors', Marina called our relatives to warn them, so they would all know what was happening. I called a aunt in  Microdistrict No. 5. They have three neighbors who are Armenians. I said, \\\"Run quickly, I can't explain what's going on; hide, do what you can, just stay alive. Hide at Azerbaijanis', ones who won't give you away.\\\" At that moment  three people came in, policemen. I think they were Azerbaijanis. I was in such awful condition, my face was completely distorted my lips were puffed up,  there was blood, my eye was swollen, no one thought I would ever see anything  out of that eye again . . . my forehead was badly cut, and one-half of my face was pushed out forward. No one would have thought that I would survive, get my normal appearance back, and be able to grasp anything at all. I started to  scream at those people, why did you come, who sent you here, no one wants you  here, haven't you killed people people yet, what are you doing here? One of  the soldiers said, \\\"Don't scream at us. We're Muslims, but we're not from the  Sumgait police. They called in from Daghestan.\\\" So at that point the  Daghestan police were there.  When we got to the police precinct there were an awful lot of police there, there were soldiers, police with dogs, ambulances, firemen . . . I don't know, maybe they were waiting for people to bring them the goners and the seriously  injured to treat them there in the police precinct. I don't know what they  were there for. There were also doctors from Baku there. They examined Lyuda  and me and said, \\\"These women need to go to the Maternity Home, but we don't  know what to do with the rest.\\\"  So they took us, and I lost contact with my parents, my boss, everyone. My  boss said, \\\"Don't worry, I'll find you, no matter where you are, no matter what happens.\\\" We went to the hospital. There we were examined by a department head from the Sumgait Maternity Home, Pashayeva, I think her name was. She  examined us. The ambulance was from Baku; I figured out that the Sumgait  ambulances hadn't done anything, they didn't respond to any calls. People  called and neither the police nor the ambulances showed any sign of life.  That doctor looked me over and I could tell from her behavior that something very good had happened, for she became quite glad. I even thought to myself,  \\\"God, can it be that nothing all that bad is wrong?\\\" She looks me over and  says, \\\"Now why are you suffering so? You don't know what your people have been doing, your people did even worse things.\\\" And I think, great, I have to deal  with her . . . And I felt so bad, I thought, why don't I just die so as not to have to hear more stuff like this from people like her? Here I am in this  condition and being told about something that our people did. I just didn't  have the energy to say, \\\"How could our people possibly be smart enough to  think of something that yours haven't already done?\\\" I stayed there. Then they brought in another woman, Ira B., she was married, and she was raped in her  own apartment, too. There were three of us, Ira, Lyuda, and 1. The next  morning they took Lyuda and Ira away. They didn't do anything to help us. This was in the old Maternity Home, in the combined block. They didn't do anything  more than examine me, that was it. I didn't want any shots or tranquilizer,  nothing. What shots could have calmed me down? I didn't even want to look at  them.  I lay in the ward. Either it just worked out that way or they did it on pur- pose, but I was alone. I was alone even though the wards were packed. That same evening a woman came by and asked me what was wrong with me, that my face was disfigured. She asked what had happened to me, and I said, \\\"Better to ask  your brother what happened, there's no point in asking me, your brother can  better explain what happened.\\\" She fell into a faint. All the doctors threw  themselves at her, and the doctor categorically forbade anyone to come into my ward.  Then people from work came to see me, my boss, his daughter; they brought me  clothing, because I was literally naked. The only thing I had on was a dress,  but the woman who gave it to me was very short, and the dress was way up  above my knees, and the woman orderly said, \\\"I can't believe you put on such a short dress, who are you showing off your legs to here?\\\" I went back to my  ward thinking, just one more thing from something. People from work came and  brought me something in a sack, apples, I think, three or four pounds, but I  couldn't take them. I had become so weak that it was just embarrassing. I said that I couldn't take the apples, and really didn't have any appetite. No one  had to bring me anything. Some woman took the sack . . . And, oh yes! . . .  Then I heard that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history should  be hidden or torn up completely so that no one would know that I was an  Armenian, maybe they wouldn't figure it out from looking at me. So they must  have been thinking that there would be some kind of attack, that something  else would happen. That it would be worse. Or, perhaps, someone was outside on the street, I don't know. In any case, I didn't sleep a wink that night.  The next morning they picked me up, a whole police detail, put me in a bus,  and off we went. I didn't even know where they were taking me. They took me to the club where the troops were, the very one I was in that ill-fated evening. I got off the bus. Near the City Party Committee there were a great many  troops, tanks, armored personnel carriers; the whole scene was terrible. I saw  a few people I knew there, and that calmed me a little. I had already thought  that I was the only one left. So there were five or six of us left in Sumgait  after that night. I still didn't know what happened to my parents, they didn't  come to see me in the hospital, and my boss told me that everything was fine.  I didn't know whether to believe him or not. Maybe he was just trying to calm  me down, maybe something happened on the way. Then I went to the club and saw  a lot of people I knew. They all knew one another, they were all kissing each  other and asking, \\\"What happened, what went on?\\\" Two days later they came to  see me from work. They were there all the time. Each day they came, showed  interest, and were constantly bringing me money. They did everything they  could. Of course I'm most thankful to my boss, the only one of my colleagues  who didn't lose his presence of mind and who didn't change his opinions,  neither before, nor after, nor in the heat of the moment, no matter what  happened. He constantly took an interest. A sincere interest, from the heart  . . . Then, about two days later, the secretary of the Party Committee came,  not from our Party organization, but from the First Trust, which ours is part  of, Comrade Kerimov, a very important figure in our town. He made arrangements with the emergency medical personnel to take me away, because if I sat down by myself I couldn't get up or lie down again. There was something wrong with my lungs, it was hard to breathe. They examined me there several times, there I  lay were several doctors, they all thought that . . . that it must just be  from all the blows, I don't know. They didn't diagnose anything in particular. When I was in the Maternity Home I even asked . . . I made it a point of  insisting that they take me to the trauma section because I felt so awful.  There was no way something inside wasn't broken, my ribs . . . Well they took  me there and took x-rays and said that everything was fine. There were  emergency medical workers on duty in the club. The mother of one of Marina's  friends was there. She was the head doctor at the Sumgait Children's Clinic.  They had every kind of antifever agent in the world, which was exactly what I needed at that moment, I thought. I said that I was having great difficulty breathing, I couldn't seem to get enough air, something was wrong with me. They put tight bandages around my chest and waist. Later I overheard some people saying that I had been cut all over. I think they just saw me being all bandaged up and decided that my breasts and face had been cut . . . But I wasn't cut.  They took us to the Khimik boarding house. We lived there a long time. Soon  appeared representatives . . . They were agitating. At first people would not  talk to them, and drove them off. One of the Armenian women shouted, \\\"We  demand that Seidov come!\\\" The response was, \\\"It's Seidov who sent us.\\\" Seidov  is the Chairman of the Azerbaijani Council of Ministers. The woman said,  \\\"We'll only see Seidov's daughter, have her come here, we'll do the same  things to her that they did to our daughters, and then we'll deal with you  agitators.\\\" And so on. More of them said, \\\"Have Seidov himself come.\\\" This  went on day in, day out. The agitators kept coming and coming, this drove us  out of our wits. Then people gradually started departing for Yerevan because  they realized it was senseless to stay. Everything got on our nerves: The  smell, the small children. There were children at the SK club, children who  had literally just come out of the Maternity Home. What were they doing in a  club that didn't even have running water all the time? At first we had to pay  to eat there. They even overcharged us, as it turned out. On the second day  someone told us that they would bring us food for free. The children were ill. Everything stank there. Well imagine about 3,000 people in a small movie  theater with seating for no more than 500. You couldn't sit or lie down, it  was impossible to even move. The stench was awful. Even the smallest infants  took ill overnight there. I heard that they were arriving seriously ill in  Yerevan, the infants. They have to be washed, they have to be bathed, not to  mention that we, the adults, were ill and needed care. People were fainting  right and left. I just don't know, everyone was crying, everyone . . . Only  the young people, the men, somehow managed to keep it together. But the women  were in a constant state of panic. It seemed to everyone that they would come  any minute and kill and stab. It seemed clear that we had been gathered  together purposely, like during the war, so that they could burn the movie  theater and there wouldn't be a single Armenian left. Then people went up to  the attic. I didn't see them, I only heard them, because I was lying down and  couldn't get up. I lay right on the stage, we had some room there. Apparently  they caught two people with either oil or gas. I think they wanted to burn the theater. Maybe someone saw them, I didn't. I was in no condition to open my  eyes.  Everyone was suspicious of everyone else. They would ask, \\\"Aren't you an  Azerbaijani? I think I saw you somewhere, I think you're an Azerbaijani.\\\" They led out all the men and started letting them back in by checking their passports, relatives might be covering for each other. Half of the people did not have any documents. There were people who had run out of their homes in  nothing but a pair of pants and slippers, or wearing just a shirt, not like they should have, with their IDs.  So on the 28th, on Sunday, I think, the police did nothing to help us. On Monday everything resumed where it had left off on Block 41A. They didn't  spare a soul there: not children, not pregnant women, nobody. They killed, they burned, they hacked with axes, just everything possible. They murdered  the Melkumian family whom I knew, my mother worked with them. Their daughter- in-law went to school with my older sister. They were brutally murdered. Only  the two daughters-in-law survived. By a miracle one was able to save herself,  she ran away, the neighbors wouldn't take her in, so she ran about the  building until she found refuge. She was pregnant and had two small children.  This all continued on Monday in Block 41A, on the 29th, when the troops were  already in the city.  They murdered people, they overturned automobiles, and they burned entire  families. They say they didn't even know for sure if the people were Armenians or not. I heard that the Lezgins suffered, too. I'm not sure myself, I didn't  see any Lezgins who had been injured. They burned cars so it's very difficult  now to say exactly who died and who didn't. It was very difficult to identify  the corpses, or rather, what remained of the corpses after they were doused in gasoline and burned . . . it's all very hard to imagine, of course I heard  that many people disappeared without a trace, from the BTZ plant two people,  including a woman who worked the night shift, Aunt Razmella, who also lived in Microdistrict 3.  They were stopping buses between Baku and Sumgait. In the evening people who  had been visiting Baku were returning to Sumgait, and people from Baku were  going home from Sumgait, and there were students, too. They were simply  savagely murdered. They were stopping the buses, the drivers immediately did  what they were told because there was just no other way to deal with that  hoard of brutally minded people. They stopped the buses, dragged the Armenians out and killed them on the spot. I didn't see it myself, but I heard that they put them all in a pile so as to burn them. Later it was hard to discern from  the corpses, well you can't call them corpses, you had to figure out from the  ashes who it was. l heard that two fellows saved two women, one a student, Ira G., if I'm not mistaken. She was in the hospital a long time after that, and  she still can't figure out who saved her. She was also brutally raped and  beaten and thrown onto a pile of corpses. The fellow pulled her out of that  whole pile of corpses, put his coat on her, took her into his arms, and  carried her to the city. I still can't imagine how he managed to do that.  I heard that from Engels Grigorian. He knows her, apparently. Well a lot of  people went to that hospital anyway. She was in the hospital and singing a  song in Armenian, and they wrote the words down, and, I think he still has  that piece of paper, because he says that a lot of people now have that song,  the one she sang in the hospital where she lay in such bad shape. They  couldn't find the guy who saved her. He left her in someone's apartment and called the ambulance, she was in such awful shape that, probably, like me, she couldn't remember anyone's face.  I think that I knew one of the people who broke into our house, maybe I had  talked with him once. But I received so many blows everything was just knocked out of my head. I can't remember to this day who he was. Then, it seems, I saw the Secretary of the Directorate's Party organization, where Marina works. She goes to school and works, she goes to night school at AZI, and works by day at the Khimzashchita Construction and Installation Administration. I'm the  Secretary of the Komsomol organization at our administration and often met  with the secretaries of Party and Komsomol organizations. We had joint  meetings. I know them all, I've even talked with them, and he, I know, is from Armenia. An Azerbaijani, but from Armenia. It became obvious that many of  those people were Azerbaijanis born in Armenia.  They took me to various police stations, to the police precinct, and to the Procuracy, because the USSR Procuracy got involved in the case, and I iden- tified the photographs of people who I could more or less recognize. They showed me the people who were in our apartment, they're working on our case, but I can't even recognize them, although it was proved that they were the ones, they're processing it somehow. They tell me that they know that someone held me by the arm and someone else held me by the leg when they were  dragging me. There was someone else in our apartment who did not even touch  me, he just stole a blanket and an earring or something like that. All these  people, all of them, as much as I've heard about them and seen them, they were all from Kafan.  The Secretary of the Party organization is named Najaf, Najaf Rzayev. He was  there when everything started. It must have been him because I didn't  recognize anyone else in the crowd whom I knew besides him. All the more since I told him, \\\"Listen, you do something, because you know me.\\\" He turned away  and went toward the bedroom, where Marina was. Well you couldn't see Marina  anyway. There was such a noisy confusion of people that you couldn't make out  anyone. All of it flew right out of my head, and then gradually I became  myself again, at the City Party Committee . . . There were military people  there. I told them what went on, and they wrote it all down. I told them his  name. On March 8 the Secretary of our First Trust Party organization, the one  we're part of, came to see us, his name is Najaf Rzayev. I tell Mamma, \\\"If he's here despite the fact that I gave his name, it means that either his  alibi has been confirmed or, probably, that they think I'm crazy, not  responsible for my words.\\\" He said, \\\"What did they do to you, how awful,  myself, I hid an Armenian family.\\\" Then after some time goes by he comes back  again and says something entirely different: \\\"I wasn't at home, my family and  I went to Baku.\\\" I said, \\\"Marina, what is he saying? He said something totally different before.\\\" After that I didn't go to see our Procurator, our case is  being handled by a procurator from Voronezh, Fedorov by name. Fedorov told me  that Rzayev's case had just gotten to him, and there were so names involved.  What are they doing with Rzayev? Did he prove his alibi or not? They just think that since I was hit in the  head I can't say anything for sure, whether it was him or not. It will be an  insult if he was in our apartment and doesn't have to pay for it, but at the  same time  I'm afraid to say I'm a hundred percent sure that it was he. Because no mat- ter who I name, they tell me, no, you're wrong, he didn't do that, that one wasn't there. All the faces have gotten mixed up in my mind. Who did what exactly I can't say.                                                       When they took me outside there was a whole crowd there, but I didn't see it,  because I had my eyes closed all the time. It seemed to me that I always got it because of my eyes, people were always hassling me, for some reason it  always seemed to me that my eyes are responsible. When they were beating my  face I thought they were trying to put my eyes out. So I had my eyes closed,  they took me outside and started to beat me. A young guy, 22, held my arms, he works at the BTZ plant. And right nearby, across the road from us, Block 41,  is where all this was going on. Right across the road from us. The BTZ  dormitory is over there, that's where he lives. Now he's in custody, they even have proved, as far as I know, that it was he who killed Shurik Gambarian, the clarinet player from the third entryway of our building. One person in our  building was killed, it was that man.  A guy comes by who shared a room with the guy who was holding me. He saw that he was holding me by the arms and that he was beating me, but he didn't come  over, he just looked and then went into the dormitory. A while after it was  all over, people started making announcements in town saying that  investigators had been summoned. That guy went and told them everything. Now  they've caught him, everything's been proved. Now, evidently, they've been beating him, I don't know what they're doing with them over there, but he  himself said that he was working the night shift at the plant. Some young guy  came to the plant and said, \\\"Everyone who wants to kill Armenians come to the  bus station on Saturday at ten.\\\" That was it. He said, the ones who wanted to, went. This was at the BTZ plant, during the night shift, probably, late Friday night. It was at night, they were at the sauna together. And he said, what do  you mean, do you understand what you are saying? The others were silent,  probably, in their hearts they were thinking, I'm going to go. But they didn't say anything to one another. He said that he thought it important to to go,  because he had heard a lot about what had happened in Kafan, that they had  killed their Azerbaijani sisters, their mothers, burned villages, and all of  that. That guy was also born in Kafan. That is certain. And Marina says that  the Secretary of the Party organization is from Armenia, too.                                                             from  I've participated in the investigation a couple of times. I'm satisfied with them thus far. They summoned us and asked about what happened, and every word  I said was recorded. I met some guy there . . . By the way, he was an  Armenian. I said that he was in our apartment, but what he did, I don't know.  His last name was Grigorian, Eduard Grigorian. He s from Sumgait, from  Microdistrict 1. He was sentenced I think, to five years, not his first time.  His mother is Russian. I met with him at the KGB in Baku, at the Azerbaijani  KGB. They took us there and showed me photographs. There were so many  photographs, I think they even photographed those people who were caught at  curfew, and I've got them all confused. I say, the face was about like this,  the guy in the white coat with the red clasps. But he could take that coat off and burn it somewhere, and it would be like looking for a needle in a  haystack. Well. This guy, Grigorian, I said, he was in our apartment, but he  is so light-complected that he looks like a Lezgin. I don't know what he did,  I can't remember. Maybe he beat me or raped me. But he was in our apartment.  At the KGB he started asking me, pleading with me, there's no need for this,  all this stuff, look me in the eyes, you're like a sister to me. I took a look at him and thought, \\\"My God, Heaven forbid that I should have a brother like  you.\\\" But they were satisfied with my responses, because I said everything  without great certainty. I was there with Mamma. Then Lyuda came in, but when  she came in she got sick immediately. She wanted to kill him, she crawled over the table at him. She recognized him. When she came to, Lyuda was lying on the balcony, the mob threw her there and all of them ran into the bedroom. We had  all kinds of boxes with dishes in them, the dowries for all three sisters.  They stole everything in the apartment, leaving only small things. At that  moment Lyuda came to and started remembering everything. Well, seeing the  faces, hearing the voices . . . Two people were saying they could burn the  apartment. Another says, why burn the apartment when I've got three kids and  no place to live. So this guy was in temporary housing, he didn't have  anywhere to live, he was from Sumgait. They were sure that they would get the  apartment. Besides, the neighbors were Azerbaijani. Why should they burn the  apartment, they might burn Azerbaijanis. That's what they said. How did they  know there were Azerbaijanis there, if they just picked a place, thinking that Armenians lived there? We have a list of the residents for our part of the  building, our name is in there, but how could they know that Azerbaijanis  lived on the other side of the wall from us? So they didn't set fire to our  apartment.  I don't know, I was in such bad shape that if all of it had come to a halt  when I was outside, if someone had asked me what was happening, I would have said that a civil war was going on. Well, maybe not civil . . . but probably civil, because when they were beating me I opened my eyes and saw that all the neighbors were standing on their balconies and watching, like at a free horror film. So a civil war was going on, and only the Armenians were being fought. If it were a world war or something like that, they would have been fighting everyone. But they only fought us. Then I met some women from  our building, some Azerbaijanis. They are crying, they tell me, \\\"Karina, we  saw all of it, how could it happen?\\\" They're asking me! Well I just don't know what to call it if a normal girl can stand there and watch what happened to  me. I think that if it were the other way around either I wouldn't have been  able to take it, or I would have tried to avert it, like that one Azerbaijani  woman did in front of our building. A woman lives there, an awful, dissipated  woman, if you can call her a woman, the dissipated life she leads. Two  Armenian families live there, in her part of the building. She came out on the balcony and saw what was happening to me and started to scream and curse. She  came down to the entryway and said, \\\"You'll come in this entryway over my dead body.\\\" So not one of them took it in his head to go in that entryway. Some  folks were saying that those people were so out of control that they didn't  even know what they were doing. I don't think that's true. They knew very well what they were doing if they didn't even lift a hand against that woman. They  couldn't have cared less about her, but the fact that she was an Azerbaijani  stopped them.  They were just beasts, they had smoked so much. When they came to our place  they were all chewing something. I noticed: Everyone who came into the  apartment was chewing something. I think, my God, maybe I just think that?  Maybe I'm losing my mind? But no, they're all chewing something. Maybe it is  some kind of drug, it must be, because . . . At first glance they all seemed  to be such normal people, young, clean-shaven, looking exactly as if they had  come to some sort of celebration. But they were shouting something. They didn't talk, they shouted, as though there were deaf people there. They  screamed and screamed: \\\"Yeah, killing, killing, we're killing the Armenians!\\\"  Only they didn't shout \\\"kill,\\\" they shouted \\\"gurun ermianlary.\\\" Gurun  literally means \\\"kill,\\\" or \\\"destroy.\\\"  That's how it was! I'll continue. We hid in a captain's apartment, he's an Azerbaijani, his wife is a Tatar. We were sitting in their apartment, their  kids were out in the yard. Their kids knew a whole lot. This was in our part  of the building, on the third floor. When Mamma came to and couldn't find Lyuda she took Papa's hand, this was while the looters were stealing things, but they didn't pay attention because they were stealing things. Apparently they had already ceased killing and switched to stealing. Mamma found the courage to . . .  A boy said to my mother \\\"Where's the gold?\\\" Mamma said he must have been 12  to 14 years old. He even looked Russian, he was so fair-skinned. But the  Azerbaijanis from Armenia are fair-skinned. I noticed they were all on the  fair side. He shouted, they were all smashing things, and he asks Mamma where  the gold is. We kept our gold in the wardrobe with our important papers. In a  little black bag, we kept everything in there. Mamma doesn't really like to  wear gold. She probably never even wore those things from the time they were  bought for her. They took everything that was lying on the cheval glass. Mamma thinks that the gold saved us. Because they threw themselves at the gold, and  Mamma grabbed Papa, who was trying to breathe. They had closed his mouth,  bound his hands, and put a pillow and a chair on his face . . . They had  shoved something into his mouth so he would suffocate. Mamma grabbed him and  tore all that stuff off . . . He had something in his mouth, he was having  trouble breathing, his nose was filled with blood. Mamma grabbed him and  started running from the fifth down to the first floor because no one wanted  to open their doors to them. Mamma said that by accident, completely by  accident that person opened his door, he was sleeping, and said, half-awake,  \\\"What's happened?\\\" He sees that they are bloody. Mamma said, \\\"At least go and  find out what's happening to my daughters, even if they've burned them or  murdered them, at least bring the corpses.\\\" He went looking for us. At that  moment Lyuda was under the bed. She says that after they left it seemed that  someone was calling her name. When he quietly called her she couldn't get out  from under the bed. She wanted to get out and was calling softly. She thought  she was shouting, but in fact she was either silent or was only talking to  herself, it just seemed to her that she was shouting. When she got out from  under the bed everyone was gone. And again . . . She thought that she had lost her mind. I'll never leave here, never! To hell with it! It just seems that  way to me, I'll come to eventually. But then, when everything had settled  down, stopped, that mall brought Lyuda down, and Igor carried me in from outside. Or first I was brought in, then Lyuda, I don't remember what order it happened in.  And Mamma said, \\\"Listen, they're all running around down there, shouting  something or other, and running toward the other building.\\\" It had more or  less calmed down where we were. Who's dead, who's alive, we don't know. I  tried to call my girlfriend. I had basically come to. Mamma says, \\\"Listen; let's go upstairs, at least get a mattress or something. We don't know how  long we'll be here. Maybe they didn't burn everything.\\\" I don't get it, all women have that feeling, they want to get something from their homes, maybe  not everything was taken? I tell Mamma, \\\"Mamma, what do you need any of that  for? To hell with it! We're alive, forget the rest of it, all of it!\\\" She says, \\\"No, let's go get at least something. Maybe we'll leave here, spend the  night at someone else's.\\\" Mamma went upstairs, and their little boy, their son Alik, was standing on the lookout. lIe was standing there to see if they were  coming. They only managed to run up there and grab something one time. He  shouts, \\\"Come back, they're coming!\\\" They didn't have enough time to get a  lot, mattresses from one apartment, a blanket from another . . . Mamma got my  knitting . . . Someone managed to grab our old things, the ones we never wore, out of the hall . . . Someone took Father's old coveralls. The neighbor, his  wife, Mamma and Papa . . . Marina went with them. I was in no condition to  leave. Neither was Lyuda. We just sat. They ran out and we closed the door and just then we hear that the mob is on its way toward our place upstairs,  they're dragging something again. They were going toward the other building,  maybe over by the school, or . . . There was an unfinished building over there, people said they were going toward the basement or the unfinished  building, they could gradually carry everything over there. Then things more  or less calmed down. I tried to call my boss.  Later there was more noise. We were on the third floor, in a one-bedroom apartment, and a woman lives in the one-bedroom place on the second floor, Asya Dallakian. She's an old woman, retired. She wasn't at home, at that time she was usually in the country, she has a married daughter there, and her grandson is in the army. She is only very rarely in town; she gets her retirement money and the apartment is essentially vacant. They started pounding on her door and broke it down. She had two or three beds in there,  something like that, she's a 60-to 70-year-old woman who really does not even  live there. Probably she had some pots, a couple of metal bed frames and  mattresses, and a television. When her grandson came she bought a television.  They started wrecking everything. I started getting sick again. I think, \\\"My  God, what is going on around here? When will this end?\\\" We turned off the  lights and sat. As it turns out the people who weren't afraid, the ones who  knew what was going on, knew not to turn off the lights. We didn't know, but  they didn't come to where we were all the same. They all knew very well that  he was a captain. He went out and closed the door, and we sat in his  apartment. His last name was Kasumov. He's an exserviceman, retired, works up  at the fire station at some plant or other. He went out and stood at his door. They tell him, \\\"Comrade Captain, don't worry, we won't harm you, you're one of us.\\\" He went upstairs, and they say, \\\"Aren't you taking anything from this  apartment?\\\" He says, \\\"I don't need anything.\\\" And the women who were standing  in the yard . . . we have a basement, full of water . . . the women who were  standing in the yard saw. Those guys, they left everything they stole on the  first floor and ran upstairs again. The women threw everything they had time  to into the basement, to save our property. Some things were left: dirty  pillows, two or three other things and a rug. A guy came downstairs, really  mad, and he says, \\\"Where's the rug? I just put it right here!\\\" They tell him,  \\\"Some guy came and took it and went off toward the school.\\\" He ran off in that direction.  Oh! I forgot the most important point. When Igor picked me up in his arms,  there were women standing there who saw everything that was going on. They  just didn't tell me about it for a long time. The wife of that military man,  she didn't want to kill my spirit, I was already dead enough. Later she told  me, that after they murdered Uncle Shurik in the third entryway one of them,  the ringleader, apparently a young man, said, \\\"Where's the girl who was here?\\\" And he became furious. The woman tells him, \\\"She came to . . . \\\" She didn't know what to say: Think something up? Someone carried her off? Then they would comb the whole house and find me and our whole family. So the woman says, \\\"She came to and went to the basement.\\\" Now, our basement is full of water. So the  whole mob dashes off to the basement to look for me or my corpse. They took  flashlights; they were up to their waists in water, water which had been  standing there for years, and soot, and fuel oil. They climbed down in there  to get me. Then one of them said, \\\"There's so much water down there, she  probably walked and walked and then passed out and died. She met her death in  the basement. That's it, we can leave, no problem!\\\" I didn't know that, and  when I was told, I felt worse. Two times worse. A lot worse! So they didn't  just want to pound me flat, something more awful was awaiting me . . .  After that we of course didn't want to live in Sumgait any longer. We really  didn't want to go back to our apartment. When we moved, I went up there and  started to quiver and shake all over, because I started remembering it all.  Although the neighbors all sobbed, it was all . . . so cheap . . . The people  who sat in their apartments and didn't help us at a time like that. I think  that they could have helped! I don't think that they were obligated to, but  they could have helped us! Because that one woman was able to stop that whole  brutal crowd by herself. That means they could have, too. It would have been enough foe one man or women to say, What do you think you're doing?\\\" That's  all! That would have done it. There were 60 apartments in our building. Not  one person said it! When I was lying on the ground and all those people were  standing on their balconies I didn't hear anyone's voice, no one said what are you doing, leave her alone . . . Mamma even told one of the neighbor women  that if it had been an Azerbaijani woman in my place they would have dropped a bomb if it would have killed even one Armenian. They would have stood up for  one of their own. True, they say that our neighbor from the fourth entryway,  an old/ sick woman tried to stop the pogrom. The Azerbaijanis have a custom:  if a woman takes her scarf and throws it on the ground, the men are supposed  to stop immediately. The old woman from the fourth entryway did that, but they stomped her scarf into the ground, pushed her off to the side, and said, \\\"If you want to go on living, you'll disappear into your apartment.\\\" So she left. That trick didn't work on them.  Even the neighbors who helped us move told me, OK, fine, calm down, forget  that it happened. I said I'd only forget it if I told them right then that it had happened to their daughter--and if that didn't have any effect on them,  then I would forget everything, too. Imagine that it happened to your sister.  And no one did anything. Anything.

With \\\"pseudo\\\" clubbing, the angle is initially positive, then negative, which is the normal situation. \\\"Real\\\" internists can talk for hours about clubbing. I'm limited to a couple of minutes.  Whether this distinction has anything to do with reality is entirely unclear, but it is one of those things that internists love to paw over during rounds. Supposedly, only \\\"true\\\" clubbing is associated with disease. The problem is that the list of diseases associated with clubbing is quite long, and includes both congenital conditions and acquired disease. Since many of these diseases are associated with cardiopulmonary problems leading to right to left shunts and chronic hypoxemia, it is very reasonable to get a chest xray. However, many of the  congenital abnormalities would only be diagnosed with a cardiac catheterization.   The cause of clubbing is unclear, but presumably relates to some factor causing blood vessels in the distal fingertip to dilate abnormally.   Clubbing is one of those things from an examination which is a tipoff to do more extensive examination. Often, however, the cause of the clubbing is quite apparent.\",\"With the popularity of minivans, the market room for station wagons is  squeezed out.

Regards,\",\"  : [ The discussion begins: why does the universe exist at all?  ]   : One of the Laws of Nature, specifying cause and effect seems to dictate  : (at least to this layman's mind) there must be a causal event.  No : reasonable alternative exists.  I would argue that causality is actually a property of spacetime;  causes precede their effects. But if you claim that there must be an answer to \\\"how\\\" did the universe (our spacetime)  emerge from  \\\"nothing\\\", science has some good candidates for an answer.  I have always wondered why Christians use the \\\"There are questions science (or atheism) cannot answer\\\" argument; I hope this is the appropriate group to ask this question.  The most popular question is the question of origins. Why does the universe exist, or anything, for that matter?  I think this question should actually be split into two parts, namely  1) Why is there existence? Why anything exists?  and  2) How did the universe emerge from nothing?  It is clear science has nothing to say about the first question. However, is it a meaningful question, after all?  I would say it isn't. Consider the following:  A die-hard skeptic being (be it human or whatever) attempts to doubt one's very existence. Since it is so easy to doubt everything else - I cannot be _sure_ the world exists, it may be my mind fooling me - can I ever be sure I exist?  However, it is only possible to exist or not to exist. (Someone insert an appropriate Shakespeare quote here ;-) )  A being that does not exist cannot doubt one's existence. A being that does exist can doubt one's existence, but this would be pointless - the being would exist anyway.  Let us return to the original question: why? A being that does not exist does not need any reasons for its non-existence. This being is not _sure_ whether anything else exists but his mind, but let us assume that the world exists independent of the mind (the objectivity postulate). The question \\\"why anything exists\\\" can be countered by demanding answer to a question \\\"why there is nothing in nothingness, or in non-existence\\\". Actually, both questions turn out to be devoid of meaning. Things that exist do, and things that don't exist don't exist. Tautology at its best.  I seriously doubt God could have an answer to this question.  Some Christians I have talked to have said that actually, God is Himself the existence. However, I see several problems with this answer. First, it inevitably leads to the conclusion that God is actually _all_ existence, good and evil, devils and angels, us and them. This is pantheism, not Christianity.  Another answer is that God is the _source_ of all existence. This sounds much better, but I am tempted to ask: Does God Himself exist, then? If God is the source of His own existence, it can only mean that He has, in terms of human time, always existed. But this is not the same as the source of all existence. This argument sounds like God does not exist, but meta-exists, and from His meta-existent perspective, He created existence. I think this is actually a nonsolution, a mere twist of words.  The best answer I have heard is that human reasoning is incapable of understanding such questions. Being an atheist myself, I do not accept such answers, since I do not have any other methods.  The second question: How did the universe emerge from nothing? belongs to the domain of science, and I, for one, do not doubt the question can be answered by its methods. Many cosmologists have suggested that it is entirely possible for universes to emerge from vacuum (this possibility has been suggested in a recent Hawking biography; see also Lizhi & Shuxian: Creation of the Universe, World Scientific, 1989). However, I think the sci groups are more appropriate for discussions like this.   : As far as I can tell, the very laws of nature demand a \\\"why\\\".  That isn't : true of something outside of nature (i.e., *super*natural).  This is not true. Science is a collection of models telling us \\\"how\\\", not why, something happens. I cannot see any good reason why the \\\"why\\\" questions would be bound only to natural things, assuming that the supernatural domain exists. If supernatural beings exist, it is as appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist.   : I believe the \\\"genetic code\\\" will be entirely deciphered in our lifetimes, : but we will not see man convert entirely inert material into self sustaining,  : reproducing life, *ever*.  (I've never been much of a prophet, though. I : can't even *picture* New York in my mind 8^] ).  I don't believe *any* : technology would be able to produce that necessary *spark* of life, despite : having all of the parts available. Just my opinion.  This opinion is also called vitalism; namely, that living systems are somehow _fundamentally_ different from inanimate systems. Do Christians in general adopt this position? What would happen when scientists announce they have created primitive life (say, small bacteria) in a lab?  There is a problem with your prophecy: artificial life has been created, although not yet in a chemical form. Computer simulations of evolution contain systems that are as much alive as any bacterium, although their code is electronic, as well as their metabolism. See a recent book  Steven Levy: Artificial life - The Quest for a New Creation. Jonathan Cape, London 1992.  Artificial chemical life is just around the corner - after all, no  spark of life has been found to be necessary; living systems do not violate any physical laws as we know them.   : You don't mind if a few of us send up a prayer on your behalf during your : research, do you?  After all, if we of Christ are deluding ourselves, you : really have nothing to worry about, eh?  Exactly. This is why I think atheists should _not_ post any evangelical atheist arguments to soc.religion groups, since people who seek to  find peace in religions must be allowed to gather together. I would normally have asked these questions in alt.atheism or talk.religion.misc, but it seems many Christians do not read these groups.

In that posting I made sure I used the word \\\"public\\\".  Public revelation contains God's truth intended for everyone to believe.  The revelation contained in the Bible is a significant subset of public revelation.  Private revelation is revelation that God gives to an individual.  He may speak directly to the individual, He may send an angel, or He may send the Virgin Mary or some lesser saint.  The only person who is required to believe a private revelation is the person to whom it is revealed. Devotional practices may be based on reported private revelations, but doctrines can not.  When an alleged private revelation attracts sufficient attention, the Church may investigate it.  If the investigation indicates a likelihood that the alleged private revelation is in fact from God, it will be approved.  That means that it can be preached in the Church.  However, it is still true that no one is required to believe that it came from God.  A Catholic is free to deny the authenticity of even the most well attested and strongly approved private revelations, such as those at Fatima and Lourdes.  (I suspect that few if any Catholics do reject Fatima and Lourdes, but if any do their rejection of them does not mean they are not orthodox Catholics in good standing.)  I do not have at hand a list of the criteria the Church uses in evaluating an alleged private revelation--it's not something I need every day--but I know that one of the primary requirements is that nothing in the alleged private revelation can contradict anything known through public revelation ------- Marty Helgesen Bitnet: mnhcc@cunyvm   Internet: mnhcc@cunyvm.cuny.edu\",\"  Of course you could develope this system, but there is already a system called Global Positioning Satellites.

It's been on all weekend and it hardly even reaches room temperature. I think the big roomy tower case has a  lot to do with it.      It's up and running DOS 6.0 with no problems. I've also read about some people having problems with high speed serial communications.  I used the DOS 6.0 InterLink program which lets me link to my old computer via a serial port at 115.2K baud. It then \\\"maps\\\" the other machines two hard disks as my disks F & G. You can \\\"cd\\\" to these drives and either run programs or copy files. It's almost like a peer-peer lan except you can also *run* programs on the other machine. It's not a two way street. The other machine is the server and this machine is the client. So thats where it seems to differ from the  peer to peer stuff. For a bundled DOS utility its very impressive.     My Jumbo-250 took about 11 minutes to back up 117MB of data. I also by-passed any potential Gateway monitor problems by taking the $430 credit and applying it towards a NEC 4FG. I love this monitor!    So, I'm glad there is some good news Gateway stories and I'm glad it was me.

The Federalist papers are propaganda and it is therefore difficult to determine precisely what Maddison etc were up to from them. They certainly emphasised a limited role for the federal government but this was not necessarily their true position.   The Senate was less powerful than the House of Lords in the period in question. The stripping of the powers of the House of Lords did not occur until 1914 and David Llloyd George's budget. Even despite this the House of Lords has considerable power even today and is far from a rubber stamping body.     The system is meant to be slow to react, the problem is that it ended up a bit too slow.    The Presiden't veto was meant to be entirely separate. Until Bush abused it in a quite extraordinary manner it was used more in accord with the intent of being a check on unreasonable legislation. The veto was clearly regarded  as a completely last gasp measure its use was meant to be restricted to preventing the legislature interfering with the actions of the executive.\",\" Gerry Cheevers used to have a mask that had stitches painted all over it.\",\"Dear All,   I am trying to get my standard connection going with KA9Q (PA0GRI113016) and a GVC NIC-2000 ethernet card.

I want to use any read-only cells that are already in my colormap once I start running out of allocatable cells, using some arbitrary nearest color matching scheme to get those cells that come closest to a requested color.  Once I determine if a cell is read-only, I assume I can then just request an XAllocColor() with the exact same color specifications and it will  then be flagged as 'used' by my application so that it doesn't later get freed by someone else and allocated again as read-write to another application.  So far, the only way I've figured out to do this is to write my own error handler and just go ahead and request the cells colors, once my colormap is all full up.  It should error out if the cell is non-shareable. But life would be much easier if I could just detect the read-only/shareable stuff directly...

I'd like to write them a letter encouraging them to see to it VERY EMPHATICALLY that the 2nd amendment is restored to the form that the founding fathers intended.

A single chip micro and a crystal will do the job reliably and easily.  An 8748 only costs about $5.  That and a $1 crystal and you're in business.  Embed the whole thing in a foam insulated blanket, power it from a solar cell, use the excess power to heat the assembly during the day and rely on the insulation to hold the heat during darkness.  If you don't want to try thermal management, contact someone like ICL and have them cut you a special low temperature crystal.  It'll cost at most $20.  If you use a single chip micro, you're looking at a parts count of  maybe 7.  A processor, a crystal, two caps on the crystal, a power FET to fire the solenoid a flyback diode and a battery.  This is fewer parts than  you can build an analog timer for and is infinitely more reliable.  Add a power zener diode (for heat) and a solar cell and the parts count screams up to 9.

However, the doctors would have enough confidence and conviction to claim, out of genuine concern, that is IS necessary.

The project manager is Dr. John Hunter, and he works for the Laser group at Livermore.  What, you may ask, does gas guns have to do with lasers? Nothing, really, but the gun is physically located across the road from the Free Electron Laser building, and the FEL building has a heavily shielded control room (thick walls) from which the gun firings are controlled.  So I suspect that the office he works for is an administrative convenience.  I visited Hunter at the beginning of Feb. and we toured the gun. At the time I was working on gas gun R&D at Boeing, where I work, but I am now doing other things (helping to save the space station),  The gun uses a methane-air mixture, which is burned in a chamber about 200 ft long by 16 inch ID (i.e. it looks like a pipe). The chamber holds a 1 ton piston which is propelled at several hundred m/s down the chamber.  On the other side of the piston is hudrogen gas, initially at room temperature andsome tens of atmospheres.  The piston compresses and heats the hydrogen ahead of it until a stainless steel burst diaphragm ruptures, at around 50,000 psi. The barrel of the gun is about 100 feet long and has a 4 inch bore.  It is mounted at right angles to the chamber (i.e. they intersect).  This was done so that in the future, the barrel could be raised and the gun fired into the air without having to move the larger and heavier chamber.  The projectile being used in testing is a 5 kg cylinder of Lexan plastic, 4 in in diameter and about 50 cm long.  All of the acceleration comes from the expansion of the hydrogen gas from 50,000 psi downwards until the projectile leaves the barrel.  The barrel is evacuated, and the end is sealed with a sheet of plastic film (a little thicker than Saran wrap).  The plastic is blown off by the small amount of residual air trapped in the barrel ahead of the projectile.    The gun is fired into a bunker filled with sandbags and plastic water jugs.  In the early testing fragments of the plastic projectile were found.  At the higher speeds in later testing, the projectile vaporizes.  The testing is into a bunker because the Livermore test range is about 3 miles across, and the projectile would go 100-200 km if fired for maximum range.  The intent is to move the whole gun to Vandenberg AFB after the testing is complete, where they can fire into the Pacific Ocean, and use the tracking radar at VAFB to follow the projectiles.  The design goal of the gun is to throw a 5 kg projectile at 4 km/s (half of orbital speed).  So far they have reached 2 km/s, and the gun is currently down for repairs, as on the last test they blew a seal and damaged some of the hardware (I think it had to do with the methane-air more detonating than burning, but I haven't had a chance to talk to Hunter directly on this).  There are people waiting to test scramjet components in this gun by firing then out of the gun into the air (at Mach 12= 4 km/s), since the most you can get in wind tunnels is Mach 8.  This gun cost about 4 million to develop, and is basically a proof-of-concept for a bigger gun capable of firing useful- sized payloads into space.  This would require on the order of 100 kg projectiles, which deliver on the order of 20 kg useful payload to orbit.

I have to talked to a few Duc owners (750SS owners in particular) who say that the power is something less than overwhelming.  That said, I would love to have a 900SS.  I guess I should have been a bit more specific.  If you have something that weighs that same as the 750, go  for the extra cubes.    I think that fact that I own a GTV-6 shows that I don't care about maximum power (it's no slug though) to the exclusion of everything else.  The note  and the handling are more important to me.

Third gear would just disengage.  Engine would rev up.  Kind of disconcerting.  I sold that car quite a few years back but the memory of that tranny sticks with me.  It also had a clutch chatter in first that the dealer could not fix.  If the lemon law had been in place then, that car would have been covered.  I have had several Jap cars since then (figuring the Horizon was my contribution to the American Auto Companies), and have never seen any bad behavior with the exception of a Toyota Tercel with a bit of clutch chatter that they did fix on the first try.  Anyway, from that day forward, I have sworn that I would never purchase another American car with a standard.  American manufacturers don't have a clue on how to manufacture five speed transmissions and have been doing the automatics much longer and on many more cars. However, I hate automatics, so I am still buying Jap cars.  Not sure this is any help, but other cars do this too.

As to the a/a (if I understand your direction), the issue remains  unproven I suspect, considering how atheists and agnostics so often  look to reason. Atheist, it is reasonable to conclude will not agree. For agnostics, a poll seems in order. Who knows?  Myself, I'm not so  sure the atheists can be counted out.   For the orthodox, I wonder how many would follow Moses, or Abraham, or David in accepting God's Word? Is the particular covenant to which one adheres, more important than God promisimg?

If you take away the government, you still have the structural flaws in society, except this time, with no restraints. Yes? No?  Why doesn't anybody ever discuss communal society, like a kibbutz?

Sorry to detract from the discussion.   But what good is change if there is no tracable improvement in the human condition? Who would ever support the change if you tell them it won't  improve their lives? I know that there are, and will be, libertarians  who will jump in now and say that it WILL improve our lives.

This newsgroup will be devoted to  build a  peaceful  mutual  understanding  of  the  Ahmadiyya  branch of Islam, its peacefull beliefs, ideology and philosophy and how  it is  different  from  other  branches  of Islam in fostering world peace and developing better understanding among religious people. It may also be used to post important religious events within the World Wide Ahmadiyya Islamic Community in general.   PURPOSE OF THE GROUP:  ====================       The following are some of the main purposes this group will      achieve:       i)   To discuss the common beliefs of all major religions as           they relate to Ahmadiyya Muslim Community.       ii)  To discuss the doctrines, origin and teachings  of this           puissant spiritual force on earth.       iii) To examine Islamic teachings and beliefs in general  in           light  of the Quran  and established Islamic traditions           of 15 centuries from Ahmadiyya perspective.       iv)  To discuss the similarities  between Ahmadi Muslims and           people of other Religions  of the world and discuss how           religious tolerance  and respect to other's  faiths can           be brought about to  eliminate inter-religion rivalries           and hatred among people of religions.        v)   To discuss the origin and teachings of all religions in           general and Islamic and Ahmadiyya Muslims in particular           to foster better understanding among Ahmadi Muslims and           other religious people.       vi)  To discuss current world problems and solution to these           problems as offered by religion.       vii) To exchange important news and views about the Ahmadiyya           Muslim Community and other Religions.       viii)To add diversity in the religious newsgroups present           on Usenet.       ix)  To discuss why  religious persecution is on the rise  in           the world  and find  solutions to remedy the ever deter-           iorating  situation  in the  world in general and in the            Islamic world in particular.       x)   To discuss the contributions of founders of  all  reli-           gions and their  people for humanity, society and world            peace in general and by the International Ahmadiyya Mus           -lim Community in particular.

The founder of this sect, Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835-1908), proclaimed to be the Promised Reformer of this age as foretold in almost all the major religions of the world today (Islam, Christianity, Judiasm,  Hin- duism).  He  claimed  to  be  the  long awaited second comming of Jesus Christ (metaphorically), the Muslim Mahdi, and the Promised Messiah.  He  claimed that the prophecies contained in almost all the great religions of the world about the advent of a  messenger from God have been fulfilled.          The claims Hazrat Ahmad raised storms  of  hostility  and extreme  oposition from many priestlike people of Muslims, Chris- tians, Jews and Hindus of that age. Such opposition is often wit- nessed  in  the history of divine reformers. Even today this sect is being persecuted specially in  some  of  the  Muslim  regimes. Dispite  the  opposition  and persecution, this sect has won many adherents in 130 countries. It has over 10 million followers, who come from a diverse ethnic and cultural background.          The sect is devoted to world peace and in bringing  about a better understanding of religion, and the founders of all reli- gions. Its mission is to unite mankind into one Universal  broth- erhood  and  develop  a  better  understanding  of  faith. Ahmadi Muslims have always been opposed to all kind of violence and spe- cially religious intollerance and fundamentalism.          Among its many philanthropic activities, the sect has es- tablished  a network of hundreds of schools, hospitals, and clin- ics in many third world countries. These institutions are staffed by  volunteer  professional  and are fully financed by the sect's internal resources.          The Ahmadiyya mission is to bring about a universal moral reform,  establish  peace and justice, and to unite mankind under one universal religion.   NEWSGROUP CREATION:  ==================\",\"It seems to me that you are the one who is supposed to do some reading. I think that our major difference in opinion is on the legitimacy of Sevres. First, thattreaty was signed by the Ottoman Empire therefore legally it does not bind the  Republic of Turkey. The new independence movement (which by the way, is not the same as the Young Turks) naturally rejected it out of hand. to say that we  should accept because the Germans did theirs is absurd. We saw what the cosequences of such harsh treaties were in Hitler. Second, the Sevres treaty was even  worse than Versailles. It divided the Ottoman Empire in to several influence  zones, had the capital occupied, the economy under Allied control, the army di minished to nothing but a police force, in short a country in name only. I'd wonder if you would like to live under such conditions. And for the record, I donot feel sorry for the soldiers killed in IZMIR harbour. Before evacuating the  city, the Greek forces burned it down, so it serves them right. As for being fooled by Allied promises, that too is your fault. You did not come to Anatolia just to enforce Sevres but to take part in the plunder  as well. K. Burak Ucer\",\"In reference to the limits of acceleration with guns launching solid rockets as payloads.  Thiokol provided me with samples and data on a reinforcement to solid motor grains for high accelerations.  Solid motor propellants usually have a substantial percentage of  aluminum in the mix.  For example, the Space Shuttle SRBs are 16 percent Aluminum.  The technique is to use a 'foamed aluminum' structure. The structure looks like the inverse of a set of bubbles (an I suspect some bubbling process is used to form it).  In other words, if you made a bunch of bubbles in molten aluminum, then froze it, this is what you get.  It forms a strong network of effectively aluminum wires in all directions.  The remaining solid fuel mix is infiltrated into the voids, and you get aluminum-reinforced solid propellant.  The foamed-aluminum makes up about 6 percent of the total propellant, so there is still aluminum particles in the bulk grain.  The major improvement is the higher resistance to grain cracking, which is the principal failure mode for solid propellant.  Dani Eder \",\"   .

Finally, I would direct anyone interested in African involvement in the church to the account of the conversion of the Ethiopian eunuch in Acts chapter 9 (I think it's chapter 9).  This is one of the earliest conversions, and the eunuch, treasurer to the queen of the Ethiopians, was definitely African.

You lurkers can join in at any time, you know!  Ahhh.. Talk.politics.guns -- the kindler, gentler newsgroup.  Who would have thought?    I remind you of shrapnel.  I consider 5' a reasonable space limitation, but make no mistake a gun blowing up is a hazard to those nearby, say in the next lane at the range.  My point was at what distance, or level of threat, we draw the line.  Is it the endangerment of others, so we do a 5' restriction, or the possibility of being shot, hence we draw a 1.5 mile restriction, or a nuke and draw a 5 mile restriction?  To me they al suffer from the fundamental flaw that they restrict based upon the instrument rather than placing the responsibility for usage squarely upon the shoulders of the user. Perhaps Sen. Metzenbaum declaring the Barrett Light Fifty an assault rifle has made this more apparent to me, since the Barrett has only range and acurracy going for it.    I disagree, on the grounds that a house can be rebuilt much more easily than my family once I have died.  I assume that word would get to the citizens that such an attack was planned.  If this is not the case, the tactical and strategic implications change quite a bit.  Personally, my home is worth, say, twenty Martians intent on taking over the world.  My family?  All of them.  The balancing act here is hard to judge sitting at my desk.    That seems to be the case already, given that heavy weapons aren't commonly owned by the citizenry.  With such low numbers, obviously due to cost, I don't think the superior weapons are going to be of great effect against a numerically superior foe.  Furthermore, it is even more doubtful their training includes proper tactical movements that best utilize tanks, whereas the commonly rifleman is not so hampered in effectiveness.    I had envisioned that the armorer, perhaps the officers of a select group, and the like would exercise control over the heavier, more complex weapons.  But, if Joe Bob owns an old Sherman tank I certainly wouldn't ask him to give it up.  Follow orders from the officers, yes.  Since the expense of a tank is so large, though, chances are it would be jointly purchased and should therefore be jointly maintained and operated.    This I'll agree with to a point.  The State having control over the heavy weapons should not be justification for the state to have them centrally located.  Keep them spread out, such that the ability of the State to lock them up isn't so easy.  Otherwise, I would have to assume that State control would rest on the authority of the Governor and militia officers.    I'm having a hard time seeing how these heavy weapons, fairly few in numbers, could not be easily wielded by a few people with government support.  Just as you argued above that the weapons should be divvied up and under democratic control so one side doesn't have all of them, I can't see where this situation is alleviated in having the select militia holding all the weapons and the unorganized militia being the infantry. I think a better mix is called for.  But, I would argue that the Federal army should rely upon the select militia and the unorganized militia for the bulk of its infantry units.    We have to assume that there would be those who would side with the government-controlled forces, and if they've all the equipment an infantry force 3x the size would be in trouble. I'd like to see that heavy stuff, say tanks, offset by the local troups having a few 105's and anti-tank weapons in their armory.  These would be much more useful to infantry than the tank would be when cost and training requirements are figured in. I suppose I'm quibbling over what constitutes heavy equipment.    So would I, but the resources often aren't available to outfit local units well enough.  Thus, we will certainly have to call in others, and a mechanized unit carries more stuff faster than anything else.    Perhaps our ideas of heavy weapons are different?  I think main battle tanks, self-propelled artillery, and 155mm and up field pieces are heavy stuff.  M113 troop carriers, 2 1/2 ton trucks, HumVee's, old M60 tanks, 105 Howitzers, are more the stuff of a mechanized infantry.  Actually, this is what the Guard units in Iowa are currently fielding in some units.   Perhaps it is just my innate fear of having the real heavy equipment under State control, with little but numbers and light stuff to act as a deterrent.  Allowing main battle tanks to the states should be balanced with anti-tank capability in the local ranks.  Similarly, local units would need to band together quickly, hence small and fast response means mechanized infantry.  Finally, the militia is more than just fighting.  Equipment is needed for other responses.

No, that's the nice thing -- on a multitasking OS, SCSI can use both drives at once.  I've got unix loaded on one of my pcs (along with windogs) and the OS can only use one of the two IDE drives at one time.  It's pretty ugly.  I just bought at Quantum 240 for my mac at home.  I paid $369 for it.  I haven't seen IDE drives cheaper.  : The original CGA cart back in '84 was $300.  I think the original EGA card : (or PGA?) was $800.  SCSI has stood relatively alone in not coming down : in price, mainly because we're talking about PC's and not Sun's or Sparc : or SGI or (name your favorite unix workstation).

No, actually, we're talking about SCSI being expensive simply because nobody did a common interface for the PC.  If they had a common (read: easily implemented) method of adding scsi to a PC (like as in a Sun or Mac), then you'd find SCSI the connection medium of choice.  : I won't argue that the SCSI standard makes for a good, well implimented : data highway, but I still want to know why it intrinsically better : (than IDE, on an ISA bus) when it comes to multi-tasking OS's when : managing data from a single SCSI hard drive.  On a single drive, SCSI is more expensive.  But, you bought your PC for expandibility, so, you'd want to add more drives or whatever.  The following are why I find SCSI intrinsically better than IDE:  A (partial?) list:  1.  You can add many different types of devices and access them   concurrently.  2.  A SCSI device works on many different machines (I have a mac  and a PC at home and moving hard drives between them is VERY nice  with SCSI -- hook them up and away they go)  3.  SCSI devices work together better than IDE devices.  For  instance, recently, I added an older connor 100 meg IDE to a maxtor  212 meg IDE.  The connor *MUST* be setup as the slave.  It will  work no other way.  On SCSI, you set the address, check the  termination, plug it in, and away it goes.  4.  I have a problem with IDE's mutual exclusion - I notice that  the time it takes to switch from accessing drive c: to drive d: is  quite long as compared to the time it takes to switch from drive c:  to d: on a SCSI system.  Under a multitasking OS, this is very  noticable, as many things can be going on at once.  One neat thing that I've noticed lately (a fringe benefit) has been the ability to add older (almost dead) drives as storage on a SCSI system with little problem -- we've got a bunch of almost dead 20 meg drives that I've added to my PC.  I've now got the interface full, but, it does allow me to have 4 20 meg drives, 1 240 meg drive, 1 tape drive, and 1 105 meg drive all on the same card.    Simply put, SCSI is handier than IDE.

To cover my arse, what I'm trying to say is that there is an infinitely grey area between weak and strong, as well as between strong and the unattainable mathematical atheism (I wish!).  Whereas I _logically_ can only support the weak atheist position, in effect I am a strong atheist (and wish I could be a mathematical one).  To justify my strong atheist position I believe I need only show that the evidence presented in favour of any of the gods under scrutiny is faulty.  If I read the FAQ correctly, no argument for the existence of god (generic, as represented by mainstream theologians) has ever been found to be unassailable.  To me this is adequate evidence that the _real_god_ is undefinable (or at least no definition has yet been found to be watertight), which in turn I accept as sufficient to base a disbelief in each and every conceivable god.  I'm a little fuzzy on the edges, though, so opinions are welcome (but perhaps we should change the thread subject).\",\"Hi, all!  Anyone knows of a Motif mailing list?

As Roger Lustig pointed out in a previous response, the reason why Schott was banned from baseball was because she had been known to call and think in a racially biased manner on a constant basis.  Such thoughts affected her hiring practices.  Bonilla, on the other hand, was found to have mentioned this one word a single time.  If he had been known to go around, criticizing homosexuals, it would be a different story.  Furthermore, he is merely an athlete.  He doesn't have to hire anyone as Schott had to do.  Dave Pallone, the former NL umpire who is an admitted homosexual, has decided to assist in a protest before a Mets game at Shea.  He, like you, thinks that Bonilla should be suspended from baseball.  Pallone is hoping for a year's suspension.  In my opinion, that's downright ludicrous.  As Howie Rose on WFAN said, if you start suspending athletes who have mentioned a derogatory word even a single time under whatever conditions, then you'd probably have enough people remaining to play a three-on-three game.  Now, honestly, if you truly analyze the differences between the two cases that you bring up in your article, I would think that you'd reconsider your thoughts.                                       -Sean  \",\"Hi.  I am trying to set up a Conner 3184 and a Quantum 80AT drive.  I have the conner set to the master, and the quantum set to the slave (doesn't work the other way around).  I am able to access both drives if I boot from a  floppy, but the drives will not boot themselves.  I am running MSDOS 6, and have the Conner partitioned as Primary Dos, and is formatted with system files.  I have tried all different types of setups, and even changed IDE controller cards.  If I boot from a floppy, everything works great (except the booting part :)).  The system doesn't report an error message or anything, just hangs there.  Does anyone have any suggestions, or has somebody else run into a similar problem?  I was thinking that I might have to update the bios on one of the drives (is this possible?).  Any suggestions/answers would be greatly appreciated.  Please reply to:\",\" I agree with Carol here.  Determining absolutes is, practically speaking, a waste of time.  And we easily forget that relative truth is, in fact relative.  For example, I recently was asking some children the question \\\"What temperature does water boil at?\\\"  I got the answer 212 degrees consistently.  I asked if they knew what scale, and was told \\\"It's just 212 degrees.  Any scale. That's what all thermometers say.\\\"  Well, that's sincere, and may be true in the experience of the speaker, but it is simply wrong.  IT is NOT an absolute truth.  Similarly, Scripture is full of Truth, which we should nurture and cherish, but trying to determine which parts are Absolute Truth and which parts are the manifestations of that in the context of the time and culture in which the text was penned is missing the point.  Then religion easily becomes an intellectual head-trip, devoid of the living experience of  the indwelling Trinity and becomes dead scholasticism, IMO.   [example of head-covering in Church deleted]  This was a good example.  There may be an Absolute Truth behind the writing, but the simplest understanding of the passage is that the instructions apply to the Corinthians, and not necessarily elsewhere. The instructions may reflect Absolute Truth in the context of first century culture and the particular climate at Corinth, which was having a LOT of trouble with order. Is it Absolute Truth to me?  No.  And I  see no compelling, or even reasonable, reason that it should be.    Even the most die-hard literalists do not take all of the Bible literally. I've yet to meet anyone who takes the verse \\\"blessed is he who takes your babies and smashes their heads against the rocks\\\" literally.  The Bible was not printed or handed to us by God with color codings to tell us what parts should be interpreted which way.     I agree.  Very few.  And even if we knew them, personally, we may not be  able to express that in a way that still conveys Absolute Truth to another. The presence of absence of Absolutes may not make any difference, since I know I can never fully apprehend an Absolute if it walks up and greets me.  I can't prove the existence of absolutes.  I can only rely upon MY experience. I also trust God's revelation that WE cannot fully comprehend the infinite. Therefore we can't comprehend the Absolutes.  So I don't need them.   I can never know the essence of God, only the energies by and through which God is manifested to God's creation.  So the reality can be that there ARE absolutes, but it is of no practical importance.  It's like claiming that the original scriptural autographs were perfect, but copies may not be.  Swell. Who cares?  It doesn't affect me in any practical useful way.  I might as  well believe that God has made a lot of electric blue chickens, and that they live on Mars.  Maybe God did.  So what? Is that going to have ANY effect on  how I deal with my neighbor, or God?  Whether or not I go to this or that cafeteria for lunch?  No.    This attitude leads many non-Christians to believe that ALL Christians are arrogant idiots incapable of critical reasoning.  Christianity is true, wonderful and sensible.  It appeals to Reason, since Reason is an inner reflection of the Logos of God.  Explanations that violate that simply appear to be insecure authoritarian responses to a complex world.  NOTE:  I'm NOT claiming there is no place for authority. That'd be silly.        There IS a world of difference between authoritative and authoritarian.        Authoritative is en expression of authority that respects others.        Authoritarian is en expression of authority that fails to do that,        and is generally agressive.  Good parents (like God) are authoritative.        Many Christians are simply authoritarian, and, not surprisingly, few         adults respond to this treatment.

CRYPTO '93  -  General Information  (August 22 - 26, 1993) ............................................................................  THE PROGRAM:  Crypto'93 is the thirteenth in a series of workshops on  cryptology held at Santa Barbara, and is sponsored by the International  Association for Cryptologic Research, in cooperation with the IEEE  Computer Society Technical Committee on Security and Privacy, the Computer  Science Department of the University of California, Santa Barbara, and  Bell-Northern Research (a subsidiary of Northern Telecom). The program  for the workshop will cover all aspects of cryptology. Extended abstracts of  the papers presented at the conference will be distributed to all attendees  at the conference, and formal proceedings will be published at a later date.  In addition to the regular program of papers selected or invited by the  program committee, there will be a rump session on Tuesday evening for  informal presentations. Facilities will also be provided for attendees to  demonstrate hardware, software and other items of cryptographic interest.  If you wish to demonstrate such items, you are urged to contact the General  Chair so that your needs will be attended to. The social program will include  hosted cocktail parties on Sunday and Monday. In addition, there will be a  beach barbecue on Wednesday evening. The price of the barbecue is included  in the room and board charge, and extra tickets may be purchased.  ABOUT THE CONFERENCE FACILITIES:  The workshop will be held on the campus of  the University of California, Santa Barbara. The campus is located adjacent  to the Santa Barbara airport and the Pacific Ocean. Accommodations are  available in the university dormitories at relatively low cost for conference  participants. Children under the age of 13 are not allowed to stay in the  dormitories, so those bringing small children will need to make separate  arrangements in one of several nearby hotels. More information on hotels is  enclosed. Parking on campus is available at no cost to the participants.  However, participants must indicate on the registration form if they desire  a parking permit.  TRAVEL INFORMATION:  The campus is located approximately 2 miles from the  Santa Barbara airport, which is served by several airlines, including  American, America West, Delta, United, and US Air. Free shuttle bus service  will be provided between the Santa Barbara airport and the campus on Sunday  and Thursday afternoons. All major rental car agencies are also represented  in Santa Barbara, and AMTRAK has rail connections to San Francisco from the  north and Los Angeles from the south. Santa Barbara is approximately 100 miles  north of Los Angeles airport, and 350 miles south of San Francisco.  REGISTRATION:  Participation is invited by interested parties, but attendance  at the workshop is limited, and pre-registration is strongly advised. Late  registrations, subject to a late registration fee, may be accepted if space  is available, but there are NO GUARANTEES. To register, fill out the attached  registration form and return to the address on the form along with payment in  full before July 9, 1993. Campus accommodations will be available on a first  come, first serve basis for attendees who register by July 9, 1993.

CRYPTO '93  -  Hotel Information ............................................................................  For those who choose not to stay in the dormitories, the following is a  partial list of hotels in the area. Those who choose to stay off campus are  responsible for making their own reservations, and early reservations are  advised since August is a popular season in Santa Barbara. Note that Goleta  is closer to UCSB than Santa Barbara, but that a car will probably be  required to travel between any hotel and the campus. All prices are subject  to change; prices should be confirmed by calling the individual hotels  directly. However, mention CRYPTO'93 when you are making your reservation and  in several of the hotels listed you will be eligible for the university rate  which can be significantly less than the normal rates. We are not able to  block rooms in these hotels, so please make reservations as early as  possible.

Does it grow automatically : on trees when we wish so, or someone has to produce it ?  Some say it was generated by God or Goddess; some say it was the result of the coalescence of billions of tons of interstellar debris.  In either case, the property of which Xavier speaks has been around for millions of years.   :     It all follows from the fact that Mother Nature does not : provide us automatically with our needs,  Oh?  When did She *stop*?  Mother Nature has been automatically providing us with her bounty ever since we crawled out of the primordial ooze.  It is not \\\"produced\\\": it produces itself, year after year.  Last night, for example, I saw four deer crossing the road (pretty sight, too); in an earlier time, one of them would have been dinner.  : There are 2 ways to go with produced things: the first is to  : _trade_ it with the the person(s) who produced it.  : The other one is to take it with a gun from the person who produced : it. The first way is the civilized method, the second is how savages : arrange their affairs.  The American Indians had no concept of ownership of property, and often freely gave of their supplies to neighboring tribes, trading food and clothing for weapons or services.  The Native Hawaiians, like their Polynesian ancestors, also could not conceive of that idea, and shared many things with the other Islanders.  In fact, \\\"hi'ipoi\\\", the Hawaiian word for \\\"cherish\\\" means \\\"sharing food\\\".  The Great Mahele, in which the Islands were divided up more-or-less evenly between the rich and the poor, was a white man's idea.  In Africa, villagers will often share tools, crops, and clothing with other members of their own village and neighboring villages.  Every anthropologist who has ever been to Africa has at least one tale of the difficulties arising from the so- called \\\"theft\\\" of the scientists possessions -- two concepts of which, until the visitors came along, the natives had no understanding.  These are the people we call \\\"savages\\\".  On the other hand, car-jackings and muggings are up from last year.

Walking around a truck stop at 4:00 AM wearing a lace miniskirt, a halter top, and no underwear of any sort;  3. Not having a purse or other I.D. with her.  Not enough to convict her, but enough to create reasonable doubt whether a rape actually took place, or theft of services.  Are you just ignorant, or lying again?   The accounts on the evening news indicated that they claimed self- defense, and the judge agreed that they were so operating. \",\"Thank you ALL for requesting my list and thank you again            if you purchased  vinyl from me.

For this reason, mixing with the NRA is probably a bad idea.  It diffuses the interests of both groups.  It may well diminish the Passion Index of the combined organization.  It is not clear it would greatly enlarge the NRA.  So, I believe a new organization, which may cooperate with NRA where the two organization's interest coincide, is the optimum strategy.  lew\",\"* Attention voters: * * I had a problem with my mailbox on the first day of voting. * Please check the Vote Acknowlegement (ACK) at the end of this CFV. * If your name/address is not there, please send your vote again. * (Actually, check even if you voted after the first day)   Introduction:   This is the third (and final) Call For Votes (CFV) for the creation  of four OS/2 newsgroups and the renaming of one:  (a)  create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting     (unmoderated)  (b)  renaming of comp.os.os2.programmer to       comp.os.os2.programmer.misc               (unmoderated)  (c)  comp.os.os2.setup                         (unmoderated)  (d)  comp.os.os2.multimedia                    (unmoderated)  (e)  comp.os.os2.bugs                          (unmoderated)   This is the second attempt at creating comp.os.os2.programmer.porting  and comp.os.os2.setup, and renaming comp.os.os2.programmer to  comp.os.os2.programmer.misc.  The first attempt failed in the summer  of 1992 (the voting deadline was August 31, 1992).  The voting rules  state that another attempt for creating newsgroups can be started  after a six month waiting period (in this case, it is March 1, 1993).  This is the first attempt at creating comp.os.os2.multimedia and  comp.os.os2.bugs.   This document contains:  *  the background showing the need for these proposals  *  the proposed charters for these proposals  *  voting instructions  *  a voting ballot  *  some example ballots  *  the voting rules  *  the voting schedule  *  the Mass Acknowledgement   Background:   The creation of two, free, 32-bit compilers for OS/2 2.x (gcc/2  and emx/gcc; read comp.os.os2.programmer for details) has spurred  a continuing deluge of software ported from UNIX platforms, such  as emacs, less, awk, grep, sed, xscheme, ispell, flex, yacc, and  much more.  Borland has released its C/C++ compiler for OS/2 2.x,  allowing for easier porting of DOS and Windows software.   Much of the PC hardware and drivers were written for DOS, and  later, Windows.  As more people are discovering OS/2 2.x, the  number of people asking questions about OS/2's compatibility  with their hardware increases, as does the questions on the  availability of drivers for their hardware, installation  procedures, etc.   Multimedia is becoming popular.  OS/2 2.0 supports Windows  Multimedia Extensions using Win-OS/2 3.0.  Furthermore, IBM is  including direct multimedia support in OS/2 starting with version  2.1 (in addition to using Win-OS/2 3.1).   Any non-trivial software will have bugs -- OS/2 is not exempt,  especially since IBM is constantly adding new features to OS/2.  So far, IBM has issued system patches and corrective service disks  (e.g.  the Service Pak) for free (free from BBSs and ftp sites, or  for free plus a small media charge for diskettes -- read  comp.os.os2.misc for details).   Proposed Charters:   (a)  create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting (unmoderated)    It will provide a forum for developers of ported software so   as to coordinate efforts, avoid duplication of effort, and   spur additional development.  The group will also cover   topics such as porting from other platforms (such as DOS,   Windows, UNIX, etc), toolkits which aid in program   portability (including porting tools such as Mirrors), and   so forth.   (b)  rename: comp.os.os2.programmer.misc (unmoderated)    To keep the structure of the OS/2 newsgroup heirarchy   orthogonal, comp.os.os2.programmer should be renamed to   comp.os.os2.programmer.misc.    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc will still be the newsgroup   for OS/2 programmers to discuss programming issues and   technical aspects of OS/2 in an unmoderated setting.   (c)  create comp.os.os2.setup (unmoderated)    It will be devoted to OS/2 system setup topics, including the   availability of device drivers, compatibility information,   installation procedures, system requirements, and overall   performance optimization.   (d)  create comp.os.os2.multimedia (unmoderated)    It will provide a forum for discussion of multi-media issues.   (e)  create comp.os.os2.bugs (unmoderated)    It will provide a forum for OS/2 system bug reports, bug   diagnosis and work arounds, the availability of system   patches and corrective service disks, and so forth.    [Note that discussion of bugs in applications belong in other   newsgroups, and discussion of bugs in OS/2 betas belong in   comp.os.os2.beta]   How to Vote:   To cast your vote, fill out the ballot below and e-mail it to me.  Many newsreaders will allow e-mail to be sent by replying to this  post.  Be sure to send only the ballot, and edit out the rest of  this post.   1)  Type in your vote for each proposal:       If you favor the charter as proposed, put a \\\"yes\\\" after its name.      If you oppose the charter as proposed, put a \\\"no\\\" after its name.      To abstain, leave a blank after its name.   2)  Type in your last name (i.e. your family name), a comma, and      your first name (i.e. your personal name).   3)  Cut out the ballot,  Please do not delete any lines of the      ballot.   4)  E-mail your ballot to mlevis@lonestar.utsa.edu before 11:59:59 pm      (Central Time), April 24, 1993.   Ballot:  ----------------cut here----------------cut here----------------cut here----          (a) comp.os.os2.programmer.porting:         (b)    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc:         (c)              comp.os.os2.setup:         (d)         comp.os.os2.multimedia:         (e)               comp.os.os2.bugs:          (f)       voter's last, first name:          e-mail ballot to mlevis@lonestar.utsa.edu by April 24  ----cut here----------------cut here----------------cut here----------------   Example Ballot #1:   (a) comp.os.os2.programmer.porting: yes  (b)    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc: yes  (c)              comp.os.os2.setup: no  (d)         comp.os.os2.multimedia:  (e)               comp.os.os2.bugs: no   (f)       voter's last, first name: Smith, John   In this example, John Smith favors comp.os.os2.programmer.porting  to be created, and comp.os.os2.programmer to be renamed to  comp.os.os2.programmer.misc.  He also opposes the creation of  comp.os.os2.setup and comp.os.os2.bugs.  He does not have a view  on the creation of comp.os.os2.multimedia.    Example Ballot #2:   (a) comp.os.os2.programmer.porting: yes  (b)    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc: yes  (c)              comp.os.os2.setup: yes  (d)         comp.os.os2.multimedia: yes  (e)               comp.os.os2.bugs: yes   (f)       voter's last, first name: Doe, Jane   In this example, Jane Doe favors the creation or rename of all  the proposals.   Voting Rules:   * One vote per person.  If you vote more than once, only the most    recent vote will be counted.   * Votes must be mailed to me by the person voting.  Proxy voting,    forwarding, posting votes to a newsgroup, etc. will not be counted.   * Do not ask how the votes are going.  The status of the votings    will be revealed only after the poll closes.   * I will acknowledge votes by Mass Acknowledgement (ACK).  I will    post the ACK twice (see Schedule below).   * If you need help for using your editor, using e-mail, how    voting works in general, etc. then ask an expert at your site.    Also see the ``How To Create a New Newsgroup'' article which is    posted to news.answers on a regular basis.   * If you need any clarifications on voting procedures for this    CFV, send me e-mail at mlevis@ringer.cs.utsa.edu.   * When the voting period is over (see Schedule below), a proposal    passes if both of the following formulas are true:    1)  the number of YES votes exceeds the number of NO votes        by at least 100 (i.e. YES >= NO + 100, or YES - NO >= 100).    2)  the number of YES votes exceeds at least twice the        number of NO votes (i.e. YES >= 2 * NO, or YES - NO >= NO).    In other words, a proposal passes if:        YES - NO >= max (100, NO)    where max() returns the highest number given to it.   Schedule:   The voting period started on March 29 when the first CFV was posted  by David Lawrence (the news.announce.newgroups moderator).   This third CFV is a repeat of the first CFV, but it also has the  Mass Acknowledgement (ACK) of names and e-mail addresses of those who  have already voted -- re-send your vote if it is not there.  If you  have not voted yet, vote now!   The voting period will end at 11:59:59 pm (Central Time), on  April 24, 1993.  Votes received after that time will not count.  The voting results and tally will be posted shortly after that  date.   Mass Acknowledgement:   Here is the list of people who have already sent in their ballots  as of 12:01 am (Central Time) on April 15, 1993:                            bdubbs@cs.tamu.edu Aiyagari,

I'd trust the NSA or the President if they stated there were no trap doors--I'd be even happier if a committee of independent experts examined the thing under seal of secrecy and reported back that it was secure.  I'd trust something from the NSA long before I'd trust something from some Swiss or anybody Japanese.  This may seem surprising to some here, but I suggest most corporations would feel the same way.

The tool survived  the trip from the launch pad up to approximately a 250,000 foot  altitude, then down to splashdown and towing back to KSC.      NASA spokesperson Lisa Malone told the media,      \\\"It's been a long time since something like this happened.  We've  lost washers and bolts (before) but never a tool like this.\\\"      The initial investigation into the incident has shown that a  Thiokol Corp. technician noticed and reported his pliers as missing on  April 2nd.  Unfortunately, the worker's supervisor did not act on the  report and Discovery was launched with its \\\"extra payload\\\".  NASA  officials were never told of the missing tool before the April 8th  launch date.      The free-flying pliers were supposed to be tethered to the SRB  technician.  When the tool was found in an aft section of the booster,  its 18-inch long rope was still attached.  The pliers were found in a  part of the booster which is not easily visible from the launch pad.      A spokesperson for the Lockheed Space Operations Company said that  the Shuttle processor will take \\\"appropriate action\\\".  Thiokol is a  subcontractor to LSOC for work to prepare Shuttle hardware for launch.  _________________________________________________________  Karl Anderson  DEV/2000: Configuration Management/Version Control  Dept 53K/006-2  Rochester, Minnesota 55901 253-8044  Tie 8-453-8044 INTERNET: karl@vnet.ibm.com PRODIGY: CMMG96A\",\"OK, I'll join in the fun and give my playoff predictions:   1st round:  ----------  PITT vs NYI:  PITT in 4.

Overacker writes, responding to Simon:     I may be interesting to see some brief selections posted to the    net.  My understanding is that SSPX does not consider ITSELF in    schism or legitimately excommunicated.  But that's really beside    the point.  What does the Roman Catholic church say?    Excommunication can be real apart from formal excommunication, as    provided for in canon law.  Here's some of the theology involved for the interested.  There is confusion over this issue of the SSPX's \\\"schism\\\"; often the basic problem is lack of an ability to distinguish between:  - true obedience - false obedience - disobedience - schism  Take the various classifications of obedience first.  There are 2 important elements involved here for my purposes:  1) a command 2) the response made to the command  As far as the command goes, commands can be LEGITIMATE, such as the Pope ordering Catholics to not eat meat on Fridays.  Or they can be ILLEGITIMATE, such as the Pope ordering Catholics to worship the god Dagon when every other full moon comes around.  As far as the response to a command goes, it can be to REFUSE to do what is commanded, or to COMPLY.  Making a table, there are thus 4 possibilites:  command         response            name ----------------------------------------------------- LEGITIMATE      COMPLY              true obedience ILLEGITIMATE    REFUSE              true obedience LEGITIMATE      REFUSE              disobedience ILLEGITIMATE    COMPLY              false obedience  So now you see where my 3 classifications of obedience come from.  Obedience is not solely a matter of compliance/refusal.  The nature of the commands must also be taken into account; it is not enough to consider someone's compliance or refusal and then say whether they are \\\"obedient\\\" or \\\"disobedient\\\".  You also have to take into consideration whether the commands are good or bad.  In my example, if the Pope commands all Catholics to worship the god Dagon, and they all refuse, they aren't being disobedient at all!  As far as the Society of Saint Pius X goes, they are certainly refusing to comply with certain things the Pope desires.  But that alone is insufficient to allow one to label them \\\"disobedient\\\".  You also have to consider the nature of the Papal desires.  And there's the rub: SSPX says the Popes since Vatican II have been commanding certain very bad things for the Church.  The Popes have of course disagreed.  So where are we?  Are we in another Arian heresy, complete with weak Popes?  Or are the SSPX priests modern Martin Luthers?  Well, the only way to answer that is to examine who is saying what, and what the traditional teaching of the Church is.  The problem here is that very few Catholics have much of an idea of what is really going on, and what the issues are.  The religion of American Catholics is especially defective in intellectual depth.  You will never read about the issues being discussed in the Catholic press in this country.  (On the other hand, one Italian Catholic magazine I get -- 30 Days -- has had interviews with the Superior General of the Society of Saint Pius X.)  Many Catholics will decide to side with the Pope.  There is some soundness in this, because the Papacy is infallible, so eventually some Pope *will* straighten all this out.  But, on the other hand, there is also unsoundness in this, in that, in the short term, the Popes may indeed be wrong, and such Catholics are doing nothing to help the situation by obeying them where they're wrong.  In fact, if the situation is grave enough, they sin in obeying him.  At the very least, they're wasting a great opportunity, because they are failing to love Christ in a heroic way at the very time that He needs this badly.  Schism... let's move on to schism.  What is it?  Schism is a superset of disobedience (refusal to obey a legitimate command).  All schismatics are disobedient.  But it's a superset, so it doesn't work the other way around: not all disobeyers are schismatics.  The mere fact that the SSPX priests don't comply with the Holy Father's desires doesn't make them schismatics.  So what is it that must be added to disobedience to constitute a schism?  Maybe this something else makes the SSPX priests schismatics.  You must add this: the rejection of the right to command.  Look in any decent reference on Catholic theology, and that's what you'll find: the distinguishing criterion of schism is rejection of the right to command.  Here's what the Catholic Encyclopedia says, for example:      ... not every disobedience is a schism; in order to possess this     character it must include besides the trangression of the commands     of superiors, denial of their Divine right to command.     (from the CE article \\\"Schism\\\")  Is the Society of Saint Pius X then schismatic?  The answer is a clear no: they say that the Pope is their boss.  They pray for him every day.  And that's all that matters as far as schism goes.  What all this boils down to is this: if we leave aside the consideration of the exact nature of their objections, their position is a legitimate one, as far as the Catholic theology of obedience and schism goes.  They are resisting certain Papal policies because they think that they are clearly contrary to the traditional teaching of the Papacy, and the best interests of the Church.  (In fact, someone who finds himself in this situation has a *duty* to resist.)  Now, what is the stance of Rome on all this?  Well, if you read the Holy Father's motu proprio \\\"Ecclesia Dei\\\", you can find out.  It's the definitive document on the subject.  A motu proprio is a specifically Papal act.  It's not the product of a Roman congregation, a letter that the Pope has possibly never even read.  It's from the Pope himself.  His boss is God... there's no one else to complain to.  In this document, the Holy Father says, among other things:  1) The episcopal consecrations performed by Archbishop Lefebvre constituted a schismatic act.  2) Archbishop Lefebvre's problem was a misunderstanding of the nature of Tradtion.  Both are confusing: I fail to see the logic of the Pope's points.  As far as the episcopal consecrations go, I read an interesting article in a translation of the Italian magazine \\\"Si Si No No\\\".  It all gets back to the question of jurisdiction.  If episcopal consecrations imply rejection of the Pope's jurisdiction, then they would truly constitute a schismatic act, justifying excommunication under the current code of canon law.  But my problem with this is this: according to the traditional theology of Holy Orders, episcopal consecration does not confer jurisdiction.  It only confers the power of Order: the ability to confect the Sacraments.  Jurisdiction must be conferred by someone else with the power to confer it (such as the Pope).  The Society bishops, knowing the traditional theology quite well, take great pains to avoid any pretence of jurisdiction over anyone.  They simply confer those Sacraments that require a bishop.  The \\\"Si Si No No\\\" article was interesting in that it posited that the reason that the Pope said what he did is that he has a novel, post-Vatican II idea of Holy Orders.  According to this idea, episcopal consecration *does* confer jurisdiction.  I lent the article to a friend, unfortunately, so can't tell you more.  I believe they quoted the new code of canon law in support of this idea.  The Pope's thinking on this point remains a great puzzle to me. There's no way there is a schism, according to traditional Catholic theology.  So why does the Pope think this?  As far as the points regarding the nature of Tradition goes, here's the passage in question:      The root of this schismatic act can be discerned in an incomplete     and contradictory notion of Tradtion.  Incomplete, because it does     not take sufficiently into the account the living character of     Tradition, which, as the Second Vatican Council clearly taught,          comes from the apostles and progresses in the Church with the         help of the Holy Spirit.  There is a growth in insight into         the realities and words that are being passed on.  This comes         about in various ways.  It comes through the contemplation and         study of believers who ponder these things in their hearts.         It comes from the intimate sense of spiritual realities which         they experience.  And it comes from the preaching of those who         have received, along with their right of succession in the         espiscopate, the sure charism of truth.      But especially contradictory is a notion of Tradition which     opposes the universal Magisterium of the Church possessed by the     Bishop of Rome and the body of bishops.  It is impossible to     remain faithful to the Tradition while breaking the ecclesial bond     with him to whom, in the person of the Apostle Peter, Christ     himself entrusted the ministry of unity in His Church.      (Papal motu proprio \\\"Ecclesia Dei\\\", 2 July 1988)  It seems to me that the Holy Father is making two points here that can be simplified to the following:  - Vatican Council II has happened. - I am the Pope.  The argument being that either case is sufficient to prove that Archbishop Lefebvre must be wrong, because he disagrees with them. This is weak, to say the least!  It would have helped clarify things more if the Pope had addressed Archbishop Lefebvre's concerns in detail.  What is John Paul II's stand on the social Kingship of Christ, as taught by Gregory XVI, Pius IX, Leo XIII, Pius XI and Pius XII, for example?  Are we supposed to ignore what all these Popes said on the subject?  I don't know what the future will hold, but the powers that be in the SSPX are still talking with Rome and trying to straighten things out.  --------------------------------------------------------------  [Many people would prefer to call a justified refusal to obey \\\"justified disobedience\\\" or even \\\"obeying God rather than man\\\". Calling a refusal to obey obedience puts us into a sort of Alice in Wonderland world where words mean whatever we want them to mean.  Similarly, schism indicates a formal break in the church.  If the Pope says that a schism exists, it seems to me that by definition it exists.  It may be that the Pope is on the wrong side of the break, that there is no good reason for the break to exist, and that it will shortly be healed.  But how can one deny that it does in fact exist?  It seems to me that you are in grave danger of destroying the thing you are trying to reform: the power of the papacy.  What good will it do you if you become reconciled to the the Pope in the future, but in the process, you have destroyed his ability to use the tools of church discipline?  It's one thing to hold that the Pope has misused his powers, and excommunicated someone wrongly.  It's something else to say that his excommunication did not take effect, and the schism is all in his imagination.  That means that acts of church discipline are not legal tools, but acts whose validity is open to debate.  Generally it has been liberal Catholics who have had problems with the Pope.

This is how the history  between the two nations started some centuries ago.  Since then, it has been  a continuous battle between the two nations.  From my perspective I can't see  why I should say that Greeks have been responsible for what has happened   between the two nations.  Of course, it would not be reasonable to argue that  the hostility should drag till we kick the Turks out of this area.  This isn't  going to happen, so the best would be to improve the relations between the two  countries.  A golden oportunity exists with Cyprus.  If things can't work  there, there isn't any possible way that could work between our nations.    I always avoid to discuss such things.  I consider it a waist of my time.

The jealousy does not technically exist until the object is apparent. However, the capacity to be jealous is presumably still there even though it is not detectable.  Your description of the Unbilical took me three passes to understand (!) but I get the gist and I have to tentatively agree. I think our two definitions can sit side by side without too much trouble, though. I haven't attempted to define the reason behind the Moral Driver (only hinted through the essence of each Moral). Your definition hints that animals are also capable of a similar morality - Simians have a similar Social Order to ourselves and it is easy to anthropomorphize with these animals. Is this possible or have I misunderstood?   My p.s. thoughts falls roughly in line with John Stuart Mill and his writings on Utilitarianism. I have no particular plan (except to do my bit - personal ethics AND social work). My opinion (for what it is worth) is that the Authority for each Moral must be increased somehow, and that this will probably take several generations to be effective. I don't think that the list of Morals has changed for Society significantly, though . The Authority element may come from our authority figures and roles models (see Eric Berne and his transactional analysis work [+ Mavis Klein] for references) and this is what gives rise to a deterioration of moral standards in the long term.  I've had some more thoughts on my definitions:  I've was thinking that I should add Moral Character to the list of definitions in order to get a dynamic version of the Moral Nature (ie. the interplay of the Moral Code and associated Authorities). A suitable analogy might be a graphic equaliser on a HiFi system - the Moral Nature being the set of frequencies and the chosen 'amplitudes', and the Moral Character being the spectrum over time.  Conscience is a little more difficult because I can't define it as the reasoning of a person between actions in the context of his Moral Nature because Conscience seems to cut in most of the time unbidden and often unwanted. I think Conscience is manifest when a decision is made at a given time which compromises one's Moral Nature. My Conscience fits in more with Freud's SuperEgo (plus the Moral Driver) with the stimulous being the urges or Freud's Id. The reasoning that I mentioned before is Freud's Ego, I suppose. If the Moral Driver is part of the Id then the reason why Conscience cuts in unbidden is partially explained. The question is \\\"what provides the stimulous to activate the Moral driver?\\\". I think I need some more time with this one.  That's about it for now!  David.  --- On religion:\",\" Bill, I have taken the time to explain that biblical scholars consider the Josephus reference to be an early Christian insert.  By biblical scholar I mean an expert who, in the course of his or her research, is willing to let the chips fall where they may.  This excludes literalists, who may otherwise be defined as biblical apologists.  They find what they want to find.  They are not trustworthy by scholarly standards (and others).  Why an insert?  Read it - I have, a number of times.  The passage is glaringly out of context, and Josephus, a superb writer, had no such problem elsewhere  in his work.  The passage has *nothing* to do with the subject matter in which  it lies.  It suddenly appears and then just as quickly disappears.  Until you can demonstrate how and why the scholarly community is wrong about the Josephus insert, your \\\"proof\\\" is meaningless and it should not be repeated here.  What's more, even if Josephus happened to be legitimate, it would \\\"prove\\\" nothing.  Scholars speak of the \\\"weight of evidence.\\\"  Far more independent evidence would be required to validate your claim.  Until forthcoming, your belief is based on faith.  That's OK, but you exceed your rights when you pass faith off as fact.  As for the gospels, there are parallels, but there are also glaring inconsistencies and contradictions.  Shouldn't a perfect canon be perfect?  Shouldn't there be absolutely no room for debate?  I suggest you read _Gospel  Fictions_ by Randel Helms, and _The Unauthorized Version_ by Robin Fox (for  Herb Huston, no known kinship or familial relationship, but we do indeed share  an evolutionary ancestry).  The fact that there are inconsistencies, gaps and contradictions does not deny your position.  On the other hand, neither do the gospels \\\"prove\\\" your faith.  Independent evidence is necessary, and I know of none (which we have already discussed, and so far you have not provided any).  Until then, its faith.  Moreover, you have committed a fundamental error in logic.  You have attempted to \\\"prove\\\" your claim with that which you want to prove.  Its no different than saying \\\"I am right because I say so.\\\"    Your logic is full of circles.  It reminds me a bit of the 1910 Presbyterian  General Assembly.  The assembly defined five fundamentals (this is where \\\"fundamentalist\\\" came from) of orthodox Protestant Christianity, to wit: 1) Jesus performed miracles, 2) Jesus was born of a virgin, 3) Jesus was bodily resurrected, 4) Jesus' crucifixion atoned for human sin, and - here is the clincher - 5) the bible is the inerrant word of God.  Presbyterians construe \\\"inerrant\\\" broadly as spritually inerrant.  Fundamentalists take the first four as literally true, and then validate them with a literally inerrant bible, which contains the first four, and which is the only thing known to  contain the first four.    Smoke and mirrors and wands and hand waving if ever there was!  Its faith, Bill.  You don't have any more or better truths than anyone else.  Whatever works for you.  Just don't foist it on others.

Prince has never hit well in the minors and he's now 27 years old, I think.  Pagnozzi was not a bad hitter in the minors.  (I'll bring in the numbers tomorrow assuming I don't have another brain cramp and forget.)  He had a very good year at Louisville  before coming up to the majors.  As I recall, the hype on Pagnozzi coming up in the organization was good hit, decent fielding.  When he got to the  majors and didn't hit as well as expected (not as much playing time?), he  became Exhibit 312 in Nichols' Law of Catcher Defense and got the reputation  as an outstanding defensive catcher.  It's not clear he ever learned to hit.

If Ted is going to invoke Pagnozzi as a model for Prince, given that Prince has underperformed Pagnozzi in the minors, it's not a rosy picture.  BTW, I'm still unhappy with moving Zeile, who had the same reputation  coming up in the Cardinal organization as Pagnozzi, except that he was a much, much better hitter, to 3rd where he could be an average hitter and a below average fielder instead of a well-above average hitter as an average (or below average) fielding catcher.

We'll probably end up giving them weapons.   During WWII, the British managed to supply arms to the Yugoslavs despite German occupation.  If the Europeans had the will to do anything besides sponsoring peace conferences, they would have no problem putting any kind of weapon they wanted into Bosnia.  I guess I would favor ending the embargo if the Congress would pass a law forbidding export of US military supplies to Yugoslavia, including via third parties.  Until then the risks of the US being drawn into a more active role would be too great.  I do not see the arms embargo as a major factor in the outcome of the war.

Those who subscribe to _Biblical Archaeology Review_ will remember a spectacular letter battle set off when someone complained about a Franklin Mint ad.  (_BAR_ is a great magazine, but the contrast between the rather scholarly articles and the incredibly sleazy ads is extreme.)  In this ad, they were hawking a doll with a head based on the famous bust of Nefertiti, giving the face a typical doll-pink complexion. The letter complained about this as a misrepresentation on the grounds that Nefertiti was \\\"a beautiful black queen.\\\"  This set off an exchange of hotheaded letters than ran for several issues, to the point where they had an article from an Egyptologist titled \\\"Was Cleopatra Black?\\\"  (The answer to the title is \\\"no\\\"-- she was greek.)  I have to say that I hear a hysterical note in much of the complaining.  I personally have seen only one blond-haired Jesus (in the National Shrine in Wash. DC), and I found it very jarring.  Western representations vary enourmously, but in general the image of is of a youngish male with dark hair and beard, of a sort that can be found (modulo the nose) all up and down the Mediterranean.  (Also, if what I remember is correct, the \\\"Black Madonna\\\" doesn't represent a person with negroid features.  It is black because of an accident.  Joe Buehler....?)  In the presence of all those marble statues, one is prone to forget that greeks are rather likely to have black hair.  When one crosses the bosporus, the situation breaks down completely.  Are Turks white?  How about Persians, or various groups in the indian subcontinent?  Was Gandhi white?  How about the Arabs?  Or picture Nassar and Sadat standing side by side.  And then there are the Ethiopians....  Those of a white racist bent are not likely to say that *any* of these people are \\\"white\\\" (i.e., of the racist's \\\"race\\\").  If I may risk a potentially inflammatory remark, one undercurrent of this seems to be the identification of modern jews as members of the oppressor race.  Considering the extreme dicotomy between medieval religion on the one hand and medieval antisemitism on the other, I don't think that this \\\"Jesus was white\\\" thesis ever played the roles that some hold it did.  Representations of Jesus as black or korean or whatever are fine.  It seems awfully self-serving to insist that Jesus belongs to one's own racial group.\",\"Hi.  I am having some interesting problems with my Boca graphics card, which  is based on the Cirrus Logic chipset (I am not sure exactly which one).  The problem is as follows:  If I use any Windows driver at 800x600 except for the 64K-colour driver (ie 16 colour or 256 colour), the image on screen becomes too tall - no amount of resizing on the monitor will make it fit.  And if I use Excel with the 64K- colour driver, it hangs as soon as it loads.  Anyone out there used this card/experienced anything similar.  Please reply by mail, and I will post any solutions here.  Regards    - Simon   -- \",\"I'm trying to set up a personal studio.

In the early 80's with the fuel crisis, etc., everyone wanted better fuel mileage.  Diesel fuel was the cheapest fuel available and usually provides better mileage than comparable gasoline engines.  So, GM decided to conver their 350 gas engine into a diesel engine (I think was a 5.7 liter).  Big mistake.  The engine was not redesigned, but converted.  The engine could not handle the higher compression, etc.  Lots of problems with these cars.  This thew up a big red flag to the casual observer -- DON\\\"T BUY A DIESEL.  THEY ARE BAD.  This was a gross generalization.  Ask yourself this question -- if your livelihood depended on driving, LOTS of it, would you use a dependable or undependable (but cheaper in the short run) vehicle?  What do Greyhound busses have in them? Trailer Trucks?  Even Train Locomotives?  Are these gasoline engines? No, they are diesel.  Tractor trailer truck manufacturers provide a 500,000 mile warrantee with they vehicles.  I own an `82 Diesel Suburban.  The 6.2L diesel is a GREAT engine. Just keeps going.  It was more expensive (when new) than the gasoline engine vehicle was.  The only problem with diesel engines is that  when they need to be rebuilt, they are expensive.  In a gas 350 engine, you will pay about $1000 for a rebuild.  Diesel 6.2L is about $2000.  But then again, the diesel engine lasts about twice as long and gets about 50% better mileage.  A carburator for a gasoline engine costs about $100 to rebuild (or less).  A rebuild of the fuel injection pump on a diesel will cost about $500 (or more).  But then again, you never need a tune-up.  If you're looking at a rebuilt 6.2L, I'd say you got a great deal. Check to see if the fuel injection pump was rebuilt also.\",\"  On my LC (RZ to any ex-colonists) I replaced the bolt at the bottom of the barrel with a tap.

(-:\",\" I must admit that this point has been running through my mind for most of the discussion: one the dice are out there, it won't be long before someone decaps it and, after a bit of work, has full details of the Clipper algorythm.  This isn't trivial to do, but then again, it is not impossibly difficult either.  Any half way decent VLSI design student should be able to take a photograph of a technology s/he is familiar with, and given a description of the input, output, control and supply lines, figure out  the function of various subsystems on the die.  Indeed, this is not an uncommon exercise performed during training (because it makes you think about design decisions made by other designers.  I could speculate that these chips are going to be manufactured using \\\"tamperproof\\\" carriers (unlikely - such techniques are *very* expensive and this thing is supposed to be relatively cheap to produce), or that there will be some legal or legislative framework to prevent publication of the algorythm (unlikely - please correct me if I am wrong but aren't these supposed to be sold internationally?).  I suppose that the most likely reason the algorythm is remaining secret for the moment is that some idiot bureaucrat, untrammeled by the realities of the situation, decided that \\\"well, we should keep it a secret because it is supposed to be secret, isn't it?\\\"  Just some random thoughts... \",\"      Of course; sorry for the misunderstanding.  I was referring to the fact that far more aeronautical development took place in the '30's.  For much of the '20's, the super-abundance of Jennies and OX-5 engines held down the industry.  By 1926, many of the obsolete WWI aircraft had been retired and Whirlwind had their power/weight ratio and reliability up to the point where long-distance flights became practical.  It's important to note that the Atlantic was flown not once but THREE times in 1927:  Lindbergh, Chamberlin and Levine, and Byrd's _America_.  \\\"When it's time to railroad, you railroad.\\\"     Not off the top of my head; I'll have to dig out my reference books again. However, I will say that the most common arrangement in Prince Henry the Navigator's Portugal was for the prince to put up part of the money and merchants to put up the rest.  They profits from the voyage would then be shared.     The problem is that the amount of prize money required to inspire a Moon Base is much larger than any but a handful of individuals or corporations can even consider putting up.  The Kremer Prizes (human powered aircraft), Orteig's prize, Lord Northcliffe's prize for crossing the Atlantic (won in 1919 by Alcock and Brown) were MUCH smaller.  The technologies required were within the reach of individual inventors, and the prize amounts were well within the reach of a large number of wealthy individuals.  I think that only a gov't could afford to set up a $1B+ prize for any purpose whatsoever.   Note that Burt Rutan suggested that NASP could be built most cheaply by taking out an ad in AvWeek stating that the first company to build a plane that could take off and fly the profile would be handed $3B, no questions asked. \",\" Press conference at 1PM ...

In short, virtually every board manufacturer cheats on the test by writing things in the driver that is there only to make the board appear faster on the WinBench suite.  So the WinBench score has no bearing in reality to how cards stack up on real world tasks.  In the last PC-Magazine they benchmarked some of the new accelerators, and admitted that many of them 'cheated' on WinBench.  Interestingly, they 'allowed' one type of cheating behaviour (caching for bitblt operations, no matter how unreal), yet did not allow a couple of other types of cheating behaviour that some of the cards used.  At least one card was eliminated from the \\\"Editor's Choice\\\" because of cheating on the benchmark.\",\"   I've got a used one for sale.

Traditionally, they have used pictures, words, demonstrations,     music and dance to communicate imagery.  However, expressing     complex notions such as God and infinity or a seemingly well     defined concept such as a flower can present challenges which far     exceed their technical skills.      The explosive use of computers as visualization and expression     tools has compounded this problem.  In hypermedia, multimedia and     virtual reality systems vast amounts of information confront the     observer or participant.  Wading through a multitude of     simultaneous images and sounds in possibly unfamiliar     representions, a confounded user asks: \\\"What does it all mean?\\\"      Since image construction, transmission, reception, decipherment and     ultimate understanding are complex tasks, strongly influenced by     physiology, education and culture; and, since electronic media     radically amplify each processing step, then we, as electronic     communicators, must determine the fundamental paradigms for     composing imagery for understanding.      Therefore, the purpose of this conference is to bring together a     breadth of disciplines, including, but not limited to, the     physical, biological and computational sciences, technology, art,     psychology, philosophy, and education, in order to define and     discuss the issues essential to image understanding within the     computer graphics context.

MILITECH(tm) is yet another oil additive. But the demonstration of this product really impressive, if it didn't cheat.  The setup of the demo is fairly simple. A cone shaped rotor is half submerged in a small oil sink, filled with motor oil. The rotor is powered by an electronic motor. A metal pad is pressed against the rotor using the torque wrench until the rotor stopped by friction.  The torque that is needed to stop rotor is read from the torque wrench.  Before MILITECH was added, the rotor was stopped with about 60 lb-ft of torque (You pick the brand of oil, no difference). Once MILITECH was  added to the oil, the rotor could not be stopped even with 120+ lb-ft of torque.   Here is the good part: even after the salesman emptied the oil sink,  you still could not stopped the rotor with the thin film remained  on it.  They say you need only add 2oz per quart of oil every 15k miles. A 16 oz bottle is $25.  I still have my doubts. If this product is really so great, why it was so little known? The salesman said it is widely used in military. I didn't believe it.  The demo was so impressive, that I bought a bottle against my common sense.  Has anyone heard of or actually used this product?

What was the scope's actual sampling rate at the time? How is the data being massaged after capture but before display, etc. One common misconception is the speed of the scope.  Is the HP scope you're using really a 100 MHz scope? Or is it a 20 MHz sample rate scope (~5 MHz single shot significance) whose front end including S/H can support 100 MHz waveforms (important for equivalent time sampling)? The 100 MHz input in this case really only helps you when your waveform is repetitive, or on a single sample, when you get lucky and hit a transient event during a sample time.  So, there are a lot more variables in understanding how to get useful information from a digital scope. I prefer an analog scope for general use and the digital for events where I need storage for later analysis or comparison, when the event is within the capability of the scope. Now, for the price of true 100 MHz digital scopes to fall...  --  --------------------------------------------------------------------        Dave Medin   Phone: (205) 730-3169 (w)     SSD--Networking    (205) 837-1174 (h)     Intergraph Corp.

(for the humor impared :{P PPhhhhhtttttt!)\",\"  Let us explore this interesting paragraph point by point, sentence by sentence.   1) We are talking about origins, not merely science.  Origins of what?  Are we speaking of the origins of life, the human species, the universe, physical law, biological diversity or what?  2) Science cannot explain origins.  This is a false statement unless it is carefully qualified.  It depends on what origins we are talking about.  3) For a person to exclude anything but science from the issue of origins is to say that there is no higher truth than science.  Again, this is a false statement.  To begin with, the notion of \\\"higher truth\\\" is distinctly dubious.  Many people believe that there are ways to ascertain truth that are not in the repetoire of science; they even believe that there are ways that are more reliable and certain.  Many believe that there are truths that cannot be expressed using the language of science.  Let it be so.  These truths are neither \\\"higher\\\" or  \\\"lower\\\"; they are simply true.  More to the point, restricting one's discussion of origins to science does not reject other sources of knowledge; it simply restricts the scope of discussion.  4) This is a false premise.  If this is intended as asserting that the previous sentence was false then (4) is actually true.  However the context identifies it as another false [or at least theologically unsound] statement.  5) By the way, I enjoy science.  On the evidence Mr. Rawlins lacks sufficient understanding of science to enjoy science in any meaningful sense.  One might just as well say that one enjoys literature written in a language that one cannot read. However one cannot mark this sentence as false -- to follow the analogy, perhaps he likes the pretty shapes of the letters.  6) It is truly a wonder observing God's creation.  Let us not quibble; count this one as true.  7) Macroevolution is a mixture of 15 percent science and 85 percent religion [guaranteed within three percent error :) ]  Still another false statement.  However one can make it come out true with the following contextual modification:  \\\"Macroevolution, as misunderstood by Rawline, is a mixture of 15 percent of what Rawlins erroneously thinks of as science, and 85 percent of what Rawlins erroneously thinks of as religion.\\\"  -----  It is distinctly noticeable that Mr. Rawlins fails miserably to touch on truth except when he reports personally on what he feels.  [I do him the justice of assuming that he is not misinforming us as to his personal reactions.]  One can account for this by the hypothesis that he has an idiosyncratic and personal concept of truth.\",\" Yes.  But this is *irrelevant*.  You're talking about averages, when we have lots of information about THIS PLAYER IN PARTICULAR to base our decisions on.  I might as well say \\\"We know that very, very few people are more than 7 feet tall, so chances are that Manute Bol is really only 6 foot 4.\\\"   Why isn't Lopez likely to hit that well?  He hit that well last year (after adjusting his stats for park and league and such); he hit better (on an absolute scale) than Olson or Berryhill did.  By a lot.  As for rushing...  If there really is a qualitative difference between the minors and the majors that requires a period of adjustment (and I don't believe there is), then wouldn't you rather waste Lopez's 22-year old good season than his 23-year old very good season or his 24-year-old excellent season?  The sooner you get him acclimated, the more of his prime you get to use.   The point was not that 17 AB is a significant sample, but rather that he hadn't done anything in spring training to cause even a blockhead manager to question whether his minor league numbers were for real, or to send him down \\\"until he gets warmed up\\\".   Most players are *never* ready for the bigs.  What does this have to do with Javy Lopez?   See above.     But I could apply the same reasoning to Frank Thomas or Barry Bonds.  Most players aren't that good, so they probably won't be that good this year either.   And demonstrated inabilities to hit their way out of a soap bubble.   Not superstars, not stars, not even good players.  Maybe average, if we're being charitable.   Ummm.  Justice is a very fine hitter.  Pendleton might have another big year in his bat, but he might also spend the season in Hamstring Hell.  Gant is a big question mark.  The Bream/Hunter platoon is decent (not excellent) and has rotten OBP or SLG (depending on who's in).  Blauser is a very valuable bat... for a shortstop.    Wanna bet?  The difference between Lopez's bat and Olson/Berryhill could be 20 or 30 runs over the course of the season.  Given a choice between a player with experience and a player who can play, I'll take the latter every time.   Just like Keith Mitchell did?   That was me, and you so far your only counter-proposal is that they really don't understand how good Lopez is, or overvalue experience, or some combination of the two.  I think my interpretation was more flattering to the organization.

Even if you ignore the nonsense of the above statement for a moment, and even if you are happy with such system and the current escrow agencies NOW, what guarantees that you'll be happy with them TOMORROW, when the government changes? Or when the current government throws away the sheep skin? All the sheep who are reasoning like you will get caught by surprise, but it will be too late, because then cryptography that is not guaranteed to be breakable by the government will already have been outlawed... After all, you've already got privacy that is said to be breakable only by the law enforcement agencies, so if you are law-abiding, you have no reasons to use a stronger one, right? So, if you are using a stronger one, you have something to hide from the law enforcement agencies, right? Something unlawful, right? Therefore, strong crypto is a clear idndication that you are doing something unlawful.

And how do you know that they will not make a mistake? And how do you know that the version of the algorithm they will be let to examine is the same as the one that will be really used?  Regarding the mistake - even the few information \\\"they\\\" have let out has revealed a serious security hole in the protocol - the 80-bit key is split in two 40-bit ones, thus the whole system is easily breakable, if you have only one of the keys.

That's why the drug dealers have their accounts in Swiss banks, instead of in American ones. For some reason, they do trust the Swiss banks more... Guess they'll trust the Swiss encryption more too... I see IDEA becoming suddenly popular... :-)   It's not surprising at all, but not because of the reason you give. It's because it is obvious that the US government has put a lot of money behind this program and it will support it. Thus, most corporations will try to get their piece from the pie by supporting it too. The same good old greed. Strong encryption is not widely available now not because of some plot, but because the companies don't see much money in it. It will be available even less, if the companies can see any penalties associated with it...   Yeah, just as I predicted, you are here again, to support the new system.

WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SATURN V PLANS      Despite a widespread belief to the contrary, the Saturn V blueprints     have not been lost. They are kept at Marshall Space Flight Center on     microfilm.      The problem in re-creating the Saturn V is not finding the drawings, it     is finding vendors who can supply mid-1960's vintage hardware (like     guidance system components), and the fact that the launch pads and VAB     have been converted to Space Shuttle use, so you have no place to launch     from.      By the time you redesign to accommodate available hardware and re-modify     the launch pads, you may as well have started from scratch with a clean     sheet design.       WHY DATA FROM SPACE MISSIONS ISN'T IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE      Investigators associated with NASA missions are allowed exclusive access     for one year after the data is obtained in order to give them an     opportunity to analyze the data and publish results without being     \\\"scooped\\\" by people uninvolved in the mission. However, NASA frequently     releases examples (in non-digital form, e.g. photos) to the public early     in a mission.       RISKS OF NUCLEAR (RTG) POWER SOURCES FOR SPACE PROBES      There has been extensive discussion on this topic sparked by attempts to     block the Galileo and Ulysses launches on grounds of the plutonium     thermal sources being dangerous. Numerous studies claim that even in     worst-case scenarios (shuttle explosion during launch, or accidental     reentry at interplanetary velocities), the risks are extremely small.     Two interesting data points are (1) The May 1968 loss of two SNAP 19B2     RTGs, which landed intact in the Pacific Ocean after a Nimbus B weather     satellite failed to reach orbit. The fuel was recovered after 5 months     with no release of plutonium. (2) In April 1970, the Apollo 13 lunar     module reentered the atmosphere and its SNAP 27 RTG heat source, which     was jettisoned, fell intact into the 20,000 feet deep Tonga Trench in     the Pacific Ocean. The corrosion resistant materials of the RTG are     expected to prevent release of the fuel for a period of time equal to 10     half-lives of the Pu-238 fuel or about 870 years [DOE 1980].

IMPACT OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE ON THE OZONE LAYER      From time to time, claims are made that chemicals released from     the Space Shuttle's Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) are responsible     for a significant amount of damage to the ozone layer. Studies     indicate that they in reality have only a minute impact, both in     absolute terms and relative to other chemical sources. The     remainder of this item is a response from the author of the quoted     study, Charles Jackman.      The atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effects on the     stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups, and was     organized by Dr. Michael Prather, NASA/Goddard Institute for Space     Studies.  The three groups involved Michael Prather and Maria Garcia     (NASA/GISS), Charlie Jackman and Anne Douglass (NASA/Goddard Space     Flight Center), and Malcolm Ko and Dak Sze (Atmospheric and     Environmental Research, Inc.).  The effort was to look at the effects     of the space shuttle and Titan rockets on the stratosphere.      The following are the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine:         Industrial sources:    300,000,000 kilograms/year    Natural sources:     75,000,000 kilograms/year    Shuttle sources:   725,000 kilograms/year      The shuttle source assumes 9 space shuttles and 6 Titan rockets are     launched yearly. Thus the launches would add less than 0.25% to the     total stratospheric chlorine sources.      The effect on ozone is minimal:  global yearly average total ozone would     be decreased by 0.0065%. This is much less than total ozone variability     associated with volcanic activity and solar flares.      The influence of human-made chlorine products on ozone is computed     by atmospheric model calculations to be a 1% decrease in globally     averaged ozone between 1980 and 1990. The influence of the space shuttle and     Titan rockets on the stratosphere is negligible.  The launch     schedule of the Space Shuttle and Titan rockets would need to be     increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about     the same effect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons     do at the present time.      Theoretical results of this study have been published in _The Space     Shuttle's Impact on the Stratosphere_, MJ Prather, MM Garcia, AR     Douglass, CH Jackman, M.K.W. Ko and N.D.

HOW LONG CAN A HUMAN LIVE UNPROTECTED IN SPACE      If you *don't* try to hold your breath, exposure to space for half a     minute or so is unlikely to produce permanent injury. Holding your     breath is likely to damage your lungs, something scuba divers have to     watch out for when ascending, and you'll have eardrum trouble if your     Eustachian tubes are badly plugged up, but theory predicts -- and animal     experiments confirm -- that otherwise, exposure to vacuum causes no     immediate injury. You do not explode. Your blood does not boil. You do     not freeze. You do not instantly lose consciousness.      Various minor problems (sunburn, possibly \\\"the bends\\\", certainly some     [mild, reversible, painless] swelling of skin and underlying tissue)     start after ten seconds or so. At some point you lose consciousness from     lack of oxygen. Injuries accumulate. After perhaps one or two minutes,     you're dying. The limits are not really known.

HOW THE CHALLENGER ASTRONAUTS DIED      The Challenger shuttle launch was not destroyed in an explosion. This is     a well-documented fact; see the Rogers Commission report, for example.     What looked like an explosion was fuel burning after the external tank     came apart. The forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the     astronauts, never mind destroy their bodies, according to the Kerwin     team's medical/forensic report.      The astronauts were killed when the more-or-less intact cabin hit the     water at circa 200MPH, and their bodies then spent several weeks     underwater. Their remains were recovered, and after the Kerwin team     examined them, they were sent off to be buried.       USING THE SHUTTLE BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT      You can't use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low Earth orbit     because it can't get there. It is big and heavy and does not carry     enough fuel, even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tanks.      Furthermore, it is not particularly sensible to do so, because much of     that weight is things like wings, which are totally useless except in     the immediate vicinity of the Earth. The shuttle orbiter is highly     specialized for travel between Earth's surface and low orbit. Taking it     higher is enormously costly and wasteful. A much better approach would     be to use shuttle subsystems to build a specialized high-orbit     spacecraft.      [Yet another concise answer by Henry Spencer.]       THE \\\"FACE ON MARS\\\"      There really is a big rock on Mars that looks remarkably like a humanoid     face. It appears in two different frames of Viking Orbiter imagery:     35A72 (much more facelike in appearance, and the one more often     published, with the Sun 10 degrees above western horizon) and 70A13     (with the Sun 27 degrees from the west).      Science writer Richard Hoagland has championed the idea that the Face is     artificial, intended to resemble a human, and erected by an     extraterrestrial civilization. Most other analysts concede that the     resemblance is most likely accidental. Other Viking images show a     smiley-faced crater and a lava flow resembling Kermit the Frog elsewhere     on Mars. There exists a Mars Anomalies Research Society (sorry, don't     know the address) to study the Face.      The Mars Observer mission will carry an extremely high-resolution     camera, and better images of the formation will hopefully settle this     question in a few years. In the meantime, speculation about the Face is     best carried on in the altnet group alt.alien.visitors, not sci.space or     sci.astro.      V. DiPeitro and G.

The  federal protection of individual rights supersedes the non-feasance of the state. Something similar has long been traditional ( well he's queer so I beat him up...) for gays   As Anatole France said; \\\"The law in its impartial majesty forbids the rich as well as the poor from sleeping under bridges.\\\"  Equality of law can be construed in any number of ways. For example the fact that all property thefts, regardless of value, are not punished equally is an inequality which protects those who have a lot of money from having it stolen. You could easily define equality to regard the property in terms of it's significance for the owner. This would a form of equality that would be skewed toward poorer people.  In fact, most anti-gay bashing laws are constructed to offer equal  protection. They make it an offense to damage people based on a  motivation of hatred for sexual orientation. Thus the law in its impartial majesty protects hets as well as gays from being bashed.

McConkie's views have been controversial (e.g. \\\"The Seven Deadly Heresies\\\" has made me a heretic!  ;-) at best, or erroneous at worst (\\\"blacks not to receive the priesthood in this dispensation\\\").  I respect him as someone who has made his valuable contribution to the church, but I personally do NOT rely on his personal interpretations (his book \\\"Mormon Doctrine\\\" is oftentimes referred to as \\\"McConkie's Bible\\\" in mormon circles) on mormon doctrine.  I rather look to official (doctrinal) sources, and... to Hugh Nibley's books! (The last comment is an lds-insider reference.)  Summarizing: McConkie was a wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more to the kingdom of God than I have, but whose views are by no means dogma or accepted doctrine, some of it clearly belongs to personal interpretation and speculation.  But having said this, I find McConkie (even in his most biased and speculative moments) far more thought-provoking than the trash coming from your proverbial pen.

The hard part is getting the radioactives to put in it.  Have you ever read Tom Clancy's _The Sum of All Fears_?

For some non fiction, read Tom Clancy's article _Five Minutes Till Midnight_.  It shows how a terrorist group could construct a nuke using Neptunium, a low grade radioactive waste product dumped in toxic waste sites and forgotten about.

Otherwise, they are following a law put into effect by the Church, and only the above Chruches really recognize any power of the Chruch to do so.  Andy Byler  [You will note that nothing in the FAQ said anything about the Church establishing or changing a law.  The argument against the Sabbath is that it is part of the ceremonial law, and like the rest of the ceremonial law is not binding on Christians.  This argument is based on Paul's letters, Acts, and in a more general sense, Jesus' teachings.  Further, most people argue that Scripture shows worship occuring on Sunday, and Paul endorsing it.  I understand that these points are disputed, and do not want to go around the dispute one more time.  The point I'm making here is not that these arguments are right, but that the backing they claim is Scripture.  Accepting the principle of \\\"sola scriptura\\\" does not commit us to obeying the entire Jewish Law.  Acts 15 and Paul's letters are quite clear on that.  I think even the SDA's accept it.  The disagreement is on where the Bible would have us place the line.  By the way, Protestants do give authority to the church, in matters that are not dictated by God.  That's why churches are free to determine their own liturgies, church polity, etc.  If you accept that the Sabbath is not binding on Christians, then the day of worship falls into the category of items on which individual Christians or (since worship is by its nature a group activity) churches are free to decide.\",\"you Need gs252ini.zip and 24*.zip, and 25*.zip font files.

WordPerfect encryption has been shown to be very easy to break.   The method uses XOR with two repeating key streams: a typed password   and a byte-wide counter initialized to 1+<the password length>. Full   descriptions are given in Bennett [BEN87] and Bergen and Caelli   [BER91].    decrypt WordPerfect document files and I think I have a solution.    There is a software company named: Accessdata (87 East 600 South,   Orem, UT 84058), 1-800-658-5199 that has a software package that will   decrypt any WordPerfect, Lotus 1-2-3, Quatro-Pro, MS Excel and Paradox   files. The cost of the package is $185. Steep prices, but if you   think your pw key is less than 10 characters, (or 10 char) give them a   call and ask for the free demo disk. The demo disk will decrypt files   that have a 10 char or less pw key.''  * How do I break a Vigenere (repeated-key) cipher?    A repeated-key cipher, where the ciphertext is something like the   plaintext xor KEYKEYKEYKEY (and so on), is called a Vigenere cipher.   If the key is not too long and the plaintext is in English, do the   following:     1. Discover the length of the key by counting coincidences.   (See Gaines [GAI44], Sinkov [SIN66].) Trying each displacement of   the ciphertext against itself, count those bytes which are equal.    If the two ciphertext portions have used the same key, something   over 6% of the bytes will be equal. If they have used different   key, then less than 0.4% will be equal (assuming random 8-bit bytes   of key covering normal ASCII text). The smallest displacement which   indicates an equal key is the length of the repeated key.    2. Shift the text by that length and XOR it with itself. This   removes the key and leaves you with text XORed with itself. Since   English has about 1 bit of real information per byte, 2 streams of   text XORed together has 2 bits of info per 8-bit byte, providing   plenty of redundancy for choosing a unique decryption. (And in fact   one stream of text XORed with itself has just 1 bit per byte.)    If the key is short, it might be even easier to treat this as a   standard polyalphabetic substitution. All the old cryptanalysis   texts show how to break those. It's possible with those methods, in   the hands of an expert, if there's only ten times as much text as key.   See, for example, Gaines [GAI44], Sinkov [SIN66].  * How do I send encrypted mail under UNIX? [PGP, RIPEM, PEM, ...]    Here's one popular method, using the des command:      cat file | compress | des private_key | uuencode | mail    Meanwhile, there is a de jure Internet standard in the works called   PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail). It is described in RFCs 1421 through   1424. To join the PEM mailing list, contact pem-dev-request@tis.com.   There is a beta version of PEM being tested at the time of this   writing.    There are also two programs available in the public domain for encrypting   mail: PGP and RIPEM.  Both are available by FTP.  Each has its own   newsgroup: alt.security.pgp and alt.security.ripem.  Each has its own FAQ   as well.    PGP is most commonly used outside the USA since it uses the RSA algorithm   without a license and RSA's patent is valid only (or at least primarily)   in the USA.    RIPEM is most commonly used inside the USA since it uses the RSAREF which   is freely available within the USA but not available for shipment outside   the USA.    Since both programs use a secret key algorithm for encrypting the body of   the message (PGP used IDEA; RIPEM uses DES) and RSA for encrypting the   message key, they should be able to interoperate freely.  Although there   have been repeated calls for each to understand the other's formats and   algorithm choices, no interoperation is available at this time (as far as   we know).  * Is the UNIX crypt command secure?    No. See [REE84]. There is a program available called cbw (crypt   breaker's workbench) which can be used to do ciphertext-only attacks   on files encrypted with crypt. One source for CBW is [FTPCB].  * How do I use compression with encryption?    A number of people have proposed doing perfect compression followed by   some simple encryption method (e.g., XOR with a repeated key).    Unfortunately, you can only compress perfectly if you know the exact   distribution of possible inputs. For all practical purposes it's   impossible to describe ``the typical English text'' beyond coarse   characteristics such as single-letter frequencies. You can build up   more and more sophisticated models of your inputs, but if the enemy   has a slightly more accurate model, he'll be able to find some   redundancy in your compressed output.    Note that nearly all practical compression schemes, unless they   have been designed with cryptography in mind, produce output that   actually starts off with high redundancy. For example, the output of   UNIX compress begins with a well-known three-byte ``magic number''   that can serve as an entering wedge for cryptanalysis.      This is not to say that compression before encryption is inherently a   bad idea; it just has to be done very, very carefully, and by no means   removes the need for strong encryption.    Compression after encryption is silly.  * Is there an unbreakable cipher?    Yes. The one-time pad is unbreakable; see part 4. Unfortunately the   one-time pad requires secure distribution of as much key material as   plaintext.    Of course, a cryptosystem need not be utterly unbreakable to be   useful. Rather, it needs to be strong enough to resist attacks by   likely enemies for whatever length of time the data it protects is   expected to remain valid.  * What does ``random'' mean in cryptography?    Cryptographic applications demand much more out of a pseudorandom   number generator than most applications. For a source of bits to be   cryptographically random, it must be computationally impossible to   predict what the Nth random bit will be given complete knowledge of   the algorithm or hardware generating the stream and the sequence of   0th through N-1st bits, for all N up to the lifetime of the source.    A software generator (also known as pseudo-random) has the function   of expanding a truly random seed to a longer string of apparently   random bits.  This seed must be large enough not to be guessed by   the opponent.  Ideally, it should also be truly random (perhaps   generated by a hardware random number source).    Those who have Sparcstation 1 workstations could, for example,   generate random numbers using the audio input device as a source of   entropy, by not connecting anything to it.  For example,   cat /dev/audio | compress - >foo    gives a file of high entropy (not random but with much randomness in   it).  One can then encrypt that file using part of itself as a key,   for example, to convert that seed entropy into a pseudo-random   string.    When looking for hardware devices to provide this entropy, it is   important really to measure the entropy rather than just assume that   because it looks complicated to a human, it must be \\\"random\\\".  For   example, disk operation completion times sound like they might be   unpredictable (to many people) but a spinning disk is much like a   clock and its output completion times are relatively low in entropy.  * What is the unicity point (a.k.a. unicity distance)?    See [SHA49]. The unicity distance is an approximation to that amount   of ciphertext such that the sum of the real information (entropy) in   the corresponding source text and encryption key equals the number   of ciphertext bits used. Ciphertexts significantly longer than this   can be shown probably to have a unique decipherment. This is used to   back up a claim of the validity of a ciphertext-only cryptanalysis.    Ciphertexts significantly shorter than this are likely to have   multiple, equally valid decryptions and therefore to gain security   from the opponent's difficulty choosing the correct one.    Unicity distance, like all statistical or information-theoretic   measures, does not make deterministic predictions but rather gives   probabilistic results: namely, the minimum amount of ciphertext   for which it is likely that there is only a single intelligible   plaintext corresponding to the ciphertext, when all possible keys   are tried for the decryption. Working cryptologists don't normally   deal with unicity distance as such. Instead they directly determine   the likelihood of events of interest.    Let the unicity distance of a cipher be D characters. If fewer than   D ciphertext characters have been intercepted, then there is not   enough information to distinguish the real key from a set of   possible keys. DES has a unicity distance of 17.5 characters,   which is less than 3 ciphertext blocks (each block corresponds to   8 ASCII characters). This may seem alarmingly low at first, but   the unicity distance gives no indication of the computational work   required to find the key after approximately D characters have been   intercepted.    In fact, actual cryptanalysis seldom proceeds along the lines used   in discussing unicity distance. (Like other measures such as key   size, unicity distance is something that guarantees insecurity if   it's too small, but doesn't guarantee security if it's high.) Few   practical cryptosystems are absolutely impervious to analysis; all   manner of characteristics might serve as entering ``wedges'' to crack   some cipher messages. However, similar information-theoretic   considerations are occasionally useful, for example, to determine a   recommended key change interval for a particular cryptosystem.   Cryptanalysts also employ a variety of statistical and   information-theoretic tests to help guide the analysis in the most   promising directions.    Unfortunately, most literature on the application of information   statistics to cryptanalysis remains classified, even the seminal   1940 work of Alan Turing (see [KOZ84]). For some insight into the   possibilities, see [KUL68] and [GOO83].  * What is key management and why is it important?    One of the fundamental axioms of cryptography is that the enemy is in   full possession of the details of the general cryptographic system,   and lacks only the specific key data employed in the encryption. (Of   course, one would assume that the CIA does not make a habit of telling   Mossad about its cryptosystems, but Mossad probably finds out anyway.)   Repeated use of a finite amount of key provides redundancy that can   eventually facilitate cryptanalytic progress. Thus, especially in   modern communication systems where vast amounts of information are   transferred, both parties must have not only a sound cryptosystem but   also enough key material to cover the traffic.    Key management refers to the distribution, authentication, and   handling of keys.    A publicly accessible example of modern key management technology   is the STU III secure telephone unit, which for classified use   employs individual coded ``Crypto Ignition Keys'' and a central Key   Management Center operated by NSA. There is a hierarchy in that   certain CIKs are used by authorized cryptographic control   personnel to validate the issuance of individual traffic keys and   to perform installation/maintenance functions, such as the   reporting of lost CIKs.    This should give an inkling of the extent of the key management   problem. For public-key systems, there are several related issues,   many having to do with ``whom do you trust?''  * Can I use pseudo-random or chaotic numbers as a key stream?    Chaotic equations and fractals produce an apparent randomness from   relatively compact generators. Perhaps the simplest example is a   linear congruential sequence, one of the most popular types of random   number generators, where there is no obvious dependence between seeds   and outputs. Unfortunately the graph of any such sequence will, in a   high enough dimension, show up as a regular lattice. Mathematically   this lattice corresponds to structure which is notoriously easy for   cryptanalysts to exploit. More complicated generators have more   complicated structure, which is why they make interesting pictures---   but a cryptographically strong sequence will have no computable   structure at all.    See [KNU81], exercise 3.5-7; [REE77]; and [BOY89].  * What is the correct frequency list for English letters?    There are three answers to this question, each slightly deeper than   the one before. You can find the first answer in various books:   namely, a frequency list computed directly from a certain sample of   English text. Of course any such list will be ``correctly'' computed,   but exactly which list you get depends on which sample was taken.    The second answer is that the question doesn't make sense. What do   you mean by ``English letters''? The ``English language'' is not a   fixed, finite, closed object that can be exactly characterized. It   has changed over time; it is different between different authors.   Any particular message will have different statistics from those of   the language as a whole.    The third answer is that yes, no particular message is going to have   exactly the same characteristics as English in general, but for all   reasonable statistical uses these slight discrepancies won't matter.   In fact there's an entire field called ``Bayesian statistics'' (other   buzzwords are ``maximum entropy methods'' and ``maximum likelihood   estimation'') which studies questions like ``What's the chance that a   text with these letter frequencies is in English?'' and comes up with   reasonably robust answers.    So make your own list from your own samples of English text. It will   be good enough for practical work, if you use it properly.  * What is the Enigma?    ``For a project in data security we are looking for sources of   information about the German Enigma code and how it was broken by   the British during WWII.''    See [WEL82], [DEA85], [KOZ84], [HOD83], [KAH91].  * How do I shuffle cards?    Card shuffling is a special case of the permutation of an array of   values, using a random or pseudo-random function.  All possible output   permutations of this process should be equally likely.  To do this, you   need a random function (modran(x)) which will produce a uniformly   distributed random integer in the interval [0..x-1].  Given that   function, you can shuffle with the following [C] code: (assuming ARRLTH   is the length of array arr[] and swap() interchanges values at the two   addresses given)    for ( n = ARRLTH-1; n > 0 ; n-- ) swap( &arr[modran( n+1 )], &arr[n] ) ;    modran(x) can not be achieved exactly with a simple (ranno() % x) since   ranno()'s interval may not be divisible by x, although in most cases the   error will be very small.  To cover this case, one can take ranno()'s   modulus mod x, call that number y, and if ranno() returns a value less   than y, go back and get another ranno() value.   * Can I foil S/W pirates by encrypting my CD-ROM?    Someone will frequently express the desire to publish a CD-ROM with   possibly multiple pieces of software, perhaps with each encrypted   separately, and will want to use different keys for each user (perhaps   even good for only a limited period of time) in order to avoid piracy.    As far as we know, this is impossible, since there is nothing in standard   PC or workstation hardware which uniquely identifies the user at the   keyboard.  If there were such an identification, then the CD-ROM could be   encrypted with a key based in part on the one sold to the user and in   part on the unique identifier.  However, in this case the CD-ROM is one   of a kind and that defeats the intended purpose.    If the CD-ROM is to be encrypted once and then mass produced, there must   be a key (or set of keys) for that encryption produced at some stage in   the process.  That key is useable with any copy of the CD-ROM's data.   The pirate needs only to isolate that key and sell it along with the   illegal copy.   * Can you do automatic cryptanalysis of simple ciphers?

Anyone else catch ESPN's piece about prospects and the relationship between age, career length, MVPs and Hall of Fame members? It was part of their preseason special. Basically, they looked  at players that had amassed 1000 plate appearances (or ABs) by the time they were 24, and noticed some interesting things.     For starters, they found out such players comprised the majority of MVPs in the history of the game. They also found out such players represented the majority of the players in the hall of fame. The kicker, though, was that they actually did some number-crunching and found that such players' careers lasted much longer than the careers of players not in that group. They also   found that these players produced at both a greater level of performance and produced over twice the raw totals (HRs, etc) of the other players. The first group outhit the second something like .282 to .260 in raw BA, and blew away the second group in such categories as HRs, 2Bs, RBIs, etc.     It was the most impressive thing I've seen on ESPN in recent memory.

Jeff\",\"Stuff deleted...\",\" Yes, absolutely, though I'd make the observation in a more general sense of all observations are made by human beings and therefore made with various biases.   But here your message leaves talk of hypothesis and gets back, once again,  to equating the business of science with the end result, the gizmo produced.   My point isn't so much whether or not you have a novel paradigm but *how*  you come about developing it.   Perhaps you'd admit that this is an oversimplification on your part (the topic of the philosophy of science is made for them, I'm making them too) but I think that it also summarizes popular misconceptions of science and the  business of doing science.  Biomedical research doesn't make any basic  assumptions that aren't the same as any other discipline of scientific research.  That is, that you make empirical observations, form an hypothesis and test it.  Modern medicine has much more to do with biochemistry than  \\\"the old Newtonian model of the world\\\".  And I doubt that many psychologists would appreciate being put outside this empirical \\\"world view\\\".  Psychology also has more to do with biochemistry than spoon bending.    Oversimplified, of course, but a good example.  This is an empirical observa- tion.  It was then tested, though perhaps not by Aristotle, and eventually  found wanting.  In the meantime, some folk will  have continued to believe in the spontaneous generation of animal life.   There's nothing at all surprising about this, it's the way the gathering of knowledge works.  There are probably more than a few things in my own  discipline of molecular biology that will be found to be totally off-base, even idiotic, to someone in the future.  These future people won't have come to these relevations because they had suddenly gone all Zen-like and had  a vision in an LSD trip.  Someone will have thought of something new and  tested it.  This is the bit that people who seem to relish misrepresenting science and research can't seem to wrap their minds around.  Science is a  creative process.  What I think of as factual and good research can be totally turned on its head tommorrow by new results and theories.  \",\"  I don't know, but I'm as willing to speculate as anyone.  Several people have suggested that the chips use public-key cryptography. Another possibility is to use Diffie-Hellman key exchange, or some other algorithm which has a similar effect.  DH allows both ends to agree on a session key which they use with symmetric cryptography (something like DES) for the encryption.  How could the \\\"back door\\\" keys work in this system?  I can see a few possibilities.  One is that the DH-like algorithm has the property that the session key can be deduced by an eavesdropper who knows the back door keys for one (or possibly both) communicants.  Perhaps the random numbers used in the DH are seeded by the back door key, or some such.  Another possibility, as was suggested here earlier, is that the chips simply broadcast the session key, encrypted with the chip's own internal secret key.  In this system the back door keys are secret keys usable for decrypting this session key broadcast.  Actually the chip's secret key doesn't need to be a public key in this usage, but can be identical to the secret back-door key.  (This proposal seems most straightforward to me.)  Still another possibility is that the encryption algorithm used for the message itself has a \\\"dual key\\\" property, that possession of either of two keys can be used to decrypt it.  One key would be the session key from the DH exchange, and the other would be the back door key for the chip.  It's worth noting that one of the proposals Dorothy Denning raised during her amazingly prescient on-line discussion last November and December was a variation on Diffie-Hellman in which a third party would participate in deriving the session keys.  This doesn't quite fit into what we know of how Clipper works but it hints that those who had early knowledge of Clipper (or whose thinking was somehow synchronized with Clipper designers) may have had Diffie-Hellman on their minds.\",\"  I believe we still remember Masada, where Jews killed themselves rather than being captured by the Romans.

I'm pretty much oblivious to any current firmware problems, so you'll have to get it from someone else.  However, I can tell you to stay clear of any board which uses the Rockwell MPU (as opposed to the DPU) for an internal implementation. This is because the MPU used \\\"speed buffering\\\" instead of having a 16550 interface.  Without the 550 interface, the number of interrupts are still the same and thus may get dropped under multitasking conditions (like in windows).  As far as I know, the \\\"speed buffering\\\" works OK for external modems if a 550 is used on the internal serial port board.  Hope this helps... Tom \",\"AAAHHHH!!!!!

As for 'Cyprus', In 1974, Turkiye  stepped into Cyprus to preserve the lives of the Turkish population  there. This is nothing but a simple historical fact. Unfortunately,  the intervention was too late at least for some of the victims. Mass  graves containing numerous bodies of women and children already showed  what fate had been planned for a peaceful minority.  The problems in Cyprus have their origin in decades of  oppression of the Turkish population by the Greek Cypriot  officials and their violation of the co-founder status of  the Turks set out in the constitution. The coup d'etat  engineered by Greece in 1974 to execute a final solution  to the Turkish problem was the savage blow that invoked  Turkiye's intervention. Turkiye intervened reluctantly and  only as a last resort after exhausting all other avenues  consulting with Britain and Greece as the other two signatories  to the treaty to protect the integrity of Cyprus. There simply  was not any expansionist motivation in the Turkish action at  all. This is in dramatic contrast to the Greek motivation which  was openly expansionist, stated as 'Enosis,' union with Greece.  Since the creation of independent Cyprus in 1960, the Turkish  population, although smaller, legally had status as the co-founder of the republic with the Greek population.  The Greek Cypriots, with the support of 'Enosis'-minded Greeks in the mainland, have consistently ignored that status and portrayed the Island as a Greek island with a minority population of Turks. The Turks of Cyprus are not a minority in a Greek Republic and they found the only way they could show that was to assert their  autonomy in a separate republic.  Turkiye is not satisfied with the status quo. She would rather not be involved with the island. But, given the dismal record of brutal Greek oppression of the Turkish population in Cyprus, she simply cannot leave the fate of the island's Turks in the hands of the Greeks until the Turkish side is satisfied with whatever accord the two communities finally reach to guarantee that history will not repeat itself to rob Turkish Cypriots of their rights, liberties and their very lives.

The sort of criticism leveled at an organisation such as this along the lines of \\\"ideological manipulation and cultural interference\\\" is probably no more than Christianising and education - in this WBT will stand alongside the early Christian missionaries to parts of Africa, or those groups who worked among native Americans a couple hundred years ago.

What is probably the most convincing is the anti-Christian literature put out by the Jewish councils in the second century.  There are enormous quantities of detailed arguments against Christianity, many of the arguments still being used today.  Despite volumes of tracts attacking Christianity, not one denies the existance of Jesus, only of his activities.    I find this considerably more compelling than Josephus or the harmony of the gospels (especially considering that Matthew and Luke probably used Mark as a source).\",\"$400included shipping  \",\"I have a line on a Ducati 900GTS 1978 model with 17k on the clock.

FACT:  It is unlawful to distribute code implementing RSA without a license to do so from PKP, whether or not one is charging for it.  Furthermore, any use of RSA, other than for research purposes allowed under US patent law, is similarly unlawful.  Therefore, the \\\"average citizen\\\" cannot use RSA to encrypt message traffic in the US without a license from PKP.  There is no licensed, freely available product in the US that uses RSA encryption other than RSAREF (and hence RIPEM), at least as far as I am aware.  If you know of another, please post it here.   FACT:  The last contact I had with RSA Data Security, Inc was with some guy trying to sell me a license (unsolicited, I might add) for TIPEM. Cost: $15K plus 2-5 percent royalties.

FACT:  There are no restrictions (yet!) on the use of cryptography under US law, although this is beginning to look like it will change.

Further striking bigoted and racist attitude of  certain Greeks still exists in our day. Most Greeks insist even  today, that the 537 year-old capital of the Ottoman Empire should  be called not by its rightful name of Istanbul, but by its half  a millennium-old moniker 'Cons*(whatever).'  Everyone knows that New York City was once called 'New Amsterdam' but Dutch people do not persist on calling it that today. The name  of Stalingrad too is long gone, replaced by Volgagrad. China's Peking traded its name for Beiging long ago. Ciudad Trujillo of the Dominican Republic is now Santa Domingo. Zimbabve's old colonial capital Salisburry became Harrare. These changes have all been accepted officially by everyone in the world.  But, Greeks are still determined on calling the Turkish Istanbul  by the name of 'Cons*.'  How can one explain this total intransigence? What makes Greeks so different from other mortals? 18-year-old questionable democracy? Why don't they seem to reconcile with the fact, for instance, that Istanbul changed hands 537 years ago in 1453 AD, and that this predates the discovery of the New  World, by 39 years. The declaration of U.S. independence in 1776 will come 284 years later.  Shouldn't then, half a millennium be considered enough time for  'Cons*' to be called a Turkish city? Where is the logic in the  Greek reasoning, if there is any? How long can one sit on the  laurels of an ancient civilization? Ancient Greece does not exist,  any more than any other 16 civilizations that existed on the soil  of Anatolia.  These undereducated 'wieneramus' live with an illusion. It  is the same mentality which allows them to rationalize that Cyprus is a Greek Island. No history book shows that it ever was. It belonged to the Ottoman Turks 'lock, stock and barrel' for a period of well over 300 years.  In fact, prior to the Turks' acquisition of it, following bloody naval battles with the Venetians in 1570 AD, the island of Cyprus belonged, invariably, to several nations:  The Assyrians, the Sumerians, the Phoenicians, the Egyptians, the Ottoman Turks, of course in that order, owned it as  their territory. But, it has never been the possession of the government of Greece - not even for one day - in the history of the world. Moreover, Cyprus is located 1500 miles from the Greek mainland, but only  40 miles from Turkiye's southern coastline.  Saddam Hussein claims that Kuwait was once Iraqi territory and the Greek Cypriot government and  the terrorist Greek governments think that Cyprus also was once part of the Greek hegemony.  Those 'Arromdians' involved in this grandiose hallucination should wake up from their sweet daydreams and confront  reality. Again, wishful thinking is unproductive, only  facts count.  As for Selanik,    <<Those Jews who survived these assaults in Southeastern Europe fled   particularly to Salonica, whose Jewish population increased substantially   as a result, from 28,000 in 1876 to 90,000 in 1908, more than half the   total population, though even there increased persecution by local Greeks   led many Jews to flee elsewhere in the Ottoman Empire, particularly to   the great port of Izmir.    Despite all the pressure from Ottomans and foreign Jews alike, the ritual   murders and other assaults by Christians on Jews went on and on. Greek   efforts to decimate the Jewish population of Salonica culminated in 1912   and 1913, following Greek conquest of Salonica during the first Balkan War,   when many of its Jews, were either killed or terrorized into leaving...>>    <<Though Greece was obligated by the post World War I treaties to allow   Jews and other minorities to use their own languages in education and to   practice their religions without hindrance, a law was issued in 1923   which forbad all inhabitants from working on Sunday, stimulating a new   Jewish exodus as it was intended to do. Between 1932 and 1934 there was a   series of anti-Semitic riots in Salonica, with the Cambel quarter, where   most of the remaining Jews lived, being burned to the ground. This   was followed by regulations requiring the use of Greek and prohibiting   Hebrew and Judea-Spanish in the Jewish schools. A start was made also   on expropriating the land of the principal Jewish cemetery in Salonica   for use by the new University in order to derive the Jews out [47]. By   killing and driving out large numbers of Jews, the Greeks left a   substantial Greek majority in the city for the first time, and starting   Salonica Jewry on the way to its final decimation by the Nazis during the   occupation of Greece starting in 1941.    Salonica and Izmir of course were not the only places of refuge for   Jewish refugees entering the Empire during its last century of existence.   Istanbul, Edirne, and other parts of Rumelia and Anatolia received   thousands more. Nor were Jews the only refugees received and helped by   the government of the Sultan. Thousands of Muslims accompanied them in   flight from similar persecutions wherever Balkan christian states gained   independence or expanded. The Russian conquest of the Crimea and the   Caucasus starting in the late eighteenth century, and particularly during   and after the Crimean War, combined with the same independence movements   in Southeastern Europe that had caused so much suffering and flight among   its Jews caused thousands of helpless, ill, and poverty-stricken Muslim   refugees to accompany them into the ever shrinking boundaries of the   Ottoman Empire, with the Istanbul government struggling mightly but vainly   to house and feed them as best it could. From 1850 to 1864 as many as   800,000 Crimean Tatars, Circassians, and other Muslims from north and   east of the Black Sea had entered Anatolia alone, as many as 200,000 more   came during the next twenty years, while 474,389 refugees entered in 1876-   1877 as a result of the Ottoman wars with Russia and the Balkan states,   with an equal number gaining refuge in the European portions of the   Empire.>>  [47] Robert Mantran, 'La structure sociale de la communaute juive de   Salonqiue a la fin du dix-neuvieme siecle', RH no.534 (1980), 391-92;   Nehama VII, 762; Joseph Nehama (Salonica) to AIU (Paris) no.2868/2,   12 May 1903 (AIU Archives I-C-43); and no.2775, 10 January 1900 (AIU   Archives I-C-41), describing daily battles between Jewish and Greek   children in the streets of Salonica.

Points covered here are ones which are not covered in the \\\"Introduction to Atheism\\\"; you are advised to read that article as well before posting.  These answers are not intended to be exhaustive or definitive. The purpose of the periodic FAQ postings is not to stifle debate, but to raise its level. If you have something to say concerning one of these questions and which isn't covered by the answer given, please feel free to make your point.

Typical posting:  Why have a newsgroup about atheism?  Why do atheists organize in groups?   What is there to discuss?  Response:  Many things are discussed here, including:  * Whether it is reasonable to feign theism in order to avoid upsetting one's   family * Prayer in schools * Discrimination against atheists * Sunday trading laws * The Satanic Child Abuse myth * Whether one should be an overt atheist or 'stay in the closet' * How religious societies prey (sic) on new college students * How to get rid of unwanted proselytizers * Whether religion is a danger to society and/or the individual * Why people become atheists  Of course, inevitably alt.atheism tends to attract evangelical Christians looking for someone to convert.  Most readers of the newsgroup don't  want to be preached to, although a few seem to derive perverse pleasure  from tearing apart particularly ill-considered or uninformed postings.  ------------------------------  Subject: Hitler was an atheist!  Typical posting:  Hitler was an atheist, and look at what he did!  Response:  Adolf Hitler was emphatically not an atheist.  As he said himself:     The folkish-minded man, in particular, has the sacred duty, each in    his own denomination, of making _people_stop_just_talking_    superficially_of_God's_will,_and_actually_fulfill_God's_will,_and_    not_let_God's_word_be_desecrated._[orig. ital.]     For God's will gave men their form, their essence, and their    abilities.  Anyone who destroys His work is declaring war on the    Lord's creation, the divine will.  Therefore, let every man be    active, each in his own denomination if you please, and let every    man take it as his first and most sacred duty to oppose anyone who    in his activity by word or deed steps outside the confines of his    religious community and tries to butt into the other.     [...]     Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will    of the Almighty Creator: _by_defending_myself_against_the_Jew,_I_am_    fighting_for_the_work_of_the_Lord._[orig. ital.]            -- Adolf Hitler, from \\\"Mein Kampf\\\", trans. Ralph Mannheim.  Of course, someone bad believing something does not make that belief wrong.  It's also entirely possible that Hitler was lying when he claimed  to believe in God.  We certainly can't conclude that he's an atheist,  though.  ------------------------------  Subject: The Bible proves it  Typical posting:  In the Bible it says that...  Response:  Most of the readers of alt.atheism feel that the Bible is of questionable accuracy, as it was written thousands of years ago by many authors who were recording oral tradition that existed many years before.  Thus, any claimed 'truth' in it is of questionable legitimacy.  This isn't to say that The Bible has no truth in it; simply that any truth must be examined before being accepted.  Many of the readers of this group also feel that because any passage is subject to \\\"interpretation\\\", any claim that a passage 'means' one thing and one thing only is not legitimate.  Note that this feeling tends to extend to other books.  It is also remarkable to many atheists that theists tend to ignore other equally plausible religious books in favour of those of their own religion.  ------------------------------  Subject: Pascal's Wager  Typical posting:  If you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing -- but if you don't believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you will go to hell. Therefore it is foolish to be an atheist.  Response:  This argument is known as Pascal's Wager.  It has several flaws.  Firstly, it does not indicate which religion to follow.  Indeed, there are many mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out there.  This is often described as the \\\"avoiding the wrong hell\\\" problem.  If a person is a follower of religion X, he may end up in religion Y's version of hell.  Secondly, the statement that \\\"If you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing\\\" is not true.  Suppose you're believing in the wrong God -- the true God might punish you for your foolishness. Consider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine in favour of prayer.  Another flaw in the argument is that it is based on the assumption that  the two possibilities are equally likely -- or at least, that they are of  comparable likelihood.  If, in fact, the possibility of there being a God  is close to zero, the argument becomes much less persuasive.  So sadly the argument is only likely to convince those who believe already.  Also, many feel that for intellectually honest people, belief is based on  evidence, with some amount of intuition.  It is not a matter of will or  cost-benefit analysis.  Formally speaking, the argument consists of four statements:    1. One does not know whether God exists.   2. Not believing in God is bad for one's eternal soul if God does      exist.   3. Believing in God is of no consequence if God does not exist.   4. Therefore it is in one's interest to believe in God.  There are two approaches to the argument.  The first is to view 1 as an assumption, and 2 as a consequence of it.  One problem with this approach, in the abstract, is that it creates information from no information.  This is considered invalid in information theory.  Statement 1 indicates one has no information about God -- but statement 2 indicates that beneficial information can be gained from the absolute lack of information about God.  This violates information entropy -- information has been extracted from no information, at no \\\"cost\\\".  The alternative approach is to claim that 1 and 2 are both assumptions.  The problem with this is that 2 is then basically an assumption which states the Christian position, and only a Christian will agree with that assumption. The argument thus collapses to \\\"If you are a Christian, it is in your interests to believe in God\\\" -- a rather vacuous tautology, and not the way Pascal intended the argument to be viewed.  The biggest reason why Pascal's wager is a failure is that if God is omniscient he will certainly know who really believes and who believes as a wager.  He will spurn the latter... assuming he actually cares at all whether people believe in him.  ------------------------------  Subject: What is Occam's Razor?  Typical posting:  People keep talking about Occam's Razor.  What is it?  Response:  William of Occam formulated a principle which has become known as Occam's  Razor.  In its original form, it said \\\"Do not multiply entities  unnecessarily.\\\"  That is, if you can explain something without supposing the existence of some entity, then do so.  Nowadays when people refer to Occam's Razor, they generally express it  more generally, for example as \\\"Take the simplest solution\\\".  The relevance to atheism is that we can look at two possible explanations  for what we see around us:  1. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, which came into being as a result of natural processes.  2. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, and  there is also a God who created the universe.  Clearly this God must be  of non-zero complexity.  Given that both explanations fit the facts, Occam's Razor might suggest  that we should take the simpler of the two -- solution number one. Unfortunately, some argue that there is a third even more simple solution:  3. There isn't an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there.   We just imagine that there is.  This third option leads us logically towards solipsism, which many people  find unacceptable.   ------------------------------  Subject: Why it's good to believe in Jesus  Typical posting:  I want to tell people about the virtues and benefits of my religion.  Response:  Preaching is not appreciated.  Feel free to talk about your religion, but please do not write postings that are on a \\\"conversion\\\" theme.  Such postings do not belong on alt.atheism and will be rejected from alt.atheism.moderated (try the newsgroup talk.religion.misc).  You would doubtless not welcome postings from atheists to your favourite newsgroup in an attempt to convert you; please do unto others as you would have them do unto you!  Often theists make their basic claims about God in the form of lengthy analogies or parables.  Be aware that atheists have heard of God and know the basic claims about him; if the sole purpose of your parable is to tell atheists that God exists and brings salvation, you may as well not post it, since it tells us nothing we have not been told before.  ------------------------------  Subject: Why I know that God exists  Typical posting:  I *know* from personal experience and prayer that God exists.  Response:  Just as many theists have personal evidence that the being they worship exists, so many atheists have personal evidence that such beings do not exist.  That evidence varies from person to person.  Furthermore, without wishing to dismiss your evidence out of hand, many people have claimed all kinds of unlikely things -- that they have been abducted by UFOs, visited by the ghost of Elvis, and so on.  ------------------------------  Subject: Einstein and \\\"God does not play dice\\\"  Typical posting:  Albert Einstein believed in God.  Do you think you're cleverer than him?  Response:  Einstein did once comment that \\\"God does not play dice [with the universe]\\\".  This quotation is commonly mentioned to show that Einstein believed in the Christian God.  Used this way, it is out of context; it refers to Einstein's refusal to accept the uncertainties indicated by quantum theory. Furthermore, Einstein's religious background was Jewish rather than Christian.  A better quotation showing what Einstein thought about God is the following: \\\"I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists, not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings.\\\"  Einstein was unable to accept Quantum Theory because of his belief in an objective, orderly reality; a reality which would not be subject to random events and which would not be dependent upon the observer.  He believed that QM was incomplete, and that a better theory would have no need for statistical interpretations.  So far no such better theory has been found, and much evidence suggests that it never will be.  A longer quote from Einstein appears in \\\"Science, Philosophy, and Religion, A Symposium\\\", published by the Conference on Science, Philosophy and Religion in Their Relation to the Democratic Way of Life, Inc., New York, 1941.  In    \\\"The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events    the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side    of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature.  For him    neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an    independent cause of natural events.  To be sure, the doctrine of a    personal God interfering with natural events could never be    *refuted* [italics his], in the real sense, by science, for this    doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific    knowledge has not yet been able to set foot.     But I am convinced that such behavior on the part of representatives    of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal.  For a doctrine    which is to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark,    will of necessity lose its effect on mankind, with incalculable harm    to human progress.  In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers    of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal    God, that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past    placed such vast power in the hands of priests.  In their labors they    will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable    of cultivating the Good, the True, and the Beautiful in humanity    itself.  This is, to be sure, a more difficult but an incomparably    more worthy task...\\\"     \\\"It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religous convictions,    a lie which is being systematically repeated.  I do not believe in a    personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly.    If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the    unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our    science can reveal it.\\\"  The latter quote is from \\\"Albert Einstein: The Human Side\\\", edited by Helen  Dukas and Banesh Hoffman, and published by Princeton University Press.   Also from the same book:    \\\"I do not believe in immortality of the individual, and I consider ethics    to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind     it.\\\"  Of course, the fact that Einstein chose not to believe in Christianity does  not in itself imply that Christianity is false.  ------------------------------  Subject: Everyone worships something  Typical posting:  Everyone worships something, whether it's money, power or God.  Response:  If that is true, everyone is a polytheist.  Theists care just as much about those things that atheists care about.  If the atheists' reactions to (for example) their families amount to worship then so do the theists'.  ------------------------------  Subject: Why there must be a causeless cause  Typical posting:  Sets of integers that have a lower bound each have a smallest member, so chains of causes must all have a first element, a causeless cause.  Response:  The set of real numbers greater than zero has a definite lower bound, but has no smallest member.  Further, even if it is true that there must be a causeless cause, that does not imply that that cause must be a conscious supernatural entity, and especially not that any such entity must match the description favoured by any particular religion.  ------------------------------  Subject: The universe is so complex it must have been designed  Typical posting:  The presence of design in the universe proves there is a God.  Surely you don't think all this appeared here just by chance?  Response:  This is known as the Argument From Design.  It is a matter of dispute whether there is any element of design in the universe. Those who believe that the complexity and diversity of living creatures on the earth is evidence of a creator are best advised to read the newsgroup talk.origins for a while.  There is insufficient space to summarize both sides of that debate here. However, the conclusion is that there is no scientific evidence in favour of so-called Scientific Creationism. Furthermore, there is much evidence, observation and theory that can explain many of the complexities of the universe and life on earth.  The origin of the Argument by Design is a feeling that the existence of something as incredibly intricate as, say, a human is so improbable that surely it can't have come about by chance; that surely there must be some  external intelligence directing things so that humans come from the chaos deliberately.  But if human intelligence is so improbable, surely the existence of a mind capable of fashioning an entire universe complete with conscious beings must be immeasurably more unlikely?  The approach used to argue in favour of the existence of a creator can be turned around and applied to the Creationist position.  This leads us to the familiar theme of \\\"If a creator created the universe, what created the creator?\\\", but with the addition of spiralling  improbability.  The only way out is to declare that the creator was not created and just \\\"is\\\" (or \\\"was\\\").  From here we might as well ask what is wrong with saying that the universe just \\\"is\\\" without introducing a creator?  Indeed Stephen Hawking, in his book \\\"A Brief History of Time\\\", explains his theory that the universe is closed and finite in extent, with no beginning or end.  The Argument From Design is often stated by analogy, in the so-called  Watchmaker Argument.  One is asked to imagine that one has found a watch on the beach.  Does one assume that it was created by a watchmaker, or that it evolved naturally?  Of course one assumes a watchmaker.  Yet like the  watch, the universe is intricate and complex; so, the argument goes, the  universe too must have a creator.  The Watchmaker analogy suffers from three particular flaws, over and above  those common to all Arguments By Design.  Firstly, a watchmaker creates  watches from pre-existing materials, whereas God is claimed to have  created the universe from nothing.  These two sorts of creation are  clearly fundamentally different, and the analogy is therefore rather weak.  Secondly, a watchmaker makes watches, but there are many other things in  the world.  If we walked further along the beach and found a nuclear  reactor, we wouldn't assume it was created by the watchmaker.  The argument  would therefore suggest a multitude of creators, each responsible for a  different part of creation.  Finally, in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that  the watch is not part of nature because it is ordered, and therefore  stands out from the randomness of nature.  Yet in the second part of the  argument, we start from the position that the universe is obviously not  random, but shows elements of order.  The Watchmaker argument is thus  internally inconsistent.  ------------------------------  Subject: Independent evidence that the Bible is true  Typical posting:  The events of the New Testament are confirmed by independent documentary evidence.  For example...  Response:  The writings of Josephus are often mentioned as independent documentary evidence.  Early versions of Josephus's work are thought not to have mentioned Jesus or James; the extant version discusses John in a non-Christian context.  Many scholars believe that the original mentioned Jesus and James in passing, but that this was expanded by Christian copyists.  Several \\\"reconstructions\\\" of the original text have been published to this effect.  Much information appears in the Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius (about 320 C.E.).  It is worthless as historical material because of the deliberate falsification of the wily Eusebius who is generally acknowledged as 'the first thoroughly dishonest historian of antiquity.' It is Eusebius who is generally given the title of authorship for this material.  Aside from the New Testament, the biographical information about Jesus is more well-documented.  For further information, please consult the Frequently Asked Questions file for the newsgroup soc.religion.christian.  ------------------------------  Subject: Godel's Incompleteness Theorem  Typical posting:  Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible for the Bible to be both true and complete.  Response:  Godel's First Incompleteness Theorem says that in any consistent formal  system which is sufficiently expressive that it can model ordinary  arithmetic, one can formulate expressions which can never be proven to be  valid or invalid ('true' or 'false') within that formal system.  (Technically speaking, the system must also be recursive; that is, there must be a decision procedure for determining whether a given string is an axiom within the formal  system.)  Essentially, all such systems can formulate what is known as a \\\"Liar  Paradox.\\\"  The classic Liar Paradox sentence in ordinary English is \\\"This  sentence is false.\\\"  Note that if a proposition is undecidable, the formal  system cannot even deduce that it is undecidable.  The logic used in theological discussions is rarely well defined, so claims that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible to prove or disprove) the existence of God are worthless in isolation.  One can trivially define a formal system in which it is possible to prove the existence of God, simply by having the existence of God stated as an axiom.  This is unlikely to be viewed by atheists as a convincing proof, however.  It may be possible to succeed in producing a formal system built on axioms that both atheists and theists agree with.  It may then be possible to show that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem holds for that system.  However, that would still not demonstrate that it is impossible to prove that God exists within the system.  Furthermore, it certainly wouldn't tell us anything about whether it is possible to prove the existence of God generally.  Note also that all of these hypothetical formal systems tell us nothing about the actual existence of God; the formal systems are just abstractions.  Another frequent claim is that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that a religious text (the Bible, the Book of Mormon or whatever) cannot be both consistent and universally applicable. Religious texts are not formal systems, so such claims are nonsense.  ------------------------------  Subject: George Bush on atheism and patriotism  Typical posting:  Did George Bush really say that atheists should not be considered citizens?  Response:  The following exchange took place at the Chicago airport between Robert I. Sherman of American Atheist Press and George Bush, on August 27 1988. Sherman is a fully accredited reporter, and was present by invitation as a member of the press corps.  The Republican presidential nominee was there to announce federal disaster relief for Illinois.  The discussion turned to the presidential primary:   RS: \\\"What will you do to win the votes of Americans who are atheists?\\\"   GB: \\\"I guess I'm pretty weak in the atheist community.  Faith in       God is important to me.\\\"   RS: \\\"Surely you recognize the equal citizenship and patriotism of       Americans who are atheists?\\\"   GB: \\\"No, I don't know that atheists should be considered as citizens,       nor should they be considered patriots.  This is one nation under       God.\\\"   RS: \\\"Do you support as a sound constitutional principle the separation       of state and church?\\\"   GB: \\\"Yes, I support the separation of church and state.  I'm just not       very high on atheists.\\\"  UPI reported on May 8, 1989, that various atheist organizations were still angry over the remarks.  The exchange appeared in the Boulder Daily Camera on Monday February 27, 1989.  It can also be found in \\\"Free Enquiry\\\" magazine, Fall 1988 issue, Volume 8, Number 4, page 16.  On October 29, 1988, Mr. Sherman had a confrontation with Ed Murnane, cochairman of the Bush-Quayle '88 Illinois campaign.  This concerned a lawsuit Mr. Sherman had filed to stop the Community Consolidated School District 21 (Chicago, Illinois) from forcing his first-grade Atheist son to pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States as \\\"one nation under God\\\" (Bush's phrase).  The following conversation took place:    RS: \\\"American Atheists filed the Pledge of Allegiance lawsuit yesterday.       Does the Bush campaign have an official response to this filing?\\\"    EM: \\\"It's bullshit.\\\"    RS: \\\"What is bullshit?\\\"    EM: \\\"Everything that American Atheists does, Rob, is bullshit.\\\"    RS: \\\"Thank you for telling me what the official position of the Bush       campaign is on this issue.\\\"   EM: \\\"You're welcome.\\\"  After Bush's election, American Atheists wrote to Bush asking him to retract his statement.  On February 21st 1989, C. Boyden Gray, Counsel to the President, replied on White House stationery that Bush substantively stood by    \\\"As you are aware, the President is a religious man who neither supports    atheism nor believes that atheism should be unnecessarily encouraged or    supported by the government.\\\"  For further information, contact American Atheist Veterans at the American Atheist Press's Cameron Road address.  ------------------------------  Subject: I know where hell is!  Typical posting:  I know where Hell is!  Hell is in Norway!  Response:  There are several towns called \\\"Hell\\\" in various countries around the world, including Norway and the USA.  Whilst this information is mildly amusing the first time one hears it, readers of alt.atheism are now  getting pretty fed up with hearing it every week.  ------------------------------  Subject: Biblical contradictions wanted  Typical posting:  Does anyone have a list of Biblical contradictions?  Response:   American Atheist Press publish an atheist's handbook detailing Biblical contradictions. See the accompanying posting on Atheist Resources for details.  There is a file containing some Biblical contradictions available from the archive-server@mantis.co.uk. See the contacts file for more information.  ------------------------------  Subject: The USA is a Christian nation  Typical posting:  Because of the religious beliefs of the founding fathers, shouldn't the United States be considered a Christian nation?  Response:  Based upon the writings of several important founding fathers, it is clear that they never intended the US to be a Christian nation.  Here are some quotes; there are many more.    \\\"What influence, in fact, have ecclesiastical establishments had on society?    In some instances they have been seen to erect a spiritual tyranny on the    ruins of the civil authority; on many instances they have been seen    upholding the thrones of political tyranny; in no instance have they been    the guardians of the liberties of the people.  Rulers who wish to subvert    the public liberty may have found an established clergy convenient    auxiliaries. A just government, instituted to secure and perpetuate it,    needs them not.\\\"       - James Madison, \\\"A Memorial and Remonstrance\\\", 1785    \\\"I almost shudder at the thought of alluding to the most fatal example of    the abuses of grief which the history of mankind has preserved--the Cross.    Consider what calamities that engine of grief has produced!\\\"       - John Adams, in a letter to Thomas Jefferson    \\\"History I believe furnishes no example of a priest-ridden people    maintaining a free civil government.  This marks the lowest grade of    ignorance, of which their political as well as religious leaders will    always avail themselves for their own purpose.\\\"        - Thomas Jefferson to Baron von Humboldt, 1813    \\\"I cannot conceive otherwise than that He, the Infinite Father, expects or    requires no worship or praise from us, but that He is even infinitely    above it.\\\"        - Benjamin Franklin, from \\\"Articles of Belief and Acts of Religion\\\",         Nov. 20, 1728  ------------------------------  Subject: The USA is not a Christian nation  Typical posting:  Is it true that George Washington said that the United States is not in any sense founded upon the Christian religion?  Response:  No.  The quotation often given is in fact from Article XI of the 1797 Treaty of Tripoli (8 Stat 154, Treaty Series 358):     Article 11     As the government of the United States of America is not in any sense    founded on the Christian Religion, -- as it has in itself no character of    enmity against the laws, religion or tranquility of Musselmen, -- and as    the said States never have entered into any war or act of hostility    against any Mehomitan nation, it is declared by the parties that no    pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption    of the harmony existing between the two countries.  The text may be found in the Congressional Record or in treaty collections such as Charles Bevans' \\\"Treaties and Other International Agreements of the United States of America 1776-1949\\\", vol. 11 (pp. 1070-1080).  The English text of the Treaty of Tripoli was approved by the U.S. Senate on June 7, 1797 and ratified by President John Adams on June 10, 1797.  It was recently discovered that the Arabic version of the treaty not only lacks the quotation, it lacks Article XI altogether.  The person who translated the Arabic to English was Joel Barlow, Consul General at Algiers, a close friend of Thomas Paine -- and an opponent of Christianity.  It is possible that Barlow made up Article XI, but since there is no Arabic version of that article to be found, it's hard to say.  In 1806 a new Treaty of Tripoli was ratified which no longer contained the quotation. \",\"      What  evidence  indicates that Gamma Ray bursters are very far away?  Their distribution is very isotropic and the intensity distribution, crudely speaking, indicates we're seeing an edge to the distribution.     Given the enormous  power,  i was just wondering,  what if they are    quantum  black holes or something  like that  fairly close by?     Why would they have to be at  galactic ranges?     Now, in the good old days before GRO data, it was thought the gamma bursters were neutron stars in the galaxy, it was expected that GRO would confirm this by either showing they were a local population (within a few hundred light years) or that they were in the galactic halo. (Mechanism was not known but several plausible ones existed) (also to be fair it was noted that the _brightest_ burster was probably in the LMC, suggesting theorists might be wrong back then...)  As the Sun is not at the center of the galaxy a halo population should show anisotropy (a local disk population is ruled out completely at this stage) - to avoid the anisotropy you have to push the halo out, the energy then gets large, the mechanism of getting NS out that far becomes questionable, and we should start to see for example the Andromeda's bursters.  The data is consistent with either a Oort cloud distribution (but only just) - but no one can think of a plausible source with the right spectrum. Or, it can be a cosmological distances (hence isotropy) and the edge is \\\"the edge of the Universe\\\" ;-) If at cosmological distances you need very high energy (to detect) and a very compact source (for spectrum), ergo a neutron star colliding with another neutron star or black hole. Even then getting the spectrum is very hard, but conceivable.   If we know anything about physics at that level, the bursters are not due to quantum black holes or cosmic strings, wrong spectrum for one thing.  The situation is further complicated by recent claims that there are two classes of sources ;-)  [in the colliding NS they'd actually probably fit relatively easily into the NS-NS and NS-BH collision scenarios respectively]     my own pet theory is that it's  Flying saucers  entering    hyperspace :-)     but the reason i am asking is that most everyone assumes  that they    are  colliding nuetron stars  or  spinning black holes,  i just wondered    if any mechanism could exist  and place them  closer in.  If you can think of one, remember to invite me to Stockholm...\",\" you can say that again. how does $23 for a new thermostat sound?\",\"    John, The problem here is that you have taken one peice of my response, without bothering to connect it with the other parts.  I have repeatedly noted that one needs to take the problematic historcity of acts and then examine the work of John Dominic Crossan and Burton Mack.  Once you have taken the time to examine recent developments in biblical scholarship, I think you will  grasp more clearly what I am saying.     Certainly this is an issue as I think the situation in Waco shows most  clearly.  If all that is required is that people are willing to die for a belief for it to be true, then surely David Koresh is the son of God.  No, the spurrious arguement that the resurrection had to be true for people to be willing to die must be put to rest.  The other problem is that it is so  monologocentric.  Even if the resurrection was a big deal (which it doesn't seem to have been for either Q, Thomas, or even John to a certain degree) there are a lot of other things which the Early Christians could have been doing together that would have been worth dying for.  It is my belief that even the idea of a mixed race community, which brought down regional/national boundaries in the name of koinonia could have been enough for people to be willing to die.  Radical communties do that (e.g. Jonestown, Waco, Warsaw, etc) But my original point was that roman persecution (which is the only persecution we have documented proof of) was not about whether a carpenter came back from the dead.  Such a claim was not unique nor particularly abhorent to the roman or greek mind.  My point is that avoidance of military and civic duty (i.e. emperor worship) would have been much more problematic -- which has nothing to do with the resurrection at all.  When nero used christians as human  torches to light up his dinner party it wasn't because the believe in a  risen savior, it was because they were supposedly involved in incest and cannablism.  The argument that christians were martyred for the resurrection just cannot stand up to critical examination.\",\"from Dean:  Yes, you're right.

Anybody who plays the way he does, does not belong in the NHL. There have been cheap shot artists through the history of the game, but a lot of them have been talanted players. Bobby Clarke, Kenny Linsemen, Pie McKenzie, Chris Chelios etc.. but nobody has been out right as dirty a cheapshot coward as Ulf. Violence in hockey has got to be curbed and players like (Should have been a Women) Samuelson don't belong. When players like Ulf, who's main purpose is to injure the better players in the league is allowed to continue, and the league won't stop it, the players should. A Christian Pro 1000 aluminum stick directed at his ugly head should do the trick nicely. If the Bruins get a chance to meet Pittsburgh in the near future, you can bet Neely will have his day. The sight of watching Ulf turtle up like the coward he is, is worth almost as much as a Stanely Cup. This wimp of a player almost ruined the career of one the best right wingers in the game. If you are to remove Ulf Samuelson from the lineup, the Penguins would not even notice he's gone. He's an eyesore on the game of hockey. \",\"  While I agree with much of this post, one point seems mis-directed...   And when controlled for usage of oil, gas, etc. energy efficiency in all countries turns out to be identical :-)  To take population density as an example, one way to reduce energy used in transportation is surely to concentrate the population in dense urban areas (though this might, of course, have other disadvantages, possibly even relating to energy use).  The fact that Japan is forced to do this by the nature of the country, while the US is not, does not mean that people in the US would be unable to do this if given sufficient motive to conserve energy.\",\" Imprecise. This description   1. ignores the role of the ballast,  2. misrepresents the heating effects in the starter.  The bimetalic strip cools down immediately after the contacts short circuit, because the neon discharge stops, and much less heat is generated from the I^2R loss in the metal as compared to the neon discharge.  The starter contacts open before the tube fires.  Actually, the tube fires as a result of the back-emf generated in the ballast because of this immediate opening of the starter's contacts.  A capacitor is connected in parallel with the contacts to prevent excessive arcing during the firing.  The neon reionizes but does not draw sufficient current to prevent firing of the tube itself.\",\" Look how long the Maple Leafs and Nordiques used similar logic....  Not that they fielded bad teams solely to field bad teams, but the Maple Leafs (and a certain dead man who was in charge) were one of the cheapest teams in the history of the sport.

They have MAJOR fan problems, namely that on occasion some of them don't make it home from the match!  The soccer fans tend to be fanatical, much like the Montreal fans who firebomb the players and coaches houses when they play pathetically.   -JPC  -- \",\"As of yet, there has been no description of the general principles behind the Clipper proposal. For example, is this a public key system or a private key system? If the latter, then I don't see how the system could work (given that the keys are tied to the device and not the person).  Further, the escrowed 80-bit keys are split into two 40-bit chunks. I would guess that the availability of one of these 40-bit chunks and a reasonable key-search machine, would allow you to read the traffic. I'm not suggesting that this is a deliberate weakness of the system, but it does make you think. Of course, this is easily fixable by  giving out two 80-bit chunks which could be x-ored to generate the  real 80-bit key.\",\"     I've had my Duo 230 for a few weeks now and suffer from both of the above problems. I reinstalled my system software twice in an effort to combat the problems - thinking they were system software problems. Initially reinstalling the system seemed to help but not anymore.

I've called the apple hotline (800 SOS-APPL) three times already and finally they agreed something is astray after my Duo's screen would go dim and the hard drive spun down by itselft and put itself to sleep.

This is in response to a question about the Immaculate Conception.  I explained it, but left justification up to our Catholic readers.  --clh]  There is no direct reference in the Holy Scripture except for the mention of Mary's _blessedness_/full of grace in the \\\"Annunciation\\\" by Angel Gabriel in Luke 1:26-28   And in the 6th month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto  a city of Galilee, named Nazareth.  To a virgin espoused to a  man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's  name was Mary.  And the angel came unto her and said, _\\\"Hail,  thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed  art thou among women.\\\"_  Now, now, hold that line of thought - \\\"the Lord is with Mary & blessed art thou among women\\\" - while you read on....  In the book, \\\"First Lady of the World, A Popular History of Devotion to Mary\\\" by Peter Lappin:  The _Immaculate Conception_ matter is really far more complicated than the _Assumption_.  This arose in 430 AD.  It is quite possible that the feast of _Mary's Conception_ under the title \\\"The Conception of Saint Anne\\\", originally commemorated the _physical miracle_ of a woman _beyond the age_ of child bearing, conceiving a daughter, just as Elizabeth had conceived John the Baptist.  A transfer in emphasis from the physical miracle wrought in Anne to the miracle of grace wrought by God in the soul of Mary was _logical_.  Mary is the incorruptible timber \\\"out of which was hewn the _tabernacle_ of Christ's sinless body\\\"; she is \\\"God's Eden, in whom there is no tree of knowledge, and no serpent that harms.\\\"  Her perfect beauty and spotlessness find their exemplar in Christ, her purity in that of the Father.  At the time of the Council of Ephesus, she was hailed as \\\"innocent, without blemish, immaculate, inviolate, spotless, holy in soul and body, who was blessed as a lily from among thorns, unlearned in the evil ways of Eve\\\". ... At the end of the thirteenth century, an Irish Franciscan, John Duns Scotus (1266-1308),...God maintained that it was a  greater thing for Him to preserve His (the Son) mother from all sin _than to use His power to clease her from it later_. ...  Now let's go to the discussion of baptism and original sin. From \\\"Pocket Catholic Cathechism\\\" by John A. Hardon:  Baptism - Concupiscence Remains after Baptism. Concupiscence or the tendency to sin remains in the baptized but since it is left to provide trial, it has no power to injure those who do not consent and who by the grace of Christ Jesus, manfully resist (Canon 5).  Original gifts of Adam and Eve before their fall: In the light of the foregoing, we see that our first parents were originally gifted three times over: -They had the natural gifts of human beings especially the  power to think and to choose freely. -The had the _preternatural_ gifts of bodily immortality  and of integrity, or the internal power to control desires. -They had the _supernatural_ gifts of sanctifying grace,  the virtues of faith, hope, and charity and the corresponding  title to enter heaven. By their disobedience, they lost the _supernatural and preternatural_ gifts entirely, and were weakened (without losing) their natural capacity to reason and to choose freely.  Baptism restores the _supernatural_ life lost by Adam's sin.  It _does not_ restore the _preternatural_ gifts but gifts as a title to a glorified restoration of our bodies on the last day...  Going back to _Immaculate Conception_ (I am not sure if this interpretation is in any other books but it may be another contribution to the 'puzzle'):  Given the miracle of St. Anne bearing a child at a non-childbearing age, AND Christ was not yet born  AND _there was no baptism yet_ on Mary's birth but STILL, the Angel Gabriel's greetings was: \\\"Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you. Blessed art thou amongst women\\\".  Even Mary was confused about this greeting.  Mary could very well have possessed all of the _treefold original gifts above_ given to our first parents (Adam and Eve before their sin):     Hail Mary (Example of praise given by the Angel Gabriel)     Full of grace (natural, preternatural, supernatural)     The Lord is with you (At those times, God would                 definitely want to be with those He                 has made _blessed_)     Blessed art thou amongst women (that says it all)  At the conception, God made Mary _full of grace and blessed_ as the 'tabernacle' for the coming body of Christ and so,  Immaculate Conception of Mary is true and Mary still has maintained her Immaculate Heart. \",\"First, I thank collectively all people who have given good answers to my questions. In my follow-up to Jason Smith's posting, I will address some issues that have caused misunderstanding:     Yes, to some degree. There was an excellent discussion in sci.skeptic on the nature of scientific work two weeks ago, I hope it did not escape your notice.   The correct word is 'likely'. There is no way to be sure our models and theories are absolutely correct. Theories are backed up by evidence, but not proved - no theory can be 'true' in a mathematical sense.  However, theories are not mere descriptions or rationalisations of phenomena. It is extremely important to test whether theories can _predict_ something new or not yet observed. All successful theories science has come up with have passed this test, including the Big Bang theory of cosmic evolution, the theory of natural selection etc. It does not mean they _must_ be correct, but they are not mere 'best fits' for the data.     Well, yes, if you want to _believe_ in them. This is not what science requires - take a good look at the theory and the evidence, see if the theory has made any successful predictions, and use your reason. Disbelievers are not punished.    This is what puzzles me - why do we need to have faith in _anything_? My fellow atheists would call me a weak atheist - someone who is unable to believe, ie, fails to entertain any belief in God.   Yes, I know that one can't believe without God's help; Luther makes this quite clear in his letter to Erasmus. I'm afraid this does not change my situation.      (deletions)    No, it is not, although it does look like one. This is a true dichotomy, either something exists, or nothing exists. If nothing exists, nobody would ask why. If something exists, it is possible to ask why, but actually no existing being could give an answer.   Imagine, for a moment, that the nobodies in non-existence could also ask: \\\"Why nothing exists?\\\" This is equivalent to my counter-question, \\\"why nothing exists in nothingness\\\".   Now, \\\"why anything exists\\\" is equivalent to \\\"why something exists in somethingness\\\".  _This_ is what I meant with my tautology, my apologies for the poor wording in my previous post.   I do indeed think there probably _is_ no reason for being, or existence, in general, for reasons I stated above. However, they will still leave open the question \\\"why this, and not that\\\", and this is where theistic explanations come in.  Science cannot give reasons for any _particular_ human being's existence.   This is a deep philosophical question - is determinism true, or not? Also, is God deterministic or not? I tend to think this question has no meaning in His case.   If I am for a reason, I've yet failed to see what it would be.  From our perspective, it looks like 'I' exist for truly random reasons. I just rolled two dice - why did I get 6 and 1? How can I believe there is any better reason for my existence?   Yes, I am satisfied with this reason, until I find something better. My 15 years of Christianity were of no help in this respect, I have to admit, but I am patient.    No, it doesn't, but I think an existing God cannot know why He exists, for an answer to this question is not knowable. Of course, this should not be any obstacle to belief in His existence.   It is impossible to know unknowable things. However, the question  \\\"why do I exist, in particular\\\" is _not_ an invalid question - this is not what I said. But from our perspective, it is impossible to tell, and I can't just believe in any given explanation instead of another, especially since I found I was deluding myself.    I think \\\"pre-existence\\\" is an oxymoron. There is no time 'outside' of this spacetime (except in some other universe), and from that  perspective, our universe never was. It exists only for those who are inside it.    No. The validity of the question has to be discussed separately; I think philosophy is of great help here. What can be known, and what is not knowable?   This is a very good question. In trying to answer this, and numerous other questions that bothered me, I finally found nothing to base my faith on.   I think it would be honest if we all asked ourselves, \\\"why do I believe\\\" or \\\"why I don't believe\\\".   Petri \",\"(please respond via email!)  Has anybody actually seen the Tek color space stuff working?  I'm not having any luck with either the xtici editor from export.lcs.mit.edu or with O'Reilly's ftp-able example xcms from ftp.uu.net.  The O'Reilly example fails for almost every set of inputs because XcmsTekHVCQueryMaxV returns a smaller value than XcmsTekHVCQueryMinV does (which makes no sense to me).  The xtici editor fails in XcmsStoreColors, apparently because the mathematical manipulations of the color specs results in invalid values.  So you can't actually edit any colors.

I know it is very contrary to the American NRA ethos of the right to bear arms, but Christians should rely on the strength of God to protect them.  Note that I say *should*.  We are inherently insecure but I feel that that is not proper justification to be armed to the teeth.  A Christian should not have to rely on physical weapons to defend himself.  A Christian should rely on his faith and intelligence. For instance, I have the faith that God will protect me but God also gave me the intelligence to know not to go walking down that dark alley at night.

It is my habit to check my articles before and after their submission for errors.  In my last article I stated:     I was wrong. I admit that I do not have a handle on Greek grammar, and thus confused \\\"kleros\\\", the second to last word in Acts 1:17 as being the plot of land discussed.  In actuality it is \\\"chorion\\\", which is the last word Acts 1:18.  Unfortunately my Greek dictionary does not discuss \\\"chorion\\\" so I cannot report as to the nuances of the word.   I don't know if someone else would have caught this, though I am sure that someone would be able to do so, but I have an aversion to disseminating mistakes, especially when someone else might use that mistake to prove a point\\\"   _____________________________________________________________________   MY REPLY... Vary noble of you Dave.  I didn't want to have to go to x number of sources to show you wrong.  (Although I am researching CHORION a little).   DB... \\\"Of course the only other reference Mr DeCenso has given is Bullinger.  And Bullinger uses such ridiculous exegisis that when I accused Mr DeCenso of actually believing Bullinger, he replied that I misquoted him:   of > my response to see what I REALLY said in my posting of this article.    [Actually Mr DeCenso, you said that there was \\\"benefit\\\" to our argument, in   that it caused to to rediscover Bullinger's exegisis.  I did not realize   that you would find such garbage beneficial, unless you were convinced by   it].\\\"   MY REPLY... Thank you for correcting your restating of my points.   DB... \\\"and Mr DeCenso also replied:     Thus I apologize for thinking that even Mr DeCenso could find such \\\"drek\\\" convincing....he should specify which parts of Bullinger he finds convincing and quit hiding behind a disingenuous mask of \\\"This is what Bullinger believed, not necessarily what I believe.\\\" So which is it Mr DeCenso? Do you find the exegisis convincing or not?)\\\"   MY REPLY... One of my purposes in debating these alleged contradictions with you and others is to diseminate many different views of possible reconciliations raised by various Bible scholars and students alike.  When I present MY VIEWS, I will clearly distinguish them from now on.   DB... \\\"Of course without Archer and Bullinger we find that Mr DeCenso has presented no Greek exegisis at all, and Mr DeCenso has made a big thing about my not referring back to the actual Greek.  Thus we find this demand on his part for quality Greek exegisis to be a hypocritical requirement.\\\"   MY REPLY... Good point.  But in your declaring that these passages are contradictory, you have produced only superficial reasonings and observations. Nor have you dug deeper.  I'm glad you have begun in this post.  I will begin Greek studies on these passages in more depth than I thought necessary, as well.   DB... \\\"It would be appropriate to look at what Mr DeCenso has actually USED as evidence.  Now we know what he claims for a standard, as he has stated it often enough:     But are these actual standards he has used, or simply empty hyperbole.  Let's see, he has used (a), and since he is trying to reconcile it to other passages, we see that he has also used (b).  On the other hand he has presented no use of:   (d) historical context                or (e) historical content                or (f) other pertinent historical info   or (g) cultural context                  or (h) cultural content                  or (i) other pertinent cultural info     or (j) grammatical construction          or even (k) Hebrew and Greek word studies [remember, Archer and Bullinger don't count]   Thus we find his vaunted criteria for exegisis is just empty mouthings.\\\"   MY REPLY... Question:  Do you find such criteria important?  If so, do you plan on starting to use them to the best of your ability, or will you continue to present shallow observations (I don't mean this in a bad way). At this point in our _debates_, I have not found it necessary to present a total exegetical analysis of these passages, since we seem to keep beating around the bush and not getting into the core of the verses.  I do not believe it necessary to use many of the above criteria to refute your arguments re: Judas in Acts and Matthew, but I will do my best from this point on to use several of the above criteria, since you desire me to.  I hope you will also. It will greatly enhance our study of these passages.   DB... \\\"The only thing he has actually used, beyond the passage itself, is any other passage.  Thus Mr DeCenso should be honest and note that most of his list is red herring and his only real criteria seems to be:     MY REPLY... The reason is simple...you are mistating the passages.  You claim that the PASSAGES contradict one another; I do not see the PASSAGES contradicting one another. (1) They may very well be complimentary, as many scholarly sources mention; (2) Matthew may not be presenting Judas' death, as you claim.  But we'll look at your defense of this later.   Also, the \\\"reward of iniquity\\\" in the Acts PASSAGE may not be the 30 pieces of silver in Matthew's PASSAGES.  (Although you have a valiant attempt later at stating why you believe it is).   At this beginning stages in our debates, we are laying some Scriptural groundwork, which will be expanded upon through deeper exegesis.   DB... \\\"Of course the only reason I can see to so drastically reinterpret a passage as he has done with Judas' death, is to make it agree with another passage so that both could be considered correct.\\\"   MY REPLY... One of the reasons I have given a different exegetical view of the passages is that you seem to think the majority of scholarship is wrong in concluding these passages are complimentary.  However, I see no problem in Tony Rose's explanation of Judas' death...   _____________________________________________________________________   HOW WOULD YOU EXPLAIN THE INACCURACY BETWEEN JUDAS HANGING HIMSELF IN MATTHEW 27:5 AND \\\"FALLING HEADLONG HE BURST OPEN\\\" =============================================================   This question of the manner in which Judas died is one with which we are constantly confronted in our travels. Many people point to the apparent discrepancy in the two accounts as an obvious, irreconcilable error. Some have gone so far as to say that the idea of an inerrant Bible is destroyed by these contradictory accounts. However, this is not the case at all. Matthew relates that Judas hanged himself, while Peter tells us he fell and was crushed by the impact. The two statements are indeed different, but do they necessarily contradict each other? Matthew does not say that Judas did not fall; neither does Peter say that Judas did not hang himself. This is not a matter of one person calling something black and the other person calling it white. Both accounts can be true and supplementary. A possible reconstruction would be this: Judas hanged himself on a tree on the edge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom. After he hung there for some time, the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and Judas fell down the ledge, mangling his body in the process. The fall could have been before *or* after death as either would fit this explanation. This possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the valley of Hinnom is examined.  From the bottom of the valley, you can see rocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular. There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom. Therefore, it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks on this way down, tearing his body open. It is important to remember that we are not told how long Judas remained hanging from the tree or how advanced was the decomposition of his body before his fall. Louis Gaussen relates a story of a man who was determined to kill himself. This individual placed himself on the sill of a high window and pointed a pistol at his head. He then pulled the trigger and leaped from the window at the same time. On the other hand, a person could say that this man took his life by shooting himself, while another could rightly contend he committed suicide by jumping form the tall building. In this case, both are true, as both are true in the case of Matthew's and Peter's accounts of the death of Judas. It is merely a situation of different perspectives of the same event.   _____________________________________________________________________   Your only reason for rejecting this is, I believe, your attempt to discredit inerrancy.

DB... \\\"At present though, Mr DeCenso only asks two questions of me:     Actually I find question (1) to be a rather stupid request, but I will answer it because he now restricts himself to two points.  First I would point out that hanging is a very efficient manner for ending a life.  In fact it is a bit of a fluke when someone survives hanging (except in fantasy cowboy movies), and even then it usually referred to as an attempted hanging.\\\"   MY REPLY... I work at an agency that investigates child abuse and neglect.  Today, I got a call re: a child that attempted suicide by hanging himself because his mother is on crack.  He failed in his attempt and is in a child's psych ward at a local hospital.  Hanging attempts are not always successful.   To assume that because most hangings are successful, this one was also is \\\"begging the question\\\", if I may quote you.   [Last night, listening to _The Bible Answer Man_ broadcast, The Christian Research Institute's show, one of the scholars on there used several of these terms that you use.  I am not all that familiar with them.  The man on the BAM show teaches Comparative Religion and Logic.  It was interesting]   DB... \\\"This is so prevalent that, so that to say a man hung himself with no other qualifiers is synonymous with stating that he killed himself.\\\"   MY REPLY... Qualifiers are important at times, as we'll see in an OT passage I'll mention below. Does hanging ALWAYS have this outcome?  Did Matthew, who is the only source we have re: Judas hanging himself, state that Judas died as a result?  To say it's synonymous means it has the same meaning as.  A boy (age 14) hung himself.  But he lived.  This is only one of probably thousands of documented cases we can discover.

Also, is it possible that the sources you read may be wrong, or lying, or deceived in other parts of their books?  If so, should we do, as we have done with Archer, toss them to the side and not value anything they say, including their \\\"interpretation\\\" of the hanging of Judas?  I am sure _you_ would find some errors and maybe even some deception in those sources.   You also noted they \\\"interpreted\\\" the hanging as meaning he died.

[^^^ above, mine] No you can't only conclude this, although, as Tony says, this was a highly probable outcome.  But Matthew does not state death as being a result.   The Greek word is APAGCHO.  Matthew 27:5 is it's only occurrence in the New Testament.   In the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the OT used at the time of Jesus), it's only used in 2 Samuel 17:23 : \\\"Now when Ahithophel saw that his advice was not followed, he saddled a donkey, and arose and went home to his house, to his city. Then he put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died; and he was buried in his father's tomb.\\\"             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   Notice that not only is it stated that Ahithophel \\\"hanged himself\\\" [Gr. Sept., APAGCHO], but it explicitly adds, \\\"and died\\\".  Here we have no doubt of the result. In Matthew, we are not explicitly told Judas died.   Also, there is nothing in the Greek to suggest success or failure.  It simply means \\\"hang oneself\\\".   DB... \\\"But Mr DeCenso, you are more than welcome to disagree and show more reputable                                                                      ^^^^^^^^^ Christian scholars that insist that the hanging was not successful.\\\"   MY REPLY... [^^^above, mine] \\\"Reputable\\\"?  You mean ones that have never erred? As far as   insisting that the hanging was unsuccessful, that can't be done, even by me. ^^^^^^^^^   As I said in an earlier post...   _____________________________________________________________________ Although I still agree with Tony's exegesis as being the most probable explanation regarding Judas' death (taking into account several criteria), I've recently noticed some new things in Matthew.   MAT 27:5-8 Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed, and went and hanged himself. But the chief priests took the silver pieces and said, \\\"It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because they are the price of blood.\\\" And they consulted together and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in. Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.   First of all, notice that the text does not say that Judas died as a result of hanging. All it says is that he \\\"went and hanged himself.\\\" Luke however, in Acts, tells us that \\\"and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out.\\\" This is a pretty clear indication (along with the other details given in Acts - Peter's speech, the need to pick a new apostle, etc.) that at least after Judas' fall, he was dead. So the whole concept that                                                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Matthew and Luke both recount Judas' death is highly probable, but not clear ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ cut. ^^^ _____________________________________________________________________   I also wrote...   _____________________________________________________________________ MY REPLY...   Here we have a stickler, Dave, that I have to say I just recently noticed. Let's look at the passage in Matthew:   MAT 27:4 saying, \\\"I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.\\\" And they said, \\\"What is that to us? You see to it!\\\"   MAT 27:5 Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed, and went and hanged himself.   MAT 27:6 But the chief priests took the silver pieces and said, \\\"It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because they are the price of blood.\\\"   MAT 27:7 And they consulted together and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in.   MAT 27:8 Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.   Notice verse 5...\\\"Then he...went and hanged himself.\\\" Matthew does not say Judas died, does it?  Should we assume he died as a result of the hanging?                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ What does Acts say? ACT 1:18 (Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out.   ACT 1:20 \\\"For it is written in the book of Psalms: 'Let his dwelling place be desolate, And let no one live in it'; and, 'Let another take his office.'   Here we may have a graphic explanation of Judas' death....So, my line of reasoning to dispel your contradiction myth re:the \\\"two\\\" accounts of Judas' death is this...Matthew doesn't necessarily explain how Judas died; he does                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ say Judas \\\"hanged himself\\\", but he didn't specifically say Judas died in the hanging incident.               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ However, Acts seems to show us his graphic demise.  Therefore, there is no contradiction between Matthew and Acts re: Judas' `death'.   .......   MY REPLY... ...we do know from Matthew that he did hang himself and Acts probably records his death.  Although it's possible and plausible that he fell from the hanging and hit some rocks, thereby bursting open, I can no longer assume that to be the case.  Therefore, no contradiction.  Matthew did not say Judas died as a                                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ result of the hanging, did he?  Most scholars believe he probably did, but...? ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ______________________________________________________________________   I quoted all that to show that I highly regard the scholars' explanations, but in looking at the texts initially, we can't assume Judas died.  It is, however, highly probable.                            ^^^^^^   DB... \\\"By the way, while all agree that Judas died from the hanging, the books had different ways of dealing with the contradiction we are discussing.  One simply ignored it entirely and simply referred back to Matthew's version as the correct version in both Matt and Acts.  \\\"The Biblical Knowledge Commentary\\\" suggested the hypotheses that Judas hung and then when he rotted, his belly exploded (which doesn't explain his headlong fall), or that his branch or rope broke, and he fell to his death and his gut gushed out (which doesn't explain how a hanging man, would fall headlong rather than feet first).\\\"   MY REPLY... The outcome of any fall is dependent upon many factors...how high the person was suspended before the fall, any obstructions such as tree branches that may have deviated the fall, how steep an incline of rocky surfaces the victim fell upon, thus possibly rolling or bouncing of several rocks, etc.  In a superficial examination of the Acts passage and the Matthew passage, we are not given a lot of info on the geographical specifics, but Tony in the above quoted post gave us some...   _____________________________________________________________________ A possible reconstruction would be this: Judas hanged himself on a tree on the edge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom. After he hung there for some time, the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and Judas fell down the ledge, mangling his body in the process. The fall could have been before *or* after death as either would fit this explanation. This possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the valley of Hinnom is examined.  From the bottom of the valley, you can see rocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular. There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom. Therefore, it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks on this way down, tearing his body open. _____________________________________________________________________   DB... Now truthfully, I do not see what is comforting about Matthew confusing the source of the Potter's field prophesy, but on the other hand the author is correct: Matthew does make that confusion.  Of course a Biblical inerrantist who claim that every word of the Bible is guaranteed true by God, will have to thereby add one more contradiction to the death of Judas (ie: where the prophesy of the Potter's field came from).\\\"   MY REPLY... Please, when we are done with this study on his death, remind me to discuss this with you.   DB... As to your second question Mr DeCenso, you ask how we could be sure that the money with which Judas purchased the land, was indeed for the betrayal, rather than some other source.  I would point out that in Acts, where it specifically mention \\\"the reward of iniquity\\\" [Acts 1:18], it also specifically mentions what act of iniquity they were talking about (ie: Acts 1:16 \\\"...concerning Judas who was guide to those who arrested Jesus.\\\").  Now I would point out that when the Bible describes an act of \\\"iniquity,\\\" and then immediately discusses \\\"*the* reward of iniquity,\\\" it would be rather inane to suggest that it was an action of iniquity other than the one discussed.\\\"   MY REPLY... Dave, we are getting somewhere, aren't we!   ACT 1:15 And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples (altogether the number of names was about a hundred and twenty), and said, ACT 1:16 \\\"Men and brethren, this Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus; ACT 1:17 \\\"for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry.\\\" ACT 1:18 (Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out. ACT 1:19 And it became known to all those dwelling in Jerusalem; so that field is called in their own language, Akel Dama, that is, Field of Blood.) ACT 1:20 \\\"For it is written in the book of Psalms: 'Let his dwelling place be desolate, And let no one live in it'; and, 'Let another take his office.'   Notice that in verse 16, the word \\\"iniquity\\\" is not used.  Rather, it states that Judas \\\"became a guide to those who arrested Jesus\\\". But the writer DID NOT stop there...vs. 17, \\\"for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry.\\\"  What part did Judas play in their ministry?          ^^^^^^ JOH 12:6 This he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and had the money box; and he used to take what was put in it. JOH 13:29 For some thought, because Judas had the money box, that Jesus had said to him, \\\"Buy those things we need for the feast,\\\" or that he should give something to the poor.   So, now we know what part Judas played - he was a treasurer, per se. Right after Peter stated that Judas played a part in this ministry (treasurer, according to John), THEN Luke adds the parenthetical explanation of \\\"wages of iniquity\\\" - money that should have been put into the ministry, but was stolen by Judas to purchase a field.  I believe this is a better exegetical explanation of what the \\\"wages of iniquity\\\" are.  What do you think, Dave?   DB... \\\"Now since I have given you clear answers (and even references), perhaps you could unequivocally state what type of inerrantist you are (instead of asking me what type I think you are, as you did to Mr Joslin).\\\"   MY REPLY...

That makes them the best method of defense for the citizenry. Not everybody has the time to train with a gladius, you know, but for some reason those who prey on others seem to have more free time.  To extend this a bit further, you need only a certain level of competence to beat another with a range weapon.  Getting in their face with a weapon and winning is much more difficult, and requires more training time the average citizen just does not have.  I've spent a few years practicing with a sword.  I can take the common person armed with one (though self-defense isn't the reason I own one).  My kid sister would have an even chance of beating me, gun vs. gun, with only a month of training.  That makes firearms much better, in our eyes.   Excellent point.  Perhaps you aren't so naive after all?   Taken into consideration in what respect?  Though quite wrong, let's make it a blanket statement for weapons in general.  This has been taken into consideration.  We call use of them aggrivated assault, assault with a deadly weapon, assault with intent to kill, attempted murder, and a whole host of others, and tack on extra prison time.   In Norway I suspect it was about the only weapon available.  You conquered your land (among others) a full millenia before we were thought of, and shortly thereafter weapons weren't quite so common.  I suspect that a few world wars made a difference too, since in times of emergency weapons tend to be turned in or donated to needy causes.  I'm curious, though, were the weapons used in the crimes bought shortly before the crime, or were they aquired by other means?  Any requirements other than just registering the shotgun?   \\\"Come on down to honest Erik's Used Swords!

The time scale and the homogeneous culture are important.  Equally important is a basic philosophical difference in personal versus collective good. In America, the individual is more important than the masses.  Personal liberties are prized above all.  This is, sadly, changing of late, but I trust you notice how this call for freedom makes laws that restrict individuals for little collective benefit hateful to Americans.  I'd hazard a guess that, were America less interested in freedom and personal liberty and more interested in collective good we never would have sent our armed forces anywhere.  One poor effect of this culture we have is that we're looking out for ourselves and it is quite easy to identify with only a small segment of the population.

The Woman is the Church.  Catholics have always called our Church \\\"Holy Mother Church\\\" and our \\\"Mother.\\\"  An example would be from St. Cyprian of Carthage, who wrote in 251 AD, \\\"Can anyone have God for his Father, who does not have the Church for his mother?\\\"  Hence the image of the Church as a woman, holding a Cross and a Cup, which tell of the Crucifxition of Our Lord, and of the power of His Blood (the grail legend, but also, more significantly, it shows that \\\"This is the Cup of the New Covenant in my blood, which shall be shed for you and for many.\\\" (Luke 22.20), the Cup represents the New Covenant and holds the blood of redemption).  The fact that the woman is holding both and is said to have the whole world for her seat, is that the Catholic Church is catholic, that is universal, and is found throughout the world, and the Church shows the Crucifixtion and applies the blood of redemption to all mankind by this spread of hers, thorugh which the Holy Sacrafice of the Mass, can be said and celebrated in all the nations as Malachi predicted in Malachi 1.11, \\\"From the rising of the sun to its setting, my name is great among the gentiles, and everywhere there is sacrafice, and there is offered to my Name a clean oblation, for my Name is great among the gentiles, says the Lord of hosts.\\\"  And so we acknowledge what St. Paul wrote \\\"For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you show the Lord's death until he comes.\\\" (1 Corinthians 11.26)   You are quite right about the identification of \\\"Babylon the Great, Mother of all Harlots\\\" with Rome.

Thus I've never really believed in God and heaven, although I don't actually believe that they don't exist either - I'm sort of undecided, probably like a lot of people I guess.         Lately I've been thinking about it all a lot more, and I wondered how religious people can be so convinced that there is a God. I feel as though I want to believe, but I'm not used to believing things without proof - just as I can't believe that there definitely isn't a God, so I can't definitely believe that there is. I wondered if most of you were brought up by religious families and never believed any different. Can anyone help me to understand how your belief and faith in God can be so strong.          Another question that frequently crosses my mind is which religion is correct?? How do you choose a religion, and how do you know that the Christian God exists and the Gods of other religions don't?? How do you feel about people who follow other religions?? How about atheists?? And people like me - agnostics I suppose. Do you respect their religion, and accept their beliefs as just as valid as your own?? Isn't there contradiction between the religions?? How can your religion be more valid than any others?? Do you have less respect for someone if they're not religious, or if they follow a different religion than you would if they were Christian??          Also, how much of the scriptures are correct?? Are all events in the bible really supposed to have happened, or are they just supposed to be stories with morals showing a true Christian how to behave??          I generally follow most of the Christian ideas, which I suppose are fairly universal throughout all religions - not killing, stealing, etc, and 'Loving my neighbour' for want of a better expression. The only part I find hard is the actual belief in God.          Finally, what is God's attitude to people like me, who don't quite believe in Him, but are generally fairly 'good' people. Surely not believing doesn't make me a worse person?? If not, I find myself wondering why I so strongly want to really believe, and to find a religion.          Sorry if I waffled on a bit - I was just writing ideas as they came into my head. I'm sure I probably repeated myself a bit too.

Robert.  \",\" If you force me to do something, am I morally responsible for it?   Well, make up your mind.    Is it to be \\\"instinctive not to murder\\\" or not?   It's not even correct.    Animals of the same species do kill one another.   Sigh.   I wonder how many times we have been round this loop.  I think that instinctive bahaviour has no moral significance. I am quite prepared to believe that higher animals, such as primates, have the beginnings of a moral sense, since they seem to exhibit self-awareness.   So what?     Are you trying to say that some killing in animals has a moral significance and some does not?   Is this your natural morality>    Are you blind?   What do you think that this sentence means?   \\\"There must be the possibility that the organism - it's not   just people we are talking about - can consider alternatives.\\\"  What would that imply?

I think this is going to be a tough measure to fight, since the Government has invested a lot of resources in developing this high-profile initiative.  They are serious about it now.  It won't be as easy as it was defeating Senate Bill 266 in 1991.  Possible actions to take in response:  1)  Mobilize your friends to to all the things on this list, and more.  2)  Work the Press.  Talk with your local newspaper's science and technology reporter.  Write to your favorite trade rags.  Better yet, write some articles yourself for your favorite magazines or newspapers.  Explain why the Clipper chip initiative is a bad idea.  Remember to tailor it to your audience.  The general public may be slow to grasp why it's a bad idea, since it seems so technical and arcane and innocent sounding.  Try not to come across as a flaming libertarian paranoid extremist, even if you are one.   3)  Lobby Congress.  Write letters and make phone calls to your Member of Congress in your own district, as well as your two US Senators.  Many Members of Congress have aides that advise them of technology issues.  Talk to those aides.  4)  Involve your local political parties.  The Libertarian party would certainly be interested.  There are also libertarian wings of the Democrat and Republican parties.  The right to privacy has a surprisingly broad appeal, spanning all parts of the political spectrum.  We have many natural allies.  The ACLU.  The NRA.  Other activist groups that may someday find themselves facing a government that can suppress them much more efficiently if these trends play themselves out.  But you must articulate our arguments well if you want to draw in people who are not familiar with these issues.  4)  Contribute money to the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR), assuming these groups will fight this initiative.  They need money for legal expenses and lobbying.  5)  Mobilize opposition in industry.  Companies that will presumably develop products that will incorporate the Clipper chip should be lobbied against it, from within and from without.  If you work for a telecommunications equipment vendor, first enlist the aid of your coworkers and fellow engineers against this initiative, and then present your company's management with a united front of engineering talent against this initiative.  Write persuasive memos to your management, with your name and your colleagues' names on it.  Hold meetings on it.  6)  Publicize, deploy and entrench as much guerrilla techno-monkeywrenching apparatus as you can.  That means PGP, anonymous mail forwarding systems based on PGP, PGP key servers, etc.  The widespread availability of this kind of technology might also be used as an argument that it can't be effectively suppressed by Government action.  I will also be working to develop new useful tools for these purposes.   7)  Be prepared to engage in an impending public policy debate on this topic.  We don't know yet how tough this fight will be, so we may have to compromise to get most of what we want.  If we can't outright defeat it, we may have to live with a modified version of this Clipper chip plan in the end.  So we'd better be prepared to analyze the Government's plan, and articulate how we want it modified. \",\"Philadelphia                     1 2 4--7 Buffalo                          0 3 1--4 First period      1, Philadelphia, Recchi 52 (Galley, Lindros) 0:18.

The material in John (I'm not sure exactly what is referred to here, but I'll take for granted the similarity to the Matt./Luke \\\"Q\\\" material) IS different; hence, one could have almost any relationship between the two, right up to John getting it straight from Jesus' mouth.   The version of the \\\"usual theory\\\" I have heard has Matthew and Luke independently relying on Mark and \\\"Q\\\".  One would think that if Luke relied on Matthew, we wouldn't have the grating inconsistencies in the geneologies, for one thing.   This is the part that is particularly new to me.  If it were possible that you could point me to a reference, I'd be grateful.    Because it closes up the gap between (supposed) writing and the existing copy quit a bit.  The further away from the original, the more copies can be written, and therefore survival becomes more probable.     I'm not really impressed with the \\\"theology\\\" argument.  But I'm really pointing this out as an \\\"if\\\".  And as I pointed out earlier, one cannot make these arguments about I Peter; I see no reason not to accept it as an authentic letter.    The best analogy would be reporters talking to the participants, which is not so bad.

From a farm out in Boondock, Saskatchewan or Weedville, Alberta.   The inner city isn't the only place that is poor. I think the biggest barrier to hockey in the inner city is... no ICE to play on.          Stace \",\"Atan):   Well, Napoleon. It is your kind of people who are preventing peace  on the world. First of all, you didn't answer the question I asked at the end of my posting. And then you told me some bullshit throughout your posting which had no positive point about the issue, filled with hatred, and filled with emotions. Why am I doing this?

I'm not a lawyer and I don't even play one on TV, but intuitively there's something wrong with having one's words archived for possible future use against you.  This possibility frightens me more than any of the talk about the Clipper Chip, right to cryptography, etc.   I'm afraid it just might.  -nhy  -- \",\" To answer your irrelevant question, yes a person of color is human, but I still don't know what you mean by human being and you have merely begged the question without responding.  By trying to inject the notion of race into the discussion, you muddy the waters without adding any insight whatever.  The same parallel question could be \\\"Is a polydactyl person a human being?\\\"  You still have not answered what you mean by human being.  Please do so.   You won't answer the question and instead drag in irrelevancies. If you want a definition of human being that does not depend on the vagaries of law, but holds solid whatever the law may rule, provide it for me.   More irrelevancies.  As Larry Margolis pointed out, the law has made special exceptions in order to include fetuses, but does not follow your version of human being.  And as he pointed out, brain death is not a means of determining who has the rights of the living, but rather who has died.  There is a significant difference.  What I am wondering now is, has your argument so failed you that you feel it necessary to drag out irrelevancies and leave the thread you started?  You got answers to your questions when you began baiting me, if you recall, after you had made some ridiculous remarks about Adrienne Regard and, having been corrected, changed the subject with your remarks about having a discussion of substance.  If you really wanted a discussion of substance, why then do you disregard logic and substance in order to toss silly accussations, e.g. \\\"It really doesn't matter to you...\\\" If it matters to you, then why not define human being and seek some substance?  You're not going to convince a logical person of the rightness of your position unless you apply some logic and show some meaning to your words.   As others point out, one is sacrificed for the other depending on which has the better chance at survival.  Again, your analogy fails.  Not precedence, but possession makes a difference here. A woman's womb is indisputably her own.  Also, I see you ignore my statement that you would grant rights to a fetus that would not be granted a born human being.  Was that due to its inconvenience?   Is it?  Please cite a precedent and the basis of the ruling.   You simply assert things without any support.  Your analogy is not accurate and your assertions are unsupported.  Try this on for size.  It is not murder for one Siamese twin to kill the other in the womb.  There.  We now have equal arguments. But the idea is illogical.  For one Siamese twin to kill the other in the womb would likely be to kill itself as well.  The systems are dependent on each other for life.  I'm still struggling to see anything analagous here and failing to do so.   Your argument is from Fantasy Island.  Your comparison is a total failure, as I have demonstrated already, and has no basis in reality, neither legally nor medically.  And for you to assert that it is not a perfect comparison because of the impossible, that of coercion or oppression, is ridiculous.  As I said, you give the analogy too little credit for failure.  On the one hand you start this by saying you want to take a real, rather than a hypothetical, situation, then you fly off into Siamese twins murdering one another in the womb or coercing or oppressing each other in the womb when the reality of the situation you describe in now way matches your version.  As I said before, decisions are made regarding which twin lives and dies in situations where they cannot both survive.  And, furthermore, as I have already said, there is a difference between an equal claim to organs and a claim that is unequal.  You seem to be asserting that a fetus has a claim on a woman's womb.  When the fetus is born, what happens to its claim?  And by what reason do you assert its claim?   You haven't answered the question.  The situations are not analagous.   Again you avoid the question.  Dependence can be transferred, and it is not as slow as you seem to think.   Yes, and I'd hate to have been the one to tell Dr Gunn's children that he was murdered by a religious, \\\"pro-life\\\" fanatic.  Please do try to stay relevant.   Clever comeback.  I congratulate you on the readiness of your wit.  What happened to that claim to bodily organs where life is at stake? Why does this parent now have an indisputable right to his or her kidney when previously the parent did not, by your standards?  What is different about the two situations?  I see I have to spell this out for you since the meaning was too subtle for you.  In the one case you do not recognize a difference between a fetus and a born child (you ask why a born child cannot be abandoned but a fetus can), and in this case you recognize a significant difference between the fetus and born child where the lives of the two are at stake.  You can't have it both ways.  Action and inaction are irrelevant to the principle, but you are wrong about the inaction anyway.  Ask any of the numerous women who post here and have borne children how inactive their pregnancy was.  To have a healthy, live child, a woman does more than hang out, eat as she chooses, plays volleyball like she always did, drinks at parties with her friends, etc.  She behaves very differently, and the provision of her resources to a fetus may be no more voluntary than the beating of her heart, but it is far from inactive.\",\"SOMEONE PLEASE BUY THESE BOOKS!!!!!

In splicing them    together it is not my intention to change Steve's meaning or misrepresent   him in any way.  I don't *think* I've done so. ]   Part of what started this was my earlier example of Illinois, USA requiring anyone doing more than X automobile transfers a year (X = 10, I think) to become licensed as a used car dealer.  In addition, it requirs anyone with a used car dealer's license to own at least 10 cars at a time, all the time.   Let me continue with this example and try to answer Steve's questions.  Steve, let's say you have the talent and inclination to fix up and resell cars.  Either you've gotten good enough at it in your spare time to bump up against these limits, or you would like to do it full-time but these stupid, arbitrary laws prevent you from starting out small and pulling yourself up.  So I'm protected from a hungry neighborhood competitor willing to take a low profit while working extra hard to fulfill my needs, and you're protected from doing what you want with your life.  Here's what I see libertarianism offering you:  Your money is truly yours; it belongs to you.  You can use it to buy a car. If you use it to buy a car, it is truly your car; it belongs to you.  You can use your money to fix up that car.  Since it is your car, you can sell that car.  Your life is truly yours; it belongs to you.  It matters not if someone thinks that it's \\\"wrong\\\" for you to buy and sell 10 cars within 12 months rather than, say, 9 cars.  They may dissaprove, but it is not their life or their money, it is your life and your money.  My money is truly mine; it belongs to me.  I can use it to buy a car. Perhaps your car.  Perhaps that 10th car, the one that someone, somewhere dissaproves of you selling and, presumably, of me buying.  That someone could go to the government and insist that the government make us stop it.  But the government would be powerless to stop us from doing what we like with our own property, in the abscence of fraud or agression. And it would be powerless to stop us from associating with each other.  This does not seem to me to be a utopian dream, but basic human decency and common sense.  A real grass-roots example of freedom and liberty. And yes, not having a few people acting as our masters, approving or rejecting each of our basic transactions with each other, does strike me as a wonderful way to improve the human condition.\",\":  : I am a Mormon.

And that kind of invisibility was prevalent for the most part for DePalma.  After being called up October 30 against the Tampa Bay Lightning, DePalma had an excellent week, scoring 5 points in 3 games while playing good defense.  Unfortunately, the 27-year-old DePalma then disappeared the rest of the way, getting just 3 more points in 15 more games, and generally looked lethargic and uninterested on both ends of the ice.  He then was sent down to Kansas City, walked out from there, and was suspended and later reinstated when it was revealed that he was injured; he then promptly disappeared from the watching eyes of Shark Bytes (as the mailing list is now known to Sharks officials) faithful, and neither the Sharks nor we miss him.  #10 JOHAN GARPENLOV  Season: 3rd Acquired: '91-92, trade with Detroit for D Bob McGill and 8th round   pick in '92 entry draft from Vancouver Grade:  A/A-  After an early slump, Garpenlov was nothing short of inspirational the rest of the way, finishing with 66 points in 79 games, second highest total on the team, as he clicked well with team MVP Kelly Kisio and right wing Rob Gaudreau.  Kisio got most of the credit, but Garpenlov, finishing second in the MVP voting, clearly demonstrated his playmaking and scoring skills, as he was seen making excellent centering passes as well as finishing passes to him by putting the puck past opposing goaltenders, getting a club-high 14 power- play goals.  Contrary to his previous rep, Garpenlov also showed that despite his small size (5' 11\\\", 183 lbs.), he was willing to throw himself around when necessary, albeit not very successful yet.  He also still needs to work on his defense, although he improved tremendously throughout the season, and was actually quite a good penalty killer by the end of the season.  He will be a major key to the offense next year.  #15 DAVID BRUCE  Season: 5th Acquired: '91-92, from St. Louis in expansion draft Grade:  I (?)  After a banner '91-92, when he led the team in power-play goals (10) and was third in total scoring (38 points in 60 games), Bruce was bothered virtually all of this season with a groin injury, which kept him out of the lineup for all by 17 games this season.  Of course, it is difficult to speculate how well he would have done this season had he not been affected by the injury, but the 28-year-old Bruce was effective with a man up or a man short in the Sharks' first season, and was expected to be a strong offensive leader this season as well.  The injury appears serious, which is a shame, because otherwise he may have a much brighter future for now; instead, his future with the Sharks next season appears clouded.  #18 MARK PEDERSON  Season: 3rd Acquired: '92-93, trade with Philadelphia for C/LW Dave Snuggerud Grade:  I (B)  It is difficult for me to understand the Flyers' decision to unload Pederson, after a very good offensive season last season (40 points in 58 games), but after riding the pine early in the season, Pederson was summarily sent to the Sharks in exchange of the defensive-minded Snuggerud, and he finished with 41 games combined with the Flyers and the Sharks.  He was also limited by injuries this season, and this limited his production (17 points).  But when healthy, Pederson appears impressive, with a good scoring touch, good size (and the willingness to throw it around, although he's not considered a physical forward), and good speed.  He also does not appear to be a liability on defense, but the Sharks probably have to wait until next season to see how much, exactly, Pederson can do.  #20 JOHN CARTER  Season: 4th Acquired: '91-92, free agent from Boston Grade:  I (B+/B)  Carter was definitely one of the hardest workers on the team, and the hard work worked wonders, as at times he looked great on ice.  However, although he did look great at times, the fact that he received just 16 points (in 55 games) for his efforts is a sign that there is only so much his hard work can do, and the Sharks confirmed that by sending him to Kansas City with about 20 games left in the season.  Carter, who will turn 30 on May 6, always hussled, but as a result, was sometimes trapped too deep within the offensive zone while forechecking, but he was generally a credit on the defensive end, but he is probably of limited utility in that capacity, and he did not impress offensively, although he was one of the best Sharks at drawing penalties.  He is very unlikely to be back next season.  #28 JEAN-FRANCOIS QUINTIN Season: 1st Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  I (B+/B)  I don't understand why the Sharks didn't let Quintin play any more than the 14 games he played this season.  He was generally hard-working and creating opportunities offensively, and appeared, at age 23, ready for regular NHL duty, at least for a team like the Sharks, finishing with 7 points in those 14 games while not being a defensive liability.  Shoulder injury in training camp before the '91-92 season limited Quintin, the team's leading scorer in exhibition games despite sitting out the final two, to just 29 games with the Sharks and the Blades that season, but he looked impressive.  He should be a solid contender for regular duty next season.  #41 MARK BEAUFAIT  Season: 1st Acquired: 2nd round pick in 1991 supplemental draft Grade:  I (?)  After a all-star season at Kansas City, Beaufait got a cup of coffey with the Sharks late in the season when the Blades knocked down a playoff spot and the Sharks decimated with injuries, playing 5 games and scoring a goal for his only NHL point thus far.  Despite small size (5' 9\\\", 165 lbs.), Beaufait was not shy to throw himself around when necessary, and looked pretty good at times, although it's too early to judge him based on 5 NHL games, in which he played mostly left wing, away from his center position at Northern Michigan and Kansas City.  #42 JAROSLAV OTEVREL Season: 1st Acquired: 8th round pick in 1991 entry draft Grade:  I (?)  Like Beaufait, Otevrel also played away from his normal position when he was up for his cup of tea (7 games) midway through the season.  He was generally very much of a defensive liability, and did not show much offensively either, although that may be more indicative of the lack of ice time he got in those 7 games.  He may need another season to work on his defense, but once his defense is acceptable, he should be ready.  #44 MICHEL PICARD  Season: 1st Acquired: '92-93, trade with Hartford for LW Yvon Corriveau Grade:  I (B-/C+)  The 23-year-old Picard, although he perennially tore up the minors, seems to be close to being out of chances, for some reason, after being acquired by the Sharks but failing to impress the management in 25 games, scoring 4 goals for his only points, and he spent most of the rest of the way in Kansas City. He was not particularly strong defensively, and despite his offensive brilliance in the minors, he has failed thus far to score in the NHL, although he has been given limited opportunities.  He may be the Sharks' bait in the expansion draft.  #45 DODY WOOD  Season: 1st Acquired: 3rd round pick in 1991 entry draft Grade:  I (D+/D, although perhaps I shouldn't give a grade at all)  I have been accused of knocking on Wood too much. :-)  Then, it is probably no surprise to you that I am thoroughly unimpressed by Wood thus far, although 13 games is a small example.  He was generally a nonfactor on offense, was not particularly good defensively, and took too many silly penalties, losing many fights in the process and gathering 69 penalty minutes in those 13 games, projecting to to 446(!) in an 84-game season.  He's not ready, and needs at least another season at KC, where he can work on his fighting skills, if nothing else.  His relatively small size (5' 11\\\", 181 lbs.) does not give much possibility that he can survive, at this stage, as an enforcer.\",\"Windows Shareware Monthly (WSM) is an on-line forum for information about the newest and best Windows 3.x and NT shareware/freeware software.   WSM is a compilation of submissions from shareware/freeware authors in a single Windows .HLP (Help System) file.  All types of software may be submitted for entry in WSM - utilities, applications, games, programming tools, etc.  WSM benefits Windows shareware/freeware authors by allowing them to publicize their software releases, inform users of updated versions, and to increase their installed base of users.  Those searching for specific Windows software will benefit by having a complete list of available software available at their fingertips - complete with feature lists, current prices, and any other relevant information.  Windows software authors may submit entries to Windows Shareware Monthly in the following manner:  1. Compose a short summary of the function of the software.  Include all    special features which are unique to your product and which set it apart    from other programs in the genre.  Be sure to include specific details    such as: the current release version, where the software is available,    how much the registration fee costs, how much disk space is required, any    special requirements (e.g. sound card, or VBRUN200.DLL, etc.), how the    author may be contacted, etc.  Because text is highly compressible, the    summary may be as long as is necessary, however, it is best to keep it    short.  A good guideline is a single screenful of 12-point text at 640x480    resolution.  Order forms and other such addendum may be included if desired.    All submissions whould be in plain text (ASCII) format.  Formatting will    be exactly as it is submitted - I will simply cut and paste text files    into a Help Authoring system.  If you require special formatting     conventions - such as boldface text or italics, or a larger font size,    indicate so CLEARLY within the text file.  For best results, use Windows    NotePad to create the .TXT file.    2. Include up to 100k of Windows-format .BMP (bitmap) screen-shots which    display the workings or special features of each program.  Special cases    (rendering applications for example) which require 256-color bitmaps may    submit up to 250k of .BMP files - all other should observe the 100k limit    and use 16-color format.  For maximum compatiblity with the software which    will be used to create the WSM .HLP file (Stefan Olson's Help Writer's    Assistant for Windows), please save the bitmaps with Windows Paintbrush or    WinGIF.   3. Include a 16-color .BMP of the program's icon (.ICO file).  Many programs    are available to convert .ICO to .BMP format, or Windows Paintbrush may be    used.  The .BMP will be embedded in the summary text.  4. Double-check for spelling errors, formatting corrections, etc.    5. Compress the .TXT file, the .BMP of the program icon, and any additional    .BMPs into a single file using PKZIP (any version).  6. Submit the entry by UUENCODING the .ZIPfile, and e-mailing it to:        DAA7365@TAMUTS.TAMU.EDU     if submitting via the Internet or Compuserve. If submitting via America    Online, send a brief message indicating submission, and append the .ZIP    file, then e-mail to:     DiegoAA  7. If any changes are required, or a new version is released, complete    the above procedures again.  Send all submissions to the @TAMUTS address,    and any comments, suggestions, criticisms, to DAA7365@RIGEL.TAMU.EDU.  All entries received before the deadline will be included in the subsequent edition of WSM.  The editor will not be held responsible for any errors, and we reserve the right to make changes to the entries.  WSM is not limited to shareware/freeware software.  A special area will be devoted to commercially available Windows 3.x and NT software.  Commercial software authors should follow the same steps above, with the exception of the limitations on size - the .TXT file and .BMPs may be as large as required (and as large as is practical for transmission over phone lines).  There is no charge for the publishing of either shareware/freeware or commercial product entries.    Advertisements for computer hardware, software, bulletin boards, etc. may be submitted as well. Again, the same procedures apply, with the exception of the size limitations.  There is no charge for advertising space.  The first ten advertisements submitted each month will be included; subsequent submissions will not be included due to size constraints.  WSM is currently looking for persons willing to devote the time to author columns within WSM.  A C/C++ programing section, a Visual Basic section, and two Windows-specific opinion/advice columns are envisioned.  All work will be on a voluntary basis.  If you wish to aid WSM and author a monthly column on one of the above topics, please send us mail at DAA7365@TAMUTS.TAMU.EDU or DiegoAA on America Online.\",\"     Just a question.     As a provider of a public BBS service - aren't you bound by law to gurantee    intelligble access to the data of the users on the BBS, if police comes    with sufficent authorisation ?

This doesn't mean that environmentalism is wrong, any more than supporting peace in the Middle East is wrong because Jews and Muslims also work for it.    Nonetheless, paganism is certainly on the rise, and we as Christians should address this and look at what draws people from paganism to Christianity.  Like it or not, pagan religions are addressing needs that Christianity should be, and isn't.     I believe that paganism has hit upon some major truths that Christianity has forgotten.  This doesn't mean that paganism is right, but it does mean that we have something to learn from the pagan movement.   First, paganism respects the feminine.  Christianity has a long history of oppressing women, and many (if not most) male Christians are still unable to live in a non-sexist manner.  The idea that God is sexless, or that Christ  could have been a women and still accomplished his mission, is met with a great deal of resistance.  This insistance on a male-dominated theology (and the  male-dominated society that goes with it) drives away many young women who have had to put up with sexist attitudes in their churches.   Second, paganism respects the physical world.  This is an idea with great ramifications.  One of these is environmentalism--respect for our surroundings and our world.  Another is integration of sexuality.  Christianity has a long tradition of calling ALL sexual feeelings sinful and urging people to suppress and deny their sexuality.  This is too much--sex is clearly a part of human experience and attempting to remove it is simply not a feasible option.   Christianity has only begun to develop a workable sexual ethic, and paganism is an attractive option.   I'm not advocating that Christian doctrines (no sex before marriage, etc.) should be changed--just that Christians work toward a more moderate ethic of sexuality.  Denial of sexuality places as much emphasis on sex as unmoderated sexuality, and neither one does much to bring us closer to God.\",\"I've a curiousity --    Whenever a person is put on the 15-day, 30-day or 60-day,   the person is on the list longer than the specificed time    I've seen a person on the 15-day for maybe 4 months last year, I don't  remember what...

He called a total of 4 penalties on the Habs and one on the Nordiques. The Nords' penalty came in O.T.  Stewart, being an ex-Nordique himself, was looking to call penalties on the Habs while letting the Nords get away with murder...WE WAS ROBBED!!!!  It was an excellent game with plenty of end-to-end rushes and tremendous goalkeeping.  The Nords tied it with over 1 minute to go while Lebeau was serving a penalty.  I don't mind Stewart calling a penalty in the last 5 min. of the game, but AT LEAST BE FAIR ABOUT IT.  The Nords were caught with their hand in the cookie jar more than once.

I inject on my legs and gut, and prefer the gut.  I can stick it in at a 90 degree angle, and barely feel it.  I'm not fat, just have a little gut.  My legs however, are muscular, and I have to pinch to get anything, and then I inject at about a 45 degree angle,and it still hurts.  The rate of absorbtion differs for subcutaneous and   muscular injections however--so if it's a daily thing it would be best not to switch places every day to keep consistencey.  Although some suggest switch legs or sides of the stomach for each shot, to prevent  irritation.  When you clean the spot off with an alcohol prep,  wait for it to dry somewhat, or you may get the alcohol in the puncture, and of course, that doesn't feel good.  A way to prevent irratation is to mark the spot that you injected.  A good way to do this is use a little round bandage and put it over the  spot.  This helps prevent you from injecting in the same spot, and spacing the sites out accuartely (about 1 1/2 \\\" apart.)  This is from experience, so I hope it'll help you.  (I have diabetes and have to take an injection every morning.)     Later,     David\",\"I'm attempting to write a serious policy paper examining whether the proposed wiretap (or \\\"Clipper\\\") chip is a cost-effective tool for police investigation.  That is, ignoring concerns about government intrusions into individual privacy, is the value of easy wiretaps to investigators greater than the cost to the communications industry, and their customers, to support this wiretap technology?    A rough estimate suggests that wiretaps are worth about five million dollars per year to U.S. law enforcement agencies.  (In 1990, 872 U.S. wiretaps led to 2057 arrests, while total police expenditures of $28 billion led to 11.25 million arrests [ref US Statistical Abstracts].) I'm working on estimating this wiretap benefit more accurately, but I'd like to ask hardware experts out there to help me with estimating the costs of the new proposed wiretap technology.  Please send me quotable/citeable estimates for:  - How many chips which would need to be made per year to keep all   phones with wiretap chips? - How much would it cost to make each chip? - How much did it cost to develop this technology in the first place? - How much more would supporting hardware, people, etc. cost, per chip? - What percentage cheaper would encryption chips and support have been   if private enterprise could compete to meet customer encryption needs? - What percentage of phone traffic would be taken up by the proposed   \\\"law enforcement blocks\\\"? - What is the total cost of handling all phone traffic per year?  Put another way, the question I'm asking is, what if each police agency that wanted a particular wiretap had to pay for it, being charged their share of the full social cost of forcing communication to be wiretap compatible?  Would they choose to buy such wiretaps, or would they find it more cost-effective to instead investigate crimes in other ways?\",\"Speech by Pete Worden                                                Delivered Before the U.S. Space Foundation Conference                                                             Colorado Springs, Colorado                                                                   April 15, 1993        What a delightful opportunity to cause some trouble.  For providing me this forum I would sincerely like to thank the U.S. Space Foundation.  My topic today is the Single Stage Rocket Technology rocket or SSRT.  By I intend to speak of more.  How to lower the cost and make rapid progress.  SSRT is to my mind -- and I hope to convince you -- the erupting a new rallying cry for our generation in space -- Faster, Cheaper, and Better.       Faster, Cheaper, Better and SSRT represent the passing of a torch from one technical generation to another.  It is a new thing to be sure -- but it is also a relearning of old things from past masters.       When we rolled out the SSRT baby two weeks ago, so called experts told us it violates the laws of physics -- it made no sense.  For example, Dr. Eberhart Rachtin - former president of the Aerospace Corp., said of SSRT in the L.A. Times that it, \\\"defies the best principles of launching payloads into space.\\\"  Well Dr. Rachtin -- you've made us mad!  What are these principles that SSRT defies?       Well I'll tell you.  It violates the principle that you need a giant program office to build space hardware.  It violates the \\\"fact\\\" that it takes 20 years to build something new.  And it violates the truism that you cant do anything significant for less than many billions of dollars.       It took some of the last generation's experts to teach us some new/old lessons.  Werhner Von Braun's first rocket was not a Saturn V.  General Schriever's ICBM's didn't take ten years to demonstrate.  And the X-1 airplane didn't cost $1 billion.       It took one of the great engineers of the 1950's to remind us of these truths -- Max Hunter.  Max, to remind you, was a senior engineer in the Thor IRBM program, and old faster, better, cheaper success story.  Max has been persistent in a vision of a single stage reusable space launch system since the 1960's.  Because he knew it had to be done in affordable steps - Build a little, Test a little.       Next he persuaded us to do a technology demonstration.  We didn't solicit a bunch of requirements -- they'd just change every few years anyway.  [ not included in the speech -- The ALS/NLS has such ephemeral requirements that it would better known as \\\"Shape Shifter\\\" than \\\"Space Lifter.\\\"  We didn't spend a lot money -- this X-Rocket only cost $60 million.  When's the last time we even built a new airplane for that?  And it didn't take a lot of time to build -- McDonnell Douglas completed it in 18 months.  Finally, the government program office consisted of one very over-worked Air Force Major -- motivated in part by the threat that he'd get to ride on it in a strapped-on lawn chair if it ran over cost or schedule.       As I described what SSRT is -- and isn't keep in mind its only a first step.  There are several more steps -- and steps that can easily fail -- before the U.S. can field an SSTO.  But each step should follow the same principles -- a small management team -- a few years technology demonstration -- and a modest budget.       Let me show a few details on SSRT and how it might evolve: (See charts)       I'm embarrassed when my generation is compared with the last generation -- the giants of the last great space era, the 1950's and 1960's.  They went to the moon - we built a telescope that can't see straight.  They soft-landed on Mars - the least we could do is soft-land on Earth!       But we do have an answer.  We can follow their build a little, test a little philosophy to produce a truly affordable and routine access to space.  I know there are nay sayers among you -- those who say SSRT is a stunt.  It needs more thermal protection, the engines are wrong, it would be better to land horizontally, etc, etc.       I say to you -- we'll see you at White Sands in June.  You bring your view-graphs, and I'll bring my rocketship.  If we do what we say we can do, then you let us do the next step.  [ not included in the speech:  If we fail -- you still have your program offices, staff summary sheets, requirement analyses, and decade long programs.]\",\"com    On a DA revolver, you get another try on a misfire.

If so, are you willing to share your config file and other tricks necessary to make it work?  Thanks for any information.\",\" I have the same problem.  I have looked at Motif++, WWL, InterViews, GINA++, and a few variations on the above.  I've also done a cursory examination of Rogue Wave's View.h++.  I like View.h++'s abstractions best of all of the toolkits I mentioned, but the resulting code looks little like Motif, and I have little confidence that this software will catch on or otherwise result in significant longevity for my code.  GINA++ allows you to write code which looks a great deal like Motif and also makes interesting use of inheritance, but the resulting code is almost too Motif-like, and is certainly not significantly less verbose than equivalent C code.  InterViews looks promising, but I haven't found a free version with Motif support, and I'm not confident how widely InterViews with Motif support will be adopted, and what (if any) specific Motif support will be available over time.  The other libraries produce code which is less Motif-like, but which does not make sufficient use of the features of C++ to simplify my coding task.  At this point, my inclination is to write my Motif manipulation routines in C, and invoke those routines from my C++ code using simple abstractions suited to my specific task.  Later, if OSF or some credible standards-setting body comes up with a C++ interface to Motif, I will change to that.  It does me no goo to write in C++ if my choice of interfaces leaves me with code which leaves me tied to an abstraction which is not consistent with the industry directions.  It's better to take a standard if inferior solution for now than to go with a slgihtly superior approach which will leave me with both useless code and useless skills a few years from now.  Views.h++ is the only library I'd consider right now, but in our environment, we'd end up spending nearly $5000 to use it, and I can't justify it when it's likely to cause short-term productivity decreases as we learn the new abstraction, and is unlikely to be a sufficiently long-lived solution for us to reap the benefits at the high end of the J curve.  - Brad\",\" How exactly would Ferreira accomplished this?

The article starts with \\\"A leader of the NASA team in charge of redesigning the planned space station said yesterday the job is tough and may be impossible.\\\" O'Connor is quoted saying whether it is possible to cut costs that much and still provide for meaningful research \\\"is a real question for me.\\\" O'Connor said \\\"everything is fair game,\\\" including \\\"dropping or curtailing existing contracts with the aerospace industry, chopping management of the space station program at some NASA facilities around the country, working closely with the Russian space station Mir, and using unmanned Titan rockets to supplement the manned space shuttle fleet.\\\"  O'Connor says his team has reviewed 30 design options so far, and they are sorting the serious candidates into three categories based on cost.  The Post says O'Connor described the design derived from the current SSF as a high cost option (I believe Kathy Sawyer, the Post writer, got confused here. I listened in on part of O'Connor's briefing to the press on Monday, and in one part of the briefing O'Connor talked about how the White House wants three options, sorted by cost [low, medium, and high]. In another part of the briefing, he discussed the three teams he has formed to look at three options [SSF derivative @ LaRC, modular buildup with Bus-1 @ MSFC, and Single Launch Core [\\\"wingless Orbiter\\\"] @ JSC. Later, in response to a reporters question, I thought I heard O'Connor say the option based on a SSF redesign was a \\\"moderate\\\" cost option, in between low & high cost options. Not the \\\"high cost\\\" option as Sawyer wrote).  The article goes on to describe the other two options as \\\"one features modules that could gradually be fitted together in orbit, similar to the Russian Mir. The other is a core facility that could be deposited in orbit in a single launch, like Skylab. That option would use existing hardware from the space shuttle - the fuselage, for example, in its basic structure.\\\"\",\"patrickd@wpi.WPI.EDU (Lazer) writes ...  Specs for the 68040 can fill a 500 page book.  Some highlights are... 32-bit address space w/ 32-bit data width.  18 32-bit integer registers  & 8 80-bit floating point registers.  8K copyback capable caches, 4-way set associative.  Typical 1.2 clocks/integer instruction.  5 clocks for a floating point multiply.  (interesting aside: the 68040 can multiply two 80-bit floating point numbers in less time than it can multiply two 32-bit integers)   More of the same but with multiple instruction dispatching.

Version 4.99c (actually beta v5.0) can be found anonymous ftp from hagar.ph.utexas.edu, in the pub/plplot  directory.    --Mark  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------    From the README file of version 4.99c:   This is the PLPLOT distribution.  PLPLOT is a scientific plotting package for  many systems, small (micro) and large (super) alike.  Despite its small size  and quickness, it has enough power to satisfy most users, including: standard  x-y plots, semilog plots, log-log plots, contour plots, 3D plots, mesh plots,  bar charts and pie charts.  Multiple graphs (of the same or different sizes)  may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each graph.  Different  line styles, widths and colors are supported.  A virtually infinite number of  distinct area fill patterns may be used.  There are almost 1000 characters in  the extended character set.  This includes four different fonts, the Greek  alphabet and a host of mathematical, musical, and other symbols.  The fonts  can be scaled to any size for various effects.  Many different output device  drivers are available (system dependent), including a portable metafile  format and renderer.   The PLPLOT package is freely distributable, but NOT in the public domain.  The PLPLOT source code, except header files and those files explicitly  granting permission, may not be used in a commercial software package without  consent of the authors.  You are allowed and encouraged to include the PLPLOT  object library and header files in a commercial package provided that: (1) it  is explicitly and prominently stated that the PLPLOT library is freely  available, and (2) the full copyrights on the PLPLOT package be displayed  somewhere in the documentation for the package.   We welcome suggestions on how to improve this code, especially in the form of  user-contributed enhancements or bug fixes.  If PLPLOT is used in any  published papers, please include an acknowledgment or citation of our work,  which will help us to continue improving PLPLOT.  Also, please remember that  as PLPLOT is not a commercial product, we cannot be expected to offer the  kind of support that a commercial product may.  There is great interest  in extending PLPLOT and fixing bugs, but the principal authors can only  afford to work on it part time.  Improvements will necessarily focus on  those which help us get our work done.   PLPLOT is written in C, enabling it to run on many platforms practically  without modification.  Fortran programs may use it transparently; stub  routines are provided to handle the C<->Fortran interface without any  modification of the user program.  C programs are required to include the  header file \\\"plplot.h\\\"; see the documentation for more details.   The main documentation for PLPLOT is in the doc/ directory in the form of  several TeX files; please consult this for additional information ('latex  plotdoc').  Unfortunately documentation tends to lag actual improvements to  the code, so don't be surprised if some known features are not explained  there.  Consult 'Changes.log' to see a list of recent changes.     At present, PLPLOT is known to work on the following systems:    Unix: SunOS    A/IX     HP-UX    Unicos    DG/UX    Ultrix    SysV    Linux    Amiga/Exec   MS-DOS   OS/2   NeXT   For more information on how to get or use PLPLOT on your system, see:   - appendices to the PLPLOT manual   - system-specific documentation in the appropriate sys/<system> directory.

Brian, why another excuse?    Peter wrote a bit of the Bible.  What Peter says about God is what the Bible says.      Consider the Bible a court recording.  Over the period of thousands of years, various people come up and testify of their experience with the living God.  Up comes Abraham the wealthy rancher.  Up comes Moses, once the high official of Egypt.  Up comes Elijah, a priest.  Up comes David, a mere shepherd who became King.  Up comes the pagan King  Nebuchanezzar.  Up comes the pagan King of Persia, Cyrus.  Up comes Nehemiah, cupbearer to the King of Persia.  Then Matthew, an IRS agent takes the stand.  Up comes Luke, an M.D.  Then Paul a Jew who use to kill Christians for fun.  Up comes John, a 17 year old boy.  Up comes Peter, a fishermen.  Up comes James, the brother of Jesus himself. Up comes hundreds of others.  You hear testimony from fishermen, IRS agents, priests, Kings.  The court hearing lasts thousands of years with people coming up and testifying about the God who calls himself \\\"I am.\\\"   While you are listening to all this stuff, you realize that King David could have never known John, Solomon could have never known Matthew, Nehemiah could have never known Peter.  You realize that all these people are independent witnesses, and so, you rule out collaboration.  Yet all of the witnesses tell of the same God.   Each testifier tells of his own experiences with the living God.  Each experience is different, but each experience has enough cross-over to unmistakenly reveal that each one of these people is talking about the very same God. What Daniel did not know about God, the 3rd Highest Official of Babylon, God revealed to John 600 years later--but with a different perspective.  No two testimonies are identical.  Each testimony dares to venture off what is already known.  Yet each witness's testimony, even though different from those prior, consistently describes harmoniously fitting facets of the character of the same God.    Now.  As we stare gazing at the computer, you got this seeming fanatic on the other end of the net, saying, I know this God  \\\"I am\\\".  He has revealed himself to me too.  He also calls himself Jesus (John 8:58). Please believe me.  I am telling the truth.  It is wonderful to know him.\",\"  Instead of reading between the lines, try to think a little bit.

When I installed NDW, it wanted to rem out the line that installed EP (EP /ON) and the command to invoke the Image utility. It replaced the Image command with a new image command that invokes the version of Image that came with NDW.  This makes sense, as presumably the Image version with NDW is newer than the one with NU.  It did not, however, install smartcan in the autoexec.  Now two questions:    1:  Will NU use the image data saved by the newer version of image invoked.        i.e. Are the two version of Image compatable?    2:  Will erase protect use the info from smartcan, and vice versa?

Other handgun designs don't have that property; if their trigger isn't pulled, the hammer can't hit the firing pin.   The breakdowns that I do have include the above category.  From them I can safely say that if Davis is right in ALL of his claims, a large negative number of people are killed by animals, because we know that the number of killings by wackos is reasonably large and that the number of accidents due to gun failures (which is a superset of the described circumstance) is near zero.

Have you ever asked a physically blind person why he or she follows a seeing eye dog? The answer is quite simple--the dog can see, and the blind person cannot.   I acknowledge, as a Christian, that I am blind.  I see, but I see  illusions as well as reality.  (Watched TV lately?) I hear, but I hear lies as well as truth.  (Listen to your  radio or read a newspaper.)  Remember, all that tastes well is not healthy.  So, I rely one the one who can see, hear, and taste everything, and knows what is real, and what is not. That is God.   Of course, you may ask, if I cannot trust my own senses, how do I know whether what I see and hear about God is truth or a lie.  That is why we need faith to be saved.  We must force ourselves to believe that God knows the truth, and loves us enough to share it with us, even when it defies what we think we know.  Why would He have created us if He did not love us  enough to help us through this world?   I also do trust my experiences to some extent.  When I do things that defy the seeming logic of my experience,  because it is what my Father commands me to do, and I see the results in the long term, I find that He has led me in the proper direction, even though it did not feel right at the time.  This is where our works as Christians are important:  As exercises of the body make the body strong, excercises of faith make the faith strong.     As for you, no one can \\\"convert\\\" you.  You must choose to follow God of your own will, if you are ever to follow Him.  All we as Christians wish to do is share with you the love we have received from God.  If you reject that, we have to accept your decision, although we always keep the offer open to you.  If you really want to find out why we believe what we believe, I can only suggest you try praying for faith, reading the Bible, and asking Christians about their experiences personally.  Then you may grow to understand why we believe what we do, in defiance of the logic of this world.

They may say they are \\\"Christian\\\" but do their actions speak differently?  Do you believe what everyone tells you?  I don't.  I came to believe in God by my own investigation and conclusions. And ultimately by my own choice.  Salvation, however, was granted only through the grace of God.   To be a Christian is to model oneself after Jesus Christ as implied by the very name Christian.  If you say you believe in your head but do not feel in your heart, what does that say of your belief?   White supremists and Neo-Nazis are NOT any brand of Christian.  \\\"If you hate your whom you can see then how can you love God whom you cannot  see?\\\"  What does this belief entail?  Believing in Christ and having your sins forgiven in His name does NOT give a Christian a free licence to sin.  To repent of a sin is to ask forgiveness of that sin and TRY NOT to do it again.  I am a Christian, but if you lump me in with racists and accuse me of being such, then are you not pre-judging me?  BTW, I am of Chinese racial background and I know what it is to be part of a visible minority in this country.  I don't think that I would be favourably looked upon by these White supremist \\\"Christians\\\" as you call them.  Anyone can say what they believe, but if they don't practice what they preach, then their belief is false.  Do you concur?    Nazis and racists in general are the ones that come to my immediate attention. What I believe is that such people may be using the bible to mask their racial intolerance and bigotry.  They can do as they do and hide behind Christianity but I tell you that Jesus would have nothing to do with them.   No arguement there.   The only point I'm trying to make is that those who call themselves Christian may not be Christian.  I ask that you draw your own conclusions by what they do and what they say.  If they are not modelled after the example of Jesus Christ then they are NOT Christian.  If they have not repented of their sins and accepted Jesus Christ as their personal Lord and Saviour then they are  NOT Christian.  These are the only criteria to being a Christian.

The point that Darren raises is a very Lutheran viewpoint.   While reason is a gift from God, it is also infected by sin. Yet we do not reject reason entirely--and neither, I think,  does Darren.  We need reason, as Darren himself has pointed out, to comprehend God's revelation of himself in the Bible. But reason alone is not sufficient to comprehend and believe the Word.  We need, first and foremost, faith.  For \\\"the sinful mind is hostile to God.  It does not submit to God's law, *nor can it do so*\\\"  (Romans 8:7).  Luther accepted Scripture as the sole means of revelation (\\\"Sola Scriptura\\\"), but accepted the necessity of the use of reason (with faith) in comprehending that revelation. Yet Luther also said, regarding baptism, \\\"But mad reason rushes forth, and, because Baptism is not dazzling like the works which we do, regards it as worthless.\\\" (Large Catechism, Fourth part, Baptism).  To make matters more complicated, Luther was the sort of theologian that many  people would describe as an `absolutist'.  I've seen him  described as a `take no prisoners' theologian.  We might conclude, given these observations, that Luther was inconsistent or mad.  And surely at least some have come to that conclusion.  But it might be useful to recall that Jesus was also called mad.  And Peter felt compelled to defend himself and the apostles against a charge of drunkenness on Pentecost.  So we as Christians ought to be careful about rejecting Luther (or others)  as mad.  Rather, we should imitate the Bereans, who examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true (Acts 17:11).  The basis for the confidence with which Luther, Peter, Paul, and many others preached the gospel was not just reason, but faith and the Holy Spirit.  This is not faith divorced from reason, but a faith that guides, informs, and uses reason.  The Spirit enables us to know the truth and to proclaim it boldly.  God does not want us to preach the message that \\\"I think that Jesus might have risen from the dead\\\" but rather \\\"I know that my redeemer lives!\\\"  (Job 19:25).  The Christian does not side with Pilate in saying \\\"What is truth?\\\" but rather follows Christ, who said, \\\"In fact, for this reason I was born, and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth.  Everyone on the side of truth listens to me\\\" (John 18:37).  We can know the truth because God has promised us that we can know the truth.  Jesus said, \\\"If you hold to my teachings, you are really my disciples.  Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free\\\" (John 8:31,32).  The Proverbs urge us \\\"Buy the truth, and do not sell it.\\\" (Pr 23:23). The Psalmist prayed \\\"Do not snatch to word of truth from my mouth\\\" (Ps 119:43).  Evidently he believed that the word of truth was in fact `in his mouth'.    Yet we do indeed appear arrogant if our claim to the truth is motivated by self-glorification.  But if we present the truth as the teachings of Scripture, revealed by the  Spirit, and not our own invention, and if we stand ready to be proved wrong on the basis of Scripture, as Luther did, then we are not arrogant, but humble.  We should humbly trust in God's promise of truth, just as we trust in his promise of forgiveness.  REXLEX> It is only because of God's own revelation that we can be  REXLEX> absolute about a thing.  Darren> But how far does that get you?  Once God's revelation stops, Darren> and your own reasoning begins, possibility for error appears.  I agree that we must make a distinction between the clear teachings of Scripture, and the products of our own reason--even when such reasoning is based on Scripture.  However I think I would draw the line of distinction more `reasonably'  :-)  and less `academically' than you would.  Darren> For example, let's suppose that our modern Bible translations Darren> include a perfect rendering of Jesus words at the Last Supper, Darren> and that Jesus said, exactly, \\\"This is my body.\\\"  Darren> We'll presume that what he said was totally without error and Darren> absolutely true.  What can we be certain of?  Not much.  Darren> At the moment he stops speaking, and people start Darren> interpreting, the possibility of error appears.  Did he mean Darren> that literally or not?  We do not have any record that he Darren> elaborated on the words.  Was he thinking of Tran- or Con- Darren> substantiation?  He didn't say.   Darren is almost at the point of making a very Lutheran statement about the Lord's supper.  The Lutheran approach is to say that if Jesus said, \\\"This is my body,\\\" then that is what we should believe.  Other interpretations are rejected simply because they are not taught in Scripture.  Recall that Jesus' words do not stand alone on this subject.  We also have Paul's words in 1 Corinthians 11:17-34,--in which he passed on to us, what he received from the Lord.  In particular he said, \\\"For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.\\\"  By these words we should believe that the bread that we eat in the Lord's Supper really is bread (as well as the Lord's body)--as our senses in fact tell us.  Does this *prove* that tran-substantiation is false?  I suppose someone could say that Paul spoke metaphorically of the Lord's body as bread, simply because that is the way the body appears when we eat it.  But this thought is found nowhere in Scripture.  So we reject it.  Thus the primary reason for rejecting tran-substantiation is not that we can prove it false, but that it is simply not found in Scripture.  [side remark] I've been told that the Lutheran doctrine on real presence is con-substantiation.  But it has been non-Lutherans who have told me this.  We tend not to use the word.  I almost think that this is used more by professors of comparative religion, who need labels to compare Catholic, Lutheran and Reformed teachings on the Lord's Supper.  But almost every church wants to call their own teaching \\\"real presence\\\" because that was the traditional teaching of  the church. [end side remark]  Darren> When Christians speak as if they believe their own reasoning Darren> can never lead them astray -- when we implicitly claim that we Darren> are infallible -- the non- Christians around us rarely believe Darren> that implicit claim.  Witnessing is hardly going to work when Darren> the person you are talking to believes that you are either too Darren> foolish to recognise your own limits, or intentionally trying Darren> to cover them up.  This is precisely why Christians should not rely on rationalizations in their witnessing.  It is far better to take the approach, \\\"I'd like to show you what Scripture says.

For example, incorrect English constructs such as \\\"its raining\\\" or \\\"it's window id\\\" annoy me. However, there comes a time when popular usage starts to dictate the way things really are in the world. Indeed, the fact that X won out over NeWS was really down to popular opinion (I know, we all think it's(!) technically superior as well!).  On a related topic, who is to say that \\\"color\\\" is more or less correct than \\\"colour\\\" - being Irish, and hence using English English as opposed to American English, I always use the latter except, of course, for API terms such as \\\"XAllocColor\\\" and \\\"colormap\\\".  In a world that uses the term \\\"Windows\\\" to refer to Microsoft Windows, perhaps the time has come to accept \\\"X Windows\\\" as a valid term for X. I think that this is a more concise and uncluttered term than, say, \\\"the X Window System\\\" and, let's face it, almost everyone uses it. Ultimately, we all need product sales to more than just X-literate people. In this respect, product recognition is important and a short, snappy, descriptive title (\\\"X\\\" is positively obscure) will help when dealing with the average punter (it's sad - I thought I was a software engineer!). Indeed it is unfortunate that X did not become popularly known as Windows and let MS worry about whether it should be called \\\"Microsoft Windows\\\" or \\\"the Microsoft Window System\\\" or how about just plain \\\"Microsoft\\\"!  To summarise (or should that be \\\"summarize\\\") the point of this message: I think there are far more pressing issues facing the X community than worrying about subtle distinctions in the naming of the window system (or should that be \\\"windowing system\\\"). Whatever gets recognised is fine by me. I agree that one should be careful in interpreting what trade papers say. However, I would be reluctant to come to this conclusion purely on the basis of how they name the X Window System. \",\"the blood of the lamb.

Thanks !  \",\"  Here at Lewis and Clark College we have recently installed a Digital Film system (based on the Mac Quadra) that does non-linear, full digital editing.  If you're considering such a system, here are the pros and cons:  For the educational environment, this system is excellent.  We use it to produce a variety of educational materials for disemination on our local network.  Because this programming is going to be viewed on other Macs, the image quality is not as important as the ability to directly export the video to the Net.  We also use it to produce orientiation and promotional video programs for use by the Lewis & Clark community.  Since these programs are not meant for commercial or broadcast use, image quality is not critical.  The Digital Film system, for those of you who are uninitiated, is an A/B roll digitizing system on one $5000 JPEG compression card.  It was promoted as an inexpensive online editing system with SVHS quality.  SuperMac, the maker of the card, is trying to achieve this quality level, but as yet, has been unable to deliver.  Our system produces \\\"near VHS\\\" quality at 30 fields per second (640x480 overscan).  The card repeats every other field to get 60 fields per second.  This results in a kind of Super 8 film look that some find distracting.  If you can get past this problem, you'll find the Adobe Premier editing  software quite enjoyable with which to work.  It produces thousands of different effects from crystalize filters to DVE transitions to color matting.  Because of its non-linear nature, editing is fast and easy.

The Giants are opening today in St. Louis.  luigi\",\" I am not an expert in the cryptography science, but some basic things seem evident to me, things which this Clinton Clipper do not address. The all pertain to opportunites for abuse, and conclusions based on what I have seen the membership of this group (except for two notable persons) agree to.  If anything bad is possible by the government in theory, it almost always ends up happening in fact.  So the key is to make abuse IMPOSSIBLE.  Question authority, and remember power DOES corrupt.  I think one has to regard this whole idea in the sense that it WILL be expanded to include other data forms, such as data transfer and stored data. and as such should be treated as if it were expanded (or such expansion will be almost impossible to stop, using Clipper as a precident). There was a hint of that in the proposal, remember.  That said, please bear with me, I am not very articulate, so I take more words to say what others could say much more briefly.  Thank you.   As I suggested this is NOW.  The hint is in the proposal that this or similar proposals are being considered for other forms of encryptions such as data transfer, data files, and such, largely dependent on how this thing is accepted or flies.  I think one would be wise to treat this in the manner one would when (not if) it gets expanded to other areas than cellular phones.  I think this is guaranteed to happen, if this proposal gets by.  Salami politics.  It has been and is used in several other areas, it is certain to be used here.  Government is not going to easily give up on the idea that they should be able to eavesedrop whenever they want to.  'Court order required' has proven to be a rather flimsy guarantee.  If the case warrants, they can always sieze the material, and force one to give the key, or sit in jail forever on periodically renewed contempt charges.  So it is not denying the justice system the information, nor the ability to lock someone up if guilty (or refuses to divulge the means to access the info - this is not protected under the Fifth - one can be forced to perform ACTS that would result in divulging incriminating evidence).  So, blocking restrictions on private encryption is not preventing LEGITIMATE law enforcement - it does make ILLEGITIMATE law enforcement a bunch more difficult.  Especially fishing expeditions without the target's knowlege.  Don't give up the right to be safe from that - that should be non-negotiable, and Clinton and Co. know it (which is probably why they quietly developed this thing, figuring if they get it this far, they can ram it on through).  How come those consulted could be roughly described as \\\"us insiders\\\"?  They cannot quietely IMPLIMENT it though, when they ban other schemes to ensure its exclusive use.  Hence the nice PR document to try and reassure everyone. Don't buy into it.  Has government really earned that kind of trust, past or future?  To be secure and free, one must keep government honest and the only way to do that is to make abuse IMPOSSIBLE, not 'unlikely' or 'difficult'.   So what?  One could use information gained by re-use of the keys (saved after the last case was finished) or other means (master key, backdoor, easily broken algorithm) to find other evidence which, given to a judge, would authorize a tap which wouldn't have been possible otherwise.  This has been the more common manner of abuse of wiretaps in the past...  For local cops, this might be workable to keep them honest, but the Feds have a workaround somehow, BET on it.  Does anyone really believe for example, that the government will use a scheme NSA cannot listen in on scanning for keywords - either easily defeated in realtime or via a 'master key'?  I sure don't.  This whole thing sounds like something to eliminate the need to use old-fashioned police work to build a case.  In the past, eavesdropping was rather easy (with or without a court order).  I think the Law Enforcement community has become a bit spoiled, and will resist changes that require them to revert to using old-fashioned detective work.  I just find it somewhat surprising coming from a bunch that cares so much about civil and individual rights, that \\\"puts people first\\\".  The question is \\\"put people first\\\" to WHERE?  With the innards not being revealed, how is one to be sure there DOESN'T exist a 'master key' for use by NSA, etc (so they can do their keyword scan, etc on conversations they routinely monitor, without a specific court order)?   Remember, the cellular phone limitiation is only TEMPORARY. Bet on it.  And so far I have not heard about police telling people that they have been tapped and nothing incriminating was found.  What is to keep them from simply keeping the keys on file for 'next time'? After awhile, they would have quite a collection.  Kept especially for folks they deem 'disruptive'.  And if they get only one key, that would reduce the search space a lot, unless it is an RSA scheme.  Remember Nixon years?  Need for court orders really slowed them down, didn't it?  And unless the escrow accounts are not government controlled (fat chance! I see one ending up being under, say Treasury, the other under Justice :-)) it could be worth some serious bucks to some folks to get keys to a competitor's Clinton Clipper (or descendent when this idea is expanded to be used for all non-government encryption).  Enough bucks would get one the keys or the innards for this algorithm.  Perhaps not an important concern, but given past government behavior and the other problems...   What will one do when it is expanded to data storage encryption?  You can BET that if Clipper is accepted, that will be next on the agenda. It is even hinted at in the proposal - read it carefully...  Expect the argumet \\\"well, if you got nothing to hide...\\\"  Fine. Then using that argument, one should not object to video cameras being installed in every room of one's home.  Granted - an exteme expansion of the idea but the principle holds.  Private stuff should remain private, even from a govt fishing expedition.  And laws/rules may change in the future as to 'safeguards'.  When it comes to the Fed Government, safeguards are pretty meaningless, if they want to do/get something.  Don't work so hard to give up some rather treasured rights, or establish bad precidents, please.  The price could be hell to pay, later.   People would fight laws forbidding more NOW, but in, say two years, because we have this 'crisis' situation which MUST be addressed by some 'drastic action', just this added reasonable restriction will only bother those who have someting to hide... etc.  Please don't buy into it.  If the Clinton Clipper is so very good, why not make its algrithm public so many people can exchange ideas and examine it, rather than a few isolated 'respected experts' (respected by whom?  for what?  Perhaps a certain professor who likes key banks would be one of the selected experts... this does seem to expand on some ideas the person was advocating, if I recall :-).  How would anybody know that what the experts examine is the same as what will end up being used in the Clipper Chip, if it is kept secret?   Perhaps the Clipper will use a crippled version (with a 'master key' provision), or features not present in the version subjected for study and evaluation by the experts.  And who chooses the expertes?  The government?  No conflict of interest there... :-)  And isn't it a REQUIREMENT for any decent encryption scheme that it NOT have its effectiveness reduced by having the algrorithm widely known? I was lead to believe that one should assume the other side has everything you have, except for the key(s)... I recall ideas presented to this group are rejected if a requirement exists the algorithm be secret...  Another question - since it is a safe bet this Clipper thing would not be used for government security, they are regarding it as not real secure but \\\"good enough\\\" for common folk.  I think I would like to see a full description (not a PR non-statement) of just what \\\"good enough\\\" means? I think when saying how strong it is, \\\"good enough\\\" really means \\\"not very\\\".  The excuse that other countries have these restrictions is not acceptable:  Other countries do not have our Bill of Rights and Constitution (which the people, not the governments, of those other countries often regard with envy - what we have as rights they have as revokable privileges).  And if we expect to retain those rights and protections, we must not allow them to be gutted because we just GOTTA have this thing to 'fight crime'.  We have allready have our Bill of Rights pretty much torn to shreds.  We should not permit more weakining for yet another 'noble cause', instead we should be trying to repair the damage.  Our crime problem may have a number of causes, but \\\"too many rights and safeguards\\\" is not a signifigant one.  A broken court system and poor police work are a much more signifigant cause as having \\\"too many rights\\\" (disregarding addressing the root causes for crime, etc).  BTW - those who suggest that this is just an attack on Clinton, believe this:  I would be going ballistic reagardless WHO seriously proposed this thing.  It is just another step in a gradual erosion of our rights under the Constitution or Bill of Rights.  The last couple of decades have been a non-stop series of end-runs around the protections of the Constitution.  It has to stop.

Normally, the older boards have a 8250 or 16450 UART on board. Those chips generate an IRQ for every char they received. The 16550 UART has an internal 16 byte buffer, so - with the right software installed - it generates an IRQ every 16 chars.    If you ran dos, you don't need a 16550, because dos runs only ONE task at a time and the whole cpu-power could be used for the transfer. But if you are running a multitasking OS such as OS/2, Unix, etc. ( windows ? :-) ), the cpu cannot work the whole time with one task.   The result are lost characters or broken transmissions because of timeouts.   NO. The only diffrence is that internal modems have the UART on board, whereas external modems are connected to the computer over a serial port which has the UART on board.

I tried using the following Xlib code :  XVisualInfo visual_info; int depth = 24; Colormap colormap; XSetWindowAttributes attribs; unsigned long valuemask = 0; Window *win; Xv_opaque frame;  win = xv_get(frame,XV_XID); XMatchVisualInfo(display,screen,depth,TrueColor,&visual_info);  /* So far so good */  colormap = XCreateColormap(display,win,visual_info,AllocNone);  /* It dies here with a BadMatch error :( */  attribs.colormap = colormap; valuemask |= CWColormap; XChangeWindowAttributes(display,w,valuemask,&attribs); XSetWindowColormap(display,win,colormap);   Am I using a completely wrong approach here ? Is it possible to set the depth and colormap for a window created by Xview ? What am I doing wrong ?  Thanks in advance for any help that I can get.

Anyway...)   The basis for our (the catholic church's) belief in the assumption of Mary, body and soul, into heaven is that, to put it simply, the apostles  and all the early generation Christians believed it.  In fact, throughout their ministry the apostles kept in close contact with Mary, and 11 of the 12 were present when she died.  Only Thomas was missing--when he arrived several days later, he asked to be shown her body, and moved with pity, Peter and several of the other apostles brought him to her tomb.  When they arrived the seal was still unbroken.  They broke the seal, entered, and the body was missing.  There was no sign that anyone had entered, forcibly or otherwise, and everything else was laid out exactly as it had been left.  The apostles present all believed that Mary was assumed into heaven--and the apostles TAUGHT this in their   preaching (of course, this does not appear in any of the texts currently  considered part of the bible, but it does appear in other writings left behind by several of them.)  Basicaly, as an apostolic church (ie. founded by the apostles), we believe that the teachings of the apostles, whether written down in the bible or written down in other sources, is true, providing that the authenticity of those other sources can be confirmed.  At least in the case of the assumption of Mary, the authenticity is quite clear.\",\" Could it be Public Missile, Inc in Michigan?  From the description of ad here, it sounds like they're talking about \\\"High Power Rocketry\\\", an outgrowth of model rocketry.  This hobby uses non-metallic structural compoments and commerically manufactured engines ranging in impulse classification from G to P.  The hobby has been flourishing from early 1980s and is becoming increasing popular. Technically this is not consider amateur rocketry.  Any rocket with a liftoff weight greater than 3.3 pounds OR using a total impulse of G or greater, REQUIRES an FAA waiver to launch. Typically, a group of people get an FAA waiver for specified period of time (ie week, weekend, etc.) at a designated site and time, and all of the launches are then covered under this \\\"blanket waiver\\\". There is also a \\\"High Power Safety Code\\\" which designates more specific rules such as launch field size, etc.  Finally, in order to purchase any of the larger (Class B) rocket  motors you need to certified through either the National Association of Rocketry or Tripoli Rocketry Association. Certification procedures require a demonstarted handling and \\\"safe\\\" flight at a total impulse level.

Except when someone else has cooked a meal for me, I only eat fruit, vegetables, and whole grain or bran cereals.  I estimate I only get about 5 to 10 percent of my calories from fat.  Very little sugar or salt.  Very high fiber.  Most Americans get about 10 grams.  25 to 35 are recommended.  I get between 50 and 150.  Sometimes 200.  (I've heard of people taking fiber pills.  It seems unlikely that pills can contain enough fiber to make a difference.  It would be about as likely as someone getting fat by popping fat pills.  Tablets are just too small, unless you snarf down hundreds of them daily.)  My \\\"clean your plate\\\" conditioning works *for* me.  Eating the last 10% takes half my eating time, and gives satiety a chance to catch up, so I don't still feel hungry and go start eating something else.  I don't eat when I'm not hungry (unless I'm sure I'll get hungry shortly, and eating won't be practical then).  I bike to work, 22 miles a day, year round.  Fast.  I also bike to stores, movies, and everywhere else, as I've never owned a car. I estimate this burns about 1000 calories a day.  It also helps build and maintain muscle mass, prevent insulin resistance (diabetes runs in my family), and increase my metabolism.  (Even so, my metabolism is so low that when I'm at rest I'm most comfortable with a temperature in the 90s (F), and usually wear a sweater if it drops to 80.)  Cycling also motivates me to avoid every excess ounce.  (Cyclists routinely pay a premium for cycling products that weigh slightly less than others.  But it's easier and cheaper to trim weight from the rider than from the vehicle.)  There's no question in my mind that my metabolism is radically different from that of most people who have never been fat.  Fortunately, it isn't different in a way that precludes excellent health.  Obviously, I can't swear that every obese person who does what I've done will have the success I did.  But I've never yet heard of one who did try it and didn't succeed.   I'm sure everyone's weight cycles, whether or not they've ever been fat. I usually eat extremely little salt.  When I do eat something salty, my weight can increase overnight by as much as ten pounds.  It comes off again over a week or two. --  Keith Lynch, kfl@access.digex.com\",\"I've never had quicken but I did use MYM in it's early days.

I would beg to differ with you here.  The properly-formed conscience can be trusted virtually ALL the time.  I am not so sure, though, about something so materialistic as the human brain.  Does that mass of tissue possess anything trustworthy?  Your observation would probably be valid if we were discussing the \\\"mind\\\" of an animal, but the human being is only half animal, as it were; and half spiritual.   ?At the moment he stops speaking, and people start interpreting, the ?possibility of error appears.  Did he mean that literally or not?  We do ?not have any record that he elaborated on the words.  Was he thinking of ?Tran- or Con- substatiation?   He didn't say.  We interpret this passage ?using our brains; we think and reason and draw conclusions.  But we know ?that our brains are not perfect: our thinking often leads us wrong.  (This ?is something that most of us have direct experience of.  8-)  Now you have hit on the purpose of the Church.  It is by necessity the infallible interpreter of divine revelation.  Without the Church,           Christianity would be nothing more than a bunch of little divisive sects.   ?Unless you are infallible, there are very few things you can be certain ?of.  To the extent that doctrines rely on fallible human thinking, they ?cannot be certain.  This argument of yours regarding the certainty of an observation or a conclusion is not necessarily substantiated by experience.  It reminds me of the theoretical physicist who said that you can never be certain of a measurment because the sensor interferes with the field you are trying to measure.  Now, the experimental physicist will reply that although the measurement can never be made with absolute certainty, he is able to determine the certainty with which the measurement can be made, and this knowledge is often sufficient to render the measurement useful enough to allow evidence of the true condition of the field under observation. Therefore, although our minds are finite and susceptible to error, our competence in arriving at inductive insights gives confidence in our ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true, even in areas not subject to the experimental method.   ?Darren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu ?\\\"If any substantial number of  [ talk.religion.misc ]  readers read some ?

I pointed out that I did, in fact, agree that both Robert Weiss and Jim Meritt took quotes out of context.  Hence, I find it difficult to understand why Jim thinks I am a hypocrite.  Needless to say, I don't have time to reply to *every* article on t.r.m. that takes a quote out of context.

Taking quotes out of context isn't a crime.  I don't have time to read every article on t.r.m., and I'm certainly under no obligation to reply to them all.

Unless I am badly mistaken, Rohit is suggesting that protecting boys from men is different than protecting girls from men. There are situations in which boys and girls are apart from members of the *opposite* sex (due to social convention or whatever) and thus are safe (in at least some sense). These same situations don't (necessarily) protect the children from abuse by members of the *same* sex.  If we can understand that, it's not such a tremendous leap to suggest that if we all think about it hard, *someone* may come up with a practical solution (or even a partial solution) to some of the situations in which children are made vulnerable to homosexuals who wish to abuse them. By working together \\\"with good will on both sides\\\", we may be able to start solving problems without restricting anyone's freedoms.  Mr. Walz on the other hand is using Rohit's post as an excuse for personal attacks on Mr. Cramer. While Mr. Walz hasn't (by a *long* stretch) been the only one to flame Mr. Cramer, it is no less childish and it only serves to weaken any other arguments he may make in the future. \",\"  Not that new.  20 years ago, we had drug addicts harboring active TB that was resistant to everything (in Chicago).  The difference now is that such strains have become virulent.  In the old days, such TB was weak.  It didn't spread to other people very easily and just infected the one person in whom it developed (because of non-compliance with medications).  Non-compliance and development of resistant strains has been a problem for a very long time.  That is why we have like 9 drugs against TB.  There is always a need to develop new ones due to such strains.  Now, however, with a virulent resistant strain, we are in more trouble, and measures to assure compliance may be necessary even if they entail force.  --  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gordon Banks  N3JXP      | \\\"Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and geb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon.\\\" \",\"I want to get rid of alot of comics that I have.

A button widget, when pressed, will cause a new item to be drawn in the Window.  This action clearly should not call XCopyArea()  (or equiv) directly; instead, it should register the existence of the new item in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler that handles \\\"regular\\\" expose events (e.g. window manager-driven exposures) take care of rendering the new image.  Using an expose event handler is a \\\"proper\\\" way to do this because at the time the handler is called, the Xlib Window is guaranteed to be mapped.  The problem, of course, is that no expose event is generated if the window is already visible and mapped.  What we need to do is somehow \\\"tickle\\\" the Window so that the expose handler is hit with arguments that will enable it to render *just* the part of the window that contains the new item.\",\"...

That's a pretty harsh assumption to make about a several million Christians world wide.  Sure, there are some who want glory for themselves who speak in tounges, just as there are among those who do not have this gift.  There were people like this in the Corinthian church also.  that does not mean that there is no true gift or that all who speak in tounges do it for their own glory in the sight of men.

I would just add to Phil's very infomative discussion the following caveat: the fifth amendment applies ONLY in crinial cases.  (\\\"...nor shall any person . . . be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself...\\\"). Thus if the father sued for custody of the children, the case would be civil and the defendant mother would not have fifth amendment protection. Oddly enough, her refusal to give information in a civil case can lead to criminal contempt charges (thus landing her in jail.)  The interesting part of all this is that in a murder trial, the woman CAN plead the fifth as  to the location of the child--this is routine.  A \\\"computer crime\\\"  prosecution thus would seem to be fertile ground for this kind of defense,  where a suit by a party injured by \\\"hackers\\\" would not.  If I am accused,  for example, of sending encrypted kiddie porn over the nets the fifth should  protect my key.  If I am accused of sending copyrighted material, however, it proabably will not (copyright infringement not being a \\\"crime\\\" in the technical sense.)  The REALLY tricky question is, say I do both (naughty boy that I am) can the government use the information gained in the civil trial (ie. my key) to gain access to my files for use in the criminal prosecution.

They promptly went to sleep and barely held on for a 6-5 victory that nearly slipped away at the buzzer. Tampa's Bob Beers tipped in a pass from Shawn Chambers, but officiating supervisor John D'Amico and video goal judge Rich Schweigler ruled that the shot had gone into the net after time had expired.  ``I'm glad I didn't see it go in at the end,\\\" Blues coach Bob Berry said.  If the goal had counted, he'd have been more upset than he was by the Blues' disappearance in the final 24 minutes. Holding on for the victory and making the playoffs tempered Berry's anger.  ``It wasn't pretty at the end,\\\" he said. ``We played 36, 37 great minutes, as good as we played all year. It slipped away at the end. It shouldn't have, but it did.\\\"  Still, the Blues won, prompting another ovation from the crowd at game's end. Despite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil this season, the Blues still made the playoffs. They'll meet the Chicago Blackhawks in a best-of-seven Norris Division semifinal, beginning at noon Sunday at Chicago Stadium.  The Blues finished the regular-season with a record of 37-36-11 for 85 points, their fourth consecutive plus-.500 season. Minnesota finished three points behind in fifth place, with a record of 36-38- 10 for 82 points. Tampa Bay, which played spoiler last week by tying the Blues 2-2 at Tampa, ended its first season with a record of 23-54-7 for 53 points.  The poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyous Blues locker room. Instead, the mood was one of relief and some disappointment.  ``It's a shame we let down,\\\" said Kevin Miller, one of three Blues to score two goals. Brendan Shanahan and Bob Bassen were the others. ``There was no need for a letdown. If we'd have kept working, it would have ended 6-2 and everyone would be happy.\\\"  Instead, a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs. ``We won, and that's all that matters,\\\" said Brett Hull, scoreless and minus-3 for the night. ``Once we got up 4-0, it was really tough to play.\\\"  Some players didn't have a problem.  ``Just because the score was announced, our line didn't quit,\\\" said Rich Sutter, who played with Bassen and Miller. ``We still had a game to play. You can't allow five goals like we did, that's not right.  ``It was disappointing to see what was going on.\\\"  Bassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the Blues' effort. Somehow, he missed the announcement of Minnesota's loss.  ``I didn't know it was final,\\\" he said. ``I was kind of looking around on the bench. I didn't realize it was a final for some reason. We're in the playoffs, and that's great, but it's a little disappointing to play like we did at the end.\\\"  The letdown was precisely the reason that Berry had instructed the scoreboard operators to keep the Minnesota-Detroit score off of the board. The score showed 0-0 until it first popped up with Detroit leading 4-2 in the third period. The Blues already led 4-0 at the time.  ``I told them I didn't want to see the score, I didn't want to know the score,\\\" Berry said. ``I felt we had to win the game, and that's the approach we took.\\\"  If Minnesota took a lead, Berry feared, the pressure of having to win might bother the Blues. If Detroit led, he worried, the Blues might quit.  Until the announcement, the Blues played splendidly. Shanahan got the crowd going at 10:44 of the first period, scoring his 50th of the season. Then, Miller and Bassen took charge late in the period.  With the teams playing four on four, Miller broke in on left wing, deked defenseman Roman Hamrlik and beat former Blues goalie Pat Jablonski with the rebound of his own shot with 21.6 seconds remaining in the period.  Then, just 10.5 seconds later, Bassen rifled a long slap shot past Jablonski after defenseman Rick Zombo intercepted a Tampa pass in the neutral zone.  Bassen made it 4-0 just 14 seconds into the second period, scoring on the  rebound of Bret Hedican's shot. The goal gave him his first two-goal game of the season and reminded him of a special friend.  Last year, Bassen befriended young Oliver Mulvihill, who died of a rare form of cancer at age 6 on Feb. 23.  ``I was thinking of my buddy Oliver,\\\" Bassen said. ``He's in heaven now, and I know he was watching. I know he's happy.\\\"  Miller increased the Blues lead to 5-0 on a break-away goal set up by Zombo at 11:09. Then, Steve Maltais broke Curtis Joseph's shutout just 18 seconds later, making it 5-1.  Less than a minute after the North Stars' final was announced, Tim Bergland scored and cut the lead to 5-2. But Shanahan scored his 51st, converting a pass from Nelson Emerson with 21.3 seconds remaining in the  second period.  Then, it was all Lightning. Adam Creighton scored 40 seconds into the third period, prompting Berry to rest the overworked Joseph. Guy Hebert allowed goals to Shawn Chambers and Danton Cole in a span of 1:21 midway through the third period.  The goals by Chambers and Cole made Shanahan's second goal stand up as the winner. ``We were in there,\\\" Shanahan said. ``The game was over. We were in.\\\"\",\"Was the ABC coverage of the Kings/Flames game supposed to be the way it was shown in BC with CBC overriding the ABC coverage?

VESA-compliant applications should have no trouble setting these modes. (But I'm forwarding your posting to our Software group, just in case.  Can't be too careful.)  Not that I doubt that YOUR applications are failing to run; lots of stuff depends on figuring out which exact SVGA they're looking at, and don't use VESA calls (VESA is still pretty new). Every new chip set confuses them.   I think we go to AT LEAST 76 Hz at 1024x768x8, and maybe more (and it's a function of the RAMDAC speed, not the Power 9000). We need to fix the problems you've noted (they were already on the list).  If you're really interested, though, take a look at the text file P9000RES.DAT, which holds the data from which the choices in the P9000 monitor installation program are built.  Working by analogy, you can build up a new monitor definition that has the right combinations of refresh rates for your monitors.  Keep a backup copy of the file!  Once you've built a new version of the P9000RES.DAT file, run the P9000 installation program, INST, and your new choices should show up.  (This assumes you have the WEITEK v. 2.2 drivers. You can tell the rev number by looking at the modification time of the driver: 02:20 is version 2.20.  Microsoft uses this gimmick, too.)   The SPEEDY benchmark was put out by Hercules and IIT, who to my knowledge were unencumbered by any motivations except making the Hercules Graphite/IIT AGX014 card look really good.  So I'd take the numbers with a ton of salt. (Texas Instruments did the same thing with WINTACH, trying to make the 34020 look good compared to the 8514, as if anyone cared.)  It's safer (though not safe) to use benchmarks from \\\"unbiased\\\" sources, such as testing labs, columnists, etc.    I think you'll a large discrepancy between the results of SPEEDY and the results of anything else in the universe on these things.   Font caching is a perfectly legitimate optimization -- Windows has hooks for it built right into the GDI.  What's kind of silly is IIT's use of a hardwired \\\"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog then sat on a tack\\\" string in their driver.  Not only is it useless in real applications, it lacks the programming elegance of the \\\"Bart Simpson optimization,\\\" in which you save the bitmap of the most-recently drawn string in off-screen memory, and just do a screen-to-screen bitblit if you happen to be given that same string a second time in a row.  (We call it the \\\"Bart Simpson optimization\\\" because Bart's the only person we can see benefiting from it: he could right \\\"I will not cheat on benchmarks\\\" a hundred times and be done in half the time it would take to actually form each character.)

Neil Smith                             WEIRD SCIENCE  Everyone knows how to tell when a politician is lying:  his lips  move.  What may not be equally obvious is that there are  politicians and then there are politicians -- and that the phrase  \\\"political science\\\" is subject to more than one interpretation.    Years ago, we heard how \\\"scientists\\\" were worried that a new Ice  Age might be coming, and later on that \\\"nuclear winter\\\" -- smoke  and dust thrown into the atmosphere by full-scale international  unpleasantness -- was a possibility.  Something like that may even  have killed the dinosaurs.    What we didn't hear was that no actual data supported any of this,  that real-world events (the burning of Kuwaiti oil fields) tended  to discredit it, that mostly it was propaganda meant to weaken  values that made America the most successful culture in history,  and that the dinosaurs probably died of something like the Plague  when continents drifted together, exposing them to new germs.    We miss a lot like this, unless we listen closely.  Prince William  Sound, site of the famous oil spill, and Mount St. Helen's weren't  supposed to recover from their respective disasters for at least  100 years.  That turned out not to be true, although you'd never  know it from watching network nightly news or CNN.  It doesn't fit  their agenda to inform us that the earth is vast and resilient, and  that nature is rougher on herself than we could ever be.    But for once, the media aren't entirely to blame.  As ignorant of  science as they are of everything, they trust \\\"scientists\\\" to  unscrew the inscrutable.  The trouble is that today's \\\"scientists\\\"  have agendas of their own.    Nobody in government, that wellspring of scientific wherewithal, is  going to offer grants to an investigator who states truthfully that  there is no respectable evidence for \\\"global warming\\\".  The money  and power for bureaucrats and politicians lie in mass transit, and  they hate the automobile -- blamed as a major cause of the mythical  crisis -- as a source of privacy and freedom they find intolerable.    The same appears true of \\\"acid rain\\\", a deliberate hoax cooked up  by the Environmental Protection Agency (which hates private  industrial capitalism almost as much as it does your car) and  foisted on real scientists through trickery which has depended on  specialists in different fields not talking to each other much.    The list goes on, always with a common, disreputable thread.   \\\"Ozone depletion\\\", for which evidence is even more suspect and  contradictory than for acid rain or global warming, is no more than  a last, desperate attempt to indict private capitalism in an era  when state central planning and the command economy have failed and  can only find this final, withered leg to teeter on.    Decades of anti-nuclear alarmism, resting on foundations of myth  and panic-mongering, have failed to erase the fact that nuclear  power is the safest, cleanest, most efficient source of energy  known to mankind -- and more to the point, that the greater amount  of energy there is available to any individual in society, the  freer that individual -- and his society -- become.    Honest studies on the effects of individual gun ownership and  self-defense on crime -- conducted by investigators who began as  ideological opponents to those concepts, but which show massive  reductions in the latter to be the result of the former -- have  been suppressed, most recently by the California state government.    And what the media didn't say about recent EPA \\\"discoveries\\\" on the  effect of \\\"secondhand smoking\\\" is that, although some harm to non- smokers may have been detected, it was less (by an order or two of  magnitude) than that associated with frying bacon a couple times a  week or keeping a pet bird.  It's enough to make you wonder whether  there was ever anything to the claim that smoking causes cancer.    That, of course, is the real threat represented by politically  correct science.  The world is a dangerous place.  It would be nice  to know the hazards.  I've never believed smoking to be a healthy  practice, but, given a lack of credibility on the part of today's  science, how am I to decide what to do about it?  Nicotine is  highly addictive, to that much I can attest from experience.  Yet  the stress of quitting may be riskier than to continue.  There  isn't any way to tell, thanks to the corrupting influence of  government money on the scientific establishment.    Two centuries ago, the Founding Fathers spared us certain agonies  to which every other nation in the world has been subject at one  time or another, by creating a legal barrier between politics and  religion.  Each time some short-sighted individual or group has  tried to lower the barrier (most recently over the issue of  abortion), blood -- real human blood, hot and smoking in the street  -- has wound up being shed.    Real human blood is being shed over scientific issues, as people's  lives are ruined through the loss, to agencies like the EPA, of  livelihood, or property it may have taken a lifetime to accumulate,  to diseases caused by toxins associated with burning fossil fuels  for electrical power, or thanks to bans on things like cyclamates,  when they die from the effects of obesity.    What we need now, if we hope to survive as a civilization for two  more centuries, is another barrier, a Constitutional separation of  state and science -- including medicine.  Knowledge is valuable;  real science won't languish for lack of funding.  The money will  simply come from contributors unwilling to pay for lies, and  everyone will benefit.    L.

I'm not sure if the cd's are good, since I've only had the drive a little less than a month and had the cd's shipped to my home address in california instead of here in maryland.  The CD-technology drive has a separate power supply separated from the drive, which supposedly gives it a longer life, and keeps it cleaner with no fan to attract dust.  A Toshiba brand drive is also available, but I think the CD-Technology is better, since you get the same mechanism, and at a slightly lower price with two free CDs.  The Apple 300/330i Drive, Sony Mechanism, is around a 300ms access time I think, and a data transfer rate of 300Kb/sec.  I know it is the slowest of the three mentioned here.  It is not widely available, except through the apple catalog, which is bad at a price of only $599.  It is also multi-session photo cd compatible. I think the external model comes with 7 free cds, some of which are pretty good.  The NEC drive has been out the longest.  it has an access time of 280ms and a data transfer rate of 300Kb/sec.  it is available from many vendors around $600 dollars, including Educorp.  It wasn't multi-sesssion photo-cd compatible before, but I hear that the current version that is shipping is.  Owners of the older drives can get an upgrade.  It does not come with any free cd's unless you buy it in a bundle.  Of the three CD-Rom drives above, i think the best choices would be the Apple drive and the CD-technology(toshiba) drive.  The apple drive for it's compatibility with apple products and the cd-technology(toshiba) for it's speed and performance.   BTW, the models of the drives are:  Apple: AppleCD 300 or AppleCD 300i (internal)  CD-Technology:  CD-T3401 (the Toshiba brand name model I'm not sure, but it is also something like with 3401)  NEC:  CDR-74   I'm very happy with my drive.

A car bomb blew up in Tyre, killing 10 people and wounding  75. A man was killed and five others seriously wounded in an explosion in  Nabatiye. ---   An Israeli navy patrol boat attacked and sank a rubber guerrilla boat off  southern Lebanon early today, killing the two men aboard, the army command  said.         It said in a communique that a Dvora patrol boat opened fire on the  motorized rubber dinghy north of Tyre after identifying it as hostile. The army  said no one on the Israeli boat was injured. The affiliation of the slain  guerrillas was not immediately known. ---   Rival factions of the guerrilla group led by terrorist mastermind Abu Nidal  battled Sunday in Tyre, Lebanon, with machine guns and rocket-propelled  grenades, killing at least four people and wounding 15, police said. ---  Lebanon's mainstream Shiite Muslim militia said Thursday that it had  uncovered a network of tunnels in a southern Lebanese village where it said pro- Iranian kidnappers had held Western hostages.         Officials of the militia, Amal, led local journalists through the catacomb- like alleys and showed them two cells with iron doors at the village,  Kawthariyet al Siyad, near Tyre, the ancient port city, about 40 miles south of  Beirut.

Higgins was detained there shortly after he was seized by gunmen on a road  outside Tyre in February 1988. -------------- ...anyway, I counted 20 articles during these 3 years of reporting. I also found out the possible reason why the numbers for the inhabitants of the city is defined between 14000 and 24000. It seems that Tyre is one of the places where people from Libanon flee to during more extensive bombings, so there's a constant flow of refugees entering and leaving Tyre (articles mentioned thousands of people entering and leaving this place).  I counted 0 articles for my home town, Kristinestad, so from now I will consider this place to be a fishing village :-).  Cheers, Kent \",\"    There is a library of map projections in:      charon.er.usgs.gov  in\",\" My votes (FWIW):  Team MVP: Pat Verbeek. He fans on 25% of goal mouth feeds, but he still has  36 goals after a terrible start and has been an examplary (sp?) team captain throughout a tough couple of seasons. Honorable mention: Nick Kypreos and Mark Janssens. Probably more appropriate in the unsung heroes category than MVP, but Kypreos (17 goals, 320+ PIM) has been the hardest working player on the team and Janssens is underrated as a defensive center and checker. I guess I place a greater emphasis on hard work than skill when determining value.  Biggest surprise: Geoff Sanderson. He had 13 goals and 31 points last season as a center, then moved to left wing and has so far put up 45 goals and 80+ points. He now has a new Whaler record 21 power play goals, most all coming from the right wing faceoff circle, his garden spot. Honorable mention: Andrew Cassels and Terry Yake. The kiddie quartet of Sanderson, Poulin, Nylander, and Petrovicky have been attracting the most attention, but Cassels is just 23 and will score close to 90 points this season. He has quite nicely assumed the role of number one center on the team and works very well with Sanderson. Yake bounced around the minors for a number of seasons but is still 24 and will put up about 20 goals and 50 points this season. Yake, like Sanderson, started performing better offensively once he was converted from center to wing,  although lefty Sanderson went to the left wing and righty Yake went to the right side.  Biggest disappointment: Hands down, John Cullen. Cullen had a disasterous 77 point season last year, his first full season after The Trade. Cullen started the season off of summer back surgery, and fell flat on his face (appropriate, since he spent all of his Whaler career flat on his ass, and whining about it). Cullen scored just 9 point on 19 games, was a clubhouse malcontent, commanded the powerplay to a 9% success percentage (>21% with Sanderson), and sulked his way out of town. Worst of all, his 4 year, $4M contract had three years left to run, so no one would give up any more than the 2nd round draft pick the  Maple Leafs offered to Hartford. Honorable mention: Steve Konroyd, also subpar after signing a 3 year, $2.1M contract; Eric Weinrich, who showed flashes of competence, but overall has played poorly; Jim McKenzie, who was a much better hockey player two seasons ago than he is now; and Frank Pietrangelo, who only seemed to play well when Sean Burke was out for an extended period and he got to make a number of starts in a row.\",\"We need a good concave ->convex polygon conversion routine.

Maybe I've misjudged you, Russell.  Anyone who agrees with something  I say can't be all bad.  ;-)  Seriously, I'm not sure whether I misjudged you or not, in one respect.   I still have a major problem, though, with your insistence that science  is mainly about avoiding mistakes.  And I still disagree with your  contention that nobody who doesn't use methods deemed \\\"scientific\\\"  can possibly know what's true and what's not.     Okay, so let's see if we agree on this: FIRST of all, there are degrees  of certainty.  It might be appropriate, for instance, to demand carefully  controlled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth (to the  extent that there is any such thing) the effectiveness of a certain  treatment. On the other hand, highly favorable clinical experience, even  if uncontrolled, can be adequate to justify a *preliminary* judgement that a treatment is useful.  This is often the best evidence we can hope for from investigators who do not have institutional or corporate support. In this case, it makes sense to tentatively treat claims as credible but to reserve final judgement until establishment scientists who are qualified and have the necessary resources can do more careful testing.  SECONDLY, it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of  evidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal.     I come to this dispute about what science is  not only as a mathematician but as a veteran of many arguments in sci.psychology (and occasionally in sci.med) about NLP (Neurolinguistic Programming).  Much of the work done to date by NLPers can be better categorized as informal exploration than as careful scientific research.  For years now I have been trying to get scientific and clinical psychologists to just take a look at it, to read a few of the books and watch some of the videotapes (courtesy of your local university library).  Not for the purpose of making a definitive judgement, but simply to look at the NLP methodology (especially the approach to eliciting information from subjects) and look for ideas and hypotheses which might be of scientific interest.  And most especially to be aware of the *questions* NLP suggests which might be worthy of scientific investigation.  Over and over again the response I get in sci.pychology is  \\\"If this hasn't been thoroughly validated by the accepted form of empirical research then it can't be of any interest to us.\\\"    To me, the ultimate reducio ad absurdum of the extreme \\\"There've got to be controlled studies\\\" position is an NLP technique called the Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure.  Simple phobias (as opposed to agoraphobia) may not be the world's most  important psychological disorder, but the nice thing about them is that  it doesn't take a sophisticated instrument to diagnose them or tell  when someone is cured of one.  The NLP phobia cure is a simple  visualization which requires less than 15 minutes.  (NLPers claim that it can also be used to neutralize a traumatic memory, and hence is useful in treating Post-traumatic Stress Syndrome.)  It is essentially a variation on the classic desensitization process used by behavioral therapists.  A subject only needs to be taken through the technique once (or, in the case of PTSD, once for each traumatic incident).  The process doesn't need to be repeated and the subject doesn't need to practice it over again at home.  Now to me, it seems pretty easy to test the effectiveness of this cure.  (Especially if, as NLPers claim, the success rate is extremely high.)   Take someone with a fear of heights (as I used to have).  Take them up  to a balcony on the 20th floor and observe their response.  Spend 15  minutes to have them do the simple visualization.  Send them back up to  the balcony and see if things have changed.  Check back with them in a  few weeks to see if the cure seems to be lasting.  (More long term  follow-up is certainly desirable, but from a scientific point of view  even a cure that lasts several weeks has significance.  In any case,  there are many known cases where the cure has lasted years.  To the best  of my knowledge, there is no known case where the cure has been reversed  after holding for a few weeks.)  (My own cure, incidentally, was done with a slightly different NLP technique, before I learned of the Fast  Phobia/Trauma Cure.  Ten years later now, I enjoy living on the 17th floor of my building and having a large balcony.)    The folks over in sci.psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to make this simple test.  They claim that only an elaborate outcome study will be satisfactory --- a study of the sort that NLP practitioners,  many of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice, can ill  afford to do.  (Most of them are also just plain not interested, because  the whole idea seems frivolous.  And since they're not part of the scientific establishment, they have no tangible rewards to gain  from scientific acceptance.)   The Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure is over ten years old now and the clinical  psychology establishment is still saying \\\"We don't have any way of  knowing that it's effective.\\\"    These academics themselves have the resources to do a study as elaborate  as anyone could want, of course, but they say  \\\"Why should I prove your  theory?\\\"  and  \\\"The burden of proof is on the one making the claim.\\\"   One academic in sci.psychology said that it would be completely  unscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn't  been described in a scientific journal.  (It's described in a number of  books and I've posted articles in sci.psychology describing it in as much  detail as I'm capable of.)    Actually, at least one fairly careful academic study has been done (with  favorable results), but it's apparently not acceptable because it's a doctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal.  To me, this sort of attitude does not advance science but hinders it.   This is the kind of thing I have in mind when I talk about \\\"doctrinnaire\\\"  attitudes about science.    Now maybe I have been unfair in imputing such attitudes to you, Russell.   If so, I apologize.    -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems  less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \",\"       Yes, please create the group alt.raytrace soon!!

Email me if you want to see the results.\",\"Having read the posted long article by JPFO, I have some observations:  1.  This article does NOT claim that the GCA of 1968 is a \\\"verbatim  translation\\\" of a Nazi law.  What it says is that in another place -- the book they're talking about -- they compare the two things section by section.  The implication is that the similarities are devastating. In the next sentence, they talk about how in that book they reproduce  the German text of the Nazi law, together with its translation.  Not  surprisingly, a reader could easily conflate these two things into a  single idea:  that the American GCA is a literal translation of the Nazi law; and sure enough, that's what the whole thing has mutated into,  urban-folklore style.  2.  The article goes to great pains to establish that Senator Dodd had a  copy of the Nazi law, either from his time on the Nurnberg prosecution  team or later.  This fact is considered highly incriminating, but I don't  understand why.  The author repeats several times that he is simply unable  to imagine how anyone could come into possession of the original text; and  yet in a paragraph towards the end, he explains it perfectly:  \\\"If Dodd got his copy of the original German text of the Nazi Weapons Law during his time at Nurnberg, it likely was part of a collection of documents, for example, issues of the Reichsgesetzblatt [the German law registry].\\\"  Bingo.  Exactly.    Dodd had a *book*, with a series of Nazi laws in it, including the one under discussion.  All of the stuff about \\\"Why would a U.S. congressman have a copy of a Nazi law?\\\" melts away, by the author's admission.  He then continues:  \\\"But if he acquired the original German text of the  Nazi Weapons Law after his service at Nurnberg, he must have done so  for a very specific reason...\\\"  But there's absolutely no reason to  think that this is the case.  In fact, as a \\\"senior member of the U.S.  team that helped to prosecute Nazi war criminals\\\", it seems to me that he would have *had* to have a copy.  All arguments about whether  the Nazi Weapon Law is really of historical interest (as it obviously is, certainly according to the author here), or whether Dodd personally prosecuted the Interior Minister who signed it, can be put aside as red  herrings.  3.  Having established that Dodd owned a copy of the original German text, the JPFO article then tries to draw sinister implications from the fact that he  asked to have it translated.  The problem is, in the context of the charge  levelled at Dodd, these two things work *against* each other.  People ask  to have things translated when they *don't know what they mean*.  If Dodd  took it upon himself to preserve the Nazi law with idea of someday introducing  it into American law, surely by 1968 he would have know what it *meant*,  wouldn't he?     Anyway, this precise charge -- the main one that I questioned in an earlier posting -- is just silly.  Why would Dodd need the exact translation for this purpose?  Is the idea that the gun controllers, despite being presumably bent on disarming the populace with the goal of eventually destroying all civil liberties, needed a crib sheet?  Didn't they have any idea how to do it on their own?     Once again, the author provides a perfectly acceptable answer to his own question: \\\"Dodd may have offered his copy of the Nazi Weapons Law to show that the specific proposal did not resemble anything in the  Nazi law.\\\"  In fact, since the law and its translation *were* entered into the Congressional Record, under the heading of documents \\\"concerning the history of Nazism and gun confiscation\\\", Dodd's motivation isn't a  mystery:  he asked for the translation in order to put it in the CR.  4.  Even this article makes it clear that the part of the Nazi law that was added *by* the Nazi regime is only a small part of that law.   Registration of guns, for instance, was begun in 1928, and thus NOT a \\\"Nazi-inspired\\\" idea.  The parts of the Nazi law that parallel the  1968 GCA include handgun control of some sort, and the identification  of certain weapons as sporting weapons.  The JPFO then goes on to list  other parts of the Nazi law, forbidding ownership of weapons by Jews; of course, there are no such provisions in the American GCA.  Nevertheless, in a rhetorical move guaranteed to muddy the waters, immediately after the  discussion of the anti-Jewish parts of the law, the JPFO article continues,  \\\"Given the parallels between the Nazi Weapons Law and the GCA'68...\\\" -- so  as to get maximum emotional mileage out of that aspect of the law.\",\"  \\\"Assuming\\\"? Also: come on, Brad. If we are going to get anywhere in  this (or any) discussion, it doesn't help to bring up elements I never  addressed, *nor commented on in any way*. I made no comment on who is  \\\"right\\\" or who is \\\"wrong\\\", only that civilians ARE being used as cover  and that, having been placed \\\"in between\\\" the Israelis and the guerillas, they *will* be injured as both parties continue their fight.    [The *purpose* of an army's use of military uniforms   is *to set its members apart* from the civilians so that   civilians will not be thought of by the other side as  \\\"combatants\\\". So, what do you think is the \\\"meaning behind\\\",   the intention and the effect when an \\\"army\\\" purposely   *does not were uniforms but goes out of its way to *look   like civilians'? *They are judging that the benefit they will   receive from this \\\"cover\\\" is more important that the harm  that will come to civilians.*  This is a comment on the Israeli experience and is saying that the guerillas *do* have some responsibility in putting civilians in \\\"the middle\\\" of this fight. By putting on uniforms and living apart from civilians (barracks, etc.), the guerillas would significantly lower the risk to civilians.   But if the guerillas do this aren't *they* putting themselves  at greater risk? Absolutely, they ask themselves \\\"why set   ourselves apart (by wearing uniforms) when there is a ready-made   cover for us (civilians)? That makes sense from their point of   view, BUT when this cover is used, the guerillas should accept   some of the responsibility for subsequent harm to civilians.   I agree with you here. I have always thought that Israel's bombing sortees and bombing policy is stupid, thoughtless, inhumane AND ineffective. BUT, there is no reason that Israel should passive wait  until attackers chose to act; there is every reason to believe that \\\"taking the fight *to* the enemy\\\" will do more to stop attacks.   As I said previously, Israel spent several decades \\\"sitting passively\\\" on its side of a border and only acting to stop these attacks *after* the attackers had entered Israeli territory. It didn't work very well. The \\\"host\\\" Arab state did little/nothing to try and stop these attacks  from its side of the border with Israel so the number of attacks were considerably higher, as was their physical and psychological impact  on the civilians caught in their path.    This is just another \\\"selectively applied\\\" statement.   The reason for this drawn-out impasse between Ababs/Palestinians and Israelis is that NEITHER side is willing to accept the Word of the other. By your criteria *everyone* should stay away from the negotiations.  That is precisely why the Palestinians (in their recent PISGA proposal for  the \\\"interim\\\" period after negotiations and leading up to full autonomy) are demanding conditions that essentially define \\\"autonomy\\\" already. They DO NOT trust that Israel will \\\"follow through\\\" the entire process and allow Palestinians to reach full autonomy.   Do you understand and accept this viewpoint by the Palestinians?  If you do, then why should Israel's view of Arabs/Palestinians  be any different? Why should they trust the Arab/Palestinians' words? Since they don't, they are VERY reluctant to give up \\\"tangible assets  (land, control of areas) in exchange for \\\"words\\\". For this reason, they are also concerned about the sorts of \\\"guarantees\\\" they will have  that the Arabs WILL follow through on their part of any agreement reached.  Absolutely, so are the Arabs/Palestinians asking FIRST for the Israelis \\\"word\\\" in relation to any agreement? NO, what is being demanded FIRST is LAND. When the issue is LAND, and one party finally gets HOLD of this \\\"land\\\", what the \\\"other party\\\" does is totally irrelevent. If I NOW have possession of this land, your words have absolutely no power; whether Israel chooses to keeps its word does NOT get the land back.   While the \\\"major armaments\\\" (those allowing people to wage \\\"civil wars\\\") have been removed, the weapons needed to cross-border attacks still remain to some extent. Rocket attacks still continue, and \\\"commando\\\" raids only require a few easily concealed weapons and a refined disregard for human life (yours of that of others). Such attacks also continue.   Bat guano. The situation you call for existed in the 1970s and attacks were commonplace.   There is NO WAY these groups can be effectively \\\"disarmed\\\" UNLESS the state is as authoritarian is Syria's. The only other way is for Lebanon to take it upon itself to constantly patrol the entire border with Israel, essentially mirroring Israel's border secirity on its side. It HAS TO PROVE TO ISREAL that it is this committed to protecting Israel from attack from Lebanese territory.  That's what I said, ok? But, doesn't that mean that Syria has to \\\"take over\\\" Lebanon? I don't think Israel or Lebanon would like that. What both \\\"sides\\\" need is to receive something \\\"tangible\\\". The Arabs/ Palestinians are looking for \\\"land\\\" and demanding that they receive it prior to giving anything to Israel. Israel has two problems: 1) if it gives up real *land* it IS exposing itself to a changed geostrategic situation (and that change doesn't help Israel's position), and 2) WHEN it gives up this land IT NEEDS to receive something in return to compensate for the increased risks\",\"Tonigth a TV journal here in Brasil announced that an object, beyond Pluto's orbit, was found by an observatory at Hawaii.

I had mentioned before that there is a report commissioned by the UN to study the Litani river, it is  still in draft form.  The Israeli gov't also commissioned a study on the river that was done by Dr. Ben Wolfe. The Litani starts in the Bekaa valley in Lebanon, flows Southward, then West across South Lebanon and discharges into the Mediterranean near the city of Tyre. There are other rivers such as the Hasbani and the Wazzani that start in Lebanese territory than join the Jordan river.   The most mentioned plan was one that would divert water from the Litani into these, then the water would flow naturally into the Lac De Houle.  BUT there is no evidence of any diversion structure (which would need to be at least 3 km long).  The area is mountainous, inaccessible and occupied by Israel so I have not seen any independent  reports of the existence of any diversion structure there. Another often mentioned diversion is through deep wells. It is also rumored that Israe has 600 m wells tapping into deep aquifers and drawing water on the Israeli side of the border.  If such wells are indeed under use they would be costly to operate  (high energy costs) and the Lebanese and Israeli gov't should  agree on the distribution of water from shared aquifers as part of an overall peace plan and the bilateral negociations on \\\"regional issues\\\".

Thanks in advance\",\"I recently published a new privacy-protecting off-line electronic cash system as a technical report at CWI. Being a PhD-student at David Chaum's cryptography-group, our group has a long history in research in the field of privacy-protecting cash systems.  The report is called CS-R9323.ps.Z, contains 77 pages, and can be retrieved from  ftp.cwi.nl   (192.16.184.180)  from the directory pub/CWIreports/AA. The postscript-file is suitable for 300dpi laserprinters.  ==================================================================== ABSTRACT (from coverpage): We present a new off-line electronic cash system based on a problem, called the representation problem, of which little use has been made in literature thus far. Our system is the first to be based entirely on discrete logarithms.  Using the representation problem as a basic concept, some techniques are introduced that enable us to construct protocols for withdrawal and payment that do not use the cut and choose methodology of earlier systems. As a consequence, our cash system is much more efficient in both computation and communication complexity than any such system proposed previously.    Another important aspect of our system concerns its provability. Contrary to previously proposed systems, its correctness can be mathematically proven to a very great extent. Specifically, if we make one plausible assumption concerning a single hash-function, the ability to break the system seems to imply that one can break the Diffie-Hellman problem.     Our system offers a number of extensions that are hard to achieve in previously known systems. In our opinion the most interesting of these is that the entire cash system (including all the extensions) can be incorporated in a setting based on wallets with observers, which has the important advantage that double-spending can be prevented in the first place, rather than detecting the identity of a double-spender after the fact. In particular, it can be incorporated even under the most stringent requirements conceivable about the privacy of the user, which seems to be impossible to do with previously proposed systems. Another benefit of our system is that framing attempts by a bank have negligible probability of success (independent of computing power) by a simple mechanism from within the system, which is something that previous solutions lack entirely. Furthermore, the basic cash system can be extended to checks, multi-show cash and divisibility, while retaining its computational efficiency. ====================================================================  Cryptographers are challenged to try to break this system!    I made a particular effort to keep the report as self-contained as possible.  Nevertheless, if you have any questions, please e-mail to me and I will try to reply as good as I can. Any comments are also welcome!

From LA Times, Friday, April 9, 1993.  P. A1.    EVIDENCE OF ADL SPY OPERATION SEIZED BY POLICE    By Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer    SAN FRANCISCO -- Police on Thursday served search warrants on the  Anti-Defamation League here and in Los Angeles, seizing evidence of a  nationwide intelligence network accused of keeping files on more than  950 political groups, newspapers and labor unions and as many as  12,000 people.    Describing the spy operation in great detail, San Francisco  authorities simultaneously released voluminous documents telling how  operatives of the Anti-Defamation League searched through trash and  infiltrated organizations to gather intelligence on Arab-American,  right-wing and what they called \\\"pinko\\\" organizations.    Representatives of the Anti-Defamation League, a well-known  organization in the U.S. Jewish community dedicated to fighting  anti-Semitism, declined detailed comment Thursday but denied breaking  any laws.    Police allege that the organization maintains undercover operatives to  gather political intelligence in at least seven cities, including Los  Angeles and San Francisco.    Groups that were the focus of the spy operation span the political  spectrum, including such groups as the Ku Klux Klan, the White Aryan  Resistance, Operation Rescue, Greenpeace, the National Assn. for the  Advancement of Colored People, the United Farm Workers and the Jewish  Defense League.  Also on the list were Mills College, the board of  directors of San Francisco public television station KQED and the San  Francisco Bay Guardian newspaper.    People who were subjects of the spy operation included former  Republican Rep. Pete McCloskey, jailed political extremist Lyndon H.  LaRouche and Los Angeles Times foreign correspondent Scott Kraft, who  is based in South Africa.    Authorities said much of the material collected by the groups was  confidential information obtained illegally from law enforcement  agencies.  They also alleged that data on some individuals and  organizations was sold separately to the South African government.    In addition to allegations of obtaining confidential information from  police, the Anti-Defamation League could face a total of 48 felony  counts for not properly reporting the employment of its chief West  Coast spy, Roy Bullock, according to the affidavit filed to justify  the search warrant.    The Anti-Defamation League disguised payments to Bullock for more than  25 years by funneling $550 a week to Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I.  Hochman, who then paid Bullock, according to the documents released in  San Francisco.  Hochman, a former president of the Jewish Federation  Council of Greater Los Angeles and one of the state's leading tax  attorneys, will be out of the city until late next week and could not  be reached for comment, his office said.    Until 1990, Hochman, a former U.S. prosecutor, also was a member of a  panel appointed by then-Sen. Pete Wilson to secretly make initial  recommendations on new federal judges in California.  Hochman is a  former regional president of the Anti-Defamation League.    The league, which initially cooperated with police, has denied  repeatedly that its intelligence-gathering operation broke any laws.  League officials will not confirm or deny whether Bullock was an  employee and have said they simply traded information with police  departments about people who might be involved in hate crimes.    But in an affidavit filed to obtain warrants for Thursday's searches,  San Francisco police alleged that \\\"ADL employees were apparently less  than truthful\\\" in providing information during an earlier search  conducted without a warrant.    David Lehrer, executive director of the Los Angeles ADL office, said  the organization has not violated the law.  \\\"There is nothing  nefarious about how we operate or what we have done,\\\" he said.  \\\"Our  record speaks for itself.\\\"    The police affidavit contends that Lehrer had sole control of a secret  fund used to pay for \\\"fact-finding operations.\\\"  Lehrer, according to  the documents, signed checks from the account under the name L.  Patterson.    An ADL official said the account was used to pay for subscriptions to  a wide variety of extremist publications that might balk at sending  them directly to the Anti-Defamation League.    Bullock, 58, who has been collecting intelligence for the ADL for  nearly 40 years, defended his efforts during a lengthy interview with  San Francisco police.  He said that he gathered names from many  sources and entered them into his computer under headings such as  \\\"Skins\\\" and \\\"Pinkos,\\\" but that did not necessarily mean that they were  under surveillance.    \\\"I might never see or call up on 99% of them again,\\\" Bullock said.  \\\"And it doesn't mean anything that they're in the files.  It's not a  threat to anyone's civil rights that a name appears in my files under,  say, 'Pinko.'\\\"    In recent years, Bullock worked closely with San Francisco Police  Officer Tom Gerard, who fled to the Phillippines last fall after he  was questioned by the FBI in the case.    A former CIA employee, Gerard supplied Bullock with criminal records  and Department of Motor Vehicles information such as home addresses,  vehicle registration, physical characteristics and drivers license  photographs.    Using files gathered for the Anti-Defamation League, Gerard and  Bullock also provided information to the South African government,  receiving $16,000 over four years, the documents show.    The file on Times staff writer Kraft, which was apparently sold to the  South African government, provides some insight into the hit-and-miss  nature of the spy operation.    The file notes that Kraft's articles \\\"appear frequently in The Times  and are well researched and written,\\\" but little else about the file  is accurate.  The brief entry confuses The Times' Kraft with another  Scott Kraft and provides the South African government with the wrong  Kraft's physical description, photograph and other personal  information.    Nevertheless, the documents provide illuminating details of how  Bullock for decades infiltrated all manner of organizations, from  skinheads to left-wing radicals, searching regularly through the trash  of target groups.  Using Anti-Defamation League funds, he also ran his  own paid informants under code names such as \\\"Scott\\\" and \\\"Scumbag.\\\"    He worked closely with police officers up and down the coast,  exchanged information with the FBI and worked with federal agencies,  including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.    It was Bullock's work as a paid informant for the FBI -- while spying  on behalf of the Anti-Defamation League and the South African  government -- that proved his undoing. The FBI learned that he was an  agent of a foreign government and began investigating, leading to the  probe of the Anti-Defamation League's intelligence network.  The  Anti-Defamation League employed undercover operatives to gather  information in Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Washington,  Chicago, St. Louis and Atlanta, according to the affidavit and  investigators.  Joining San Francisco police in searching league  offices and a Los Angeles bank were investigators from the office of  San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith and the state Franchise Tax  Board.  The Los Angeles Police Department, which earlier refused to  cooperate with the investigation, was informed of the searches in Los  Angeles but not invited to participate.  Investigators suspect that  some confidential information in the Anti-Defamation League files may  have come from Los Angeles police officers.        From Los Angeles Times, Saturday, April 10, 1993.  P. A23.    ADL VOWS TO COOPERATE WITH SPY INVESTIGATION    By Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer.    SAN FRANCISCO -- The Anti-Defamation League defended its record as a  civil rights group Friday and said it will cooperate with authorities  who are investigating whether the organization collected confidential  police information on citizens and groups.    But San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith said that Anti-Defamation  League employees involved in intelligence gathering could face many  felony counts of receiving confidential files, eavesdropping, tax  violations and conspiracy.    Police have accused the Anti-Defamation League of not being truthful  about its spying operations, which collected information on more than  12,000 individuals and 950 political groups across the political  spectrum.    Hundreds of pages of documents released by prosecutors Thursday show  that the ADL maintained a nationwide intelligence network and kept  files on political figures.    Even so, Smith suggested that if the Anti-Defamation League shut down  its spy operation, prosecutors would take that into account when  deciding what charges to file.    In a statement released in Washington, National Director Abraham H.  Foxman described the ADL as \\\"a Jewish defense agency which has fought  to protect all minorities from bigotry and discrimination for 80  years.\\\"    Foxman said the organization is regarded as a credible source on  extremist groups and has a tradition of routinely providing  information to police, journalists, academics, government officials  and the public.  It has never been the policy of the ADL to obtain  information illegally, he said.    \\\"Like other journalists, in order to protect the confidentiality and  physical safety of its sources, ADL will not comment on the nature or  identity of any source of information,\\\" Foxman said.    The Anti-Defamation League refused to acknowledge that one of its  longtime employees, Roy Bullock, was anything more than \\\"a private  individual who is alleged to be an ADL 'informant.'\\\"    Among the documents released by prosecutors were detailed statements  showing how the ADL funneled weekly payments to Bullock through  Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I. Hochman.    \\\"Roy would penetrate organizations and needed this arrangement to be  distanced from ADL,\\\" Hochman told a San Francisco police investigator.  Hochman could not be reached Friday at his home or office for comment.    Despite the Anti-Defamation League's assertion that it will cooperate  with authorities, San Francisco police said the group did not turn  over all pertinent documents during a voluntary search of the group's  offices in Los Angeles and San Francisco last fall.    A second round of searches Thursday, this time with search warrants,  produced a vast quantity of records, primarily dealing with financial  transactions, Smith said.  Further searches may be necessary and it  will be at least a month before any charges are filed, he said.    \\\"The investigation, of course, will go wherever the facts lead us,\\\"  the district attorney said.\",\"  Excuse me?

Your logic certainly applies to standard investment strategies.  However, the concept of a prize for a difficult goal is done for different reasons, I  suspect.  I'm not aware that Mr Orteig received any significant economic  benefit from Lindbergh's flight.  Modern analogies, such as the prize for a human powered helicopter face similar arguments.  There is little economic benefit in such a thing.  The advantage comes in the new approaches developed and the fact that a prize will frequently generate far more work than the  equivalent amount of direct investment would.  A person who puts up $ X billion for a moon base is much more likely to do it because they want to see it done than because they expect to make money off the deal.\",\"[reply to zazen@austin.ibm.com (E. H. Welbon)]         For many atheists, the lack of belief in gods is secondary to an epistemological consideration:  what do we accept as a reliable way of knowing?  There are no known valid logical arguments for the existence of gods, nor is there any empirical evidence that they exist.  Most philosophers and theologians agree that the idea of a god is one that must be accepted on faith.  Faith is belief without a sound logical basis or empirical evidence.  It is a reliable way of knowing?   There is probably nothing else most people would accept in the absence of any possibility of proof.  Even when we agree to take someone elses word \\\"on faith\\\", we just mean that having found this person to be reliable in the past, we judge him likely to be a reliable source now. If we find faith less reliable than logic and empirical evidence everywhere else, why assume it will provide reliable knowledge about gods?   The difference between the atheist and the theist is fundamentally then one of whether or not faith is held to be a reliable way of knowing, rather than, as some agnostic posters would have it, whether ones faith is in gods or no gods.  The theist believes that faith is an acceptable basis for a belief in gods, even if he rejects faith as reliable at other times, for example in his work as a scientist.  The atheist believes that only logic and empirical evidence lead to reliable knowledge.  Agnosticism seems to me a less defensible position than theism or atheism, unless one is a sceptic in regards to all other knowledge.  Without evidence, why should we believe in gods rather than Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny?   I would also like to point out as others have that the atheist doesn't require absolute knowledge of the lack of gods.  I don't believe that there is any such thing as absolute knowledge.  Atheism is the best and simplest theory to fit the (lack of) facts and so should be held until contrary evidence is found.\",\"  As far as I know, they did; my new Mac came with one yesterday...

We do some calculations based on the image of the hole on the screen.  However, the calculations are mathematically highly complex, and must assume that the object's hole projects an image (resembling an ellipse if the tube is not parallel to the screen) in the centre of the screen.  However, it is unlikely that the object is placed so conveniently.    Firstly, we must transform the major and minor axis of the ellipse.  I cannot know what the angle between the tube and screen is.  Do I have to assume that they are parallel to do the transformation?  How do I do this transformation?  Secondly, there is a distortion of the image due to the screen being planar (the source--screen distance increases as we move away from the centre of the screen).  How can I compensate the ellipse's axis for this image distortion?  So, please can anyone give us a few pointers here?  How do we transform the image so it appears as it would if it were in the centre of the screen, and how do I deal with distortion due to the shape of the screen?

Or is it all hypothetical?\",\"                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^          The \\\"used to kill\\\" is the heart of the misinformation.  It's one of those technically accurate phrasings that conveys the wrong impression. What Mr. Quiqley is more than aware of, I'm sure, is that when people read this they think violent arguments where one member of the family grabs a gun and shoots another, thereby creating a tragic situation which could easily have been avoided had the gun not been there, or a tragic accident, especially involving a child.         Unfortunately, that's not the way things stack up.  The majority of that 43 \\\"times\\\" (37 I believe) are suicides.  That is, someone  intentionally took a firearm and shot themselves intending to kill  themselves.  And why it's popular to try and blame suicides on guns, the evidence doesn't support this.  Internal studies, as well as comparative studies with other countries, indicate that cultural factors far outweigh whether a person will kill themselves or not. (Japan, for instance, has a slightly higher rate than the U.S.  There people jump off buildings.)         According to the National Crime Survey, 40% of violent crime is commited by \\\"non-strangers,\\\" which mistakenly has been generalized regarding the King County study to mean, \\\"Friends and family.\\\"  That is, Mr. Quigley, and others who quote this statistic, are banking on the mental image that a \\\"Friend, family member, or child,\\\" equates to a loving relationship, and that it was cut short in a moment of anger.  Unfortunately, all too often husbands beat and kill wives, children assault parents, or vice-versa.  Most rapes are commited by  someone known to the victim, for instance.  Essentially, that a gun was used against a \\\"friend\\\" or family member doesn't mean they weren't trying to hurt the other person.  Crime is highest among poor urban families, and those are also the areas most \\\"at risk\\\" for family problems, especially violent ones.  A son in a gang may not be as loving toward his parents if they disapprove than a suburban kid might.         Finally, it hinges on the fallacy that a dead intruder is the only value of a self-defense firearm.  Using the minimum figures I worked out using the NCS I got about an 80:1 ratio between deadly self-defenses (justifiable homicides) and with-gun self-defenses. Between the FBI Uniform Crime report and the NCS there's an enormous amount of data and anybody with the calculator can crunch the numbers. As such it is incorrect to assume that a dead body is the only valid means of determining the success of such a defense, since according to the NCS (which has been considered by many to seriously under-report defenses) there were far more successful with-gun defenses than intruders killed.         Not it also confines itself to the home, where attack by a \\\"friend or family member\\\" is far, far more likely, and excludes any defense which occurs outside the home.  (I believe a large number occur in businesses.)          I have not seen the exact data for this, so I can't comment.  I will point out Canada's and Japan's suicide rate as indications that culture far more than firearm availability affect suicide rates.         There was also a comparative study between Canada (for what it's worth, considering the difficulty of comparing across cultural lines) published in the New England Journal of Medicine (I can get the exact cite if you need it) that concluded that restrictive firearm laws  would not significantly impact the over-all suicide rate. \",\" Chelios is by far the MVP on Chicago...

But lets ignore that for the moment.  The fundamental question is:Can the government stop me from using encryption?  Ignoring for the moment the question of patented processes (such as Public Keys), can the government stop me from using an encryption process?  If the answer is yes then what freedom we have in this country is truly gone and its time to get out the guns or the lawyers (depending upon which causes more damage and to whom).  However assuming that I can still encrypt things as I please, who cares about the clipper chip? As far as I'm concerned a phone line is insecure PERIOD. I don't care if they encrypt it 10 ways from sunday, if I didn't do the encrypting, I don't trust it. This is the attitude that everyone else should have. Instead of worrying about a clipper chip, simply connect your handset to your computer and feed the voice single through, process, encrypt, and transmit over the phone.

Anyone who expects the government to protect their freedoms is kidding themselves. Only you can protect your own freedoms.  One final thought addressed to EFF:  1.Do you support the implementation of ANY form of  encryption where the encryption key must be revealed?  2.If you do, why? If not, why?  3.What SPECIFIC actions are you planning to take to either  support or stop this proposal?  4.If you do not support this proposal, what alternatives do  you offer?      The Jester\",\"Can a theist be truly objective?  Can he be impartial      when questioning the truth of his scriptures, or      will he assume the superstition of his parents      when questioning?   I've often found it to be the case that the theist      will stick to some kind of superstition when      wondering about God and his scriptures.  I've      seen it in the Christian, the Jew, the Muslim,      and the other theists alike.  All assume that      their mothers and fathers were right in the      aspect that a god exists, and with that belief      search for their god.       Occasionally, the theist may switch religions or      aspects of the same religion, but overall the      majority keep to the belief that some \\\"Creator\\\"      was behind the universe's existence.  I've      known Muslims who were once Christians and vice      versa, I've known Christians who were once      Jewish and vice versa, and I've even known      Christians who become Hindu.  Yet, throughout      their transition from one faith to another,      they've kept this belief in some form of higher      \\\"being.\\\"  Why?       It usually all has to do with how the child is      brought up.  From the time he is born, the      theist is brought up with the notion of the      \\\"truth\\\" of some kind of scripture-- the Bible,      the Torah, the Qur'an, & etc.  He is told      of this wondrous God who wrote (or inspired)      the scripture, of the prophets talked about in      the scripture, of the miracles performed, & etc.      He is also told that to question this (as      children are apt to do) is a sin, a crime      against God, and to lose belief in the scrip-      ture's truth is to damn one's soul to Hell.      Thus, by the time he is able to read the      scripture for himself, the belief in its \\\"truth\\\"      is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a      matter of course.       But it doesn't stop there.  Once the child is able      to read for himself, there is an endeavor to      inculcate the child the \\\"right\\\" readings of      scripture, to concentrate more on the pleasant      readings, to gloss over the worse ones, and to      explain away the unexplainable with \\\"mystery.\\\"      Circular arguments, \\\"self-evdent\\\" facts and      \\\"truths,\\\" unreasoning belief, and fear of      hell is the meat of religion the child must eat      of every day.  To doubt, of course, means wrath      of some sort, and the child must learn to put      away his brain when the matter concerns God.      All of this has some considerable effect on the      child, so that when he becomes an adult, the       superstitions he's been taught are nearly      impossible to remove.       All of this leads me to ask whether the theist can      truly be objective when questioning God, Hell,      Heaven, the angels, souls, and all of the rest.      Can he, for a moment, put aside this notion that      God *does* exist and look at everything from      a unbiased point of view?  Obviously, most      theists can somewhat, especially when presented      with \\\"mythical gods\\\" (Homeric, Roman, Egyptian,      & etc.).  But can they put aside the assumption      of God's existence and question it impartially?

With all the knowledge believers accumulated, He would think that we would be 'enlightened' enough to detect which ones are  'authentic and divine' as opposed to 'evil or man-made'.  These signs, these miracles, are you afraid that they are not from God? That these are the signs we should not open our hearts and mind to for thinking   they are evil? Well, is faith in God evil? Is true peace evil?  Is true love that is divine and pure evil?  Why can't someone accept that God can do what He wants in fulfillment of His   generous love and Jesus' never ending forgiveness to those who turn back to   Him for salvation? Why are we refusing God's messenger of this truth?  The mother to all who are   in Christ? What brings us these:     fears of being shamed by what others will think or say about us?         which, in contrary, could be pleasing to God?     fears of being humbled?     fears of being judged as wrong (wrt mainstream standard of what is right)? Why can't we tolerate non-believers' mockery or ridicule of us for the   sake of peace, love and obedience to God?  The humbling lessons left to us   by martyrs and saints? We'd rather engage in never-ending bickering and disproof of each other's   opinion - looking at each other's mistakes - for the sake of arguments,   instead of having communion in one body with Christ. What makes us go blind to the truth that God is All Powerful and that He can   not be binded by what people wrote and have written about Him in all ages? Why is our faith in God limited?  By all the words and literature we muster? What prevents us from going *beyond* being saved and extend God's rich love   to others who are not?  Why are our eyes not wide open to see that He continuously sees our faith, hope   and love which glorify Him and so He gives us indications of His    acknowledgements with signs/miracles (ordinary/common or divinely inspired)    everywhere?  Isn't that like an atheist/agnostic's view that all these   are just ordinary here on earth and not caused by anything supernatural?  Why then does the Holy Mother comes back to remind us:   \\\"We must really __accept that prayer__ changes the course of things and that   with prayers __even wars can be prevented__.\\\" but then she continues:   \\\"You often have an egotistic attitude.  Dear children, in these days you   have prayed very much, __but your hands have remained empty__.\\\" Why hesitate in proclaiming what needs to be done:   \\\"prayer, conversion, peace, penance, fasting, the Holy Mass, living life   as what the Gospel brings.\\\"? Why not do so?  How?  To the world?   \\\"Start in your family.  Be a good example.  Live the Word.\\\" Why worry if it is going to be of good use to many?   \\\"The fruits, __leave them to the Lord__, do not worry about anything or    anyone but entrust yourself to the Lord.\\\"  Although the Holy Mother does not insist because:   \\\"You are free; I bow before the freedom which God gives you.\\\" but she follows this with:   \\\"You are surprised because I say to you: Decide for God and yet, see how   you have lived this day.\\\" Why does she constantly conveys:   \\\"Take this life toward God in the way as to __experience__ the Lord Himself   in your __behavior__ and __not only__ when you pray\\\" or one time when we    decide that we are saved, or talk/write about God, etc. The Holy Mother warns:   \\\"Satan (the serpent) is always trying to dissuade you to turn you away from   my peace plan and prayer.\\\"  (Rev 12:17, the dragon became angry with the woman   and went off to wage war against the rest of her offsprings, those who keep   God's commandments, and bear witness to Jesus.)  Do you have fear or hate for God's current messenger of true peace, love and   our motherly protector from the anti-Christ? The one who is being apprehensive of communism, wars, famine and other evils   that the serpent brings upon us?  This obedient and blessed new Eve? The mother who warns us so we can be prepared and be strong against Satan? Haven't there been renewed faith, hope, love, peace and obedience wherever   this messenger has shared her blessings and graces that God has given her   in good purpose? Why do we choose to be blind? Why fear the truth that God has been giving us a chance and sharing Christ's   ever-forgetting forgiveness to us through the obedient mother? The mother who has been consecrated the task __to reverse__ the disobedient   harm and example done by the ancient Eve. She has been preparing the new Eden with her Immaculate Heart. The new Eden as sanctuary (the womb) for the next coming and judgement of the    righteous by our Lord, Jesus Christ; when The Lamb marries His bride. Shouldn't we give her a hand in her exhaustive job of preparing us for the   second coming of her Son as she has been conceived without sin to bear   the Son of God in her womb? Why fear true peace, love and renewed faith and obedience to God that Mary   faithfully brings to God's children?  She has been protecting the flock   (the rest of the offsprings) from the greedy dragon so as to present more    righteous members for her Son's coming. Not all apparitions and miracles that resulted from them are worthy   of belief.  With prayer and guidance from the Holy Spirit and, of course,   approval of our Church authorities, we should be aware of the true and   divinely inspired ones; specifically, the ones which aligns with the   Scripture.     Also, our Lady reminds us of recommendation of __silence__ in our prayers:   \\\"If you speak unceasingly in your prayers, how will you be able to hear   God?  Allow Him room to answer you, to speak to you.\\\"   She encourages us (with motherly nurturing) to continue in exuberant  faith, hope and love to Jesus, constantly.  NOT with mere emotions,  but with deep, constant obedience to Jesus, her Beloved Son and acknowledgement of our need to have Him as part of our lives.  Let's not wait to the last minute to renew our faith and the life that God wants us to live; when there won't be enough time or when it will be late.                                                        Nowadays, Mary says,  \\\"Pray, pray, pray for peace...reconciliation, my children.\\\" Have peace within yourself first before you can promote peace to others.  For without peace, you can not fully accept my Son.\\\"                                                                          And you think she's just an ordinary lady.  Not to me.

Oh, and I also leave my system running all the time.                                                                     \",\" This a \\\"tried and true\\\" method utilized by guerilla and terrorists groups: to conduct operations in the midst of the local populace, thus forcing the opposing \\\"state\\\" to possible harm innocent civilians in their search or, in order to avoid the deaths of civilians, abandon the search. Certainly the people who use the population for cover are *also* to blaim for dragging the innocent civilians into harm's way.  Are you suggesting that, when guerillas use the population for cover, Israel should totally back down? So...the easiest way to get away with attacking another is to use an innocent as a shield and hope that the other respects innocent lives?   Your damn right Israel insists on some sort of \\\"demilitarized\\\" or \\\"buffer\\\" zone. Its had to put up with too many years of attacks from the territory of Arab states and watched as the states did nothing. It is not exactly surprizing that Israel decided that the only way to stop such actions is to  do it themselves.   What? So the whole bit about attacks on Israel from neighboring Arab states  can start all over again? While I also hope for this to happen, it will only occur WHEN Arab states show that they are *prepared* to take on the  responsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attacks on Israel from their  soil. They have to Prove it (or provide some \\\"guaratees\\\"), there is no way Israel is going to accept their \\\"word\\\"- not with their past attitude of  tolerance towards \\\"anti-Israel guerillas in-residence\\\".  Good lord, Brad. What in the world goves you the idea that UN troops stop anything? They are ONLY stationed in a country because that country allows them in. It can ask them to leave *at any time*; as Nasser did in '56 and '67. Somehow, with that \\\"limitation\\\" on the troops \\\"powers\\\" I don't think that Israel is going to be any more comfortable. Without a *genuine* commitment to peace from the Arab states, and concrete (not intellectual or political exercises in jargon) \\\"guarantees\\\" by other parties, the UN is worthless to Israel (but, perhaps useful as a \\\"ruse\\\"?).   Perhaps you are aware that, to most communities of people, there is the feeling that it is better that \\\"many of us die fighting against those who attack us than for few to die while we silently  accept our fate.\\\" If,however, you call on Israel to see the sense of  suffering fewer casualties, I suggest you apply the same to Palestinian, Arab and Islamic groups.   From Israel's perspective, \\\"concessions\\\" gets it NOTHING...except the  realization that it has given \\\"something\\\" up and now *can only  hope* that the other side decides to do likewise. Words *can be taken back* by merely doing so; to \\\"take back\\\" tangible items (land, control of land) requires the sort of action you say Israel should stay away from.   Israel put up with attacks from Arab state territories for decades  before essentially putting a stop to it through its invasion of Lebanon. The entire basis of that reality was exactly as you state above: 1) Israel  would express outrage at these attacks and protest to the Arab state  involved, 2) that state promptly ignored the entire matter, secure  in the knowledge that IT could not be held responsible for the acts  committed by \\\"private groups\\\", 3) Israel would prepare for the next  round of attacks. What would Israel want to return to those days (and don't be so idiotic as to suggest \\\"trust\\\" for the motivations of present-day Arab states)?  Ah, ok...what is \\\"different\\\" about the present situation that tells us that the Arab states will *not* pursue their past antagonistic  policies towards Israel? Now, don't talk about vague \\\"political factors\\\" but about those \\\"tangible\\\" (just like that which Israel gave up) factors that \\\"guarantee\\\" the responsibility of those states. Your assessment of \\\"difference\\\" here is based on a whole lot of assumptions, and most states don't feel confortable basing their existence on that sort of thing.   It has not. Without the support, and active involvement, of Syria, Lebanon would not have been able to accomplish all that has occurred. Once Syria leaves who is to say that Lebanon will be able to retain  control? If Syria stays thay may be even more dangerous for Israel. Tim\",\"  Oops! Quite right.

Source: 'The Times,' 3 March 1992  MASSACRE UNCOVERED....  By ANATOL LIEVEN,  More than sixty bodies, including those of women and children, have  been spotted on hillsides in Nagorno-Karabakh, confirming claims  that Armenian troops massacred Azeri refugees. Hundreds are missing.  Scattered amid the withered grass and bushes along a small valley  and across the hillside beyond are the bodies of last Wednesday's  massacre by Armenian forces of Azerbaijani refugees.  From that hill can be seen both the Armenian-controlled town of  Askeran and the outskirts of the Azerbaijani military headquarters  of Agdam. Those who died very nearly made it to the safety of their  own lines.  We landed at this spot by helicopter yesterday afternoon as the last  troops of the Commonwealth of Independent states began pulling out.  They left unhindered by the warring factions as General Boris Gromov,  who oversaw the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, flew to Stepanakert  to ease their departure.  A local truce was enforced to allow the Azerbaijaines to collect their  dead and any refugees still hiding in the hills and forest. All the  same, two attack helicopters circled continuously the nearby Armenian  positions.  In all, 31 bodies could be counted at the scene. At least another  31 have been taken into Agdam over the past five days. These figures  do not include civilians reported killed when the Armenians stormed  the Azerbaijani town of Khodjaly on Tuesday night. The figures also  do not include other as yet undiscovered bodies  Zahid Jabarov, a survivor of the massacre, said he saw up to 200  people shot down at the point we visited, and refugees who came  by different routes have also told of being shot at repeatedly and  of leaving a trail of bodies along their path. Around the bodies  we saw were scattered possessions, clothing and personnel documents.  The bodies themselves have been preserved by the bitter cold which killed others as they hid in the hills and forest after the massacre.  All are the bodies of ordinary people, dressed in the poor, ugly  clothing of workers.  Of the 31 we saw, only one policeman and two apparent national  volunteers were wearing uniform. All the rest were civilians,  including eight women and three small children. TWO GROUPS,  APPARENTLY FAMILIES, HAD FALLEN TOGETHER, THE CHILDREN CRADLED  IN THE WOMEN'S ARMS.  SEVERAL OF THEM, INCLUDING ONE SMALL GIRL, HAD TERRIBLE HEAD  INJURIES: ONLY HER FACE WAS LEFT. SURVIVORS HAVE TOLD HOW THEY  SAW ARMENIANS SHOOTING THEM POINT BLANK AS THEY LAY ON THE GROUND.

Have you ever heard of Jonestown? The sad thing is the people inside the compound were the authority  worshipers and their only authority was Koresh/Howell.   If these  people were able to think for themselves, there would likely be a lot  more survivors today.  Koresh preached a fiery apocalypse as early as  last year.   By all means, the FBI should be investigated, too.

JPEG (pronounced \\\"jay-peg\\\") is a standardized image compression mechanism. JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, the original name of the committee that wrote the standard.  JPEG is designed for compressing either full-color or gray-scale digital images of \\\"natural\\\", real-world scenes. It does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line drawings.  JPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it handle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG respectively.  JPEG is \\\"lossy\\\", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't quite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably the fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details of light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are invisible to the eye.  A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small files if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image archives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you aren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.   [2]  Why use JPEG?  There are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store 24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.  Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a 2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the size ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)  If your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have to convert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even with a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image than to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using JPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply.  It's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file.  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.  The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet posting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel (16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have only 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as black-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed in section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably more appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.   [3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?  JPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images, GIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first things to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.  As a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or gray-scale images of \\\"realistic\\\" scenes; that means scanned photographs and similar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit display hardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)  GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors, such as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels that are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by GIF.  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without introducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form. (In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they should be avoided in JPEG files.)  JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels adjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly often in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is particularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high. If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it.  Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and subtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it. The same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).  Plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG. You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale images.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images of up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.  If you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you should convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do. (Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only applies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from a GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG can only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify converting anyway.  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself. If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be prepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not convert well.   [4]  How well does JPEG compress images?  Pretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have handy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three files are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG software described in section 6B.  File    Size in bytes  Comments  ship.ppm 1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits     or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead) ship.ppm.Z  963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress     compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note.     Other text-oriented compressors give similar results. ship.gif  240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif     Most of the savings is the result of losing color     info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)  ship.jpg95  155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)     This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,     at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs. ship.jpg75   58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)     You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this     from the original, even with both on-screen at once. ship.jpg50   38406  cjpeg -Q 50     This has slight defects; if you know what to look     for, you could tell it's been JPEGed without seeing     the original.  Still as good image quality as many     recent postings in Usenet pictures groups. ship.jpg25   25192  cjpeg -Q 25     JPEG's characteristic \\\"blockiness\\\" becomes apparent     at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).     Still, I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were     of poorer image quality than this. ship.jpg5o    6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)     Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or     indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:     the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !  In this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smaller than a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the GIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical ratio for real-world scenes.   [5]  What are good \\\"quality\\\" settings for JPEG?  Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings.  \\\"Quality 95\\\" does NOT mean \\\"keep 95% of the information\\\", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary; it's not a percentage of anything.  The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting (smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another, but here are some rules of thumb.  The default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for experimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a file two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.  If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to go down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you might need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation. The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG. The default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to 95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).  If you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are prepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is about right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as \\\"op art\\\".  (Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG software described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other JPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different quality scale.  Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just \\\"high\\\"/\\\"medium\\\"/\\\"low\\\"-style choices.)   [6]  Where can I get JPEG software?

The file is called 'xv-???.tar.Z' (where ??? is the version number, currently 2.21); it is located in the 'contrib' directory on export or the 'pub/xv' directory at upenn.  XV reduces all images to 8 bits internally, which means it's not a real good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you'll still get only 8-bit color).  Also, you shouldn't use XV to convert full-color images to JPEG, because they'll get color-quantized first. But XV is a fine tool for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG. CAUTION: there is a glitch in versions 2.21 and earlier: be sure to check the \\\"save at normal size\\\" checkbox when saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.  Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package, also available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z. This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The ImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped displays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the basic free JPEG software.  Both of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple image viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest release, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage, said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original. (The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4 decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next xloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said to do the right thing with 24-bit displays.   MS-DOS:  This covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.  One good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files. The current version, 2.4a, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca (129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg24a.zip.  This is a good basic viewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is not flashy, but it's functional.  Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview.  The current version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU and a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and OS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit on the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do). You may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a bit tricky; read the directions carefully!  A shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is also much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use --- more keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a little slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than screen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both are faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip. Requires a VESA graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zip or vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in VESA driver, so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains that the driver is missing.)  A second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around the net for a while, but I don't know any stable archive location for it. The current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway. The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.  The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest revision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good: it's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is poor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see a good JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.  Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can't get *any* of them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you have hi-color hardware, don't use GIF as the intermediate format; try to find a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right thing with hi-color displays.)  The Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS compilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will convert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.  Handmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF. These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in particular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietary JPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format files are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version 2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip. NOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is not readable on non-PC platforms.  Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation package, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI formats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images. A demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.1 is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch161.zip.  NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet's key archive site for PC-related programs is Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20 runs a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document refers to directory (eg) \\\"msdos/graphics\\\" at Simtel20, that really means \\\"pd1:<msdos.graphics>\\\".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should expect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several Internet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives; most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA mirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files in (eg) \\\"/pub/msdos/graphics\\\".  If you have no FTP capability, you can retrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in comp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA, consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.  Microsoft Windows:  There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images. (Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware, due to Windows' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion programs described above inside a Windows DOS window.)  The newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0 is available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip. Requires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers. But it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing...  JView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the decompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can't create new JPEG files, and it doesn't view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it's an excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip. (Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites, including wuarchive.wustl.edu.)  WinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files; it can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter. It has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and slideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow 286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version, which is roughly 25% faster.)  ColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising contender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it has no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the current version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file pub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will be appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)  DVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen mode, not in a window.  OS/2:  The following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151). Note: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator is not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip     32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4. /pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip     16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc11.zip     Image Archiver 1.01: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.     Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip     PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows     (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview84.zip     PMView 0.84: JPEG/GIF/BMP viewer.  GIF viewing very fast, JPEG viewing     fast if you have huge amounts of RAM, otherwise about the same speed     as the above programs.  Strong 24-bit display support.  Shareware, $20.  Macintosh:  Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation, which is part of the QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed. To use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running System 6.0.7 or later.  (If you're running System 6, you must also install the 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get QuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx. (As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0 in several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However, some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)  Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is not the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for details.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format. Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.  The first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images that are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can convert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big improvement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and QuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can view large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it's the only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a typical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down to fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people like this behavior, some don't.  Overall, JPEGView's user interface is very well thought out.  GIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and PICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest version is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later. GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can load and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it's faster with QuickTime.) Note: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try converting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.  JPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx. This will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing. You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.  Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF converter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this program, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.  Apple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and GIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx. Requires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it's really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime. Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display, and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an unsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not intend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called PICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash it, as it's even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much cleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that Picture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)  Storm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter. This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but it will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on older systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can't use it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a downloaded image file to 'JPEG' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.  If your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance), GIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you don't want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.  More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not all can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version 2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG plug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded JPEG file to 'JPEG' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.  Amiga:  (Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at amiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this archive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good choice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)  HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a general image manipulation tool.  It's cheap (shareware, $20) and can read several formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version is available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger than 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.  Rend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM, and GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even capturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The current version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is supposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under AmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)  Viewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.  If you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages that support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24 and Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and ImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting, effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are distributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro), from ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation software for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another well-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.  The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file AmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.  The Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many based on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks to a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without so much as notifying the authors).  Among these are \\\"AugJPEG\\\", \\\"NewAmyJPEG\\\", \\\"VJPEG\\\", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion, anything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space it's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.  Atari ST:  The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc, from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo. These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.  I have not heard of any free or shareware JPEG-capable viewer for Ataris, but surely there must be one by now?  Pointers appreciated.  Acorn Archimedes:  !ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view JPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG, although this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.  Recent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle JPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be found on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by registering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede, The Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).  There's also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write functionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image format conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not necessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST, Cambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.   Portable software for almost any system:  If none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free JPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You'll also need a viewer program. If your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a display with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa or PPM 24-bit image files.  There are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every day.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find the available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case, purchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether the product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can handle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are not and never will be compatible with anyone else's files.   [6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:  Free, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent JPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code, documentation, and some small test files is available from several places. The \\\"official\\\" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9 or 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release is jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don't forget to retrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP. If you are on a PC and don't know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may prefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on CompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip. If you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest comp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34. (If you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ article \\\"How to find sources\\\", referred to at the top of section 6.)  The free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG \\\"JFIF\\\" format and image files in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats. The core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other programs, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have tested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.  We have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use. Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products. We do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in product literature (see the README file in the distribution for details). We hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with anything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.  The Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you'd like to contribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.   [7]  What's all this hoopla about color quantization?  Most people don't have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware. Typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display 256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors.  This process is called \\\"color quantization\\\".  (This is something of a misnomer, \\\"color selection\\\" would be a better term.  We're stuck with the standard usage though.)  Clearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most images, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at the very lowest JPEG quality settings).  Since JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display on 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for *all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what comes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors. This happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a little differently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets \\\"smeared\\\" into a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to display a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image source.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.  (Incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see posted images described as \\\"256-color JPEG\\\".  This tells me that the poster (a) hasn't read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF. JPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but number of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG.)  On the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to 256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its palette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.) For purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to. This is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you're stuck with the sender's quantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image. Furthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantization algorithm, you're out of luck.  For this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware. JPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's display hardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in this area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG images you already have.  With a GIF, you're stuck forevermore with what was sent.  It's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA display, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it's also due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average GIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!  Finally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display hardware already: 15-bit \\\"hi-color\\\" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on workstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already obsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their display.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively. Thus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images in a machine-independent fashion.   [8]  How does JPEG work?  The buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine transforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy coding.  This article's long enough already, so I'm not going to say more than that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ. This is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files /pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in using the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.   [9]  What about lossless JPEG?  There's a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the final output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG algorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few implementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.  Saying \\\"-Q 100\\\" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image. What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say \\\"-sample 1x1\\\" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial JPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)  Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG algorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye, but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.  At this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG provides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees bit-for-bit accuracy.  If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the JBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG lossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with 6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a Huffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.   [10]  Why all the argument about file formats?  Strictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms; it does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations.  Since we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of official standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to \\\"do their own thing\\\", and as a result their programs aren't compatible with anybody else's.  The closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work that's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined two JPEG-based file formats:   * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a \\\"low-end\\\" format that transports     pixels and not much else.   * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is     a \\\"high-end\\\" format that will let you record just about everything you     ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is     a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,     because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different     and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It's not likely that adding JPEG to the     mix will do anything to improve this situation. Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of JPEG-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards.  I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in picture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the TIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well defined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported \\\"lowest common denominator\\\"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.  A particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTime software for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped inside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and QuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are available to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor that handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF by hand; see section 11 for details.  Another particular case is Handmade Software's programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and Image Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF format.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by HSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be used for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This applies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF format by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format files, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)   [11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?  If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read, it's likely to be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:  1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,     followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'JFIF'.  2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a     \\\"raw JPEG\\\" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---     it's worth a try, anyway.  3.  HSI files start with 'hsi1'.  You're out of luck unless you have HSI     software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they     won't decompress properly with non-HSI programs.  4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred     bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for 'JFIF').  Strip off     everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.  5.  Anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are     lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.     If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),     try stripping off everything before that.  In uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is   \\\"begin\\\" line  M_]C_X ...  whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with   \\\"begin\\\" line  M:'-I ...  If you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of downloading non-JFIF files.   [12]  What about arithmetic coding?  The JPEG spec defines two different \\\"back end\\\" modules for the final output of compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed. The choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the file-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)  Unfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the JPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi. Thus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses from these companies.  (The \\\"fair use\\\" doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best.)  At least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify the potential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not* be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.  There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future.  Stay tuned for further details.   [13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?  It would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could decompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially. Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered image loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the first time around.  The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an identical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current free JPEG software.  It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation output.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.) One of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.  In any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original quality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation. (If you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move. If you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but that's a mighty limited capability!)  The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format (PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are ready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot of compression/decompression time this way :-).   [14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?  As stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original full-color data the GIF was made from, it's far better to make a JPEG from that.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from, here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality.  The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to make sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF; that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in section 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors don't convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality will be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)  Experience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best candidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation. Don't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don't expect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created directly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through JPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file, not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).  Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color border around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts (\\\"ghost\\\" edges).  Do yourself a favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows system, XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this.)  cjpeg's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but for GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher Q setting may not be necessary.)  Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually \\\"dithered\\\" to fool your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store. If you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The trouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency color noise; and JPEG can't compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it). To get around this, you want to \\\"smooth\\\" the GIF image before compression. Smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of the compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image than you'd get without smoothing.  With the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing capability is built in.  Try \\\"-smooth 10\\\" or so when converting GIFs. Values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular fine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong smoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image, which you don't want.  If you are an image processing wizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as pnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg's built-in smoother is a LOT faster than pnmconvol...  The upshot of all this is that \\\"cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10\\\" is probably a good starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the image, you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.   ---------------------  For more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in particular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net. \",\" Hello net.

I don't think \\\"extra-scientific\\\" is a very useful phrase in a discussion of the boundaries of science, except as a proposed definiens.  Extra-rational is a better phrase.  In fact, there are quite a number of well-known cases of extra-rational considerations driving science in a useful direction.  For example, Pasteur discovered that racemic acid was a mixture of enantiomers (the origin of stereochemistry) partly because he liked a friend's crank theory of chemical action.  The friend was wrong, but Pasteur's discovery stood.  A prior investigator (Mitscherlich), looking at the same phenomenon, had missed a crucial detail; presumably because he lacked Pasteur's motivation to find something that distinguished racemic acid from tartaric (now we say: d-tartaric) acid.  Again, Pasteur discovered the differential fermentation of enantiomers (tartaric acid again) not because of some rational conviction, but because he was trying to produce yeast that lived on l-tartaric acid.  His notebooks contained fantasies of becoming the \\\"Newton of mirror-image life,\\\" which he never admitted publically.  Perhaps the best example is the discovery that DNA carries genes.  Avery started this work because of one of his students, and ardent Anglophile and Francophobe Canadian, defended Fred Griffiths' discoveries in mice. Most of Griffiths' critics were French, which decided the issue for the student.

I walked by, and they were showing real-time video capture using a (Radious or SuperMac?) card to digitize and make right on the spot quicktime movies.  I think the quicktime they were using was the old one (1.5).     They digitized a guy talking there in 160x2xx something.  It played back quite nicely and in real time.  The guy then expanded the window (resized) to 25x by 3xx (320 in y I think) and the frame rate decreased enough to notice that it wasn't 30fps (or about 30fps) anymore.  It dropped to like 15 fps.  Then he increased it just a bit more, and it dropped to 10<->12 fps.      Then I asked him what Mac he was using... He was using a Quadra (don't know what model, 900?) to do it, and he was telling the guys there that the Quicktime could play back at the same speed even on an LCII.     Well, I spoiled his claim so to say, since a 68040 Quadra Mac was having a little bit of trouble.  And this wasn't even from the hardisk!  This was from memory!

It is also closer to 4 m in diameter.   You've hit on the real kicker, however. The Centaur is pressure stabilized.  It cannot hold up its own weight without pressure in the tanks. Additionally,  the pressure difference between the two tanks must be maintained to ~+/- 5 psi.  That is rather tight to be rocking and rolling on the train. The pressure  stabilization is how centaur achieves the performance. On numerous occasions (when I was there 88-91) the AF wanted to see what it would take to make  a non-pressure stabilized centaur.

The Bible does not have a  message -- it has messages.  And some of those are messages of repentance and giving, to turn the other cheek, and do unto the least of these.  But some of the messages are the complete opposite.  Like the isrealites order to  wipe out other tribes including women and children down to cattle, and  punished severely when they were less than complete about the job.  Like jews who are said to have cried out in Matthew, \\\"His blood be upon our heads and our childrens heads\\\" A verse quoted in every pogrom from the crusades to the holocaust.  Have these been misunderstood?  I think not.  They have only been understood too clearly.  It is essential that christians grasp firmly the good the bible teaches, the meek carpenter from Nazareth is a potent  symbol for how we should be, his teachings we must take to heart, but we cannot ignore the other material in the bible which is not to our liking and say those who live by that have misread it.  To say that is only to chose a point of interpretation and declare it normative.  Such can be done with the same legitmacy by anyone.  Instead we must let the text critique the text. Understanding that there is both good and bad in our sacred corpus, we test all things and hold fast to that which is good.   At the risk of sounding heretical (well ok, more heretical) I don't think that doubt is something which requires forgiveness, it is something which requires introspection and reflection.  If that is a sin, then there can be no salvation, for doubt is an inescapble part of being human.  Consider Job.  His friends had no doubt. Whereas Job had no doubt in himself but doubted the wisdom and justice of God.  When God finally did appear he  rebuked the friends and had job make sacrifices for them.

Chris  \",\"Howdy,  I'm a little new to this newsgroup, but I would like to tap some of the knowledge and expertise available here.  The Subject:  After-market cruise controls  The Background: I recently broke my ankle in a road-bicycling accident (4 places, five  screws, yuk! :-( ).  In two weeks I will be returning to Texas (my home) from my school (BYU) in Provo, Utah.  As you can imagine, trying to drive nearly 1300 miles with a broken right ankle isn't just the epitome of a good time.  My car does not have a cruise control, so I would have to do all the pedalling (ha ha) with my messed-up ankle.  My question: What is the general opinion of after-market cruise control units?  I realize that a cheap CC (cruise control) from, say, Pep Boys, isn't going to be as good as a factory or professionally installed unit (if there is such a thing).  And I uderstand that I probably can't expect much in the way of accuracy, looks and that sort of thing;  But anything's gotta be better than trying to drive with a hosed ankle.  I have a 1984 Jeep Cherokee, 4 speed, standard, 4*4, 2.5L engine with kettering(sp?) ignition (y'know, distributor cap, rotor, that set-up--not electronic.  Maybe you could've guessed it being an '84, but I'm just trying to give information as completly as I can).  I found a CC unit for 80 bucks.  It seems to use the vehicles vacuum system  instead of an electric servor/motor.  Is this good or bad?  If I did buy this CC, which vacuum hose should I tap?  It has two speed sensors:  One magnetic, and one that gets a signal from the  negative side of the distributor, kinda like a tach pick-up, or so I understand.  I can use either one.  Which is best?  The manual says (I read it in the store today) that the magnetic/axle set-up is more accurate, but harder to install.  Is there really a big difference?  It has a sensor for the brake pedal, just like other CCs, but does NOT have a sensor for the clutch pedal.  So if I wasn't paying real close attention I might push the clutch in while the cruise is trying to get the speed up.  Which would wind the engine up kinda high until I got my wits about me and turned  the thing off.  I'm pretty coordinated, so this doesn't bother me, if it were for my girlfriends car, *then* it would bother me, but I'm ok with it.  The installation also calls for an attachment to a steady-on brake signal and a switched-on brake signal.  I think I can get a switched brake signal from the correct side of the brake light blade fuse.  Am I right?  But I'm not sure where to get the steady-on brake signal, or, for that matter, what exactly it is?  Any ideas as to what the manufaturer wants and where to get it?  I think I can figure the other things out.  Like how to hook-up the negative side tach-type sensing gizmo and the cabin control unit, and the ground and all that miscellaneous business.  But I need a little help with:   1.  Is it worth the money and safety risk (if any) for such a      device?  2.  Is there any particularly good after-market CC?  3.  Are \\\"professionally\\\" installed CCs signifacantly better and      worth the cabbage?  4.  If the unit I saw (sorry, no manufacturer or model number, just      that it is at Pep Boy and its $80) is sufficient for my simple       needs, how do I get the thing installed properly (specifically,      the questions above)?  My father and I built a \\\"Veep\\\" (Volkswagen powered Jeep CJ-2A) when I was in high school, so I consider myself fairly good with tools, electronics, and cars.  So the installation doesn't scare me.  I just want to be certain that I get the thing installed correctly as my Cherokee is just a wee bit more complicated than my Veep. :-)  I appreciate your time in reading my post, and I would appreciate any expertise or opinion anybody has on the subject.

That's *your* *interpretation* of these texts.   2 Peter 1:20-21 But know this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture is a matter  of one's own interpretation, for no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.  The study notes in my Bible offer three possible meanings for verse 20. Apparantly it's not as clear to Charles Ryrie as it is to you.  2 Timothy 3:16-17 All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work.  Galations 1:11-12 For I would have you know, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man.  For I neither received it from man,  nor was I taught it, but I receieved it through a revelation of Jesus Christ.  When I read these passages, it was not immediately clear to me what every phrase meant.  I had stop and think about the possible connotations of words, what the intent of the author may have been, wonder if the translator used the correct English word to convey the  same meaning: I had to interpret.  If you want to believe that your  are not interpreting Scripture as you read, there's probably nothing  I can say to change your mind.  But I think it's naive to think that  our culture, experiences, education, do not affect everything we read.   In college, I took an entire course in Biblical interpretation.  Go to any Christian bookstore, there are scores of books on interpreting and understanding Scripture.

I bought my machine a couple of weeks ago as well and started to experience these problems.  Apple Australia via my dealer said that this problem has a number of potential causes - Faulty applications, faulty third party hardware (modems, memory etc), system software, PRAM corruption and power manager corruption, and the Duo hardware itself.  None of the above are relevant in my case except the last two maybe (no applications were running, the system software was re-installed, I have no additional hardware). I have found that clearing PRAM appears to help for a while at least (hold down command option P and R on startup). Unfortunately the problem returns suggesting that PRAM is being corrupted by something (system software bug ? - I don't have any non-issue inits in my system). Apparently the Power Manager can be reset by \\\"holding the reset and interrupt buttons while powering up\\\" - Apple's advice - but since the Duo does not have an interrupt button I'm not sure what they mean in this case. This may also help if someone can decipher Apple's advice for me.  Beyond this Apple suggest that \\\" you should follow the technical procedures to check the hardware of this Duo\\\". Since so many others appear to be having the same problem it would seem to me that there has been a system software bug introduced somewhere along the line - and quite recently too - since it only seems to be recent Duo 230 purchasers who have this problem.

The Roman Empire lasted until 1453, with its transfered capital in Constantinople.  The main reason for it's fall was not so much the sack of Constantinople by the men of the 4th Crusade (who were not Christians - they had been excommunicated down to the last man after attacking the Christian city of Zara in Croatia), but rather the disastorous defeat in the battle of Mazinkert.  After the Turks breached the frontier, it was only a matter of time before the Empire fell, the inability of the Empire to hold onto the rim of Anatolia, with the Ottomans and Rum Seljuks in the middle should be quite obvious to any student of history.  The sack of Constantinople only hastened the inevitable along.  For if the Greeks had wanted to save their empire, why would they not cooperate with the Crusaders when they came to do battle with the Saracens in the 1st-3rd Crusades?  Because of their obstinacy over cooperating with people they considered heretics, even though those \\\"heretics\\\" were fighting for the cause of the Empire and Christendom in doing battle with the Turkish hordes in Anatolia, Edessa, Lebanon, Palastine, and Syria, the some hordes who were to later sack Constantinople, and overrun a third of Europe (the Balkans, Hungary, the Ukraine, the Caucasus, etc.)\",\" There was a Volvo owner that had $3000 dollars worth of improvements to the  looks of the car by hail :). \",\"]I wrote the slash two blues for a bit of humor which seems to be lacking ]in the MOA Owners News, when most of the stuff is \\\"I rode the the first ]day, I saw that, I rode there the second day, I saw this\\\"   I admit it was a surprise to find something interesting to read in  the most boring and worthless mag of all the ones I get.  ]any body out there know were the sense if humor went in people? ]I though I still had mine, but I dunno...

Any uniform once on him was gone, so   I'd no proof which he was, and quickly went out, gagging at the mess of his    slashed genitals.\\\"  p. 363 (first paragraph).    'How many people lived there?'  'Oh, about eight hundred.' He yawned.  'Did you see any Turk officers?'  'No, sir. I was in at dawn. All were Tartar civilians in mufti.'   \\\"The lieutenant dozed off, then I, but in the small hours a voice woke me -   Dro's. He stood in the starlight bawling out an officer. Anyone keelhauled  so long and furiously I'd never heard. Then abruptly Dro broke into   laughter, quick and simple as child's. Both were a cover for his sense  of guilt, I thought, or hoped. For somehow, despite my boast of irreligion,  Christian massacring 'infidels' was more horrible than the reverse would  have been.   From daybreak on, Armenian villagers poured in from miles around.....  The women plundered happily, chattering like ravens as they picked over  the carcass of Djul. They hauled out every hovel's chattels, the last   scrap of food or cloth, and staggered away, packing pots, saddlebags,   looms, even spinning-wheels.   'Thank you for a lot, Dro,' I said to him back in camp. 'But now I must   leave.'...We shook hands, the captain said 'A bientot, mon camarade.' And   for hours the old Molokan scout and I plodded north across parching plains.   Like Lot's wife I looked back once to see smoke bathing all, doubtless in   a sack of other Moslem villages up to the line of snow that was Iran.'\\\"  p. 354.  \\\"At morning tea, Dro and his officers spread out a map of this whole  high region called the Karabakh. Deep in tactics, they spoke Russian,  but I got their contempt for Allied 'neutral' zones and their distrust  of promises made by tribal chiefs. A campaign shaped; more raids on  Moslem villages.\\\"  p. 358.  \\\"It will be three hours to take,\\\" Dro told me. We'd close in on three  sides. \\\"The men on foot will not shoot, but use only the bayonets,\\\" Merrimanov said, jabbing a rifle in dumbshow. \\\"That is for morale,\\\" Dro put in. \\\"We must keep the Moslems in terror.\\\" \\\"Soldiers or civilians?\\\" I asked. \\\"There is no difference,\\\" said Dro. \\\"All are armed, in uniform or not.\\\" \\\"But the women and children?\\\" \\\"Will fly with the others as best they may.\\\"  p. 360.  \\\"The ridges circled a wide expanse, its floors still. Hundreds of feet   down, the fog held, solid as cotton flock. 'Djul lies under that,' said   Dro, pointing. 'Our men also attack from the other sides.'   Then, 'Whee-ee!' - his whistle lined up all at the rock edge. Bayonets  clicked upon carbines. Over plunged Archo, his black haunches rippling;  then followed the staff, the horde - nose to tail, bellies taking the  spur. Armenia in action seemed more like a pageant than war, even though   I heard our Utica brass roar.   As I watched from the height, it took ages for Djul to show clear. A tsing  of machine-gun fire took over from the thumping batteries; cattle lowed,  dogs barked, invisible, while I ate a hunk of cheese and drank from a snow  puddle. Mist at last folded upward as men shouted, at first heard faintly.  The came a shrill wailing.   Now among the cloud-streaks rose darker wisps - smoke. Red glimmered about  house walls of stone or wattle, into dry weeds on roofs. A mosque stood in  clump of trees, thick and green. Through crooked alleys on fire, horsemen  were galloping after figures both mounted and on foot.   'Tartarski!' shouted the gunner by me. Others pantomimed them in escape  over the rocks, while one twisted a bronze shell-nose, loaded, and yanked  breech-cord, firing again and again. Shots wasted, I thought, when by  afternoon I looked in vain for fallen branch or body. But these shots and  the white bursts of shrapnel in the gullies drowned the women's cries.   At length all shooting petered out. I got on my horse and rode down toward  Djul. It burned still but little flame showed now. The way was steep and   tough, through dense scrub. Finally on flatter ground I came out suddenly,  through alders, on smoldering houses. Across trampled wheat my brothers-in-  arms were leading off animals, several calves and a lamb.\\\"  p. 361 (fourth paragraph).  \\\"Corpses came next, the first a pretty child with straight black hair,   large eyes. She looked about twelve years old. She lay in some stubble   where meal lay scattered from the sack she'd been toting. The bayonet   had gone through her back, I judged, for blood around was scant. Between   the breasts one clot, too small for a bullet wound, crusted her homespun   dress.   The next was a boy of ten or less, in rawhide jacket and knee-pants. He   lay face down in the path by several huts. One arm reached out to the   pewter bowl he'd carried, now upset upon its dough. Steel had jabbed   just below his neck, into the spine.    There were grownups, too, I saw as I led the sorrel around. Djul was   empty of the living till I looked up to see beside me Dro's German-speaking   colonel. He said all Tartars who had not escaped were dead.\\\"  p. 358.   \\\"...more stories of Armenian murdering Turks when the czarist troops fled   north.

The OT game winner came from Dimitri Yushkevich, just his 5th of the season and his first game winner. The FLYERS never led up until that point in the game. For the Whalers, the loss marked an NHL record 9th OT loss this season.  Roster move:  Gord Hynes was called to to play in place of Ryan McGill  Injuries:  Ryan McGill injured his hand in a fight 4/15 and was scratched.  Lines:  Eklund-Lindros-Recchi Beranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen Lomakin-Butsayev-Conroy Faust-Acton-Brown  Galley-Bowen Yushkevich-Hawgood Carkner-Hynes  Dominic Roussel  Game Summary:  I didn't get TV coverage of the game, and since it was stormy in these parts I didn't have the best radio coverage either. Here's the box score followed by a few things I did pick up:  First Period:  Hartford, Nylander 10, 8:51  Philadelphia, Recchi 53 (Lindros, Brind'Amour), 19:59.8 (pp) Penalties - Verbeek, Har (holding), :55; Carkner, Phi (roughing), 13:53; Houda, Har (interference) 18:43  Second Period:  Hartford, Burt 6 (Cunneyworth, Kron), 2:00  Philadelphia, Bowen 1 (Eklund, Recchi), 7:09  Hartford, Nylander 11 (Zalapski, Sanderson), 9:38 Penalties - Galley, Phi, major-game misconduct (spearing) :58; Verbeek, Har major-game misconduct (spearing), :58; Brown, Phi (tripping), 3:22; Zalapski, Har (tripping), 15:51; Brind'Amour, Phi (slashing), 19:50  Third Period:  Hartford, Kron 14 (Sanderson, Cassels), 1:24 (pp)  Philadelphia, Beranek 15 (Lomakin, Yushkevich), 3:11  Philadelphia, Faust 2 (Brind'Amour, Roussel), 3:38 Penalties - Houda, Har (tripping), 4:20; Hawgood, Phi (holding), 5:30  Overtime:  Philadelphia, Yushkevich 5 (Faust), 1:15. Penalties - None  Power Play:  Philadelphia 1 of 4, Hartford 1 of 4  Goalies:  Philadelphia, Roussel 14-11-5 (30 shots - 26 saves)  Hartford, Lenarduzzi, 1-1-1 (38 - 33)  On the first Hartford goal, Gord Hynes misplayed the puck at the FLYERS blue line and Nylander stripped him and took off.  The Recchi goal was a 2 on 1 with Lindros.  The Bowen goal was just a puck he threw at the net, got a good carom and it ended up behind the goalie.  On the second Nylander goal he got three whacks at the puck before it went in. This is the most frustrating part of the FLYERS defense. Take the body, and if they get one shot and beat you fine. Don't give them another chance. Carkner, Galley and McGill are all terrible about this, I'll bet money at least one of them was the closest FLYER to the play.  That's all I have, my radio got bad after that and I was lucky to know who it was that scored, much less how.  From what I heard, Roussel had a very strong game. After the game, Gene Hart asked Bobby Taylor to pick the three stars of the season rather than of the game. It was Garry Galley #3 for his career high point total (I'm surprised that a former goalie wouldn't look closer at his defensive play), Tommy  Soderstrom #2 for his team record tying 5 shutouts in only about 1/2 a season and, Mark Recchi #1 for his all time high team single season scoring mark. But here's the odd part. He couldn't decide between Lindros and Recchi for number 1. If he picks Recchi as #1 after he had a hard time choosing between him and Lindros, doesn't that make Lindros #2????  What? You wanna know my three stars of the season? Well, since you asked...  #1 Eric Lindros. Eric dominates a game simply by stepping out onto the ice. The difference between the team's record with him and without him is no accident. I believe that the team could have been almost as successful without Recchi. There is no question that this team is significantly better with Eric Lindros on it, and I think that he will deservedly wear the 'C' on his jersey next season.  #2 Tommy Soderstrom. 5 shutouts was second in the league to only Ed Belfour, and Tommy didn't have a Chris Chelios (booo) in front of him. He also didn't play a complete season due to heart problems (sentimental edge here, my family has a history of heart problems). There's no question in my mind that Tommy Soderstrom is this teams goalie of the future, and if Roussel complains again about being number 2 look for him to be traded within 2 years.  #3 Mark Recchi. Again, you can't argue with an all-time team high single season scoring mark. There are an awful lot of teams that didn't have a single player get as many points. Plus, Mark is the only FLYER to play the entire season. Not a tough choice.  Honorable mentions: Rod Brind'Amour topped his single season high point total which he set last year. The difference was that he wasn't on the top line this year and didn't get as much playing time. Then again, he didn't get the defensive attention that he got last year from the other team either.  Dimtri Yushkevich was the teams most consistent defenseman. Yes, he made rookie mistakes, but he was usually fast enough to make up for them. I have a feeling that with his shot he'll score a few more points next year without giving up anything in his own zone, and I suspect that he'll be the teams top defenseman in years to come.  Garry Galley was the team's point leader from defensemen. Again, there are some things you just can't argue with. And he battled with chronic fatigue syndrome, he certainly deserves kudos for only missing one game, and that was against his wishes under doctors orders. But his defensive play often negates his offensive contribution. A little more caution, and a little bit smarter in his own end will make him a much more important part of the team next year.  Brent Fedyk was the leagues biggest improvement over last years point total. But consistency became a problem for him.

They finished 17th overall, will draft 10th in next years entry draft (Quebec had the 1st rounder, though). They scored as many goals as they allowed, 319.  The 8 straight wins is the most since they won 13 in a row in 1985.

Too much in the diet, and the system gets thrown off.

Also the Mets (my other least  favorite team) loss to the Rockies made this this a great day and a  great start to the weekend as the Cardinals are on the ESPN tonight.  Big Lee Smith is having a great start and the Cardinals seem to be hitting in the clutch even though they have had a few games with lots of hits and not many runs.  Hopefully with the coaches stress on situational hitting in spring training, the runners LOB will be lower this year (probably due to the high strikeout numbers by Jose and Lankford and Zeile's off year).

Some of your charges are arguable, but most of them are obvious lies.  I challenge you to present us with any evidence that Nixon stole, rigged a national election, never mind elections, or used the powers of his office for personal gain.

Even if it were possible, I think it is a bad idea since it smacks real strongly of double jeopardy.  A civil case for damages is fine since that is a trial that would proceed regardless of the first.  I think a bad precedent has already been set in the King trial in L.A. and something like this would make it worse.

Sure -- only 3.8 years for each solution.     But there is a MUCH more pernicious problem with the scheme as proposed.  Building a brute force machine to test 2^40 possible keys if you have the other half from one escrow agent is EASY.  (One chip, one test per microsecond gives you one break every two weeks, and that break gives you all messages involving that phone.)     The XOR scheme so that the files from one escrow agent gives you nothing is an improvement, but notice that XORing with (truely random) bit strings allows for an arbitrary number of escrow agents.  Using + for XOR, SK for the escrowed key, and A and B for two random bit strings, hand SK+A+B, SK+A, and SK+B to three escrow agents.  It is possible to come with an encoding scheme to match any escrow pattern, for example 3 of 4, such that fewer cooperating escrow agents gives the cracking agency no benefit.  --       Robert I.

This complexity has led to some programs' poor TIFF writers making some very bizarre files, other programs' inability to load TIFF images (though they'll save them, of course), and a general inability to interchange images between different environments despite the fact they all think they understand TIFF.  As the saying goes, \\\"It's not me I'm worried about- it's all the abuse of TIFF over the years, and I chalk it all up to the immense (and unnecessary) complexity of the format.  In the words of the TIFF 5.0 spec, Appendix G, page G-1 (capitalized emphasis mine):  \\\"The only problem with this sort of success is that TIFF was designed to be powerful and flexible, at the expense of simplicity.  It takes a fair amount of effort to handle all the options currently defined in this specification (PROBABLY NO APPLICATION DOES A COMPLETE JOB), and that is currently the only way you can be >sure< that you will be able to import any TIFF image, since there are so many image-generating applications out there now.\\\"   If a program (or worse all applications) can't read >every< TIFF image, that means there are some it won't- some that I might have to deal with.  Why would I want my images to be trapped in that format?  I don't and neither should anyone who agrees with my reasoning- not that anyone does, of course! :-)\",\"Can anybody tell me how to use the Xmu function \\\"XmuCvtStringToWidget\\\".

Were there anti-trust laws in place in mandatory Palestine? Since the answer is no, you're argument, while interestingly constructed, is irrelevant.  I will however, respond to a few points you assert in the course of talking about anti-trust laws.     And those fleeing Arab lands, where Jews were second class citizens.     Jews often paid far more than fair market value for the land they bought.    You know, Sam, when people start talking about an International Jewish conspiracy, its really begins to sound like anti-Semitic bull.   The reason there is no conspiracy here is quite simple. Zionists made no bones about what was going on.  There were conferences, publications, etc, all talking about creating a National home for the Jews.    [...]   Because you've never heard of it, its dead?  The fact is, you claimed Israel had to give arabs rights because of (non-existant) International aid.  Then you see that that argument has a hole you could drive a truck through, and again assert that Israel is only democratic within the (unexplained) constraints of one ethnic group. The problem with that argument is that Arabs are allowed to vote for whoever they please.  So, please tell me, Sam, what constraints are there on Israeli democracy that don't exist in other democratic states?   I've never heard anything about the Khazakistani arab population.  Does that mean that they have no history or roots?  When I was at Ben Gurion university in Israel, one of my neighbors was an Israeli arab.  He wasn't really all that different from my other neighbors.  Does that make him dead or oppressed?     How recent is recent?  I can probably build a case for a Jewish Gaza city.

David,    As an economist, I'm sure you can see the flaws in this logic. If the (naive) market is flooded with proprietary, but weak, encryption, then truly strong  encryption will be unable to compete. Suppose the govt had a secret TV broadcast standard, and then sold TVs below cost. Private industry has a better standard, but it's not as widespread due to the govt early flooding of the market with cheap proprietary sets. Even though the industry's technology is better, the programming is being broadcast to the govt's unduplicatable standard. Who could compete?    The other flaw, of course, is that making something voluntary today ensures that it will be voluntary in the future.

Steve -- \",\" PC Magazine, January 12, 1993 had a review of several personal finance management programe, as did PC-Computing, January 1993.  PC World, December 1992 also had articles about Quicken and Managing Your Money. I can email you copies of these articles if you can't find them at your library.  I've been using Managing Your Money for several years, and I have several friends who use Quicken, though I've not used it myself.  My overall impression is that Quicken is a financial accounts manager while Managing Your Money will help you more completely manage your finances.  Here are some features that I believe Managing Your Money and Quicken share:   The ability to keep records for each of your financial accounts:  checking, savings, charge, cash, or brokerage.  You can reconcile  your account statements with the records the program keeps.   The ability to make a budget and track your spending against that  budget.   A Checkfree module which will allow you to use the Checkfree bill  paying service to pay your bills via your modem.    The ability to print checks on your printer.   The ability to keep loan records and set up automatic loan payments.   The ability to import stock quotations to keep your brokerage accounts  up to date.  I know Managing Your Money can do this automatically  via modem.  Quicken probably can as well, but I'm not sure about it.   The ability to export tax information to popular tax preparation  programs.   Here are some features that I believe Managing Your Money has that Quicken does not:   A tax prediction module.  This looks at your accounts and budget to  predict your tax liability for the coming year.  It's usefull to fine  tune your withholding so Uncle Sam doesn't get his due too early.   An insurance and vital records module.  This is a place to keep  records of your insurance policies as well as other vital records.  It can also compute your life expectancy.   A financial analysis module.  This computes compound interest,   effects of inflation, loan payments term or interest, yield to  maturity for bonds, savings account yields, days between dates, and  loan amortization schedules.  It also has functions to help you   decide whether to refinance your mortgage, whether you can afford  a particular home, whether a particular rental property is a good  investment, whether you should buy lease or rent, and whether  a particular investment's cash flow is adequate for your situation.  This module can also help you plan for retirement and for helping  your kids with their tuition.     A net worth module.  This is a place to record all your assets  and liabilities.  Your net worth can be computed from this   information.  Any assets or liabilities recorded in other modules  are automatically included here.   A \\\"desk\\\" module.  This includes a small word processor, a card file  you can use to store names, addresses, phone numbers and other vital  information about friends and associates, a perpetual calander, a  rudimentary calculator, a to-do list, a reminder list, an appointment  list, and a place to record your phone calls (for those who need to  track such things).  Your appointments, reminders and to-do list  can be made to display automatically when you start the program.

By the 1920s, there was a very active \\\"good roads\\\" movement, which had its origins actually in the 1890s during the bicycle craze, picked up steam in the teens (witness the Linclon Highway Association, 1912 or so, and the US highway support act (real name: something different) in 1916 that first pledged federal aid to states and counties to build decent roads. Also, the experience of widespread use of trucks for domestic transport during WW 1 convinced the government that good raods were crucial to our national defense.  Anyway, by the 20s there were plenty of good roads, at least around urban areas, and they were rapidly expanding into the countryside.  This was the era, after all, of the first auto touring fad, the motel, the auto camp ground, etc. Two good books on the subject spring to mind - Warren Belasco \\\"America on the Road\\\" (title may not be exact - author is) and another called \\\"The Devil Wagon in God's Country\\\" author I forget.  Also, any of John Flink's  or John Bell Rae's auto histories.  As to placement of the steering wheel being arbitrary, by the early teens there were virtually no American cars that did not have the wheel on the left.  In the early days, cars had the wheel on the left, on the right, and even in the middle, as well as sometimes having a tiller instead of a wheel.  This was standardized fairly early on, though I don't know why.

ISA has no bus arbitration, so if two busmastering cards in 1 ISA system try to do DMA xfers on the same DMA channel the system will lock or  crash.(I forget)  Their are 8 DMA channels in an ISA system. 0-7. 0-3 are 8-bit & 4-7 are 16-bit.  The system uses DMA 0, a SoundBlaster uses DMA 1.  I could buy a busmastering XGA-2 video card & a busmastering SCSI HA.  In order for them to work properly, I would have to find out what DMA channel the XGA-2 card uses and then simply configure the SCSI HA to use a different DMA channel for its DMA xfers.  I don't know if multiple DMA xfers can go on at the same time on ISA. I'm not sure if they can on EISA systems either.

Of course if there is some reason why you need to always know the state of modifiers even if your windows don't have the keyborads focus you can always ask for KeyPress events from the root window.  Then you get all the KeyPresses and you always know what have been pressed.   I think this is just a question of how to implement XLookupString. You can always write another function that interprets the KeyPresses as you like.  You can look at the implementation of XLookupString from the Xlib sources and then modify it a little bit.\",\" How does that saying go: Those who say it can't be done shouldn't interrupt those who are doing it.

If you don't have an XUSERFILESEARCHPATH environment variable then set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to be the directory where the BuilderXcessory file is. You can do this using the setenv command under csh. Note that the name ends in .ad so you will have to set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to {BX}/%N.ad to get the app-defaults to load correctly.     To make sure the the app-defaults file can be read by all the users, make sure that a copy of or a link to the app-defaults file exists in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults or  /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults, depending on how your system is set up.     Once you have taken care of this set the *systemDirectory resource to be the directory in which you have installed BX.  For example let's say I've installed BX in /t then my system directory resource should be set like this :  *systemDirectory: /t/builderXcessory\",\"Just a little something I found while reading the Village Voice, which is not noted for its sports coverage, but occasionally the print some interesting features.

Yes (2) What CPU is in the Mac Portable? A low power version of the 68000  running at 15.87 Mhz. (3) Does the Mac Portable run system 7? Yes, although it does use up a  lot of memory. (4) Is memory still availabe for the Portable? There are several vendors  that still make RAM for the Portable. There are two options: Some vendors  sell memory that plugs into the RAM Slot inside the portable. Others sell  memory that plugs into the Processor Direct Slot. Either way, the most  memory you can address is either 8 or 9 megabytes, depending on whether  the Portable is Backlit or not. King Memory and Peripherials in Irvine  California is the cheapest place I know of for Portable memory. 2MB -  $140, 4 MB, $250, and 7 MB $415. I still see several ads in macuser that  are selling 4 MB modules for $450. Wide variety in pricing here. (5) What is the internal HD? Its a Conner CP-3045 40 MB HD with an  average access time of about 25 ms. (6) Is the screen better that the PB 100? Heavens yes! The PB 100 is a  backlit PASSIVE matrix screen which means it fades out on you if you move  your head a few degrees left or right. The Portable has a backlit or  non-backlit ACTIVE Matrix screen which I think is a joy to read.  Other things to consider - Where to get the portable and how much to pay  for it? A good supplier has been SelectTerm in Mass. They were willing to  sell a 2MB Non-backlit Portable with an internal 2400 bps modem for about  $650. Or a 4 MB Backlit Portable with an internal 2400 bps modem for  about $900.   The answer is call around for a good while or you'll pay too much.

I have an appl. which uses 1 window to draw in.  Since I give the user the capability of scaling and zooming as well as allowing the window to be resized, I made a translation table for the Expose & Configure events. The Expose event calls my redraw method while the Configure event calls my rescale method.  The rescale method invokes a \\\"fake\\\" Expose event (actually just calls the redraw w/ an appropriate Expose struct) to draw the data.  Quest 1. When the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R4 (running in either R4 or R5 env.) I get multiple (>4) redraws when the window gets uncovered or the size is changed.  I assume I'm getting cascading events.  Is that right? Any suggestions as to how to handle/trap events in a better way?  Quest 2. When the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R5 I get no Expose events whatsoever.

With regard to this discussion:  We are getting dangerously far from the usual rantings of t.p.g, and close to the realm of r.g, but I'd like to put my two cents worth in.  While there's nothing wrong with a revolver (especially a  large frame S&W in .357 magnum - my favorite) there are valid advantages to semi-autos.  I suggest reading Massad Ayoob's (I know, some people can't stand him and think he's full of bull, but I think that in general his material is very valid and useful) book _The Semi Auto Pistol in Police Work_ (or something  like that).  He defines a number of ways that semi-auto's are different, and that \\\"different is good\\\".  The main advantage is not in increased firepower, but in  more accurate followup shots when you go to single action mode.  There is also a certain \\\"propriatory nature\\\" of each gun that takes some familiarity to  learn.  This may have diminished with time as more criminals become familiar with different models of semi-autos, but it was cited as stopping or at least slowing down criminals who had grabbed a police officers gun.   Yes, but this is best done with a two hand hold.  With a single hand you either pull the gun far off target to cock, or must fire double action.  The DA semi auto has the same advantages plus is always SA after the first shot.    I'm not sure if this is meant to be different from your first point.  In a DA semi-auto you can pull the trigger again to try dropping the hammer on the same round - an advantage you don't have in a revolver where the next trigger pull will always go to the next round (discussing this point now).  This is fine with a dud but what about a hangfire situation?  Granted it's very rare, but your round will now go off confined in the cylinder with no place to go.  Slingshotting the slide on a misfire takes very little time.    Actually with modern revolver designs incorporating hammer blocks this is not necessary or usually recommended.  A revolver would have to fall hard enough and at the right angle to actually break the hammer and driver the firing pin into the round to set it off.   The best speedloader users, especially those using the spring loaded speed loaders are very fast.  A problem is that ejecting the spent cases is a two handed job where dropping the expended magazine is one handed.  This means that while you can be inserting a fresh magazine as soon as the old one clears the gun, with a speed loader you have to go through more motions that will always  take more time.  You also don't have the advantage of tactical reloads (replacing a partial magazine to bring you back to full capacity - the partial magazine can still be used if needed later).     Yes, the time to recognize the problem is just as important as the time to clear it.  Really though, in either a revolver or semi-auto the odds of an actual misfire with factory ammo are awfully small.  You are more likely to get a jam in a semi-auto but even these are exceptionally rare with modern quality guns (Sigs, Glocks, et.al.).     All common semi-auto's can be carried with a round in their chamber without any safety problems.  While I put that out as a statement that I believe, I should say that this applies to all of the ones I've looked at.  For the DA semi's it's no different from the revolver situation:  The guns all have hammer or firing pin blocks.  They also have a safety.  Because there's no real advantage carrying one of these cocked and locked you have the same safety and speed of employment as a revolver, plus the advantage of SA followup shots.  I'm not familiar with SA semi-autos except for the 1911-A1.  I admit that I was initially skeptical about carrying this cocked and locked, but after examining the design, trying to defeat the safeties (gun unloaded of course), and  shooting it a lot, I see no inherent safety problems with it, especially in a thumbreak holster with the strap under the hammer.  This design also gets you more speed for an accurate first shot than a revolver.   Yeah, the infamous Glock.  I still can't figure out how it's worse than a revolver for safety.  If you don't pull the trigger it doesn't go off.  I imagine that if all your revolver shooting was done double action then you could pull the Glock trigger far enough to fire before you realized it.  In addition, if you had developed that nasty habit of keeping your finger on the trigger when holstering your gun and relying on your thumb on the hammer to remind you to take it off before you blew off your foot then you'd have problems when the hammer wasn't there.   I think this is even okay for a riot (as long as it's a small one B^)).   I have the poor man's Beretta (Taurus 99) and consider it inferior as a carry weapon to the Springfield .45 (oops, 9mm vs. 45 arguments are relegated to r.g).  You are right, though.  If you don't hit what you aim at then the shooter/gun combination has failed.  I don't ascribe failures in the the fire real fast with a wonder-nine scenario you mention to the gun.  This is a shooter failure, whether through lack of discipline or lack of training.    9mm's are becoming more popular with crooks too, though the .38 does still lead the list.  And like I said, around here semi-auto's seem the rule for the street cop.  Don't know about the State Patrol however, they may still carry the \\\"Highway Patrolman\\\".

Thank you for the reproach, I really do appreciate it.  I'll try to get better.  Rob, at the same time, I have also learned that some people respond to the gentle approach while others respond only at a harsh rebuke.  Brian K., so far, only responds to the latter.  And I am glad he responds at all.   In both cases of approach,  my intention is to be loving.  I am making no excuse for myself if I am coming across condesending.  I apologize for that.  Rob, sometimes Brian K. comes across as honest. I know this.  But Brian K.  vasillates back and forth.  One post looks honest; the next is an excuse.  Now he wants me to explain the universe in 50 words or less.   I think Brian Kendig is really trying but he is too comfortable with his set of excuses.    I just want Brian K. to be honest with himself.  If he really wants to know, he will ask questions and stop asserting irrelevant excuses which have nothing to do with my God.   I wish Brian would read the Bible for himself and come to his own decisions without being sidetracked with the temptation to mock God.  From my perspective Rob, when I look at Brian Kendig, I see a man standing out in the middle of a highway.  Off into the distance I  see a Mack truck heading right for him, but Brian K. is faced away from the oncoming truck.  He doesn't see it.   Here's is how I see the dialog:   Me:  \\\"Brian K, please step aside before you get run over.\\\"   BK:  \\\"There is no truck.\\\"  Me:  \\\"Turn around at look.\\\"  BK:  \\\"No.\\\"  Me:  \\\"Look!  You will be healthier if you do take a look at      the oncoming truck.\\\"  BK:  \\\"No. Explain to me why trucks exist.\\\"  Me:  \\\"Turn around or you will run over.\\\"  BK:  \\\"No. I won't because I like hiking and tomorrow is Tuesday.\\\"  Me:  \\\"You blind fool!  Why do you choose ignorance? You have nothing       to lose if you look.  But if do not look, you will certainly lose your life.\\\"       I do not want to see you squashed all over the road.  BK:  \\\"It is my life to lose.  I rather not look.       Besides, a truck running over me will not harm me.\\\"       And by the way, I really have an open mind.\\\"   So is my motivation to belittle Brian, or to love Brian the best I know how?     I do not wish to single Brian Kendig out.  Because millions if not billions of people fall into the same category.  Perhaps all people fall have fallen into this category at one time in their lives.  I have. I can now see the truck behind Brian.  My hope is that Brian will look and will see the ramifications of the truck coming towards him.  My hope is that Brian will want to step out of the way.  My fear, though,  is that Brian will instead choose to glue himself to the middle of the highway, where he will certainly get run over.  But if he so chooses, he so chooses, and there is nothing I can do beyond that to change his mind.   For it is his choice.   But at this very moment, Brian hasn't gotten even that far.  He is still at the point where he does not want to look.  Sure he moves his eyeball to appease me, but his head will not turn around to see the entire picture.  So far he is satisfied with his glimpse of the mountains off in the distance. \",\"When I use telix (or kermit) in WIN 3.1, or use telix after exiting windows to dos, telix can not find the serial port.

Of course, as Henry pointed out, vetical landings aren't quite that simple.   Well, to be blunt, yes.  But at least you're learning.   The Soyuz vehicles use parachutes for the descent and then fire small rockets just before they hit the ground.

The name of the company is Secure Communicatiions Technology (Information will be given at the end of this message on how to contact them).     Basically they are disturbed about the announcement for many reasons that we are. More specifically however, Mr. Bryen of Secure Communications brought to light many points that might interest most of the readers.     His belief is that AT&T was made known of the clipper well before the rest of the industry. This is for several reasons, several of which are:   - A company of AT&T's size could never be able to make a decision to use    the new chip on the SAME DAY it was announced.   - Months ago they proposed using their own chip for AT&T's secure telephone    devices. AT&T basically blew them off as being not interested at all.    This stuck them as strange, until now...      Also I spoke with Art Melnick, their cryptographer, he expressed several concerns over the new Clipper Chip:    - The obvious backdoor will be able to let many people decrypt the code.    - Once the key is released to authorities the security of the crypto     system is lost forever. These keys can end up in the hands of any agency     of the government.    - The fact that the escrowed keys never change means that the algorithm     is vulnerable over time to an attacker.    - The classified algorithm may hide another backdoor. But he feels that     it is probably to keep people from forging fake serial numbers, or     changing the keys themselves.    - Additionally he feels that the NSA has probably spent enough time and     money in working on a way to keep this chip from being reversed     engineered, that he feels that reverse engineering it will be very     difficult to do. He feels that they have developed a suitable technique     to protect the chip from this attack. Also he feels that the chip is     hardware encoded with the algorithm and not microcoded onto the chip.  Additonally I spoke with Mr. Melnick about their algorithm. He couldn't tell me much about their new agorithm because it hasn't been patented yet. However he told me a little:   - The algorithm will be released for public review after patents have been    granted for it. This is so the crypto community can see that it is    secure.   - The algorithm is called NEA for New Encryption Algorithm.    The details were sketchy because now it is held as a trade secret    until the patent was issued, but I was told that it will incorporate    the following:      - It will have fast encryption of data (Exact specs not given, but       Mr. Melnick stated \\\"Much faster than what an RS-232 can put out.\\\")      - It is a symmetric cipher, just like IDEA and DES.      - It will use 64 bit data blocks for encryption (like DES and IDEA).      - The key length was not given to me, but Mr. Melnick states that       it is _adujustable_ and is \\\"More than adequate for security.\\\"      - The algorithm is written in C and Assembler in software form, and       can be ported to many platforms (Unlike the the Clipper Chip which       is hardware ONLY and cannot be made into software) This I       consider a definite plus for the NEA for widespread use.      - The algorithm will accomodate public key distribution techniques       such as RSA or Diffie-Hellman. This will also be supported in the       hardware chip.      - Right now the projected cost of the NEA chip will be about 10 dollars       for each!! (Clipper will run 25 each chip [that is if it is produced       enough, which probably won't happen]).      - They currently sell a program called C-COM that uses the algorithm       and a special streaming protocol that does not divide the encrypted       data into \\\"blocks.\\\" This could prevent plaintext attacks if you know       what the block header is. This program operates at all supported       RS-232 speeds and uses the software implementation of the algorithm.      - Most importantly: IT DOES NOT HAVE A BACKDOOR!!    Right now the company is afraid that the new clipper chip will put them out of business. This is a very real possibility. So they really need help in stopping the clipper chip from becoming a standard. If you want to contact them, they can be reached at..

This approach is the easiest and cleanest way to switchover from the mains to battery once your power kicks out since, as you mentioned, nothing will know about what happened down the line.  Another way to do the UPS scheme is to use the mains until you lose power, and then kick in the battery backup with it's inverter to replace the lost power.

Here are some observations gained from painful experience:    1. Reactions to chiggers vary greatly from person to person.      Some people get tiny red bites.  Others (like me) are more      sensitive and get fairly large swollen sore-like affairs.    2. Chigger bites are the gift that keeps on giving.  I swear      that these things will itch for months.    3. There is a lot of folklore about chiggers.  I think most of      it is fiction.  I have tried to do research on the critters,      since they have such an effect on me.  The only book I could      find on the subject was a *single* book in UNC's special      collections library.  I have not yet gone through what is      required to get it.    4. Based on my experience and that of my family members, the old      folk remedy of fingernail polish simply doesn't work.  I recall      reading that the theory upon which it is based (that the chiggers      burrow into your skin and continue to party there) is false.  I      think it is more likely that the reaction is to toxins of some      sort the little pests release.  But this is speculation.    5. The *best* approach is prevention.  A couple of things work well.      A good insect repellent (DEET) such as Deep Woods Off liberally      applied to ankles, waistband, etc. is a good start.  There is      another preparation called \\\"Chig Away\\\" that is a combination of      sulfur and some kind of cream (cortisone?) that originally was      prepared for the Army and is not commercially available.  In      the summer I put this on my ankles every morning when I get      up on weekends since I literally can't go outside where we      live (in the country) without serious consequences.  (They      apparently don't like sulfur much at all.  You can use sulfur      as a dust on your body or clothing to repel them.)    6. No amount of prevention will be *completely* successful.  Forget      the fingernail polish.  I have finally settled upon a treatment      that involves topical application of a combination of cortisone      creme (reduces the inflamation and swelling) and benzocaine      (relieves the itch).  I won't tell you all the things I've tried.      Nor will I tell you some of the things my wife does since this      counts as minor surgery and is best not mentioned (I also think      it gains nothing).    7. The swelling and itching can also be significantly relieved      by the application of hot packs, and this seems to speed recovery      as well.  Doctors seem not to care much about chiggers.  The urban and suburban doctors apparently don't encounter them much.  And the rural doctors seem to regard them as a force of nature that one must endure.  I suspect that anyone who could come up with a good treatment for chiggers would make a *lot* of money.\",\"     You haven't fully explained the atheist position.

Displaying all 256 levels synchronized to the 60Hz display took about 10 seconds. After experimenting with different aperture settings and screen brightnesses we found a range that worked well, giving respectable contrast. The quality of the images was pretty good. There were no visible contrast bands.  To minimize the exposure time the display program built 255 different 1 bit frames. The first contained a dot only for pixels that had value 255, the second only for pixels that had value 254, etc. These frames were stored using a sparse data structure that was very fast to 'or' onto the screen in sequence. Creating these frames sometimes took 5-10 minutes on that old Mac, but the camera shutter was closed during that time anyway. And yes, we wrote directly to the screen memory. Mea culpa.  Our biggest problem was that small images were displayed in the top left corner of the screen instead of the center. It took an extra week to have the film developed and printed, because the processors took the trouble to manually move the all images into the center of the print.

Some examples of very low cost NATURAL ANTI-cancer Remedies are listed in the following article:                             NATURAL ANTI-CANCER REMEDIES                                  A 3RD OPINION                           ( Some of these Remedies also work against AIDS. )             DISCLAIMER: This list was compiled from unorthodox sources            that have shown themselves to be reliable.

What is important is HOW they are used, and what            else is EXCLUDED DURING their use. )             (1) THE 7-DAY FAST.                 1st day: Eat as much fresh fruit as you want, one kind            at a time, preferably grapes.                 2nd day: Eat all the vegetables you want, at least half            raw, including GARLIC; also, whole kernel corn to help scrape            clean the intestinal linings.                 3rd day: Drink all the fresh fruit and vegetable juice            you want.  Preferably start with 16 to 32 ounces of prune            juice WITH PULP, followed by a gallon of pure (NOT from            concentrate) apple juice, then grape juice.  (Stay close to            your home bathroom.)                 4th day: Eat all the UN-salted nuts (NO peanuts) and            dried fruit you want, preferably raisins and almonds (ALMONDS            CONTAIN LAETRILE.).                 5th day: ONE GALLON OF LEMONADE.  Squeeze the juice from            two lemons into a gallon of water (preferably distilled), and            add 2 to 4 tablespoons of locally-made honey, (NO sugar).             Drink one glass per hour.           [EVERYone, including healthy people, should do this one day            every week, preceded by a large glass of prune juice WITH            PULP.]                 6th day: Same as 5th day.                 7th day: Same as 6th day.                 All 7 days, eat ONLY the foods listed above for each            day, along with your usual vitamin and mineral supplements,            plus as much DISTILLED WATER as you want.             (2) THE GRAPE DIET.                 Eat 2 to 3 ounces of fresh grapes every 2 hours, 8 AM to            8 PM, every day for six days.  Eat NOTHING else during the            six days, but drink as much DISTILLED WATER as you want.                   (3) APPLE CIDER VINEGAR.                Mix a teaspoon of pure apple cider vinegar (NOT apple            cider \\\"flavored\\\" vinegar.  Regular vinegar is HARMFUL.) in a            glass of water (preferably distilled) and drink all of it.             Do this 3 or 4 times per day, for 3 weeks; then stop for a            week.  Repeat if desired.  Do this along with a normal            healthy diet of natural foods.  This remedy is especially            effective against those types of cancer that resemble a            FUNGUS, as well as against other kinds of fungus infections.                     (4) THE SEA-SALT & SODA BATH.  [Please keep an OPEN MIND.]                Fill a bathtub with moderately warm water so the level            comes up almost to the overflow drain when you get in.             Immerse yourself in it for a minute, and then completely            dissolve in the bath water 1 pound of SUN-evaporated SEA-salt            (regular salt won't work.) and 1 pound of fresh baking-soda.                 Soak in this bath for 10 to 20 minutes, while exercising            your fingers, toes, and limbs, turning sideways and onto your            stomach, dunking your head, sitting up and laying back down,            chomping your teeth together, etc..                 Among other things, the SEA-salt & Soda Bath neutralizes            the accumulated effects of X-rays, etc., as described in the            book \\\"Born To Be Magnetic, Vol. 2\\\", by Frances Nixon, 1973.                 PRECAUTIONS: Only the ONE person using each bath should            prepare it and drain it.           For at least 30 minutes after taking the bath, stay away            from, and even out of sight of, other people.  (Your greatly            expanded Aura energy-field during that time could disrupt            other people's fields.)  Two hours after the bath, eat at            least 8 ounces of yogurt containing ACTIVE Yogurt Cultures.             (The bath may kill FRIENDLY bacteria also.)  Better yet, take            a 2-Billion-bacteria \\\"Acidophilus\\\" capsule, which is also an            EXCELLENT DAILY REMEDY AGAINST THE EFFECTS OF \\\"A.I.D.S.\\\"            (because it kills all kinds of harmful bacteria in the            digestive tract, taking a big load off the remaining immune            system).  [Because this external bath can kill IN-ternal            bacteria, it may also be a CURE for \\\"Lyme disease\\\".]           Do NOT take this bath within a few hundred miles of a thunder            storm, within 3 days of a full moon, nor during \\\"Major\\\" or            \\\"Minor Periods\\\" as listed in the \\\"Solunar Tables\\\" published            bimonthly in \\\"Field & Stream\\\" Magazine, (because of the            measurable disruptive ambient environmental energy-fields            present at those times).           Do NOT take this bath more than four times per year.                    (5) MISCELLANEOUS NATURAL ANTI-CANCER REMEDIES:                         For skin cancer, apply STABILIZED Aloe Vera Jel to the                 affected skin twice daily, and take 2 to 4 tablespoons                 per day of STABILIZED Aloe Vera Juice internally, for                 about 2 months.                          D.M.S.O. (Dimethyl Sulfoxide) causes cancer cells to                 perform NORMAL cell functions.                  ALMONDS (UN-blanched, UN-roasted) CONTAIN LAETRILE.                  To help prevent cancer, eat several almonds every day.                  To help cure cancer, eat several OUNCES of almonds per                 day.                [NEVER take large concentrated doses of Laetrile orally.                  IT WILL KILL YOU!  Take it INTRAVENOUSLY ONLY.  (Cancer                 cells contain a certain enzyme which converts Laetrile                 into cyanide, which then kills the cell.  This enzyme is                 ALSO present in the digestive system.)]                  ANTI-OXIDANTS are FREE-RADICAL SCAVENGERS, and include                 Vitamin E, Selenium (200 mcg. per day is safe for most                 people.), Chromium (up to 100 mcg. per day), Vitamin A                 (25,000 IU per day is safe for most people.), Superoxide                 Dismutase (up to 4,000,000 Units per day), Vitamin C (up                 to 3000 mg. per day), and BHT (Butylated Hydroxy-                toluene), [1 to 4 capsules of BHT every night at bedtime                 will also MAKE ONE IMMUNE AGAINST HERPES (BOTH types),                 suppress herpes symptoms if one already has herpes,                 prevent spreading herpes to other people, but will not                 cure herpes.  BHT MIGHT ALSO DO THESE THINGS AGAINST                 \\\"A.I.D.S.\\\", which is really a form of cancer similar to                 leukemia.]  (See the book \\\"Life Extension\\\", by Durk                 Pearson and Sandy Shaw.)                  HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE.  Dilute twelve(12) drops of 3%                 hydrogen-peroxide in a glass of pure water (preferably                 DISTILLED) and drink it.  Do this once or twice per day,                 hours before or after eating or drinking anything else.                  Apply 3% hydrogen-peroxide directly to skin cancers                 several times per day.                Use hydrogen-peroxide ONLY if you are taking a good                 daily dose of some of the various anti-oxidants                 described above.                  VITAMIN & MINERAL SUPPLEMENTS are more effective, and                 much less expensive, when COMBINED together in MEGA                 doses into SINGLE tablets made from NATURAL sources.                  Cancer cells can NOT live in a strong (100,000 Maxwell)                 NORTH MAGNETIC FIELD, especially if it is pulsating on                 and off.  [A strong south magnetic field is an                 aphrodisiac.]  In my opinion, ALL types of ionizing-                radiation treatments for cancer should be REPLACED with                 daily 30-minute doses of pulsating 100,000-Maxwell NORTH                 magnetic fields.                  Properly made and operated RADIONICS/PSIONICS MACHINES                 can both diagnose and cure all forms of cancer, as well                 as most other medical problems.  Some Radionics/Psionics                 Machines can even take cross-sectional X-ray-like photos                 of cancer tumors, etc., with-OUT X-rays!                  INTERFERON tablets.                 TAHEEBO TEA, (Lapacho).                             HOMEOPATHY can cure cancer, and many other medical                 problems (even drug addiction!).                  50 mg. per day of CHELATED ZINC can help prevent or cure                 prostate trouble.                  This list is NOT exhaustive.              The above NATURAL Remedies can CURE both diagnosed AND UN-           DIAGNOSED cancers, as well as PREVENT them, and also prevent            and cure many other medical problems including heart-           diseases.  They are NOT too simple and inexpensive to work            effectively.             Besides acting on a person biologically and chemically, these            remedies, especially The 7-Day Fast and The Grape Diet, send            a strong message to one's subconscious mind, PROGRAMMING it            to CURE the cancer.             In my opinion, if a person finds out that s/he has cancer,            then s/he should promptly try at least the first 4 remedies            described above, in sequence (starting with The 7-Day Fast),            BEFORE resorting to the UN-natural and expensive mutilations            and agonies [POISON, BURN, and MUTILATE!] of orthodox cancer            treatment [organi$ed-CRIME!].

Dr Zippy.\",\" First let me correct myself in that it was Goerbels and not Goering (Airforce) who ran the Nazi propaganda machine. I agree that Arab news sources are also inherently biased. But I believe the statement I was reacting to was that since the american accounts of events are not fully like the Israeli accounts, the Americans are biased. I just thought that the Israelis had more motivation for bias.  The UN has tried many times to condemn Israel for its gross violation of human rights. However the US has vetoed most such attempts. It is interesting to note that the U.S. is often the only country opposing such condemnation (well the U.S. and Israel). It is also interesting to note that that means other western countries realize these human rights violations. So maybe there are human rights violations going on after all.  \",\"Hello,    way back in the mists of time, I had a set of patches written by Richard Caley (I believe to the standars distribution, patch level 6) which added regular expressions in the .tvtwmrc file, multiple icon regions, squeezable icons, and f.deleteordestroy function.

It does not say that it deters an individual from committing a capital crime in the first place.  The true question is whether the threat of death is likely to actually stop one from murdering.  (Or commiting treason -- are there any other capital crimes anywhere in the USA?)  That is, if there were no death penalty, would its introduction deter a would-be criminal from committing her/his crime?  I doubt it.  This is only the first step.  Even if it were a strong deterrent (short of being a complete deterrent) I would reject it.  For what about the case of the innocent executed?  And even if we could eliminate this possibility, I would reject the death penalty as immoral. This makes me something of a radical on the issue, although I think there are many opponents of captial punishment who agree with me, but who find the innocent executed the strongest argument to make.

How modern how daring how liberating How modern how daring how liberating they chant  The sophomore, being American Doesn't know That his ``question''     modern        skeptical            cynical  Was asked before, by a     modern        skeptical            cynical    urbane cosmopolitan  Politician (appointed not elected) Who happened to live two thousand years ago.  Like many politicians he cared      Less about ideals          than results      Less about ends          than means      Less about anything          than keeping his job               (and his head).  We might call him A bit brutal Though `firm' would be kinder (And no doubt Stalin, who let nobody go, laughed at his laxness) He didn't like his job; perhaps he no longer hoped for better (Nor feared worse, except regarding his head).  And when these wily Jews With their heads-I-win, tails-you-lose      conundrums Brought forth their madman, His first impulse was to play the Roman: ``I find nothing wrong with him,   See to it yourselves.''  But when they mentioned `King' and `Caesar' His heart froze.  If he killed their madman     He'd start a riot          and lose his job              (and his head)  If he saved the King of the Jews     He'd piss off Caesar          and lose his job              (and his head)  And when his wife told him to have    Nothing to do with the righteous lout She didn't tell him anything    He hadn't already figured out.  So he punted.  ``Not my jurisdiction!  Take him to see Herod!'' (who just happened to be in town....)  Herod appreciated the courtesy But wasn't worried         And sent the sharp-tongued fool      (Who suddenly didn't have much to say,     funny how people lose it under pressure....)   back In the attire proper   to his Royal State.  His ass is covered---if Herod has no problem, Caesar certainly won't.  The fool can be king of whatever world he wants as long as it's not Caesar's.  ``I'm letting him go,'' he said with a shout. (Looks like he'll last this one out....)  The crowd's reaction puzzled him.   They really wanted him dead. They didn't want the King of the Jews,   They wanted Barabbas instead (And, as Josephus records, they got him)  Oh well, he thought, They all look the same to me. And we'll get Barabbas next time.  And if I can get them to say    ``We have no king but Caesar!''    By killing a madman, Hell, I'll kill ten a day.

TIA,   John\",\"(reference line trimmed)    Well, I'd say that a murderer is one who intentionally committed a murder. For instance, if you put a bullet into a gun that was thought to contain blanks, and someone was killed with such a gun, the person who actually performed the action isn't the murderer (but I guess this is actually made clear in the below definition).   What do you mean by \\\"reasonable?\\\"  [...]  Yes, it is bad to include the word being defined in the definition.  But, even though the series is recursively infinite, I think the meaning can still be deduced.   [math lesson deleted]  Okay, let's look at this situation:  suppose there is a longstanding feud between two families which claim that the other committed some travesty in the distant past.  Each time a member of the one family kills a member of the other, the other family thinks that it is justified in killing a that member of the first family.  Now, let's suppose that this sequence has occurred an infinite number of times.  Or, if you don't like dealing with infinities, suppose that one member of the family goes back into time and essentially begins the whole thing.  That is, there is a never-ending loop of slayings based on some non-existent travesty. How do you resolve this?  Well, they are all murders.  Now, I suppose that this isn't totally applicable to your \\\"problem,\\\" but it still is possible to reduce an uninduced system.  And, in any case, the nested \\\"murderer\\\" in the definition of murder cannot be infintely recursive, given the finite existence of humanity. And, a murder cannot be committed without a killing involved.  So, the first person to intentionally cause someone to get killed is necessarily a murderer.  Is this enough of an induction to solve the apparently unreducable definition?  See, in a totally objective system where all the information is available, such a nested definition isn't really a problem.\",\"     I think this is mostly the fault of the people who write up the literature and price lists being confused themselves. Since there are two possible processor configurations and one of the them doesn't have an FPU it does seem to be an option, even though it really isn't.       Well, then allow me to end your confusion. The C650 ONLY come with an LC040 in the base 4/80 configuration. If you are not getting this configuration then you are getting an FPU.       Good question. I have been wondering that since Feb. 10th.        This is possible, but an option is something that you are supposed to be able to request when you want it. What Apple has done is given the buyer a CHOICE between configurations and not an OPTION.       This is not unclear at all. In fact Apple has included in the ROMs of those machines with LC040s code to recognize the presence of the full 040's FPU and use it. Thereby making the upgrade as easy as switching chips. You pop the LC040 out and pop in a full '040.       They did? I think I would double-check this. It has been stated countless times in this newsgroup by two of the Centris hardware designers that the LC040 and the full '040 are pin compatible and that the C610 can be upgraded to a full '040.\",\"    [flame-bait, pure and simple]   \",\"I am looking for a source for a 4 circuit Sequence flasher.

Burleigh Grimes went from 20+ wins and an ERA of 3 or so in '24 to 13-19 and an ERA around 4 in '25.  He pitched well for several more years.  Carlton won 13 and lost 20 the year after his 27-10 record. (Source: Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract.)      And let's not forget John Tudor, who started 1-5 and finished 21-6 in 1985.  He had a pretty bad ERA when you take Busch Stadium into account at the start of the season.        If I recall, he had a 4.50 ERA in the 1st half and a 3.50 ERA in the 2nd half of last year.        Hmmm, 21 runs in 11 innings.  Suppose he starts 30 more games, and winds up w/200 innings pitched.  If he allows 4 runs a game in the next 189 innings, he'll have a 4.75 ERA or so at the end of the year. (I think I have his totals right.) This is going to be hard to come back from.        My 1st hunch is that Morris is very gutsy, and that he may be pitching through an injury and not telling anyone.  My 2nd guess is that he will be banished to the bullpen the remainder of the season after a few more starts. (Perhaps when Stewart comes off the DL?  Or will Danny Cox, who went 3 or 4 scoreless innings against the Tribe today, start for Morris?  He looks like a really good one.  Gaston is scrambling to find starters, I'd imagine. Luckily, the Jays have a very good offense.)      I don't think they would dare release him before the end of the year. He'll just be replaced by Stewart or Cox.\",\"Ack!

The central point I made is that local/state police agencies attempting to play by the rules and get warrants, legit escrowed keys, etc., may find themselves at the mercy of bureaucratic inertia and agency infighting at the federal level.    I disagree that this would assist civil liberties by hobbling the cowboy cops.  It would be a strong incentive, as Vesselin points out, for more police agencies to \\\"go rogue\\\" and try to get keys through more efficient     Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on         a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation         encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to         decipher the message?     A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a                                                        ^^^^^^^^^^         court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.         ^^^^^^^^^^^  The clear implication is that there are \\\"legal\\\" authorizations other than a court order.  Just how leaky are these?  (And who  knows what's in those 7 pages that authorized the NSA?).  There may well arise a black market of sorts _within_ police agencies, in which keys are traded.  Furthermore, the police will be in an excellent position to carry out this kind of thing without being caught.  They already have a communication infrastructure with secure portions.  There are a few laws that I know of, that limit citizens' rights to access police communications (or use the information they get).  It may be very difficult to prove police misuse -- the fact that you have such evidence may itself be evidence that YOU have broken some other law.  Throw in private detectives, who have even fewer policy/constitutional restrictions.  Also consider mercenaries who've \\\"retired\\\" from intelligence agencies.  William Gibson must be loving it.  Great story material.  Don't think it'll happen?    Well, consider e.g. the Michigan State Police, generally a very professional organization, which for years kept \\\"Red Files\\\" on thousands of suspected  commies, knowing full well it was not consititutional.  The standards of evidence were just about zero: people were in the file because they happened to park near a place where, say, a US-China People's Friendship rally was happening -- the police went around writing down license plate numbers.  If you happened to be visiting a friend who lived near the  meeting place, well, the state police wound up filing you as a subversive. (They were eventually found out and a court ruled against carrying on any more such nonsense.  I believe thay may have had to destroy the tapes as well.)  Even with well-meaning cops (and I'm sure there are many), there will  be strong pressure to bend the constitutional safeguards.  We don't need to assume corrupt or unbalanced officers -- it will all be in the interest  of enforcing sensible laws, saving lives, and protecting property.   Compromises will be made by well-meaning officers, facing what (to them)  will be a moral dilemma.  Clipper will make criminals out of cops.  Do we want to do this to our police forces?\",\"I'd *desparately* prefer it if we didn't rehash the same arguments that went on ad infinitum last time.  That's especially true for sci.crypt.  For that matter, I've created alt.privacy.clipper, since the traffic is appearing in *many* different groups right now.  I'm going to focus here on some technical aspects of the plan, hence my followup to sci.crypt.  Frankly, if you're not an absolutist, your feelings may turn on some of these issues.  For example -- with an 80-bit key, simply splitting it into two 40-bit pieces is much less acceptable than other schemes, because it means that if just one repository is, shall we say, overly pliable, a would-be eavesdropper would need to recover just 40 more bits of key.  I need not point out in this newsgroup that that's pretty easy to do by exhaustive search. A slightly more complex scheme -- XOR-ing the key with a random number, and then with its complement -- would produce two 80-bit subkeys, neither of which is useful alone.  That variant is much more resistant to attack.  Clearly, one can get even more sophisticated, to protect the subkeys even more.  Other thoughts...  Some people have noted the size and complexity of the databases necessary.  But the id strings the phones emit could be their back door key, double-encrypted with the escrow repositories' public keys.  For that matter, they could do that only with session keys, and have no back door at all.  In that case, the FBI would have to bring every intercept to the repositories to be decrypted.  This would answer many of the objections along the lines of ``how do you make sure they stop''.  We can even combine that with a variant of the digital telephony back door -- have the switch do the tap, but with a digitally-signed record of the time, phone number, etc, of the call.  That provides proof to the escrow agents that the tap was done in compliance with the terms of the warrant.  I can suggest other variations, too.  Suppose each Clipper chip had 100 public key pairs.  Each would be used ~10 times, after which you'd need more keying material.  (Not a bad idea in any event.)  This could be used to enforce time limits, or rather, usage limits, on each warrant; the keys the repository agents would deliver wouldn't last for very long.  I suspect that the cryptographic algorithm itself is secure.  Apart from the obvious -- why push a weak algorithm when you've already got the back door? -- I think that the government is still genuinely concerned about foreign espionage, especially aimed at commercial targets.  This scheme lets the spooks have their cake and eat it, too.  (I've heard rumors, over the years, that some factions within NSA were unhappy with DES because it was too good.  Not that they couldn't crack it, but it was much too expensive to do so as easily as they'd want.)  They're keeping the details secret so that others don't build their own implementations without the back door.\",\"I've been intently following the MAG thread while waiting for mine to arrive in the mail.

What I am saying is that Roussel can be a #1 netminder.  The GAA difference is less than half a goal per game (less than that after last night), their save percentages are close, and their records are similar.  And with that, I just don't see how you can label Roussel as the most disappointing player on the Flyers this season.  You say Soderstrom played against better competition.  That may very well be, but there is no way of knowing how Roussel would have performed in those games.  Besides, against the better scoring teams like Pittsburgh, the defense is more keyed up than they are against San Jose.   But I'm not just judging Roussel on that game alone.  I've seen him play for the past two seasons in Philly and before that in Hershey.  It's just my opinion, but I think he's got what it takes.  Of course, I thought that about Mark LaForest, too.  But I never did about Wendell Young.  So I'm batting .500 in judging Hershey talent since the Hextall-era.  As for the Rangers game, you can say he was saved by a mistake by the offensive player if you like.  But Rou had his leg in position to make the save.  If he didn't, it wouldn't have mattered if the Rangers player didn't get the puck up or not.  It would have been a goal.  On a breakaway that's what the goalie wants to do, take away as much as possible and force the shooter to beat him.   I seem to remember Roussel doing an excellent job against Pittsurgh on opening night to give the Flyers a tie against the two-time defending champs.  And not to take anything away from Soderstrom because he was senational in that game agains the Habs.  But you can't tell me that a Montreal player had an open net to shoot at some point during that game and just flat out missed it.  Mistakes, both on offense and defense are part of the game.  Or there'd never be shutouts.  Anyway, I'm happy the Flyers have both Soderstrom and Roussel and I'm not going to argue about it anymore.  Besides, with the current 7-game winning streak and expectations soaring for next year, I don't want to piss you off to the point that you don't sell me any tickets next season:-).\",\"  The lengthy article you quote doesn't imply this.  It only states that it is somehow POSSIBLE, not that it is in any way likely.  This is akin to an article saying that it is POSSIBLE that the USAF has several captured UFOs, without supporting the liklihood of such an assertion.   In other words, they were telling a pesky reporter to keep guessing.  Israel maintains this same attitude about nuclear weapons it may or may not have.  The US maintains the same attitude about the presence of nuclear weapons on specific naval craft.  By refusing to acknowledge the existence of such weapons on specific ships, US warships have, I believe, become unwelcome in New Zealand, which has declared itself a nuclear-free-zone.     The USAF has never officially admitted to having any UFOs, either.   This is stated as a fact without supporting evidence.  It would've been more convincing if your reporter had come up with just one name of someone who is sitting in jail, lost to the world, as he suggests. Maybe Elvis, or JFK, somebody.    Let's put it this way: If Israel has put people away without publicizing their arrests or the legal proceedings against them, how has their disappearance been explained?  People have relatives, friends and colleagues, you know.  Israel is not known as a place where people are made to vanish.  Would you care to give us a list of people whose whereabouts are unknown?

An option in the menu contained in the Xterm runs a Fortran subroutine that creats a Tektronics-mode Xterm for displaying some graphics.  Typing a <RET> while the Tektronics-mode Xterm (future reference to this will be \\\"Tek-term\\\") is active makes the Xterm read future keystrokes but does not shift input focus to the Xterm (I'm basing that statement on the fact that the border of the  Tek-term stays the highlighted color and that the Tek-term stays on top of Xterm.  If what I'm describing isn't input focus, let me know.)    The xterm can be brought to the top by clicking the mouse button on it.  Subsequent selections from the Xterm of the menu item that displays graphics  highlihts the border and displays the updated graphics, but does not move  the Tek-term to the top.

Since we apparently don't have the sensor base you folks have, they're installing cameras at strategic points along the freeways (initial tests are going to be in the Santa Clara area I'm told), with the video being piped into a command center they're building somewhere in the East Bay.  I'm not sure if frame grabbers or cheap labor will be used to interpret the data, but large multi-colored status displays will show the various routes using different colors to represent the various average speeds for each stretch of highway.  An announcer will sit in front of the status 'wall', and will relay continuous verbal traffic status to those who want to receive it.  They're apparently also looking into licensing a low-AM frequency to be dedicated to providing continuous audio from this system.  In the mean time, they'll set up large incandescent display boards along the test stretch to provide commuters with data on traffic conditions up ahead.  My understanding is that the system is subsidized as a pilot program, and information from it will be available free of charge.  Perhaps the LA system is similarly free or provided at an obviously subsidized rate (read \\\"cheap\\\").  We also have the traffic reports that are broadcast on the SAP audio channel of television channels 2 and 36.  These are verbal reports, qualified with a identification tone to tell in-vehicle receivers like the 'Auto Talk' that the information coming next is applicable to a given area.  In LA, they're probably using some other TV channels, but the concept is the same.  Try setting your stereo TV or VCR to receive the SAP audio channel, and go station jumping to find out which one is broadcasting this information. I believe this program is also subsidized, making the in-vehicle receivers cheap to purchase (and without having to incur monthly fees to use it).  Since the makers of these in-vehicle receivers don't have to pay for the broadcast (this may not be completely true), they likely have no investment in keeping the system up and running when the Cal Trans stuff hits the airwaves.  You may have a nifty little TV audio receiver in your car, nothing more, when this happens.

In comparison, in  the United States, reported cases of gonorrhea in 1992 continued an overall  decreasing trend (1). This report summarizes an analysis of the increase in  gonorrhea in Colorado in 1992 and characterizes trends in the occurrence of  this disease from 1985 through 1992.       In 1992, 4679 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the Colorado Department  of Health (CDH) compared with 3901 cases reported in 1991. During 1992,  reported cases increased 22.7% and 17.5% among females and males, respectively  (Table 1). Similar increases occurred among blacks, whites, and Hispanics  (15.6%, 15.1%, and 15.9%, respectively); however, the number of reported cases  with race not specified increased 88% from 1991 to 1992 and constituted 9.7%  of all reported cases in 1992. Although the largest proportional increases by  age groups occurred among persons aged 35-44 years (80.4%) and greater than or  equal to 45 years (87.7%), these age groups accounted for only 11.0% of all  reported cases in 1992. Persons in the 15-19-year age group accounted for the  largest number of reported cases of gonorrhea during 1992 and the highest age  group-specific rate (639 per 100,000).       Reported cases of gonorrhea increased 32.9% in the five-county Denver  metropolitan area (1990 population: 1,629,466) but decreased elsewhere in the  state (Table 1). Half the cases of gonorrhea in the Denver metropolitan area  occurred in 8.4% (34) of the census tracts; these represent neighborhoods  considered by sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)/acquired immunodeficiency  syndrome (AIDS) field staff to be the focus of gang and drug activity.       When compared with 1991, the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed among  men in the Denver Metro Health Clinic (DMHC, the primary public STD clinic in  the Denver metropolitan area) increased 33% in 1992, and the number of visits  by males to the clinic increased 2.4%. Concurrently, the number of cases  diagnosed among women increased by 1%. Among self-identified heterosexual men,  the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed at DMHC increased 33% and comprised  94% of all cases diagnosed in males, while the number of cases diagnosed among  self-identified homosexual men remained low (71 and 74 in 1991 and 1992,  respectively).       Four selected laboratories in the metropolitan Denver area (i.e., HMO,  university hospital, nonprofit family planning, and commercial) were contacted  to determine whether gonorrhea culture-positivity rates increased. Gonorrhea  culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories contacted increased  23%-33% from 1991 to 1992, while the rate was virtually unchanged in the  fourth (i.e., nonprofit family planning).       From 1985 through 1991, reported cases of gonorrhea among whites and  Hispanics in Colorado decreased; in comparison, reported cases among blacks   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 14 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  increased since 1988 (Figure 1). During 1988-1992, the population in Colorado  increased 9.9% for blacks, 9.8% for Hispanics, and 4.5% for whites. In 1992,  the gonorrhea rate for blacks (1935 per 100,000 persons) was 57 times that for  whites (34 per 100,000) and 12 times that for Hispanics (156 per 100,000)  (Table 1). Among black females, reported cases of gonorrhea increased from  1988 through 1992 in the 15-19-year age group; among black males, cases  increased from 1989 through 1992 in both the 15-19-and 20-24-year age groups.

Editorial Note: The increase in reported gonorrhea cases in Colorado in 1992  may represent an overall increase in the occurrence of this disease or more  complete reporting stimulated by visitations to laboratories by CDH  surveillance staff during 1991-1992. The increases in confirmed gonorrhea  cases at DMHC and in culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories  suggest a real increase in gonorrhea rather than a reporting artifact.  However, the stable culture-positivity rate in the nonprofit family planning  laboratory (which serves a network of clinics statewide) indicates that the  gonorrhea increase did not uniformly affect all segments of the population.       One possible explanation for the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in  Colorado may be gang- and drug-related sexual behavior, as implicated in a  recent outbreak of drug-resistant gonorrhea and other STDs in Colorado Springs  (2). Although the high morbidity census tracts in the Denver metropolitan area  coincide with areas of gang and drug activity, this hypothesis requires  further assessment. To examine the possible role of drug use -- implicated  previously as a factor contributing to the national increase in syphilis (3-6)  -- the CDH STD/AIDS program is collecting information from all persons in whom  gonorrhea is diagnosed regarding drug use, exchange of sex for money or drugs,  and gang affiliation.       The gonorrhea rate for blacks in Colorado substantially exceeds the  national health objective for the year 2000 (1300 per 100,000) (objective  19.1a) (7). Race is likely a risk marker rather than a risk factor for  gonorrhea and other STDs. Risk markers may be useful for identifying groups at  greatest risk for STDs and for targeting prevention efforts. Moreover, race- specific variation in STD rates may reflect differences in factors such as  socioeconomic status, access to medical care, and high-risk behaviors.       In response to the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in Colorado,  interventions initiated by the CDH STD/AIDS program include 1) targeting  partner notification in the Denver metropolitan area to persons in groups at  increased risk (e.g., 15-19-year-old black females and 20-24-year-old black  males); 2) implementing a media campaign (e.g., public service radio   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 15 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  announcements, signs on city buses, newspaper advertisements, and posters in  schools and clinics) to promote awareness of STD risk and prevention targeted  primarily at high-risk groups, and 3) developing teams of peer educators to  perform educational outreach in high-risk neighborhoods. The educational  interventions are being developed and implemented with the assistance of  members of the target groups and with input from a forum of community leaders  and health-care providers.

Child safety seats and safety  belts can substantially reduce this loss (2). From 1977 through 1985, all 50  states passed legislation requiring the use of child safety seats or safety  belts for children. Although these laws reduce injuries to young children by  an estimated 8%-59% (3,4), motor-vehicle crash-related injuries remain a major  cause of disability and death among U.S. children (1), while the use of  occupant restraints among children decreases inversely with age (84% usage for  those aged 0-4 years; 57%, aged 5-11 years; and 29%, aged 12-18 years) (5). In  addition, parents who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to  use restraints for their children (6). To characterize the association between  adult safety-belt use and adult-reported consistent use of occupant restraints  for the youngest child aged less than 11 years within a household, CDC  analyzed data obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System  (BRFSS) during 1988 and 1989. This report summarizes the findings from this  study.       Data were available for 20,905 respondents aged greater than or equal to  18 years in 11 states * that participated in BRFSS -- a population-based,  random-digit-dialed telephone survey -- and administered a standard Injury  Control and Child Safety Module developed by CDC. Of these respondents, 5499  (26%) had a child aged less than 11 years in their household. Each respondent  was asked to specify the child's age and the frequency of restraint use for  that child. The two categories of child restraint and adult safety-belt use in  this analysis were 1) consistent use (i.e., always buckle up) and 2) less than  consistent use (i.e., almost always, sometimes, rarely, or never buckle up).  Data were weighted to provide estimates representative of each state. Software  for Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) (7) was used to calculate point estimates  and confidence intervals. Statistically significant differences were defined  by p values of less than 0.05.       Each of the 11 states had some type of child restraint law. Of these, six  (Arizona, Kentucky, Maine, Nebraska, Rhode Island, and West Virginia) had no  law requiring adults to use safety belts; four (Idaho, Maryland, Pennsylvania,  and Washington) had a secondary enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., a  vehicle had to be stopped for a traffic violation before a citation for nonuse  of safety belts could be issued); and one state (New York) had a primary  enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., vehicles could be stopped for a  safety-belt law violation alone). In nine states, child-passenger protection   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 17 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  laws included all children aged less than 5 years, but the other two states  used both age and size of the child as criteria for mandatory restraint use.  The analysis in this report subgrouped states into 1) those having a law  requiring adult safety-belt use (law states), and 2) those without such a law  (no-law states).       Overall, 21% of children aged less than 11 years reportedly were not  consistently restrained during automobile travel. Both child restraint use and  adult restraint use were significantly higher (p less than 0.05, chi-square  test) in law states than in no-law states (81.1% versus 74.3% and 58.7% versus  43.2%, respectively).       High rates of restraint use for children aged less than or equal to 1  year were reported by both adults indicating consistent and less than  consistent safety-belt use (Figure 1). Adults with consistent use reported  high rates of child-occupant restraint use regardless of the child's age  (range: 95.5% for 1-year-olds to 84.7% for 10-year-olds). In comparison, for  adults reporting less than consistent safety-belt use, the rate of child- occupant restraint use declined sharply by the age of the child (range: 93.1%  for 1-year-olds to 28.8% for 10-year-olds). When comparing children of  consistent adult safety-belt users with children of less than consistent adult  safety-belt users, 95% confidence intervals overlap for the two youngest age  groups (i.e., aged less than 1 and 1 year).       Reported child-occupant restraint use in law states generally exceeded  that in no-law states, regardless of age of child (Table 1). In addition,  higher adult educational attainment was significantly associated with  increased restraint use for children, a factor that has also been associated  with increased adult safety-belt use (8).   Reported by: National Center for Injury Prevention and Control; National  Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC.   Editorial Note: The findings in this report are consistent with others  indicating that adults who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely  to employ occupant restraints for their children (6,9). Because these  nonbelted adults are at increased risk of crashing and more likely to exhibit  other risk-taking behaviors, children traveling with them may be at greater  risk for motor-vehicle injury (10).       Educational attainment of adult respondents was inversely associated with  child restraint use in this report. Accordingly, occupant-protection programs  should be promoted among parents with low educational attainment. Because low  educational attainment is often associated with low socioeconomic status, such  programs should be offered to adults through health-care facilities that serve  low-income communities or through federal programs (i.e., Head Start) that are  directed at parents with young children.       Injury-prevention programs emphasize restraining young children. In  addition, however, efforts must be intensified to protect child occupants as   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 18 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  they become older. Parents, especially those with low educational attainment,  those who do not consistently wear safety belts, and those from states that do  not have mandatory safety-belt use laws, should be encouraged to wear safety  belts and to protect their children by using approved child safety seats and  safety belts. Finally, the increased use of restraints among children may  increase their likelihood of using safety belts when they become teenagers --  the age group characterized by the lowest rate of safety-belt use and the  highest rate of fatal crashes (5).

SURVEILLANCE FOR AND COMPARISON OF BIRTH DEFECT PREVALENCES                                IN TWO GEOGRAPHIC                          AREAS -- UNITED STATES, 1983-88        Problem/Condition: CDC and some states have developed surveillance  systems to monitor the birth prevalence of major defects.       Reporting Period Covered: This report covers birth defects surveillance  in metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia, and selected jurisdictions in California for  the years 1983-1988.       Description of System: The California Birth Defects Monitoring Program  and the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program are two population- based surveillance systems that employ similar data collection methods. The  prevalence estimates for 44 diagnostic categories were based on data for 1983- 1988 for 639,837 births in California and 152,970 births in metropolitan  Atlanta. The prevalences in the two areas were compared, adjusting for race,  sex, and maternal age by using Poisson regression.       Results: Regional differences in the prevalence of aortic stenosis, fetal  alcohol syndrome, hip dislocation/dysplasia, microcephalus, obstruction of the  kidney/ureter, and scoliosis/lordosis may be attributable to general  diagnostic variability. However, differences in the prevalences of arm/hand  limb reduction, encephalocele, spina bifida, or trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) are  probably not attributable to differences in ascertainment, because these  defects are relatively easy to diagnose.       Interpretation: Regional differences in prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy  termination may affect prevalences of trisomy 21 and spina bifida. However,  the reason for differences in arm/hand reduction is unknown, but may be  related to variability in environmental exposure, heterogeneity in the gene  pool, or random variation.       Actions Taken: Because of the similarities of these data bases, several  collaborative studies are being implemented. In particular, the differences in  the birth prevalence of spina bifida and Down syndrome will focus attention on  the impact of prenatal diagnosis.

INFLUENZA -- UNITED STATES, 1988-89       Problem/Condition: CDC monitors the emergence and spread of new influenza  virus variants and the impact of influenza on morbidity and mortality annually  from October through May.       Reporting Period Covered: This report covers U.S. influenza surveillance  conducted from October 1988 through May 1989.       Description of System: Weekly reports from the vital statistics offices  of 121 cities provided an index of influenza's impact on mortality; 58 WHO  collaborating laboratories reported weekly identification of influenza  viruses; weekly morbidity reports were received both from the state and  territorial epidemiologists and from 153 sentinel family practice physicians.  Nonsystematic reports of outbreaks and unusual illnesses were received  throughout the year.       Results: During the 1988-89 influenza season, influenza A(H1N1) and B  viruses were identified in the United States with essentially equal frequency  overall, although both regional and temporal patterns of predominance shifted  over the course of the season. Throughout the season increases in the indices  of influenza morbidity in regions where influenza A(H1N1) predominated were  similar to increases in regions where influenza B predominated. Only 7% of  identified viruses were influenza A(H3N2), but isolations of this subtype  increased as the season waned, and it subsequently predominated during the  1989-90 season. During the 1988-89 season outbreaks in nursing homes were  reported in association with influenza B and A(H3N2) but not influenza  A(H1N1).       Interpretation: The alternating temporal and geographic predominance of  influenza strains A(H1N1) and B during the 1988-89 season emphasizes the  importance of continual attention to regional viral strain surveillance, since  amantadine is effective only for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A.       Actions Taken: Weekly interim analyses of surveillance data produced  throughout the season allow physicians and public health officials to make  informed choices regarding appropriate use of amantadine. CDC's annual  surveillance allows the observed viral variants to be assessed as candidates  for inclusion as components in vaccines used in subsequent influenza seasons.  Authors: Louisa E.

Copyright 1993, The University of Arizona                   High Tech Assisted Reproductive Technologies  Following the birth of the first in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF- ET) baby in 1978, a host of assisted reproductive technologies have been  developed that include IVF-ET, gamete intrafallopian tube transfer (GIFT),  embryo cryopreservation (freezing) and gamete micromanipulation. Together,  these technologies are referred to as the high-tech assisted reproductive  technology (ART) procedures.   Ovulation induction, sperm insemination and surgery for tubal disease and/or  pathology still are the mainstays of the therapies available for infertility  management. However, when these fail, it almost always is appropriate to  proceed with one of the ART procedures.   Therefore, in addition to a comprehensive basic and general infertility  service at The University of Arizona Center for Reproductive Endocrinology and  Infertility, there is a program of Assisted Reproduction that specializes in  ART procedures. This program serves as a tertiary provider for those patients  in the state of Arizona whose infertility problems cannot be resolved by the  traditional therapies.   The following article (on back) describes the ART procedures available in our  Center, clarifies appropriate applications for each, and considers the  realistic expectations for their success. Procedures included are:   o in vitro  o fertilization - embryo transfer (IVF-ET),  gamete intrafallopian tube    transfer  o (GIFT),  cryopreservation of human embryos and  gamete micromanipulation.  This article also considers ongoing research in our program that is directed  towards improved success of these technologies.

This technology involves biopsying the preimplantation human embryo and then  subjecting the biopsied cells to genetic analysis using either DNA  amplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization.   There are recent reports of the successful application of DNA amplification by  other centers, for example, for diagnosis of the genes for cystic fibrosis and  hemophilia. We hope to apply and further focus fluorescent in situ  hybridization technology for probing the X chromosome, the identification of  which will provide a scientific basis for counselling patients who exhibit  sex-linked disorders.   The considerable clinical application of such technology lies in the fact that  it circumvents the need for prenatal diagnosis, in addition to the possibility  of a subsequent termination of affected fetuses, in order to avoid the birth  of affected children.

In Vitro Fertilization - Embryo Transfer is the core ART procedure of our  Assisted Reproduction Program.  This procedure involves retrieval of  unfertilized eggs from the ovary, their insemination in vitro in a dish, and  the culture of resultant embryos for 1 or 2 days, before they are transferred  to the patient's uterus. All cultures are maintained in an incubator under  strictly controlled atmospheric and temperature conditions. Before being  processed for use in insemination, semen samples are evaluated in our  andrology laboratory using both subjective light microscopy and computer-  HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 25 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  assisted semen analyses. To ensure an adequate number of eggs with which to  perform IVF-ET, or indeed, GIFT, follicular development is typically  stimulated, with gonadotropins (perganol, metrodin), gonadotropin releasing  hormone (GnRH, Factrel, lutrepulse) and/or GnRH analogues (lupron, Depo  lupron, synarel). Occasionally, however, IVF-ET is accomplished with eggs  obtained in non-stimulated cycles. While some programs utilize laparoscopic  egg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia,  we undertake the less costly approach of ultrasound-guided retrieval in our  Infertility Unit, with the patient sedated.        Couples who resort to IVF-ET exhibit such pathologies as tubal  deficiencies, ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, and/or mild forms of male  factor infertility.  According to the United States IVF Registry, the overall  success rate for IVF-ET nationwide has stabilized at about 14 percent per  cycle. Results from our program, involving 86 patients who have undergone 173  IVF-ET cycles, reflect a comparable success rate.       Nevertheless, the overall incidence of success with this procedure is  disconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiological  factors that limit achievement of a higher percentage of pregnancies.  Well  recognized predictors of outcome include patient age, response to exogenous  ovarian stimulation, quality of sperm and number of repeated IVF-ET cycle  attempts. However, among these, age is the single most significant determinant  of conception. Therefore, it is critical that such patients are referred to an  Assisted Reproduction Program at the earliest opportunity following failure of  traditional therapies.       The underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has not  been clearly delineated beyond recognition that: 1) the number of eggs  available for retrieval declines markedly with age; 2) fertilization rates  significantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over 40 years;  and 3) provided the appropriate hormonal background is present, age is  unrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy. Ongoing research in our  Center, therefore, is investigating physiological changes in the egg that may  be impacted by age. We have determined that more than 50 percent of eggs that  fail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal, and that a significant  proportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age. Currently,  the only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from a donor. Our  program has initiated recruitment of volunteer egg donors to satisfy the needs  of a list of recipients interested in this form of therapy.        GIFT - This high-tech ART procedure is performed in the operating room,  usually with the use of a laparoscope and, in contrast to IVF-ET, involves  introducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the Fallopian  tube (an average of 3 eggs/tube). Under these circumstances, fertilization  occurs in vivo and, if excess eggs are retrieved, the remainder undergo IVF,  with subsequent options for embryo transfer in that cycle, or freezing for  transfer in a subsequent cycle. This ART procedure is applied to cases in   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 26 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  which there is at least one patent Fallopian tube but the couple has such  pathologies as ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, male factor infertility  and/or idiopathic infertility.          The data reported in the United States IVF Registry for 1985 through 1990  indicate that the overall success rate with GIFT is higher than that obtained  with the IVF-ET technique (range of clinical pregnancies for GIFT is 24 to 36  percent and for IVF-ET 14 to 18 percent). In view of this fact, one might  expect more patients to be treated with GIFT than IVF-ET. However, in our  program we have taken into account three basic concerns which, while  substantially reducing the number of GIFT cycles performed, benefit the  patient. These concerns are: 1) the increased costs associated with performing  a procedure in the operating room; 2) the risks, albeit minimal, of undergoing  general anesthesia; and 3) the considerable benefits to be accrued from  obtaining direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the eggs,  and the developmental competency of resultant embryos.       The increased success with GIFT undoubtedly reflects the artificial  environment provided by the laboratory in the IVF-ET procedure. Between  January 1, 1991, and December 31, 1992, we have performed a total of 12 GIFT  cycles, with an overall success rate of 20 percent.       Embryo cryopreservation, or freezing, is applied in our program when  embryos result from residual GIFT eggs or from non-transferred IVF embryos.  This procedure not only provides patients with a subsequent opportunity for  success at much reduced costs, but also circumvents the legal and ethical  issues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos. Therefore, as stipulated  by the American Fertility Society ethical guidelines for ART programs, from  both a practical and an ethical standpoint, all Assisted Reproduction programs  should have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys.       Gamete Micromanipulation - This ART procedure, which is still very new,  is applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen but  who have severe male factor infertility (less than 10 million sperm/ml in  combination with fewer than 20 perccent motile sperm, and/or less than 10  percent sperm with normal morphology). We are currently developing the  procedure of sub-zonal insertion (SZI), which entails injecting sperm under  the coating around the egg, the barrier normally penetrated by the sperm  through enzymatic digestion.       Available data from SZI programs world-wide indicate that only 5 to 10  percent of SZI cycles result in a pregnancy. This statistic undoubtedly  relates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the sperm.  Therefore, we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniques  for the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation. Such  efforts are unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that this technology  offers the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patients to  establish conception.

[1]  Born 1964 Secretary-Typist Azsantekmontazh Trust Sumgait Construction and Installation Administration Secretary of the SMU Komsomol Organization  Resident at Building 17/33B, Apartment 15 Microdistrict No. 3 Sumgait [Azerbaijan]   On the 27th my sister Marina and I went to the movies the seven o'clock show, at the theater that is across from the City Party Committee, about 50 yards  away. The SK theater. They were showing an Argentinian film, \\\"The Abyss.\\\"  Before the film we noticed about 60 to 70 people standing near the podium at  the City Party Committee, but they were silent, there's no conversation  whatsoever, and we couldn't figure out what was going on. That is, we knew it  was about Karabagh, but what it was exactly, what they were talking about, if  someone gave a speech or not, we didn't know. We bought our tickets. There  were 30 or 40 people in the theater. This was a very small number for that  large movie theater. The film started. About 30 minutes later they stopped the film. A crowd burst in. About 60 people. They came up onto the stage. Well  mostly they were young people, from 16 to 23 years old. They demanded that an  Armenian woman come up onto the stage. They used foul language and said that  they were going to show what Azerbaijanis were capable of, what they could do  to Armenian girls. I thought that's what they meant because they had demanded  a girl specifically. Marina and I were sitting together. I told her to move  over, there were some Russian girls sitting nearby. So that if someone  recognized me or if something happened, they would take me, and not Marina.  It got quiet, 2 or 3 girls jumped up to run out, but the door was closed--it's only opened at the end of the   show--and they returned to their seats.  Everyone in the theater was looking at one another, Russians, Azerbaijanis,  people of various nationalities. But no one reacted at all, no one in the  auditorium made a sound. They were silent, looking at one another, and  gradually started to leave. Some guy, a really fat one, says, \\\"OK, we've  scared them enough, let's leave.\\\" They leave slowly, pompously. It seemed to  me that those people were not themselves. Either they had smoked a bunch of  \\\"anasha\\\", or had taken something else, because they all looked beastly, like  they were ready to tear anyone apart. Then it was all over, as though nothing  had happened at all. The film started up again, it was one of those cheerful  films which should have only brought pleasure, made you happy to be alive. We  could barely sit to the end. So it had started at seven it was over by nine,  and it was dark . . .  Marina and I were walking home, Lenin Street, that's the center of town. Lenin Street was packed, just packed with young people. They were shouting,  something about Karabagh and something about Armenians. We weren't especially  listening, because the way we were feeling we didn't know if we were going to  make it home or not, and just what had happened anyway? Public transportation  wasn't running. Incidentally, when we came out of the theater we saw police,  policemen standing there. The director of the movie theater was looking at the doors, because when they were leaving they had broken the glass, the doors  there are basically all glass. Everything was broken. He stood there grief- stricken, but looking as though nothing really big had happened, like some  naughty boys had just broken them quite by accident, with a slingshot. Well,  since he looked more or less calm I decided that, nothing all that super  serious had happened. We went out very slowly; we wanted to catch a bus, we  live literally one stop away. We didn't want to go on foot, not because it was dark, but because something might happen. We flagged down a cab, but the  driver didn't want to take us. We told him we live near the bus station, and  he said he'd take us to the bus station and not a yard farther. I said, well,  OK . . .  So we got into the cab and managed to get there. Something incredible was  happening at the bus station. There was a traffic jam. Public transportation  was at a standstill and everyone was shouting \\\"Ka-ra-bagh,\\\" they're not going  to give up Karabagh. I go home and tell my family what's going on, and there's immediate panic in the house. Mamma says, what should we do? Like the end had  come, they were going to come, kill us, that's it . . . Somehow we managed to  cheer ourselves up: Nothing that bad could happen. Where are we living anyway, just what kind of social order do we have? Somehow we manage to calm Mamma  down. And we went to bed. But no one could sleep. Everyone made as though  nothing had happened.  That was on Saturday. In short, the day went by. We didn't go anywhere and  didn't call our relatives. No one did anything. Because . . . life goes on. That day I realized something was approaching, but what exactly, I couldn't guess.  On the 28th everything was like it was supposed to be, we lived like we always had. There were five of us at home: Mamma, Papa and us, three sisters: Lyuda,  Marina, and I. My sister Lyuda was in Yerevan at the time. We sat at home and  no one went out. Later we learned that a demonstration had started that  morning. It all started . . . They were smashing up stores. We were sitting at home and didn't know anything about it. Then a girlfriend of mine, Lyuda  Zimogliad, came by at around three o'clock I think. We worked together, we did our apprenticeships together, she's a Russian girl. She said that something awful was happening in town. I asked, \\\"Don't they want Armenians? Well what  are they after, if they're already in that state?\\\" She says, no, nothing like  that, it's just a demonstration, but it's awful to watch it. Somehow, it feels like a war has broken out. Public transportation has been stopped . . . The  cabs, the buses, well it's just a nightmare.  Then Papa decides to go to the drugstore, my mother was having allergy  problems at the time . . . He left the house and our neighbor, Aunt Vera, asked him, \\\"Where are you going? Stop! There are such terrible things going on in the courtyard; aren't you afraid to go out?\\\" Papa didn't know what she was talking about. She simply pushed him back into the entryway. He came home  and told Mamma. Mamma said, \\\"Well, if Aunt Vera was talking like that it means that something is really going on.\\\" But we didn't go see her, she's a Russian, she lives across from us. I had to see my friend out. Around five o'clock I  tell Lyuda, \\\"Ok, look, it's time for you to go, it's late already, I'll see  you out.\\\" Mamma says, \\\"You don't need to go, it's too late already, you can  see what the situation in town is.\\\" So we decided to stay home. Dinner was  ready. Mamma says, \\\"Let her eat with us, then she can go.\\\" We sat down at the  table. But no one was hungry, no one was in the mood, we just put everything  out on the table to calm ourselves down, and make it appear that we're eating. We turned on the television, and the show \\\"In Fairy-Tale Land\\\" was coming on.  We cleared the table.  We hear some noise out in the courtyard. I go out on the balcony, but I can't  see what's going on, because the noise is coming from the direction of the bus station, and there is a 9-story building in the way. There is mob of people  . . . I can't figure out what's happening. They're shouting something, looking somewhere, I can't make out what is going on. I go down to a neighbor, she's  an Azerbaijani; we've been friends of her family for about 25 years. I go down to look from their place. I see people shouting, looking at the 5-and 9-story  buildings near the bus station. Just then soldiers set upon them, about 20  people, with clubs. The mob runs off in different directions. I even see  several people from our building. They are looking and laughing . . . I decide that means it's not all that bad if they are laughing: it means they're not  killing anyone. But now the crowd suddenly dashes toward the soldiers. One of  the soldiers cannot manage to get away, they start stomping on him with their  feet, everyone's kicking him . . . I become ill and go home, and explain in  general terms that horrible things are going on out there . . .  can't speak . . . Well, they've probably killed that soldier, the way that crowd is . . . If each of them kicked him just once . . . They took his club away from him and started to beat him with it. But it was far away and I couldn't see if he got up and left or not.  I become terrified and go home and say, \\\"Lyuda, don't go anywhere, stay at our place, because if you go out they could kill you or . . . \\\" Then the crowd  runs over closer toward our building and stands at the 12-story building and  starts shouting something. We go out onto the balcony. All of our neighbors  are also out on theirs, too. Everyone is standing, staring. The mob is  shouting and about 5 minutes later comes running toward our building. As it  turns out, at the 12-story building the Azerbaijani neighbors went down and  kept them from coming in. There's only one entryway there, they could stop  them.  They all run up to our building. Mamma immediately starts closing the windows, afraid that they might throw stones. They have stones and they break the  windows, all of them. There are very many people. We have a large courtyard,  and it's packed with people. They spill up to the first floor so they don't  crush each other. They crawl up on trees, posts, and garages. It's just a huge cloud of people. They break and burn the motorcycle of the Armenian Sergey  Sargisian, from our building. We close the windows and immediately hear  tramping in our entryway. They come up to our fifth floor with a tremendous  din and roar. It's incomprehensible. Mamma told me later that they were  shouting Father's name, \\\"Grisha, open the door, we've come to kill you!,\\\" or something like that. I don't remember that, I was spaced out, kind of. Mamma  says, \\\"Into the bedroom, quickly!\\\" In the bedroom we have two tall beds, part  of our dowry; Mamma says, \\\"Hide there, they probably won't come in there,  they'll ask something, say something, and leave.\\\" She says, \\\"We'll tell them  that we live alone here.\\\" I can't imagine that my parents will stand out in  the hall alone talking with some sort of beasts . . . I go to them and say  that I'll stand together with them, I'll talk with them if they come, maybe I  can find a common language with them, all the more so if they know me: I speak  Azerbaijani more or less, and I can find out what they want. I told Marina and Lyuda to hide under the bed, and my sister Lyuda, I can't remember if I told  her anything or not.  Then . . . they open the door: it's like they blew on it and it broke and fell right into the hall. The crows bursts in and starts to shout: Get out of here, leave, vacate the apartment and go back to your Armenia; things like that. I tell them, \\\"What has happened, speak calmly. One of you, tell me, calmly, what has happened.\\\" In Azerbaijani, they say, \\\"Get out of the apartment, leave.\\\" I  say, \\\"OK. Go downstairs. We'll gather everything we need and leave the  apartment.\\\" I realize that it is senseless to discuss any sort of rights with them, these are animals. They must be stopped. The ones standing in the doorway, the young guys, say, \\\"There are old people and one girl with them. Too bad!\\\" They take two or three steps back. It seems as though I have pacified them with our exchange. Then someone in the courtyard shouts,  commanding them: \\\"Don't you understand what you are saying? Kill them?\\\"  And that was it! That was all it took. They grab Papa, carry him into one room, and Mamma and me into another. They put Mamma on the bed and start  undressing her, beating her legs. They start tearing my clothes, right there,  in front of Mamma. I don't remember where they went, what they did, or how  much time passed. I had the feeling that they beat me on the head, on my body, and tore my clothes, all at the same time, I don't even know what I said. The  atrocities started. I was savagely raped in that room. They argued among  themselves who would go first.  Later, I remember, I came to. I don't know if I'm dead or alive. Someone comes in, someone tall, I think, clean-shaven, in an Eskimo dogskin coat, balding.  He looks around at what's happening. At that instant everything stops. It  seems to me that he is either their commander or . . . that somehow everything depends on him. He looks and says, \\\"Well, we're done here.\\\" They are beating Mamma on the head. They break up the chairs and beat her with the chair legs  . . . She loses consciousness, and they decide that she's dead. Papa . . . was out cold. They want to throw Lyuda off the balcony, but they can't get the  window open. Apparently the window frames are stuck after the rain and the  windows can't be opened. They leave her next to the window. She was thinking  about being thrown out the window and passed out. She's not a real strong  person anyway . . . He looks at me and sees that I'm saying something, that I'm still twitching. Well, I start saying the opposite of what I should be,  which is humbling myself and pleading. I start shouting, cursing . . . they  don't get any entreaty out of me. I  already know that I'm dead, why would I  humble myself before anyone? And he says that if that's what I think, since my tongue is so long . . . maybe he thinks that I still look quite appealing  . . . In short, he commands that I be taken outside.  I no longer saw or remembered what was happening to Marina and Lyuda, I don't  know if they are alive or not. They take me outside. They are dragging me by  my arms, by my legs. They are hitting me against the wall, the railings,  something metal . . . While they are carrying me someone is biting me, someone else is pinching me . . .I don't even know. I think, my God, when will death  come? If only it were sooner . . . Then . . . they carry me out, throw me near the entryway . . . and start kicking me. I lose consciousness . . . What  happened after that, how many people there were, I don't remember.   I come to after a while, I don't remember how long. A neighbor is bringing me  clothing. I'm entirely covered with blood, she puts a dress on me. I remember  that I said the same words over and over again: \\\"Mamma, what happened, Mamma,  what have they done to us, where are we, whose house are we at?\\\" I can't make  sense out of anything. There is a guy standing over me, I sort of know him, he served in Afghanistan, his name is Igor, he brought me indoors. When they all  went to the third entryway and killed a person there, Igor gathered his  courage, took me into his arms, and brought me to the neighbors', even though  he's small-minded, he put himself at risk. Igor Agayev is Azerbaijani; he  served in Afghanistan. There are three brothers. The older brother also served there, I think; now he's stationed here, on the border, in Armenia. Igor  brought me to the neighbors', and then helped me come to my senses, saying,  \\\"Karina, I know you, calm down, I'm not one of them.\\\" How do I know who's who  and what's what? I come to, and they clean me up. I was covered in blood. Then Papa . . . I saw Papa, I saw Mamma. And Marina, too . . . Igor was there when  they dragged Marina and Lyuda out from under the bed . . . Marina . . . Lyuda  said that she was Russian, they said, we'll let you go, we aren't touching the Russians, go. And while they are dragging Marina out she decides she's going  to tell them she's Azerbaijani. Igor immediately grabs Marina's and Lyuda's  hands, because he knows Marina, and knows that she is Armenian and is our  sister, and takes her to the second floor to a neighbor's and starts pounding  on the door so she will open up. She opens the door and Igor pushes them in  there. So they survived.  My sister Lyuda lost consciousness after the bandits started stealing things. While they were going downstairs, taking things downstairs, then coming back  up again, Lyuda seized the opportunity and crawled under the bed and stayed  there. Then, when she was herself again, she found a torn night shirt and put  it on, and some sort of robe and went to a neighbor's on the fourth floor, the one whose apartment I had watched the crowd from, the friend of ours, and  knocked on the door. The neighbor opened and said, \\\"I'm not going to let you  in the apartment because I'm afraid of them. But I'll give you some stockings  and we'll leave the building.\\\" Lyuda says, \\\"I'll stay at your place because of what's going on, they keep going up and down the stairs.\\\" It was just for a  moment, just a moment in life, but the neighbor wouldn't consent. Lyuda came  back to our place and lay under the bed . . .  I came to. Mother was there. I can't remember my supervisor's telephone  number, but something had to be done. Somehow I remembered and called, and he  came to get us. He didn't have any idea what was going on. He thought we were  simply afraid, he didn't know that they were killing us and that we had passed between life and death. He came and got us and took us to the police precinct. There they looked us over. I was having trouble walking, my lungs hurt badly,  it was hard to breathe . . .  My supervisor's name is Urshan Feyruzovich Mamedov. He's the head of our  administration. They took us there. When we were leaving, I saw a great number of buses full of soldiers at the entrance to town. The buses were ordinary  passenger buses. There were very many soldiers. We left around eleven, right  after eleven. If these people could stop what was happening they could save a  great many lives . . . Because the crowd was moving on, toward the school, and what was going on there . . . I think everyone know not only in Sumgait, not  only in Yerevan. Because there they murdered them all one after the next,  without stopping. After us.  I think 14 people died in Microdistrict No. 3, and 10 to 12 of them were from Buildings 4, 5, and 6. In our building one person died, and one old woman died from Building 16, that's the building in front of ours. There young  Azerbaijani men stopped the mob and wouldn't let it into their building.  Incidentally, when we were at the neighbors', Marina called our relatives to warn them, so they would all know what was happening. I called a aunt in  Microdistrict No. 5. They have three neighbors who are Armenians. I said, \\\"Run quickly, I can't explain what's going on; hide, do what you can, just stay alive. Hide at Azerbaijanis', ones who won't give you away.\\\" At that moment  three people came in, policemen. I think they were Azerbaijanis. I was in such awful condition, my face was completely distorted my lips were puffed up,  there was blood, my eye was swollen, no one thought I would ever see anything  out of that eye again . . . my forehead was badly cut, and one-half of my face was pushed out forward. No one would have thought that I would survive, get my normal appearance back, and be able to grasp anything at all. I started to  scream at those people, why did you come, who sent you here, no one wants you  here, haven't you killed people people yet, what are you doing here? One of  the soldiers said, \\\"Don't scream at us. We're Muslims, but we're not from the  Sumgait police. They called in from Daghestan.\\\" So at that point the  Daghestan police were there.  When we got to the police precinct there were an awful lot of police there, there were soldiers, police with dogs, ambulances, firemen . . . I don't know, maybe they were waiting for people to bring them the goners and the seriously  injured to treat them there in the police precinct. I don't know what they  were there for. There were also doctors from Baku there. They examined Lyuda  and me and said, \\\"These women need to go to the Maternity Home, but we don't  know what to do with the rest.\\\"  So they took us, and I lost contact with my parents, my boss, everyone. My  boss said, \\\"Don't worry, I'll find you, no matter where you are, no matter what happens.\\\" We went to the hospital. There we were examined by a department head from the Sumgait Maternity Home, Pashayeva, I think her name was. She  examined us. The ambulance was from Baku; I figured out that the Sumgait  ambulances hadn't done anything, they didn't respond to any calls. People  called and neither the police nor the ambulances showed any sign of life.  That doctor looked me over and I could tell from her behavior that something very good had happened, for she became quite glad. I even thought to myself,  \\\"God, can it be that nothing all that bad is wrong?\\\" She looks me over and  says, \\\"Now why are you suffering so? You don't know what your people have been doing, your people did even worse things.\\\" And I think, great, I have to deal  with her . . . And I felt so bad, I thought, why don't I just die so as not to have to hear more stuff like this from people like her? Here I am in this  condition and being told about something that our people did. I just didn't  have the energy to say, \\\"How could our people possibly be smart enough to  think of something that yours haven't already done?\\\" I stayed there. Then they brought in another woman, Ira B., she was married, and she was raped in her  own apartment, too. There were three of us, Ira, Lyuda, and 1. The next  morning they took Lyuda and Ira away. They didn't do anything to help us. This was in the old Maternity Home, in the combined block. They didn't do anything  more than examine me, that was it. I didn't want any shots or tranquilizer,  nothing. What shots could have calmed me down? I didn't even want to look at  them.  I lay in the ward. Either it just worked out that way or they did it on pur- pose, but I was alone. I was alone even though the wards were packed. That same evening a woman came by and asked me what was wrong with me, that my face was disfigured. She asked what had happened to me, and I said, \\\"Better to ask  your brother what happened, there's no point in asking me, your brother can  better explain what happened.\\\" She fell into a faint. All the doctors threw  themselves at her, and the doctor categorically forbade anyone to come into my ward.  Then people from work came to see me, my boss, his daughter; they brought me  clothing, because I was literally naked. The only thing I had on was a dress,  but the woman who gave it to me was very short, and the dress was way up  above my knees, and the woman orderly said, \\\"I can't believe you put on such a short dress, who are you showing off your legs to here?\\\" I went back to my  ward thinking, just one more thing from something. People from work came and  brought me something in a sack, apples, I think, three or four pounds, but I  couldn't take them. I had become so weak that it was just embarrassing. I said that I couldn't take the apples, and really didn't have any appetite. No one  had to bring me anything. Some woman took the sack . . . And, oh yes! . . .  Then I heard that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history should  be hidden or torn up completely so that no one would know that I was an  Armenian, maybe they wouldn't figure it out from looking at me. So they must  have been thinking that there would be some kind of attack, that something  else would happen. That it would be worse. Or, perhaps, someone was outside on the street, I don't know. In any case, I didn't sleep a wink that night.  The next morning they picked me up, a whole police detail, put me in a bus,  and off we went. I didn't even know where they were taking me. They took me to the club where the troops were, the very one I was in that ill-fated evening. I got off the bus. Near the City Party Committee there were a great many  troops, tanks, armored personnel carriers; the whole scene was terrible. I saw  a few people I knew there, and that calmed me a little. I had already thought  that I was the only one left. So there were five or six of us left in Sumgait  after that night. I still didn't know what happened to my parents, they didn't  come to see me in the hospital, and my boss told me that everything was fine.  I didn't know whether to believe him or not. Maybe he was just trying to calm  me down, maybe something happened on the way. Then I went to the club and saw  a lot of people I knew. They all knew one another, they were all kissing each  other and asking, \\\"What happened, what went on?\\\" Two days later they came to  see me from work. They were there all the time. Each day they came, showed  interest, and were constantly bringing me money. They did everything they  could. Of course I'm most thankful to my boss, the only one of my colleagues  who didn't lose his presence of mind and who didn't change his opinions,  neither before, nor after, nor in the heat of the moment, no matter what  happened. He constantly took an interest. A sincere interest, from the heart  . . . Then, about two days later, the secretary of the Party Committee came,  not from our Party organization, but from the First Trust, which ours is part  of, Comrade Kerimov, a very important figure in our town. He made arrangements with the emergency medical personnel to take me away, because if I sat down by myself I couldn't get up or lie down again. There was something wrong with my lungs, it was hard to breathe. They examined me there several times, there I  lay were several doctors, they all thought that . . . that it must just be  from all the blows, I don't know. They didn't diagnose anything in particular. When I was in the Maternity Home I even asked . . . I made it a point of  insisting that they take me to the trauma section because I felt so awful.  There was no way something inside wasn't broken, my ribs . . . Well they took  me there and took x-rays and said that everything was fine. There were  emergency medical workers on duty in the club. The mother of one of Marina's  friends was there. She was the head doctor at the Sumgait Children's Clinic.  They had every kind of antifever agent in the world, which was exactly what I needed at that moment, I thought. I said that I was having great difficulty breathing, I couldn't seem to get enough air, something was wrong with me. They put tight bandages around my chest and waist. Later I overheard some people saying that I had been cut all over. I think they just saw me being all bandaged up and decided that my breasts and face had been cut . . . But I wasn't cut.  They took us to the Khimik boarding house. We lived there a long time. Soon  appeared representatives . . . They were agitating. At first people would not  talk to them, and drove them off. One of the Armenian women shouted, \\\"We  demand that Seidov come!\\\" The response was, \\\"It's Seidov who sent us.\\\" Seidov  is the Chairman of the Azerbaijani Council of Ministers. The woman said,  \\\"We'll only see Seidov's daughter, have her come here, we'll do the same  things to her that they did to our daughters, and then we'll deal with you  agitators.\\\" And so on. More of them said, \\\"Have Seidov himself come.\\\" This  went on day in, day out. The agitators kept coming and coming, this drove us  out of our wits. Then people gradually started departing for Yerevan because  they realized it was senseless to stay. Everything got on our nerves: The  smell, the small children. There were children at the SK club, children who  had literally just come out of the Maternity Home. What were they doing in a  club that didn't even have running water all the time? At first we had to pay  to eat there. They even overcharged us, as it turned out. On the second day  someone told us that they would bring us food for free. The children were ill. Everything stank there. Well imagine about 3,000 people in a small movie  theater with seating for no more than 500. You couldn't sit or lie down, it  was impossible to even move. The stench was awful. Even the smallest infants  took ill overnight there. I heard that they were arriving seriously ill in  Yerevan, the infants. They have to be washed, they have to be bathed, not to  mention that we, the adults, were ill and needed care. People were fainting  right and left. I just don't know, everyone was crying, everyone . . . Only  the young people, the men, somehow managed to keep it together. But the women  were in a constant state of panic. It seemed to everyone that they would come  any minute and kill and stab. It seemed clear that we had been gathered  together purposely, like during the war, so that they could burn the movie  theater and there wouldn't be a single Armenian left. Then people went up to  the attic. I didn't see them, I only heard them, because I was lying down and  couldn't get up. I lay right on the stage, we had some room there. Apparently  they caught two people with either oil or gas. I think they wanted to burn the theater. Maybe someone saw them, I didn't. I was in no condition to open my  eyes.  Everyone was suspicious of everyone else. They would ask, \\\"Aren't you an  Azerbaijani? I think I saw you somewhere, I think you're an Azerbaijani.\\\" They led out all the men and started letting them back in by checking their passports, relatives might be covering for each other. Half of the people did not have any documents. There were people who had run out of their homes in  nothing but a pair of pants and slippers, or wearing just a shirt, not like they should have, with their IDs.  So on the 28th, on Sunday, I think, the police did nothing to help us. On Monday everything resumed where it had left off on Block 41A. They didn't  spare a soul there: not children, not pregnant women, nobody. They killed, they burned, they hacked with axes, just everything possible. They murdered  the Melkumian family whom I knew, my mother worked with them. Their daughter- in-law went to school with my older sister. They were brutally murdered. Only  the two daughters-in-law survived. By a miracle one was able to save herself,  she ran away, the neighbors wouldn't take her in, so she ran about the  building until she found refuge. She was pregnant and had two small children.  This all continued on Monday in Block 41A, on the 29th, when the troops were  already in the city.  They murdered people, they overturned automobiles, and they burned entire  families. They say they didn't even know for sure if the people were Armenians or not. I heard that the Lezgins suffered, too. I'm not sure myself, I didn't  see any Lezgins who had been injured. They burned cars so it's very difficult  now to say exactly who died and who didn't. It was very difficult to identify  the corpses, or rather, what remained of the corpses after they were doused in gasoline and burned . . . it's all very hard to imagine, of course I heard  that many people disappeared without a trace, from the BTZ plant two people,  including a woman who worked the night shift, Aunt Razmella, who also lived in Microdistrict 3.  They were stopping buses between Baku and Sumgait. In the evening people who  had been visiting Baku were returning to Sumgait, and people from Baku were  going home from Sumgait, and there were students, too. They were simply  savagely murdered. They were stopping the buses, the drivers immediately did  what they were told because there was just no other way to deal with that  hoard of brutally minded people. They stopped the buses, dragged the Armenians out and killed them on the spot. I didn't see it myself, but I heard that they put them all in a pile so as to burn them. Later it was hard to discern from  the corpses, well you can't call them corpses, you had to figure out from the  ashes who it was. l heard that two fellows saved two women, one a student, Ira G., if I'm not mistaken. She was in the hospital a long time after that, and  she still can't figure out who saved her. She was also brutally raped and  beaten and thrown onto a pile of corpses. The fellow pulled her out of that  whole pile of corpses, put his coat on her, took her into his arms, and  carried her to the city. I still can't imagine how he managed to do that.  I heard that from Engels Grigorian. He knows her, apparently. Well a lot of  people went to that hospital anyway. She was in the hospital and singing a  song in Armenian, and they wrote the words down, and, I think he still has  that piece of paper, because he says that a lot of people now have that song,  the one she sang in the hospital where she lay in such bad shape. They  couldn't find the guy who saved her. He left her in someone's apartment and called the ambulance, she was in such awful shape that, probably, like me, she couldn't remember anyone's face.  I think that I knew one of the people who broke into our house, maybe I had  talked with him once. But I received so many blows everything was just knocked out of my head. I can't remember to this day who he was. Then, it seems, I saw the Secretary of the Directorate's Party organization, where Marina works. She goes to school and works, she goes to night school at AZI, and works by day at the Khimzashchita Construction and Installation Administration. I'm the  Secretary of the Komsomol organization at our administration and often met  with the secretaries of Party and Komsomol organizations. We had joint  meetings. I know them all, I've even talked with them, and he, I know, is from Armenia. An Azerbaijani, but from Armenia. It became obvious that many of  those people were Azerbaijanis born in Armenia.  They took me to various police stations, to the police precinct, and to the Procuracy, because the USSR Procuracy got involved in the case, and I iden- tified the photographs of people who I could more or less recognize. They showed me the people who were in our apartment, they're working on our case, but I can't even recognize them, although it was proved that they were the ones, they're processing it somehow. They tell me that they know that someone held me by the arm and someone else held me by the leg when they were  dragging me. There was someone else in our apartment who did not even touch  me, he just stole a blanket and an earring or something like that. All these  people, all of them, as much as I've heard about them and seen them, they were all from Kafan.  The Secretary of the Party organization is named Najaf, Najaf Rzayev. He was  there when everything started. It must have been him because I didn't  recognize anyone else in the crowd whom I knew besides him. All the more since I told him, \\\"Listen, you do something, because you know me.\\\" He turned away  and went toward the bedroom, where Marina was. Well you couldn't see Marina  anyway. There was such a noisy confusion of people that you couldn't make out  anyone. All of it flew right out of my head, and then gradually I became  myself again, at the City Party Committee . . . There were military people  there. I told them what went on, and they wrote it all down. I told them his  name. On March 8 the Secretary of our First Trust Party organization, the one  we're part of, came to see us, his name is Najaf Rzayev. I tell Mamma, \\\"If he's here despite the fact that I gave his name, it means that either his  alibi has been confirmed or, probably, that they think I'm crazy, not  responsible for my words.\\\" He said, \\\"What did they do to you, how awful,  myself, I hid an Armenian family.\\\" Then after some time goes by he comes back  again and says something entirely different: \\\"I wasn't at home, my family and  I went to Baku.\\\" I said, \\\"Marina, what is he saying? He said something totally different before.\\\" After that I didn't go to see our Procurator, our case is  being handled by a procurator from Voronezh, Fedorov by name. Fedorov told me  that Rzayev's case had just gotten to him, and there were so names involved.  What are they doing with Rzayev? Did he prove his alibi or not? They just think that since I was hit in the  head I can't say anything for sure, whether it was him or not. It will be an  insult if he was in our apartment and doesn't have to pay for it, but at the  same time  I'm afraid to say I'm a hundred percent sure that it was he. Because no mat- ter who I name, they tell me, no, you're wrong, he didn't do that, that one wasn't there. All the faces have gotten mixed up in my mind. Who did what exactly I can't say.                                                       When they took me outside there was a whole crowd there, but I didn't see it,  because I had my eyes closed all the time. It seemed to me that I always got it because of my eyes, people were always hassling me, for some reason it  always seemed to me that my eyes are responsible. When they were beating my  face I thought they were trying to put my eyes out. So I had my eyes closed,  they took me outside and started to beat me. A young guy, 22, held my arms, he works at the BTZ plant. And right nearby, across the road from us, Block 41,  is where all this was going on. Right across the road from us. The BTZ  dormitory is over there, that's where he lives. Now he's in custody, they even have proved, as far as I know, that it was he who killed Shurik Gambarian, the clarinet player from the third entryway of our building. One person in our  building was killed, it was that man.  A guy comes by who shared a room with the guy who was holding me. He saw that he was holding me by the arms and that he was beating me, but he didn't come  over, he just looked and then went into the dormitory. A while after it was  all over, people started making announcements in town saying that  investigators had been summoned. That guy went and told them everything. Now  they've caught him, everything's been proved. Now, evidently, they've been beating him, I don't know what they're doing with them over there, but he  himself said that he was working the night shift at the plant. Some young guy  came to the plant and said, \\\"Everyone who wants to kill Armenians come to the  bus station on Saturday at ten.\\\" That was it. He said, the ones who wanted to, went. This was at the BTZ plant, during the night shift, probably, late Friday night. It was at night, they were at the sauna together. And he said, what do  you mean, do you understand what you are saying? The others were silent,  probably, in their hearts they were thinking, I'm going to go. But they didn't say anything to one another. He said that he thought it important to to go,  because he had heard a lot about what had happened in Kafan, that they had  killed their Azerbaijani sisters, their mothers, burned villages, and all of  that. That guy was also born in Kafan. That is certain. And Marina says that  the Secretary of the Party organization is from Armenia, too.                                                             from  I've participated in the investigation a couple of times. I'm satisfied with them thus far. They summoned us and asked about what happened, and every word  I said was recorded. I met some guy there . . . By the way, he was an  Armenian. I said that he was in our apartment, but what he did, I don't know.  His last name was Grigorian, Eduard Grigorian. He s from Sumgait, from  Microdistrict 1. He was sentenced I think, to five years, not his first time.  His mother is Russian. I met with him at the KGB in Baku, at the Azerbaijani  KGB. They took us there and showed me photographs. There were so many  photographs, I think they even photographed those people who were caught at  curfew, and I've got them all confused. I say, the face was about like this,  the guy in the white coat with the red clasps. But he could take that coat off and burn it somewhere, and it would be like looking for a needle in a  haystack. Well. This guy, Grigorian, I said, he was in our apartment, but he  is so light-complected that he looks like a Lezgin. I don't know what he did,  I can't remember. Maybe he beat me or raped me. But he was in our apartment.  At the KGB he started asking me, pleading with me, there's no need for this,  all this stuff, look me in the eyes, you're like a sister to me. I took a look at him and thought, \\\"My God, Heaven forbid that I should have a brother like  you.\\\" But they were satisfied with my responses, because I said everything  without great certainty. I was there with Mamma. Then Lyuda came in, but when  she came in she got sick immediately. She wanted to kill him, she crawled over the table at him. She recognized him. When she came to, Lyuda was lying on the balcony, the mob threw her there and all of them ran into the bedroom. We had  all kinds of boxes with dishes in them, the dowries for all three sisters.  They stole everything in the apartment, leaving only small things. At that  moment Lyuda came to and started remembering everything. Well, seeing the  faces, hearing the voices . . . Two people were saying they could burn the  apartment. Another says, why burn the apartment when I've got three kids and  no place to live. So this guy was in temporary housing, he didn't have  anywhere to live, he was from Sumgait. They were sure that they would get the  apartment. Besides, the neighbors were Azerbaijani. Why should they burn the  apartment, they might burn Azerbaijanis. That's what they said. How did they  know there were Azerbaijanis there, if they just picked a place, thinking that Armenians lived there? We have a list of the residents for our part of the  building, our name is in there, but how could they know that Azerbaijanis  lived on the other side of the wall from us? So they didn't set fire to our  apartment.  I don't know, I was in such bad shape that if all of it had come to a halt  when I was outside, if someone had asked me what was happening, I would have said that a civil war was going on. Well, maybe not civil . . . but probably civil, because when they were beating me I opened my eyes and saw that all the neighbors were standing on their balconies and watching, like at a free horror film. So a civil war was going on, and only the Armenians were being fought. If it were a world war or something like that, they would have been fighting everyone. But they only fought us. Then I met some women from  our building, some Azerbaijanis. They are crying, they tell me, \\\"Karina, we  saw all of it, how could it happen?\\\" They're asking me! Well I just don't know what to call it if a normal girl can stand there and watch what happened to  me. I think that if it were the other way around either I wouldn't have been  able to take it, or I would have tried to avert it, like that one Azerbaijani  woman did in front of our building. A woman lives there, an awful, dissipated  woman, if you can call her a woman, the dissipated life she leads. Two  Armenian families live there, in her part of the building. She came out on the balcony and saw what was happening to me and started to scream and curse. She  came down to the entryway and said, \\\"You'll come in this entryway over my dead body.\\\" So not one of them took it in his head to go in that entryway. Some  folks were saying that those people were so out of control that they didn't  even know what they were doing. I don't think that's true. They knew very well what they were doing if they didn't even lift a hand against that woman. They  couldn't have cared less about her, but the fact that she was an Azerbaijani  stopped them.  They were just beasts, they had smoked so much. When they came to our place  they were all chewing something. I noticed: Everyone who came into the  apartment was chewing something. I think, my God, maybe I just think that?  Maybe I'm losing my mind? But no, they're all chewing something. Maybe it is  some kind of drug, it must be, because . . . At first glance they all seemed  to be such normal people, young, clean-shaven, looking exactly as if they had  come to some sort of celebration. But they were shouting something. They didn't talk, they shouted, as though there were deaf people there. They  screamed and screamed: \\\"Yeah, killing, killing, we're killing the Armenians!\\\"  Only they didn't shout \\\"kill,\\\" they shouted \\\"gurun ermianlary.\\\" Gurun  literally means \\\"kill,\\\" or \\\"destroy.\\\"  That's how it was! I'll continue. We hid in a captain's apartment, he's an Azerbaijani, his wife is a Tatar. We were sitting in their apartment, their  kids were out in the yard. Their kids knew a whole lot. This was in our part  of the building, on the third floor. When Mamma came to and couldn't find Lyuda she took Papa's hand, this was while the looters were stealing things, but they didn't pay attention because they were stealing things. Apparently they had already ceased killing and switched to stealing. Mamma found the courage to . . .  A boy said to my mother \\\"Where's the gold?\\\" Mamma said he must have been 12  to 14 years old. He even looked Russian, he was so fair-skinned. But the  Azerbaijanis from Armenia are fair-skinned. I noticed they were all on the  fair side. He shouted, they were all smashing things, and he asks Mamma where  the gold is. We kept our gold in the wardrobe with our important papers. In a  little black bag, we kept everything in there. Mamma doesn't really like to  wear gold. She probably never even wore those things from the time they were  bought for her. They took everything that was lying on the cheval glass. Mamma thinks that the gold saved us. Because they threw themselves at the gold, and  Mamma grabbed Papa, who was trying to breathe. They had closed his mouth,  bound his hands, and put a pillow and a chair on his face . . . They had  shoved something into his mouth so he would suffocate. Mamma grabbed him and  tore all that stuff off . . . He had something in his mouth, he was having  trouble breathing, his nose was filled with blood. Mamma grabbed him and  started running from the fifth down to the first floor because no one wanted  to open their doors to them. Mamma said that by accident, completely by  accident that person opened his door, he was sleeping, and said, half-awake,  \\\"What's happened?\\\" He sees that they are bloody. Mamma said, \\\"At least go and  find out what's happening to my daughters, even if they've burned them or  murdered them, at least bring the corpses.\\\" He went looking for us. At that  moment Lyuda was under the bed. She says that after they left it seemed that  someone was calling her name. When he quietly called her she couldn't get out  from under the bed. She wanted to get out and was calling softly. She thought  she was shouting, but in fact she was either silent or was only talking to  herself, it just seemed to her that she was shouting. When she got out from  under the bed everyone was gone. And again . . . She thought that she had lost her mind. I'll never leave here, never! To hell with it! It just seems that  way to me, I'll come to eventually. But then, when everything had settled  down, stopped, that mall brought Lyuda down, and Igor carried me in from outside. Or first I was brought in, then Lyuda, I don't remember what order it happened in.  And Mamma said, \\\"Listen, they're all running around down there, shouting  something or other, and running toward the other building.\\\" It had more or  less calmed down where we were. Who's dead, who's alive, we don't know. I  tried to call my girlfriend. I had basically come to. Mamma says, \\\"Listen; let's go upstairs, at least get a mattress or something. We don't know how  long we'll be here. Maybe they didn't burn everything.\\\" I don't get it, all women have that feeling, they want to get something from their homes, maybe  not everything was taken? I tell Mamma, \\\"Mamma, what do you need any of that  for? To hell with it! We're alive, forget the rest of it, all of it!\\\" She says, \\\"No, let's go get at least something. Maybe we'll leave here, spend the  night at someone else's.\\\" Mamma went upstairs, and their little boy, their son Alik, was standing on the lookout. lIe was standing there to see if they were  coming. They only managed to run up there and grab something one time. He  shouts, \\\"Come back, they're coming!\\\" They didn't have enough time to get a  lot, mattresses from one apartment, a blanket from another . . . Mamma got my  knitting . . . Someone managed to grab our old things, the ones we never wore, out of the hall . . . Someone took Father's old coveralls. The neighbor, his  wife, Mamma and Papa . . . Marina went with them. I was in no condition to  leave. Neither was Lyuda. We just sat. They ran out and we closed the door and just then we hear that the mob is on its way toward our place upstairs,  they're dragging something again. They were going toward the other building,  maybe over by the school, or . . . There was an unfinished building over there, people said they were going toward the basement or the unfinished  building, they could gradually carry everything over there. Then things more  or less calmed down. I tried to call my boss.  Later there was more noise. We were on the third floor, in a one-bedroom apartment, and a woman lives in the one-bedroom place on the second floor, Asya Dallakian. She's an old woman, retired. She wasn't at home, at that time she was usually in the country, she has a married daughter there, and her grandson is in the army. She is only very rarely in town; she gets her retirement money and the apartment is essentially vacant. They started pounding on her door and broke it down. She had two or three beds in there,  something like that, she's a 60-to 70-year-old woman who really does not even  live there. Probably she had some pots, a couple of metal bed frames and  mattresses, and a television. When her grandson came she bought a television.  They started wrecking everything. I started getting sick again. I think, \\\"My  God, what is going on around here? When will this end?\\\" We turned off the  lights and sat. As it turns out the people who weren't afraid, the ones who  knew what was going on, knew not to turn off the lights. We didn't know, but  they didn't come to where we were all the same. They all knew very well that  he was a captain. He went out and closed the door, and we sat in his  apartment. His last name was Kasumov. He's an exserviceman, retired, works up  at the fire station at some plant or other. He went out and stood at his door. They tell him, \\\"Comrade Captain, don't worry, we won't harm you, you're one of us.\\\" He went upstairs, and they say, \\\"Aren't you taking anything from this  apartment?\\\" He says, \\\"I don't need anything.\\\" And the women who were standing  in the yard . . . we have a basement, full of water . . . the women who were  standing in the yard saw. Those guys, they left everything they stole on the  first floor and ran upstairs again. The women threw everything they had time  to into the basement, to save our property. Some things were left: dirty  pillows, two or three other things and a rug. A guy came downstairs, really  mad, and he says, \\\"Where's the rug? I just put it right here!\\\" They tell him,  \\\"Some guy came and took it and went off toward the school.\\\" He ran off in that direction.  Oh! I forgot the most important point. When Igor picked me up in his arms,  there were women standing there who saw everything that was going on. They  just didn't tell me about it for a long time. The wife of that military man,  she didn't want to kill my spirit, I was already dead enough. Later she told  me, that after they murdered Uncle Shurik in the third entryway one of them,  the ringleader, apparently a young man, said, \\\"Where's the girl who was here?\\\" And he became furious. The woman tells him, \\\"She came to . . . \\\" She didn't know what to say: Think something up? Someone carried her off? Then they would comb the whole house and find me and our whole family. So the woman says, \\\"She came to and went to the basement.\\\" Now, our basement is full of water. So the  whole mob dashes off to the basement to look for me or my corpse. They took  flashlights; they were up to their waists in water, water which had been  standing there for years, and soot, and fuel oil. They climbed down in there  to get me. Then one of them said, \\\"There's so much water down there, she  probably walked and walked and then passed out and died. She met her death in  the basement. That's it, we can leave, no problem!\\\" I didn't know that, and  when I was told, I felt worse. Two times worse. A lot worse! So they didn't  just want to pound me flat, something more awful was awaiting me . . .  After that we of course didn't want to live in Sumgait any longer. We really  didn't want to go back to our apartment. When we moved, I went up there and  started to quiver and shake all over, because I started remembering it all.  Although the neighbors all sobbed, it was all . . . so cheap . . . The people  who sat in their apartments and didn't help us at a time like that. I think  that they could have helped! I don't think that they were obligated to, but  they could have helped us! Because that one woman was able to stop that whole  brutal crowd by herself. That means they could have, too. It would have been enough foe one man or women to say, What do you think you're doing?\\\" That's  all! That would have done it. There were 60 apartments in our building. Not  one person said it! When I was lying on the ground and all those people were  standing on their balconies I didn't hear anyone's voice, no one said what are you doing, leave her alone . . . Mamma even told one of the neighbor women  that if it had been an Azerbaijani woman in my place they would have dropped a bomb if it would have killed even one Armenian. They would have stood up for  one of their own. True, they say that our neighbor from the fourth entryway,  an old/ sick woman tried to stop the pogrom. The Azerbaijanis have a custom:  if a woman takes her scarf and throws it on the ground, the men are supposed  to stop immediately. The old woman from the fourth entryway did that, but they stomped her scarf into the ground, pushed her off to the side, and said, \\\"If you want to go on living, you'll disappear into your apartment.\\\" So she left. That trick didn't work on them.  Even the neighbors who helped us move told me, OK, fine, calm down, forget  that it happened. I said I'd only forget it if I told them right then that it had happened to their daughter--and if that didn't have any effect on them,  then I would forget everything, too. Imagine that it happened to your sister.  And no one did anything. Anything.

With \\\"pseudo\\\" clubbing, the angle is initially positive, then negative, which is the normal situation. \\\"Real\\\" internists can talk for hours about clubbing. I'm limited to a couple of minutes.  Whether this distinction has anything to do with reality is entirely unclear, but it is one of those things that internists love to paw over during rounds. Supposedly, only \\\"true\\\" clubbing is associated with disease. The problem is that the list of diseases associated with clubbing is quite long, and includes both congenital conditions and acquired disease. Since many of these diseases are associated with cardiopulmonary problems leading to right to left shunts and chronic hypoxemia, it is very reasonable to get a chest xray. However, many of the  congenital abnormalities would only be diagnosed with a cardiac catheterization.   The cause of clubbing is unclear, but presumably relates to some factor causing blood vessels in the distal fingertip to dilate abnormally.   Clubbing is one of those things from an examination which is a tipoff to do more extensive examination. Often, however, the cause of the clubbing is quite apparent.\",\"With the popularity of minivans, the market room for station wagons is  squeezed out.

Regards,\",\"  : [ The discussion begins: why does the universe exist at all?  ]   : One of the Laws of Nature, specifying cause and effect seems to dictate  : (at least to this layman's mind) there must be a causal event.  No : reasonable alternative exists.  I would argue that causality is actually a property of spacetime;  causes precede their effects. But if you claim that there must be an answer to \\\"how\\\" did the universe (our spacetime)  emerge from  \\\"nothing\\\", science has some good candidates for an answer.  I have always wondered why Christians use the \\\"There are questions science (or atheism) cannot answer\\\" argument; I hope this is the appropriate group to ask this question.  The most popular question is the question of origins. Why does the universe exist, or anything, for that matter?  I think this question should actually be split into two parts, namely  1) Why is there existence? Why anything exists?  and  2) How did the universe emerge from nothing?  It is clear science has nothing to say about the first question. However, is it a meaningful question, after all?  I would say it isn't. Consider the following:  A die-hard skeptic being (be it human or whatever) attempts to doubt one's very existence. Since it is so easy to doubt everything else - I cannot be _sure_ the world exists, it may be my mind fooling me - can I ever be sure I exist?  However, it is only possible to exist or not to exist. (Someone insert an appropriate Shakespeare quote here ;-) )  A being that does not exist cannot doubt one's existence. A being that does exist can doubt one's existence, but this would be pointless - the being would exist anyway.  Let us return to the original question: why? A being that does not exist does not need any reasons for its non-existence. This being is not _sure_ whether anything else exists but his mind, but let us assume that the world exists independent of the mind (the objectivity postulate). The question \\\"why anything exists\\\" can be countered by demanding answer to a question \\\"why there is nothing in nothingness, or in non-existence\\\". Actually, both questions turn out to be devoid of meaning. Things that exist do, and things that don't exist don't exist. Tautology at its best.  I seriously doubt God could have an answer to this question.  Some Christians I have talked to have said that actually, God is Himself the existence. However, I see several problems with this answer. First, it inevitably leads to the conclusion that God is actually _all_ existence, good and evil, devils and angels, us and them. This is pantheism, not Christianity.  Another answer is that God is the _source_ of all existence. This sounds much better, but I am tempted to ask: Does God Himself exist, then? If God is the source of His own existence, it can only mean that He has, in terms of human time, always existed. But this is not the same as the source of all existence. This argument sounds like God does not exist, but meta-exists, and from His meta-existent perspective, He created existence. I think this is actually a nonsolution, a mere twist of words.  The best answer I have heard is that human reasoning is incapable of understanding such questions. Being an atheist myself, I do not accept such answers, since I do not have any other methods.  The second question: How did the universe emerge from nothing? belongs to the domain of science, and I, for one, do not doubt the question can be answered by its methods. Many cosmologists have suggested that it is entirely possible for universes to emerge from vacuum (this possibility has been suggested in a recent Hawking biography; see also Lizhi & Shuxian: Creation of the Universe, World Scientific, 1989). However, I think the sci groups are more appropriate for discussions like this.   : As far as I can tell, the very laws of nature demand a \\\"why\\\".  That isn't : true of something outside of nature (i.e., *super*natural).  This is not true. Science is a collection of models telling us \\\"how\\\", not why, something happens. I cannot see any good reason why the \\\"why\\\" questions would be bound only to natural things, assuming that the supernatural domain exists. If supernatural beings exist, it is as appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist.   : I believe the \\\"genetic code\\\" will be entirely deciphered in our lifetimes, : but we will not see man convert entirely inert material into self sustaining,  : reproducing life, *ever*.  (I've never been much of a prophet, though. I : can't even *picture* New York in my mind 8^] ).  I don't believe *any* : technology would be able to produce that necessary *spark* of life, despite : having all of the parts available. Just my opinion.  This opinion is also called vitalism; namely, that living systems are somehow _fundamentally_ different from inanimate systems. Do Christians in general adopt this position? What would happen when scientists announce they have created primitive life (say, small bacteria) in a lab?  There is a problem with your prophecy: artificial life has been created, although not yet in a chemical form. Computer simulations of evolution contain systems that are as much alive as any bacterium, although their code is electronic, as well as their metabolism. See a recent book  Steven Levy: Artificial life - The Quest for a New Creation. Jonathan Cape, London 1992.  Artificial chemical life is just around the corner - after all, no  spark of life has been found to be necessary; living systems do not violate any physical laws as we know them.   : You don't mind if a few of us send up a prayer on your behalf during your : research, do you?  After all, if we of Christ are deluding ourselves, you : really have nothing to worry about, eh?  Exactly. This is why I think atheists should _not_ post any evangelical atheist arguments to soc.religion groups, since people who seek to  find peace in religions must be allowed to gather together. I would normally have asked these questions in alt.atheism or talk.religion.misc, but it seems many Christians do not read these groups.

In that posting I made sure I used the word \\\"public\\\".  Public revelation contains God's truth intended for everyone to believe.  The revelation contained in the Bible is a significant subset of public revelation.  Private revelation is revelation that God gives to an individual.  He may speak directly to the individual, He may send an angel, or He may send the Virgin Mary or some lesser saint.  The only person who is required to believe a private revelation is the person to whom it is revealed. Devotional practices may be based on reported private revelations, but doctrines can not.  When an alleged private revelation attracts sufficient attention, the Church may investigate it.  If the investigation indicates a likelihood that the alleged private revelation is in fact from God, it will be approved.  That means that it can be preached in the Church.  However, it is still true that no one is required to believe that it came from God.  A Catholic is free to deny the authenticity of even the most well attested and strongly approved private revelations, such as those at Fatima and Lourdes.  (I suspect that few if any Catholics do reject Fatima and Lourdes, but if any do their rejection of them does not mean they are not orthodox Catholics in good standing.)  I do not have at hand a list of the criteria the Church uses in evaluating an alleged private revelation--it's not something I need every day--but I know that one of the primary requirements is that nothing in the alleged private revelation can contradict anything known through public revelation ------- Marty Helgesen Bitnet: mnhcc@cunyvm   Internet: mnhcc@cunyvm.cuny.edu\",\"  Of course you could develope this system, but there is already a system called Global Positioning Satellites.

This was two weeks to the DAY from when I called the order in.      Upon unboxing it I found everything to be in perfect order. All the  peripherals I ordered were properly installed (Jumbo-250 & CD-ROM). I was very impressed with the quantity and quality of the Gateway  documentation. All software came with the original disks and manuals. The Gateway manual itself is in a nice 3-ring binder. The ATI GUP came with build59 drivers. All other software I specified (Microsoft Office) was properly installed. The machine came right up out of the box and  has been performing flawlessly. It's been on all weekend and it hardly even reaches room temperature. I think the big roomy tower case has a  lot to do with it.      It's up and running DOS 6.0 with no problems. I've also read about some people having problems with high speed serial communications.  I used the DOS 6.0 InterLink program which lets me link to my old computer via a serial port at 115.2K baud. It then \\\"maps\\\" the other machines two hard disks as my disks F & G. You can \\\"cd\\\" to these drives and either run programs or copy files. It's almost like a peer-peer lan except you can also *run* programs on the other machine. It's not a two way street. The other machine is the server and this machine is the client. So thats where it seems to differ from the  peer to peer stuff. For a bundled DOS utility its very impressive.     My Jumbo-250 took about 11 minutes to back up 117MB of data.

The Federalist papers are propaganda and it is therefore difficult to determine precisely what Maddison etc were up to from them. They certainly emphasised a limited role for the federal government but this was not necessarily their true position.   The Senate was less powerful than the House of Lords in the period in question. The stripping of the powers of the House of Lords did not occur until 1914 and David Llloyd George's budget. Even despite this the House of Lords has considerable power even today and is far from a rubber stamping body.

Actually, if they intend to mass armour against the (weakly-armed, at that) civilian population, we need the right to field tactical nukes. Government tyranny! Who would have ever thought it would happen here!  I wonder who'se house they'll run tanks through next, because the gov. SUSPECTS child abuse. Maybe yours! Maybe mine! And what is an Illegal Weapon (which they have yet to show us), if the 2nd amendment is designed to do what I believe it is, and the gov. uses tanks against you? Government self-serving? Naaaah. Not here.  Time was when the U.S. used armour/attack helicopters against small countries.

A single chip micro and a crystal will do the job reliably and easily.  An 8748 only costs about $5.  That and a $1 crystal and you're in business.  Embed the whole thing in a foam insulated blanket, power it from a solar cell, use the excess power to heat the assembly during the day and rely on the insulation to hold the heat during darkness.  If you don't want to try thermal management, contact someone like ICL and have them cut you a special low temperature crystal.  It'll cost at most $20.  If you use a single chip micro, you're looking at a parts count of  maybe 7.  A processor, a crystal, two caps on the crystal, a power FET to fire the solenoid a flyback diode and a battery.  This is fewer parts than  you can build an analog timer for and is infinitely more reliable.  Add a power zener diode (for heat) and a solar cell and the parts count screams up to 9.  PD assemblers are available for all the common single chip micros.

However, the doctors would have enough confidence and conviction to claim, out of genuine concern, that is IS necessary.

The fact is that millions of people today are sending highly confidential information over unencoded, easy to receive cellular phones.  They figure the chances of being heard are small, so they risk it.  And 99.9% of people don't understand crypto the way the least of the sci.crypt newbies does.   If Clinton tells them it's good crypto, they'll believe him, and send important stuff over it, and be thankful that they're no longer using clear-voice FM cellular phones.  Only a tiny fraction of people will want more crypto.

The project manager is Dr. John Hunter, and he works for the Laser group at Livermore.  What, you may ask, does gas guns have to do with lasers? Nothing, really, but the gun is physically located across the road from the Free Electron Laser building, and the FEL building has a heavily shielded control room (thick walls) from which the gun firings are controlled.  So I suspect that the office he works for is an administrative convenience.  I visited Hunter at the beginning of Feb. and we toured the gun. At the time I was working on gas gun R&D at Boeing, where I work, but I am now doing other things (helping to save the space station),  The gun uses a methane-air mixture, which is burned in a chamber about 200 ft long by 16 inch ID (i.e. it looks like a pipe). The chamber holds a 1 ton piston which is propelled at several hundred m/s down the chamber.  On the other side of the piston is hudrogen gas, initially at room temperature andsome tens of atmospheres.  The piston compresses and heats the hydrogen ahead of it until a stainless steel burst diaphragm ruptures, at around 50,000 psi. The barrel of the gun is about 100 feet long and has a 4 inch bore.  It is mounted at right angles to the chamber (i.e. they intersect).  This was done so that in the future, the barrel could be raised and the gun fired into the air without having to move the larger and heavier chamber.  The projectile being used in testing is a 5 kg cylinder of Lexan plastic, 4 in in diameter and about 50 cm long.  All of the acceleration comes from the expansion of the hydrogen gas from 50,000 psi downwards until the projectile leaves the barrel.  The barrel is evacuated, and the end is sealed with a sheet of plastic film (a little thicker than Saran wrap).  The plastic is blown off by the small amount of residual air trapped in the barrel ahead of the projectile.    The gun is fired into a bunker filled with sandbags and plastic water jugs.  In the early testing fragments of the plastic projectile were found.  At the higher speeds in later testing, the projectile vaporizes.  The testing is into a bunker because the Livermore test range is about 3 miles across, and the projectile would go 100-200 km if fired for maximum range.  The intent is to move the whole gun to Vandenberg AFB after the testing is complete, where they can fire into the Pacific Ocean, and use the tracking radar at VAFB to follow the projectiles.  The design goal of the gun is to throw a 5 kg projectile at 4 km/s (half of orbital speed).  So far they have reached 2 km/s, and the gun is currently down for repairs, as on the last test they blew a seal and damaged some of the hardware (I think it had to do with the methane-air more detonating than burning, but I haven't had a chance to talk to Hunter directly on this).  There are people waiting to test scramjet components in this gun by firing then out of the gun into the air (at Mach 12= 4 km/s), since the most you can get in wind tunnels is Mach 8.  This gun cost about 4 million to develop, and is basically a proof-of-concept for a bigger gun capable of firing useful- sized payloads into space.  This would require on the order of 100 kg projectiles, which deliver on the order of 20 kg useful payload to orbit.

If you want to know about events in Palestine it makes more sense to get the news directly from the source. EVERY news source is inherently biased to some extent and for various reasons, both intentional and otherwise. However,  the more sources relied upon the easier it is to see the \\\"truth\\\" and to discern  the bias.   Go read or listen to some Israeli media. You will learn more news and more opinion about Israel and Palestine by doing so.

I have to talked to a few Duc owners (750SS owners in particular) who say that the power is something less than overwhelming.  That said, I would love to have a 900SS.  I guess I should have been a bit more specific.  If you have something that weighs that same as the 750, go  for the extra cubes.    I think that fact that I own a GTV-6 shows that I don't care about maximum power (it's no slug though) to the exclusion of everything else.  The note  and the handling are more important to me.  I just bought a Ninja because I  couldn't afford a Duc.

Third gear would just disengage.  Engine would rev up.  Kind of disconcerting.  I sold that car quite a few years back but the memory of that tranny sticks with me.  It also had a clutch chatter in first that the dealer could not fix.  If the lemon law had been in place then, that car would have been covered.  I have had several Jap cars since then (figuring the Horizon was my contribution to the American Auto Companies), and have never seen any bad behavior with the exception of a Toyota Tercel with a bit of clutch chatter that they did fix on the first try.  Anyway, from that day forward, I have sworn that I would never purchase another American car with a standard.  American manufacturers don't have a clue on how to manufacture five speed transmissions and have been doing the automatics much longer and on many more cars. However, I hate automatics, so I am still buying Jap cars.  Not sure this is any help, but other cars do this too.
