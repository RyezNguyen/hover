On those three, I am unable to use the X11R5 libraries to build Motif clients, because I get link errors between the vendor-supplied port of Motif and my X11R5. I anticipate having this same problem when X11R6 becomes available.    The result is that I cannot build Motif clients that rely on X11R5, since I do not have Motif compiled under X11R5.

Blacks have the same (+- 2%) crime report rate, arrest rate, and incarceration rate for violent crimes.  So I doubt that for violent crimes, that there is any inherent bias mechanism present.  There is a wider discrepancy for all crimes for blacks wrt to 3 categories.  Interestingly enough, the discrepancy is the largest in the Southern United States -- where blacks are incarcerated well BELOW the average in the rest of the United States! Which points to an anti-bias-against wrt blacks.  In any case, for violent crimes and burglary and drug selling, blacks are reported 53%, arrested 44%, and are present in jails/prisons 47% (1988).  Considering that 12% of the population is black, 6% are black males, and some percentage of that is out of the high/low age groups, we do have a situation where (if I remember my old calculations right) 4% of the population commits almost half of the really nasty crimes.  Blacks with similar histories (crime) to whites get the same sentences, except in the South, where they receive around 20% less on paper!!    --  There are actually people that STILL believe Love Canal was some kind of environmental disaster.

The national government retains the right to make any laws necessary to sufficiently deter and punish any crime against someone's civil rights until that behavior becomes so well punished that nobody even tries it! The fact is, that at last count, gays were not beating straights for their sexual orientation. Thus, the law is getting applied only to the straights who indulge themselves. The federal government or judiciary has the right to enforce the 14th amendment guarantee of equal protection under law even if it takes 1000 possible charges against people who would violate them.

After a large response (about 15 email messages), I've decided that there is sufficient interest here on t.p.g. to warrant posting.  *** file follows ***   Hi Folks;  As perhaps the only Boise resident on the list, I guess it kind of falls on me to keep people updated about the Randy Weaver/Kevin Harris trial.  Yesterday marked the seating of the jury.  Apparently no other legal activities occurred.  The jury was selected and things start today.  More interesting is what happenned outside.  About a dozen Weaver supporters showed up to stage a protest outside the courthouse.  One woman carried a sign that read, \\\"Who stands trial for the murder of Vicki and (son's name - I forget) Weaver?\\\"  On the evening news she said, \\\"I am here protesting because I believe in freedom of speech and freedom of religion. I thought we all did.\\\"  Nice sound bite (grin)!  The news reporter also interviewed some guy named \\\"Tim\\\" who refused to give his last name.  Not to prejudge the guy, but he looked like a neo-nazi.  He also said he expected many neo-nazis to show up throughout the trial. \\\"Tim\\\" had been handing out leaflets in support of Weaver and Harris and the news had footage of a Boise cop telling him to move along or he'd arrest.  I don't know the finer points of this one.  Perhaps there's a law against political activity within X feet of a courthouse or something (what happenned to the First Amendment?!?).  Most ominous of all was that the local reporter filmed an agent of the Gestapo...err...ATF with a minicam FILMING THE PROTESTORS!  Welcome to the world of Big Brother.

One of the folks involved in those discussions, a spacecraft engineer named Preston Carter, passed the suggestion on to  some entreprenurial types, and Mike Lawson is apparently going ahead with it.  Preston is now at LLNL, and is working with Space Marketing on  the sensors that might be carried.  Actually, that sounds unlikely.  I don't know what the launch vehicle would be, but I would expect it to go on a commercial launcher -- certainly not on the Shuttle -- and the fraction of the cost paid to NASA for, e.g.,  launch support would probably  cover NASA's incremental costs pretty well.   No, as noted, LLNL is involved in lightweight sensor design, per  Clementine and related programs.  I'm sure folks around here would like to  see a demonstration of a modern inflatable structure, but after all,  the U.S. did the Echo satellites long ago, and an advertising structure would not be much closer to an inflatable space station than Echo was (or a parade balloon, for that matter).  While I happen to personally dislike the idea, mostly because I've got a background in astronomy, it's hardly vandalism -- it would be a short-lived intrusion on the night sky, doing no permanent damage and actually hurting only a small subset of astronomers.  On the other hand, it would certainly draw attention to space.     Which, unfortunately, this is not likely to contribute much to.   As far as I know, it's a purely commercial venture.  I gather it is being very seriously discussed with possible advertisers.

This will be the the first time I've taken anyone for an extended ride    (read: farther than around the block  :-).  We'll be riding some twisty,     fairly bumpy roads (the Mines Road-Mt.Hamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans).  Communication:  work out your own system.  Or just slow down and holler back every once in a while.  At reasonable speeds, even on my under-muffled Magna, we can hear each other.  It's only above, say, 45 MPH that you  can't really communicate.  Balance: New passengers are a real pain, because you never know how they're going to react to steering.  Some people catch on immediately and lean with me.  Others are completely skittish about the leaning thing, and keep their bodies perpendicular to the horizon.  This is a pain while turning, but manageable.  The WORST are the passengers who stay perpendicular to the horizon, then REMEMBER in the middle of a turn and WHIP AROUND until they're in the `correct' position.  This always screws up the line I've picked out.  Here's my personal checklist of things to tell passengers:  - attire: helmet, long pants, boots/heavy shoes, jacket.  - Keep feet on pegs at all times, unless I say otherwise.  Do not    get on/off unless I say you can.  (I've had people try to dismount    in traffic, just as I'm pulling in to a parking space!)  - Muffler gets HOT! ('Nuff said)  - We get *GOOD* traction.  We're not going to fall over.  (Many    first-time riders are surprised by how tightly you can turn!)  - Turn dynamics:  sit so that you feel like you're sitting upright and    we're going straight.  Trust your butt, not your eyes -- if you're    confused, close your eyes for a couple of turns to get the feel    of it.  Or just hug me tight.    - Please, no sudden moves -- shift your weight as desired, but be     gradual, so I can compensate.  - Your faceplate is yours to open/close as desired.  - Trust is essential.  Trust the driver (me) to do the right     thing -- I've driven many miles on this thing, and know how    to operate it.  Enjoy the ride.  (This is important to    stress.  For example, one of my first-time passwngers seemed to     watch the speedo like a hawk:  I drove her to the beach down 84,     and whever we topped 35 mph, she'd holler, \\\"SLOW DOWN! I'M SCARED\\\"     I humored her for a while, then simply covered the speedometer with     the spare piece of duct tape I keep stuck to the top of the cluster.    Problem solved:  she watched the scenery instead of the    instruments, and had a much better time.  Based on her    experience driving a Lincoln Continental, she was unwilling to     trust my ability to choose a safe speed for the bike.)  Usually I'll point out the controls, engine, transmission, brakes,  tires, etc. and discuss motorcycle physics a bit too for first-timers. Helps calm their nerves, and gives the bike a chance to warm up.  Watch out for gravel on the Mt. Hamilton road:  there were lots of little mudslides after the last big rain; by now, many of the blind corners will be nicely covered with a carpet of little, round, nearly invisible stones. It doesn't help build trust when you slide out on a blind corner, on the  first trip!  Good luck -- have fun!\",\" Only the most comprehensive survey on sexuality in 50 years.

Other than that, the award goes to Robert Lang, an uninspiring Czech.

My top is a 46L and the bottom is a 48L.  For the bottom, the waist is far too large, but the thighs fit just right (the 46 had a better waist, but cut off the circulation in my legs, I have large, muscular thighs, and no, I didn't use the thighmaster to get them :-).  The jacket fits me ok in the chest, slightly snug at the waist, and too small in the arms.  I can't imagine finding a one-piece size that would have fit correctly, as even the 2 piece has it's problems (strange, since my V-Pilot jacket fits great all over, and when I tried the matching pants, they fit like a glove as well).  I can only assume the models Aero Design uses to design its suits are in some way different from us real folks.  Also, even though it's related to convienience, you look pretty damn wierd walking around with the tops and bottoms while running errands. I've gotten some really suspicious looks, and sweated a lot while in a store wearing the whole suit, since you can't fit the top and bottom in any motorcycle storage device yet devised (except the trunk in my sidecar rig :-).  With the two piece, I unzip the pants (I generally leave the two pieces zipped together, primarily because the pants fall down unless I pull the cheesy elastic belt-type band real tight), stuff them in one of my spacious BMW saddlebags (the pants just fit), and run errands just wearing the jacket.  Actually, if I know I'll be running errands, I just wear my V-Pilot jacket, but that's just me...  As far as crash protection, I'd say that both suits are probably equal.  It seems that for weather protection, if anything the 2 piece provides a little more because of the jacket overlapping the pants by 3 inches.  The 2 piece is probably a little less comfortable around the waist, just because of the extra layer of stuff, but maybe not.  So I'd have to vote for the two piece.  Despite the slightly odd fit, I still find the suit the most versatile piece of riding clothing I own.  Wouldn't go long distance without it.

If I rob or beat up or rape or kill someone, it's very clear to anyone not a sociopath that I've done something immoral.  On the other hand, if I smoke grass or have sex with a consenting adult in a manner illegal in that state, the morality or immorality of that act is merely a lifestyle choice; it doesn;t clearly hurt anyone else.

I can't imagine how to estimate bat speed, but its pretty obvious that Jose is missing fastballs he used to hit, likely due to his back.    I don't know, he had an even more open stance when he first came up with the A's, and had no problems with it then. It might be that pre-back problems, he was quick enough to cover up any deficiencies the stance caused, but now he's lost just enough bat speed that the stance hurts him. The old saying if you're hot its a trigger mechanism, if you're cold, its a hitch.    The biggest problem IMHO is he never has found a stance he's comfortable with for more than a few months. He changes his stance so much, he loses track of where the strike zone is. In Wednesday's night game, he was  clearly mad at strike calls on both corners that looked pretty good to me. I think he no longer knows where the strike zone really is because he's changed his stance so much.  I'm also a bit concerned that because he's got Palmer and Gonzalez hitting all the homeruns, he'll become competitive, swing even harder and screw himself up even worse.

Why don't you compare the rates at which blacks and whites commit crimes? Blacks commit crimes disproportionately, so in a perfectly fair penal system, blacks would be disproportionately represented.  (Note: black vs. white crime rates is not a racial thing.  It's probably an economic thing: poor people are more likely to commit crimes, and blacks are more likely to be poor.  The way to reduce the proportion of minorities in prison is to increase the wealth of minorities.)\",\"Dear folks,  I am still awaiting for some sensible answer and comment.  It is a fact that the inhabitants of Gaza are not entitled to a normal civlized life. They habe been kept under occupation by Israel since 1967 without civil and political rights.   It is a fact that Gazans live in their own country, Palestine. Gaza is not a foriegn country. Nor is TelAviv, Jaffa, Askalon, BeerSheba foreign country for Gazans. All these places are occupied as far as Palestinians are concerned and as far as common sense has it.   It is a fact that Zionists deny Gazans equal rights as Israeli citizens and the right to determine by themsevles their government. When Zionists will begin to consider Gazans as human beings who deserve the same rights as themselves, there will be hope for peace. Not before.  Somebody mentioned that Gaza is 'foreign country' and therefore Israel is entitled to close its borders to Gaza. In this case, Gaza should be entitled to reciprocate, and deny Israeli civilians and military personnel to enter the area. As the relation is not symmetrical, but that of a master and slave, the label 'foreign country' is inaccurate and misleading.  To close off 700,000 people in the Strip, deny them means of subsistence and means of defending themselves, is a collective punishment and a crime. It is neither justifiable nor legal. It just reflects the abyss  to which Israeli society has degraded.   I would like to ask any of those who heap foul langauge on me to explain why Israel denies Gazans who were born and brought up in Jaffa to return and live there ? Would they be allowed to, if they converted to Judaism ? Is their right to live in their former town depdendent upon their religion or ethnic origin ?

By your logic, it would be OK for them to come into your home, take away your bible, and send you off to \\\"re-education camps\\\" to save your mind from ruin.  Are you ready for that?        /(hudson) /And why is there nothing wrong with it?  Because you say so?  Who gave you /the authority to say that, and set the standard for morality?  Why?  Because:  I am a living, thinking person able to make choices for myself.

Because: I set the standard for my *own* morality, and I permit you to do  the same for yourself.  I also do not try to force you to accept my rules.

It is also a point of respect:  I trust other people to be intelligent enough to make their own choices, and I expect the same to be returned.  You, on the other hand, do not trust them, and want to make the choice for them--whether they like it or not.  It is also a way to avoid an inconsistency:  if you believe that you have  the right to set moral standards for others and interfere in their lives,  then you must, by logic, admit that other people have the same right of  interference in your life.

Big Brother is NOT always right. \",\"The problems with Catholic liturgy are likely to continue for some time.  The problem is, in a nutshell, this: the Liturgy is a symbolic action - in other words Catholics do [or should] believe that the _signs_ during the mass - Water, Blessings, Vestments, Altar, Relics, etc - are real. That is the sprinkling of water bestows real, almost tangible, holiness, the Vestments are a real indication of real sacred time. The point of a _symbol_ is that it is understood by all to be connected to an underlying REAL referent. This kind of thinking precludes analysis; holy water is not holy because of anything, it simply IS holy.  But, modern westerners find it extremely difficult, especially if well- educated, to think of the mass as a symbol. We are more likely to see it as a _sign_, ie an action that represents grace, but which could be replaced with other signs. In concrete terms, this means the mass has become a commercial for God's grace rather than the real thing. You can mess around with a commercial in a way you wouldn't dare with the real thing [ask Coca-Cola Co.!]. These attitudes have been encouraged by Liturgy workshops, etc. which instead of focusing on _how_ to do do liturgy, have focused on how to create a meaning in liturgy. You can only create signs, symbols have to come from God [or the heart, or somewhere deeper than analysis. The most dramatic example of this shift in understanding has been in the treatment of the sacred species [the consecrated host and wine]. Now, with pita bread etc, it is common to come away from the altar with hands covered in particles. If the Host is a sign of Grace, this isnt and issue; but Catholics in the past would have been distraught at this real desacration of the real symbol of Jesus' body.  Modern Catholic liturgy  is caught in this epistemological shift. We try to perfrom the old rites, but then we have some liturgomaniac priest get up and 'explain' what we are doing - so we stop doing it and start pretending to do it. This is not a soul filling experience. It doesn't help BTW that we have got stuck witha huge amount of two and three chord ersatz-folk music [again a result of mis-analysis: complicated tunes are in fact easier to remember than simple ones - this was the genius of Wesley and the 19C Anglican hymn writers]. Taize' is only slightly better.  What are we to do? Well I suggest rejecting the parish system if it doesn't work for you. Search out a Church where the liturgy is well prepared not well-explained. They exist in every city. This is not BTW a matter of particular style: the music might be old or new. It is the attitude of the church that counts. Also, note that a conservative liturgy - harking back to pre-Vatican II days, does not necessarily mean the Church will be socially conservative.  In NYC I can recommend:  Corpus Christi - W 12st St.  Corpus Christi - W 12st St. - very conservative liturgy,   St. Joseph's, Greenwich Village.  - Modern, \\\"clean\\\", largely gay  Oratorian Church, Brooklyn - Very beautiful  Avoid, anywhere, anytime a church with electric candles.

 The problem if  transffering US government files about Yigal Arens and some other similar persons does or does not violate a federal or a local American law seemed to belong to some local american

The readers of this forum seemed to be more interested in the contents of those files. So It will be nice if Yigal will tell us: 1. Why do American authorities consider Yigal Arens to be dangerous? 2. Why does the ADL have an interest in that person ? 3. If one does trust either the US government or the ADL what an    additional information should he send them ? \",\"  One of the things I find intersting about pagan beliefs is their belief in a feminine deity as well as a masculine deity. Being brought up in a Christian household, I often wondered if there was God the Father, where was the mother? Everyone I know who has a father usually as a mother. It just seemed rather unbalanced to me.   Fortunately, my own personal theology, which will probably not fall into line with a lot others, recognized God as a being both without gender and posessing qualities of both genders, as being both a masculine and feminine force. It provides a sense of balance I find sorely lacking in most theologies, a lack which I think is responsible for a lot of the unbalanced ways in which we see the world and treat each other.\",\"I have a 386/33 with 8 megs of memory  I have noticed that lately when I use programs like WpfW or Corel Draw my computer \\\"boggs\\\" down and becomes really sluggish!

To the person asking about nicotine patches, there are four on the market:\",\"Here is some material by Michael Davies on the subject of schism in general and Archishop Lefebvre in particular.  He wrote it around 1990.  The first part of the two-part article was on the scandalous activities of Archbishop Weakland (in this country), but I cut all that.  And I pared down the rest to what was relevant.  Joe Buehler  ...  Schism and Disobedience  According to St. Thomas Aquinas, schism consists primarily in a refusal of submission to the Pope or communion with the members of the Church united to him. On first sight it would appear that, whatever the subjective motivation of the Archbishop, as discussed above, he must be in a state of objective schism as he has refused to submit to the Pope on a very grave matter involving his supreme power of jurisdiction. However, standard Catholic textbooks of theology make it clear that while all schisms involve disobedience not all acts of disobedience are schismatic. If this were so, as was noted at the beginning of this article, it would mean that the number of American bishops who are not schismatic would not reach double figures.  The distinction between disobedience and schism is made very clear in the article on schism in the very authoritative Dictionnaire de Theologie Catholique. The article is by Father Yves Congar who is certainly no friend of Archbishop Lefebvre.  He explains that schism and disobedience are so similar that they are often confused. Father Congar writes that schism involves a refusal to accept the existence of legitimate authority in the Church, for example, Luther's rejection of the papacy. Father Congar explains that the refusal to accept a decision of legitimate authority in a particular instance does not constitute schism but disobedience.  The Catholic Encyclopedia explains that for a Catholic to be truly schismatic he would have to intend \\\"to sever himself from the Church as far as in him lies.\\\"  It adds that \\\"not every disobedience is schism; in order to possess this character it must include besides the transgression of the command of the superiors, a denial of their divine right to command.\\\"Not only does Mgr. Lefebvre not deny the divine right of the Pope to command, but he affirms repeatedly his recognition of the Pope's authority and his intention of never breaking away from Rome. The Archbishop made his attitude clear in the July/August 1989 issue of 30 Days: \\\"We pray for the Pope every day. Nothing has changed with the consecrations last June 30. We are not sedevacantists. We recognize in John Paul II the legitimate Pope of the Catholic Church. We don't even say that he is a heretical Pope. We only say that his Modernist actions favor heresy.\\\"  ...  Intrinsically Schismatic?  The principal argument used by those claiming that Mgr. Lefebvre is in schism is that the consecration of a bishop without a papal mandate is an intrinsically schismatic act. A bishop who carries out such a consecration, it is claimed, becomes ipso facto a schismatic. This is not true. If such a consecration is an intrinsically schismatic act it would always have involved the penalty of excommunication. In the 1917 Code of Canon Law the offence was punished only by suspension (see Canon 2370 of the 1917 Code). Pope Pius XII had raised the penalty to excommunication as a response to the establishment of a schismatic church in China. The consecration of these illicit Chinese bishops differed radically from the consecrations carried out by Mgr. Lefebvre as the professed intention was to repudiate the authority of the Pope, that is, to deny that he has the right to govern the Church, and the illicitly consecrated Chinese bishops were given a mandate to exercise an apostolic mission. Neither Archbishop Lefebvre nor any of the bishops he has consecrated claim that they have powers of jurisdiction. They have been consecrated solely for the purpose of ensuring the survival of the Society by carrying out ordinations and also to perform confirmations. I do not wish to minimize in any way the gravity of the step take by Mgr. Lefebvre. The consecration of bishops without a papal mandate is far more serious matter than the ordination of priests as it involves a refusal in practice of the primacy or jurisdiction belonging by divine right to the Roman Pontiff. But the Archbishop could argue that the crisis afflicting the Church could not be more grave, and that grave measures were needed in response.  It appears to be taken for granted by most of the Archbishop's critics that he was excommunicated for the offense of schism, and the Vatican has certainly been guilty of fostering this impression.  There is not so much as a modicum of truth in this allegation. The New Code of Canon Law includes a section beginning with Canon 1364 entitled \\\"Penalties for Specific Offenses\\\" (De Poenis in Singula Dicta). The first part deals with \\\"Offenses against Religion and the Unity of the Church\\\" (De Delictis contra Religionem et Ecclesiae Unitatem). Canon 1364 deals with the offense of schism which is, evidently, together with apostasy and heresy, one of the three fundamental offenses against the unity of the Church.  But the Archbishop was not excommunicated under the terms of this canon or, indeed, under any canon involving an offense against religion or the unity of the church. The canon cited in his excommunication comes from the third section of \\\"Penalties for Specific Offenses\\\" which is entitled \\\"Usurpation of Ecclesial Functions and Offenses in their Exercise\\\" (De Munerum Ecclesiasticorum Usurpatione Degue Delictis iniis Exercendis). The canon in question is Canon 1382, which reads: \\\"A bishop who consecrates someone bishop and the person who receives such a consecration from a bishop without a pontifical mandate incur an automatic (latae sententiae) excommunication reserved to the Holy See.\\\"  The scandalous attempts to smear Archbishop Lefebvre with the offense of schism are, then, contrary to both truth and charity. A comparable smear under civil as opposed to ecclesiastical law would certainly justify legal action for libel involving massive damages. An accurate parallel would be to state that a man convicted of manslaughter had been convicted of first degree murder.  I must stress that what I have written here is not the dubious opinion of laymen unversed in the intricacies of Canon Law. Canon lawyers without the least shred of sympathy for Mgr. Lefebvre have repudiated the charge of schism made against him as totally untenable. Father Patrick Yaldrini, Dean of the Faculty of Canon Law of the Institut Catholique in Paris noted in the 4 July 1988 issue of Valeurs actuelles that, as I have just explained, Mgr.  Lefebvre was not excommunicated for schism but for the usurpation of an ecclesiastical function. He added that it is not the consecration of a bishop which constitutes schism but the conferral of an apostolic mission upon the illicitly consecrated bishop. It is this usurpation of the powers of the sovereign pontiff which proves the intention of establishing a parallel Church.  Cardinal Rosalio Lara, President of the Pontifical Commission for the Authentic Interpretation of Canon Law, commented on the consecrations in the 10 July 1988 issue of la Repubblica. It would be hard to      The act of consecrating a bishop (without a papal mandate) is not     in itself a schismatic act. In fact, the Code that deals with     offenses is divided into two sections. One deals with offenses     against religion and the unity of the Church, and these are     apostasy, schism, and heresy. Consecrating a bishop with a     pontifical mandate is, on the contrary, an offense against the     exercise of a specific ministry. For example, in the case of the     consecrations carried out by the Vietnamese Archbishop Ngo Dinh     Thuc in 1976 and 1983, although the Archbishop was excommunicated     he was not considered to have committed a schismatic act because     there was no intention of a breach with the Church.  ....  It is not simply unjust but ludicrous to suggest that in consecrating bishops without a papal mandate Archbishop Lefebvre had the least intent of establishing a schismatic church. He is not a schismatic and will never be a schismatic. The Archbishop considers correctly that the the Church is undergoing its worst crisis since the Arian heresy, and that for the good of the Church it was necessary for him to consecrate the four bishops to ensure the future of his Society. Canon Law provides for just such a situation, and even if one believes that the future of the Society could have been guaranteed without these consecrations, the fact that the Archbishop believed sincerely that it could not means, as Canon Law states clearly, that he has not incurred excommunication. Furthermore, while the Vatican allows such prelates as Archbishop Weakland to undermine the Faith with impunity it cannot expect Catholics to pay the least attention to its sanctions against a great and orthodox Archbishop whose entire life has been devoted to the service of the Church and the salvation of souls.  Dr. Eric M. de Saventhem, President of the International Una Voce Association, is one of the best informed laymen in the Church, and he knows the Archbishop intimately. Dr. de Saventhem, like myself, has no greater desire than to see a reconciliation between Mgr. Lefebvre and the Holy See during the Archbishop's lifetime. A quotation from a statement by Dr. de Saventhem which was published in the 15 February 1989 Remnant merits careful study:\",\" Get Norton Desktop.

In general though when someone refers to a Tesla coil, they mean an \\\"air core resonant transformer\\\". The TV flyback version Tesla coil (see the _Encyclopedia_of_Electronic_Circuits_ V3, 106-1 for diagram) has NOT an air core. It is of a class of circuit called \\\"Oscillating Shuttle Circuit\\\" (OSC). Generally OSC's are highly efficient, but this version uses transistors and resistors, which are very lossy devices. Typically Tesla used active reactances instead of passive resistors, so that he could achieve efficiencies of 99.5%, and better. The usual application of an air-core resonant transformer, or of an OSC, is to produce strong EMI for wireless broadcasts. How well do you think your computer screen would work if we removed the HF HV Tesla (flyback) coil from it? If we were to remove from our homes and industries all Tesla coils, our lights would go dark, our cars would sputter and die, our radios would go silent, our industries would grind to a halt, and we would have to go back to using coal for heat, gas for lamps, horses for transportation, steam for power, and telegraph for communication.

But.....  - The manual for the Resource Workshop seems to be from a different version    from the Workshop itself. Some of the windows that appear on the manual   have more itens than in the manual. - I think I will run into trouble since I got this TC++/VE from my brother   as a present. I didnt wanted to buy the Japanese version because 1) I    suspect that the manuals will be in Japanese :-( and 2) I believe it   will be far more expensive here. So he bought it as a present and sent to   me, I send the registration card to the Japanese branch of Borland, but...   who knows.  So, I'd like to ask some questions for you all;  - I know that there are some Microsoft guys around here in this group. Is   there anybody from Borland ? Is there any e-mail address that we can    contact the technical support ? Not for stupid questions, but to ask   for example, why the RW manual seems to be different from the RW itself ? - Is there anybody else using it around here ? - Will the book of Petzold be useful for me ? I intend to use RW and ProtoGen   to make the interfaces and then work on the code itself.   Answers to my e-mail or comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.tools, please.

According to Luke 3:23     And when he began his ministry, Jesus himself was about     thirty years of age, being supposedly the son of Joseph,    the son of Eli,  Aside from the fact that Mary is not mentioned, there are two possible interpretations: either Joseph was her father or he was her brother. Clearly this is not acceptable.  A third would be that Joseph, the son of Eli, was her Father and just happened to have the name as the man to whom she was betrothed. But that would seem to be grasping at straws. The most straightforward interpretation is that Luke had no intention of tracing Mary's genealogy (in which case he would have named her) but that he traces her husband's, from David's son Nathan.  The Matthew descendant list most definitely traces down from David's son, Solomon, to Joseph.  Matthew 1:16 reads:     And to Jacob was born Joseph, the husband of Mary, by whom was born    Jesus, who is called Christ.   There are two apparent problems.  The first is, how to reconcile the two paternal genealogies - which diverge with the sons of David, Solomon and Nathan.  The second is, why is any genealogy of Joseph relavent at all, if Joseph had nothing to do with it.  If Joseph was not Jesus's physical father, then the original poster is quite correct, that claims for Jesus's messianic heritage are not based on truth but only on appearances, whatever Jesus's divine nature was.  The second problem is easy, in my mind.  We assume that Joseph was not involved in the conception of Jesus in any way.  However, a Holy Spirit capable of working a physical conception in Mary is also capable of employing the physical agency of Joseph's seed in this work.  In our materialistic times we interpret viginity and its loss solely in terms of a physical act, whereas it is really a matter of purity on a much higher level as well.  The important thing is that neither Mary nor Joseph was conscious of any union between them (they had not \\\"known\\\"each other).  Thus the first gospel's dedication of half its opening chapter to the genealogy of Joseph is quite relevant to Jesus, the Virgin birth not- withstanding.  To the first question there is an answer that creates, to begin with, more problems than it resolves.  It is that the two evangelists are relating  the births of two entirely different children of two entirely different sets of parents.  Except for the names of the parents and the child, and  the birthplace in Bethlehem there is no point in common between the two  stories.  Matthew and Luke converge in their accounts only thirty years later with the Baptism of Jesus in Jordan.  Rudolf Steiner offered his explanation of how these accounts begin with two children and then converge with their accounts of the one Jesus of Nazareth.  He did not derive his resolution from biblical study or speculation, or from other external documents, and the discussion of \\\"how this could be\\\" might bring us beyond the limits of appropriateness for this newsgroup.  In any case, the details are described in Steiner's \\\"The Spiritual Guidance of the Human  Being and of Humanity\\\", \\\"The Gospel of St. Luke\\\", and \\\"The Gospel of St. Matthew\\\".   Whether or not Rudolf Steiner's methods and explanation are accepted as valid, at least this interpretation resolves the apparent contradictions of the two genealogies while leaving the text intact.  As for the passing of one's Jewishness through the mother, this was never an issue with Jesus. No one ever questioned his or Mary's Jewishness.  The issue of the genealogies has to do with his paternal line of descent from David, the king.\",\"   but what is Saturn's motivation here?  they're already selling every car they make, with multiple shifts in the plant.  given this, what possible motivation could they have to lower prices?  cheers,   richard\",\"I have a wonderful Commodore 128 for sale!!!!

The Amiga Zorro II bus is comparable with the ISA bus (7.16 vs 8.33 MHZ). The Amiga has had a pre-emptative multi-tasking  OS since '85 and can operate with 1 MB RAM!  SCSI is used almost exclusively on these systems.  A SCSI controller that transfers data by DMA allows the cpu to request data from the hard drive and continue working while the controller gets the data and moves it to memory.  A controller that allows reselection can operate even better with multiple devices.  This is espically true with SCSI tape units.  For example, when rewinding or formatting a tape, the command is issued to the controller and the bus is released to allow access to other devices on the bus.  This greatly increases productivity or, at least, do something else while backing up your hard drive :-).  Which happens to be what I am doing while reading this group.  Its a long story, but I still use IDE on my 486 except for the CDROM which, thanks to SCSI, I can move between both machines.  If, and when, SCSI is better standardized and supported on the ibm-clone machines, I plan to completely get rid of IDE. --   Wayne Summer        //        AMIGA - Simply the Best.   Palm Bay, FL.

The name of the company is Secure Communicatiions Technology (Information will be given at the end of this message on how to contact them).     Basically they are disturbed about the announcement for many reasons that we are. More specifically however, Mr. Bryen of Secure Communications brought to light many points that might interest most of the readers.     His belief is that AT&T was made known of the clipper well before the rest of the industry. This is for several reasons, several of which are:   - A company of AT&T's size could never be able to make a decision to use    the new chip on the SAME DAY it was announced.   - Months ago they proposed using their own chip for AT&T's secure telephone    devices. AT&T basically blew them off as being not interested at all.    This stuck them as strange, until now...      Also I spoke with Art Melnick, their cryptographer, he expressed several concerns over the new Clipper Chip:    - The obvious backdoor will be able to let many people decrypt the code.    - Once the key is released to authorities the security of the crypto     system is lost forever. These keys can end up in the hands of any agency     of the government.    - The fact that the escrowed keys never change means that the algorithm     is vulnerable over time to an attacker.    - The classified algorithm may hide another backdoor. But he feels that     it is probably to keep people from forging fake serial numbers, or     changing the keys themselves.    - Additionally he feels that the NSA has probably spent enough time and     money in working on a way to keep this chip from being reversed     engineered, that he feels that reverse engineering it will be very     difficult to do. He feels that they have developed a suitable technique     to protect the chip from this attack. Also he feels that the chip is     hardware encoded with the algorithm and not microcoded onto the chip.  Additonally I spoke with Mr. Melnick about their algorithm. He couldn't tell me much about their new agorithm because it hasn't been patented yet. However he told me a little:   - The algorithm will be released for public review after patents have been    granted for it. This is so the crypto community can see that it is    secure.   - The algorithm is called NEA for New Encryption Algorithm.    The details were sketchy because now it is held as a trade secret    until the patent was issued, but I was told that it will incorporate    the following:      - It will have fast encryption of data (Exact specs not given, but       Mr. Melnick stated \\\"Much faster than what an RS-232 can put out.\\\")      - It is a symmetric cipher, just like IDEA and DES.      - It will use 64 bit data blocks for encryption (like DES and IDEA).      - The key length was not given to me, but Mr. Melnick states that       it is _adujustable_ and is \\\"More than adequate for security.\\\"      - The algorithm is written in C and Assembler in software form, and       can be ported to many platforms (Unlike the the Clipper Chip which       is hardware ONLY and cannot be made into software) This I       consider a definite plus for the NEA for widespread use.      - The algorithm will accomodate public key distribution techniques       such as RSA or Diffie-Hellman. This will also be supported in the       hardware chip.      - Right now the projected cost of the NEA chip will be about 10 dollars       for each!! (Clipper will run 25 each chip [that is if it is produced       enough, which probably won't happen]).      - They currently sell a program called C-COM that uses the algorithm       and a special streaming protocol that does not divide the encrypted       data into \\\"blocks.\\\" This could prevent plaintext attacks if you know       what the block header is. This program operates at all supported       RS-232 speeds and uses the software implementation of the algorithm.      - Most importantly: IT DOES NOT HAVE A BACKDOOR!!    Right now the company is afraid that the new clipper chip will put them out of business. This is a very real possibility. So they really need help in stopping the clipper chip from becoming a standard. If you want to contact them, they can be reached at..

Basic Scenario:   I set up a bbs that uses public-key encryption and encryption of  files on disk.  The general setup is designed so that when users   connect they send a private key encrypted using the system public  key and the user's public-private keypair is used to wrap the  one-time session keys used for encrypting the files on disk.  The  result of this is that even if I reveal the system private key it  is impossible for anyone to gain access to the files stored on the  machine.  What is possible is for someone to use the revealed  system private key to entice users into revealing thier personal  private keys during the authentication sequence.  Questions:   Does the fact that the system private key does not provide any  information useful for a search give me any protection as far as  being coerced to reveal the key?  (I doubt it myself..)   It seems providing the system private key does not mean that I am  assisting in \\\"entrapment\\\" (the users would send thier key anyway  and are not being enticed into doing something they would not  otherwise do) but is there any other hook that can be used?   Would the user private-key enticement require wiretap approval?

Zionism agrees with the basic tenet of anti-Semitism, namely that Jews cannot live with non- Jews.  The history and roots of the Holocaust go back a long way. While the industru of death and destruction did not operate before 1942, its roots were firmly placed in the 19th Century. Jewish aspirations for emancipation emerged out of the national struggles in Europe. When the hopes for liberation through bourgeois-democratic change were dashed, other alternatives for improving the lot of the Jews of Europe achieved prominence.  The socialist Bund, a mass movement with enormous following, had to contend with opposition from a new and small, almost insignificant opponent, the political Zionists.  In outline these two offered diametrically opposed options for Jews in Europe. While the Bund was suggesting joining forces with the rest of Europe's workers, the Zionists were proposing a new programme aimed at ridding Europe of its Jews by setting up some form of a Jewish state.  Historically, nothing is inevitable, all depends on the balance of forces involved in the struggle. History can be seen as an option tree: every time a certain option is chosen, other routes become barred. Because of that choice, movement backwards to the point before that choice was made is impossible. While Zionism as an option was taken by many young Jews, it remained a minority position until the first days of the 3rd Reich. The Zionist Federation of Germany (ZVfD), an organisation representing a tiny minority of German Jews, was selected by the Nazis as the body to represent the Jews of the Reich. Its was the only flag of an interantional organisation allowed to fly in Berlin, and this was the only international organisation allowed to operate during this period. From a marginal position, the leaders of the Zionist Federation were propelled to a prominence and centrality that surprised even them. All of a sudden they attained political power, power based not on representation, but from being selected as the choice of the Nazi regime for dealing with the the 'Jewish problem'. Their position in negotiating with the Nazis agreements that affected the lives of many tens of thousands of the Jews in Germany transformed them from a utopian, marginal organisation in Germany (and some other countries in Europe) into a real option to be considered by German Jews.  The best example of this was the 'Transfer Agreement' of 1934. Immediately after the Nazi takeover in 1933, Jews all over the world supported or were organising a world wide boycott of German goods. This campaign hurt the Nazi regime and the German authorities searched frantically for a way disabling the boycott. It was clear that if Jews and Jewish organisations were to pull out, the campaign would collapse.  This problem was solved by the ZVfD. A letter sent to the Nazi party as early as 21.  June 1933, outlined the degree of agreement that existed between the two organisations on the question of race, nation, and the nature of the 'Jewish problem', and it offered to collaborate with the new regime:  \\\"The realisation of Zionism could only be hurt by resentment of Jews abroad against the German development. Boycott propaganda - such as is currently being carried out against Germany in many ways - is in essence unZionist, because Zionism wants not to do battle but to convince and build.\\\"  In their eagerness to gain credence and the backing of the new regime, the Zionist organisation managed to undermine the boycott. The main public act was the signature of the \\\"Transfer Agreement\\\" with the Nazi authorities during the Zionist Congress of 1934. In essence, the agreement was designed to get Germany's Jews out of the country and into Mandate Palestine. It provided a possibility for Jews to take a sizeable part of their property out of the country, through a transfer of German goods to Palestine. This right was denied to Jews leaving to any other destination. The Zionist organisation was the acting agent, through its financial organisations. This agreement operated on a number of fronts - 'helping' Jews to leave the country, breaking the ring of the boycott, exporting German goods in large quantities to Palestine, and last but not least, enabling the regime to be seen as humane and reasonable even towards its avowed enemies, the Jews. After all, they argued, the Jews do not belong in Europe and now the Jews come and agree with them.  After news of the agreement broke, the boycott was doomed. If the Zionist Organization found it possible and necessary to deal with the Nazis, and import their goods, who could argue for a boycott ? This was not the first time that the interests of both movements were presented to the German public as complementary. Baron Von Mildenstein, the first head of the Jewish Department of the SS, later followed by Eichmann, was invited to travel to Palestine. This he did in early 1933, in the company of a Zionist leader, Kurt Tuchler. Having spent six months in Palestine, he wrote a series of favourable articles in Der STURMER describing the 'new Jew' of Zionism, a Jew Nazis could accept and understand.  This little-known episode established quite clearly the relationship during the early days of Nazism, between the new regime and the ZVfD, a relationship that was echoed later in a number of key instances, even after the nature of the Final Solution became clear. In many cases this meant a silencing of reports about the horrors of the exterminations. A book concentrating on this aspect of the Zionist reaction to the Holocaust is Post-Ugandan Zionism in the Crucible of the Holocaust, by S. B. Beth-Zvi.  In the case of the Kastner episode, around which Jim Allen's play PERDITION is based, even the normal excuse of lack of knowledge of the real nature of events does not exist. It occured near the end of the war. The USSR had advanced almost up to Germany. Italy and the African bases had been lost. The Nazis were on the run, with a number of key countries, such as Rumania, leaving the Axis. A second front was a matter of months away, as the western Allies prepared their forces. In the midst of all this we find Eichmann, the master bureaucrat of industrial murder, setting up his HZ in occupied Budapest, after the German takeover of the country in April 1944. His first act was to have a conference with the Jewish leadership, and to appoint Zionist Federation members, headed by Kastner as the agent and clearing house for all Jews and their relationship with the SS and the Nazr authorities. Why they did this is not difficult to see. As opposed to Poland, where its three and  a half million Jews lived in ghettoes and were visibly different from the rest of the Polish population, the Hungarian Jews were an integrated part of the community. The middle class was mainly Jewish, the Jews were mainly middle-class. They enjoyed freedom of travel, served in the Hungarian (fascist) army in fronline units, as officers and soldiers, their names were Hungarian - how was Eichmann to find them if they were to be exterminated ? The task was not easy, there were a million Jews in Hungary, most of them resident, the rest being refugees from other countries. Many had  heard about the fate of Jews elsewhere, and were unlikely to believe any statements by Nazi officials.  Like elsewhere, the only people who had the information and the ear of the frightened Jewish population were the Judenrat. In this case the Judenrat comprsied mainly the Zionist Federation members. Without their help the SS, with 19 officers and less than 90 men, plus a few hundred Hungarian police, could not have collected and controlled a million Jews, when they did not even know their whereabouts. Kastner and the others were left under no illusions. Eichmann told Joel Brand, one of the members of Kastner's committee, that he intended to send all Hungary's Jews to Auschwitz, before he even started the expulsions!  He told them clearly that all these Jews will die, 12,000 a day, unless certain conditions were met.  The Committee faced a simple choice - to tell the Jews of Hungary about their fate, (with neutral Rumania, where many could escape, being in most cases a few hours away) or to collaborate with the Nazis by assisting in the concentration process. What would not have been believed when coming from the SS, sounded quite plausible when coming from the mouths of the Zionist leadership. Thus it is, that most of the Hungarian Jews went quietly to their death, assured by their leadership that they were to be sent to work camps.  To be sure, there are thirty pieces of silver in this narrative of destruction: the trains of 'prominents' which Eichmann promised to Kastner - a promise he kept to the last detail. For Eichmann it was a bargain: allowing 1,680 Jews to survive, as the price paid for the silent collaboration over the death of almost a million Jews.  There was no way in which the Jews of Hungary could even be located, not to say murdered, without the full collaboration of Kastner and his few friends. No doubt the SS would hunt a few Jews here and there, but the scale of the operation would have been miniscule compared to the half million who died in Auschwitz.  It is important to realise that Kastner was not an aberration, like say Rumkovsky in Lodz. Kastner acted as a result of his strongly held Zionist convictions. His actions were a logical outcome of earlier positions. This is instanced when he exposed to the Gestapo the existence of a British cell of saboteurs, Palgi and Senesh, and persuaded them to give themselves up, so as not to disrupt his operations. At no point during his trial or elsewhere, did Kastner deny that he knew exactly what was to happen to those Jews.\",\"has                                                        ^^^^^^^^ Oops, I meant fair, not unfair. \",\"   What, pray tell, does this mean?

If we  unthinkingly adopt pantheistic ideas that are opposed to Christianity,  we can pervert our faith.  When we clearly recognize pantheism when we  encounter it we have the opportunity to embrace what is consistent with  Christianity and reject what isn't.      We need to be alert, always thinking and questioning.  We must examine  the underlying assumptions of every book we read, tv program we watch  and socio-political movement we participate in.  Ideas are important.   Philosophies and doctrines are what give form to the events of our  lives.  They are the basis from which we live our lives of love and  service.  The command to love God with all one's mind means no fuzzy- headed drifting from idea to idea.    One Christian who acknowledges this is the Pope.  It is a frequent theme  in his writings.  Indeed, thoughtful Christians from most traditions  recognize that consumerism has no place in the lives of Christians.  It  too is a perversion and dangerous to our faith.

As per request of Hasan:  From _The Revolt_, by Menachem Begin, Dell Publishing, NY, 1977:  [pp. 225-227]      \\\"Apart from the military aspect, there is a moral aspect to the story of Dir Yassin. At that village, whose name was publicized throughout the world, both sides suffered heavy casualties. We had four killed and nearly forty wounded. The number of casualties was nearly forty percent of the total number of the attackers. The Arab troops suffered casualties neraly three times as heavy. The fighting was thus very severe. Yet the hostile propaganda, disseminated throughout the world, deliberately ignored the fact that the civilian population of Dir Yassin was actually given a warning by us before the battle began. One of our tenders carrying a loud speaker was stationed at the entrance to the village and it exhorted in Arabic all women, children and aged to leave their houses and to take shelter on the slopes of the hill.  By giving this humane warning our fighters threw away the element of complete surprise, and thus increased their own risk in the ensuing battle. A substantial number of the inhabitants obeyed the warning and they were unhurt. A few did not leave their stone houses - perhaps because of the confusion. The fire of the enemy was murderous - to which the number of our casualties bears eloquent testimony. Our men were compelled to fight for every house; to overcome the enemy they used large numbers of hand grenades. And the civilians who had disregarded our warnings suffered inevitable casualties.      \\\"The education which we gave our soldiers throughout the years of revolt was based on the observance of the traditional laws of war. We never broke them unless the enemy first did so and thus forced us, in accordance with the accepted custom of war, to apply reprisals. I am convinced, too, that our officers and men wished to avoid a single unnecessary casualty in the Dir Yassin battle. But those who throw stones of denunciation at the conquerors of Dir Yassin [1] would do well not to don the cloak of hypocrisy [2].      \\\"In connection with the capture of Dir Yassin the Jewish Agency found it necessary to send a letter of apology to Abdullah, whom Mr. Ben Gurion, at a moment of great political emotion, called 'the wise ruler who seeks the good of his people and this country.' The 'wise ruler,' whose mercenary forces demolished Gush Etzion and flung the bodies of its heroic defenders to birds of prey, replied with feudal superciliousness. He rejected the apology and replied that the Jews were all to blame and that he did not believe in the existence of 'dissidents.' Throughout the Arab world and the world at large a wave of lying propaganda was let loose about 'Jewish attrocities.'      \\\"The enemy propaganda was designed to besmirch our name. In the result it helped us. Panic overwhelmed the Arabs of Eretz Israel. Kolonia village, which had previously repulsed every attack of the Haganah, was evacuated overnight and fell without further fighting. Beit-Iksa was also evacuated. These two places overlooked the main road; and their fall, together with the capture of Kastel by the Haganah, made it possible to keep open the road to Jerusalem. In the rest of the country, too, the Arabs began to flee in terror, even before they clashed with Jewish forces. Not what happened at Dir Yassin, but what was invented about Dir Yassin, helped to carve the way to our decisive victories on the battlefield. The legend of Dir Yassin helped us in particular in the saving of Tiberias and the conquest of Haifa.\\\"   [1] (A footnote from _The Revolt_, pp.226-7.) \\\"To counteract the loss of Dir yassin, a village of strategic importance, Arab headquarters at Ramallah broadcast a crude atrocity story, alleging a massacre by Irgun troops of women and children in the village. Certain Jewish officials, fearing the Irgun men as political rivals, seized upon this Arab gruel propaganda to smear the Irgun. An eminent Rabbi was induced to reprimand the Irgun before he had time to sift the truth. Out of evil, however, good came. This Arab propaganda spread a legend of terror amongst Arabs and Arab troops, who were seized with panic at the mention of Irgun soldiers. The legend was worth half a dozen battalions to the forces of Israel. The `Dir Yassin Massacre' lie is still propagated by Jew-haters all over the world.\\\"\",\" No.  Patrick Roy is the reason the game was lost, and Ron Hextall is the reason Quebec won.  Everybody said it would come down to goaltending, that goaltending was the key, etc etc.  Well, the key doesn't quite fit if you're Montreal.  The Dionne penalty was kind of a cheesy call, but let's face it; he literally left his feet to throw an elbow.  Blaming Stewart is just an excuse to avoid facing the fact that Roy allowed what was one of the worst goals he could possibly allow.  He even saw the whole shot, dammit.  Besides, Stewart evened things up a bit by calling a Quebec penalty in OT.  Montreal played a solid game (although they still don't know how to clear traffic in front of the net; the loss of Schneider will hurt even more).  Normally I would say that any team that blows a 2-goal lead with less than  five, let alone two, minutes to go in regulation time IN A PLAYOFF GAME  ESPECIALLY needs to be smacked upside their collective heads.  But I don't think this was a team loss (although Keane should have been able to clear  the zone just prior to the first Quebec goal).  Roy is paid big money to  play.  He looked like a player in an industrial league on Sakic's shot.  Demers should start Racicot in the next game.  If not that, he should let the damn team read the papers for the next day or two....and maybe this article, if possible.   I didn't think the wrap-around was as bad as the second goal.  I also didn't think Scott Young should have gotten around the defender (can't remember who) in the first place.  But you are correct, it shouldn't have gone in regardless.   Yep.  Moog looked bad on Mogilny's goal with five seconds left in the second, IMO.  How about Neely though?   Holy shit, what a player.  Speaking of great players, man-oh-man can Quebec skate.  I haven't seen a team so potent on the rush in a long time.  Watching them break out of their zone, especially Sundin, is a treat to watch.  They remind me of the Red  Army.    But I still hate the team.  On the rest of the games:  Didn't St. Louis' winning goal come on a powerplay?  Penalties will cost Chicago dearly, especially against Detroit.

The cities in question are at 7000 to 9000 feet of altitude.  One of them especially is very polluted...  Often I feel faint the first two or three days.  I feel lightheaded, and my heart seems to pound a lot more than at sea-level.  Also, it is very dry in these cities, so I will tend to drink a lot of water, and keep away from dehydrating drinks, such as those containing caffeine or alcohol.  Thing is, I still have symptoms.  How can I ensure that my short trips there (no, I don't usually have a week to acclimatize) are as comfortable as possible? Is there something else that I could do?  A long time ago (possibly two years ago) there was a discussion here about altitude adjustment.  Has anyone saved the messages?  Many thanks,\",\"The article that follows was taken from the Wednesday, April 14, 1993 issue of USA Today (\\\"Drug Use Up Among U.S. eighth-graders\\\" by Mike Snider, p. 6D).      A new national survey says drugs are easier to get, more teens are     using them and fewer deem drug use as risky.       For the last two years, government officials have trumpeted results     from the National High School Survey as signs that the drug war is     being won.  But this year, officials are retreating - drug use by     eighth-graders has risen, according to the survey of 50,000 students     nationwide.      Possible reason for the increase:  more experimentation.  Why?  If     drug use dropped during the '80s, eventually some students will     have fewer \\\"drug-using contemporaries\\\" who act as examples of     substance abuse's drawbacks, says social psychologist Lloyd Johnston,     one of the survey authors.  Each new wave of youths \\\"must be given     the knowledge, skills and motivation to resist using these drugs,\\\"     Johnston says.      This type of resurgence \\\"is possible,\\\" says Eileen Shiff, author of     \\\"Experts Advise Parents\\\" (Delta, $14.95).  But that's not the issue,     she says.  The prevalence of alcohol and drugs among teens today     could result in more alcoholic adults decades from now.      Aggravating the problem:  baby boomer parents - who experimented with     drugs and alcohol as teens - trying to be friends, not parents, to     their children.  \\\"I've even seen parents serving kegs of beer\\\" to     their underage kids and friends, Shiff says.  For a recent graduation,     Shiff and other parents organized an all-night, \\\"lock-in\\\" party where     no booze or drugs were allowed.  \\\"We need to fulfill that parental     role, otherwise the peer group takes over,\\\" she says.      Officials may \\\"talk about the war on drugs, but they really haven't     done anything that I've seen,\\\" says Suzanne Linkous, Scottsdale,     Ariz., 16, a volunteer who talks with teens about drugs, dating and     other issues on a peer counseling and suicide hot line.  Linkous, a     member of USA Today's Teen Panel, says \\\"there's always going to be     experimentation\\\" with drugs.      A real war on drugs could be waged \\\"education-wise,\\\" she says.  But     \\\"some don't want to give kids the facts.  They think it will give     them ideas; it's the same with birth control.  I think you should     give the kids the information or have it accessible\\\" through classes,     pamphlets and speakers, she says.      Education efforts need to start as soon as kids get in school - in     kindergarten, says Dallas Owens, 17, teen panelist from Miami Shores,     Fla.  \\\"I remember in kindergarten, I used to see (drugs).  I think     kids in the 10th and 12th grades have already made up their minds     (about using drugs),\\\" he says.      Scare tactics in public service announcements aren't working; only     one commercial has gotten it right, he says.  The commercial opens     with two \\\"good-looking girls\\\" in the restroom talking about having     no prom date.  Then they take a hit off a joint.  \\\"That hits home     because it's not attractive,\\\" he says.  \\\"You can't be doing drugs if     you want somebody to like you.\\\"       Adolescents' choices      Drugs used by eighth graders in the last month:                       Estimated, per 100 students                              1991     1992   Pct. chg.

Let's talk practicality, shall we?  If the Monarch tried to do something, what would happen?            But you illustrated the problem very well.          I am contending that there is no state in the Union which does not have ample wealth, if they choose to spend it, to run a perfectly acceptable Education system.  (I further contend that the amount of money being spent now is more then sufficient, but is being spent badly.)          So, tell me Phill.  Were the Republicans also responsible for some of the *huge* increases in social programs?  Or were they *only*  responsible for what you don't like.  (I contend it is Congress which is to blame.  Democrat and Republican alike.)          Most of our worst areas are still better off than most of Europe. In any case, we're talking about *education*.            Yes, I live in once such area.  You're woefully ignorant of the situation.         At the same time some of Tennessee's school districts are closing down, the Governor asked for 7.5 million dollars for bicentenntial celebration license plats.  In almost the same breath he wanted to raise unemployment compensation and reduce taxes which paid into it.          I don't know about the rest of the country, but *our* education problems stem directly from two problems, neither of which are a lack of money in the state.  (BTW, Tennessee is considered a \\\"tax heaven\\\" and our economy is one of the strongest in the country.  *I* see a correlation.)  1)  What money we spend goes primarly to administration. The average administrator makes two and a half times what the average teacher makes, and sucks up an enormous amount of revenue.  And 2) the Governor is making a concerted effort to create an \\\"Education crisis\\\" in order to push for his pet income tax.  Some of the most idiotic programs get funded (like State funds for new art in the county seat) while schools are closing.  It's not a lack of funds.  It's an unwillingness to spend them on what is more appropriate.  Education is *the* parental hot-button.  Education is *always* the first to but cut, because it's easier to get people to pay for their children than ugly art.         It spoke very eloquently on government being based on the consent of the governed.           They did it anyway.  The Continental Congress had its own set of bylaws.  It wasn't quite a government, but a means of making decisions had to be created.  (However low George Washington's opinion of them were.)         Allow me again to speak heresy against the Holy Democratic Orders. So what?  The government was built with a very non-democratic Presidency with fairly broad powers, including the veto.         Yes, and the Senate was intended to act as a balance to this. Too much democracy was intentionally avoided.  It was considered a good thing to place non-democratic blocks to impulsive action.         So long as Congress has something to sell, people will pay for it.  Most congressmen rake in more money than they need.          No, if the \\\"progressives\\\" don't want the \\\"reactionaries\\\" to move backward, they get the same benefit.  41% of the states is a *lot* of people.  And historically laws with that sort of minority arent' very effective, especially since it is usually geographically concentrated.        When wielding the Federal Big Stick I don't see why they shouldn't have to make a better argument than, \\\"more people than not,\\\" agree.                 I'm not a Republican.  I'm a republican.  :-)                And no, I'm neither a Democrat nor a democrat.                Now, I've asked several times, and all you've done is answer \\\"It isn't democratic,\\\" which I knew before I said it.  Why *should* it be democratic?  We don't have a true direct democracy, and few people advocate one.

GB> I hope you meant \\\"inarguably\\\".  Given the choice, I would rather argue <g>.  No arguments about migranous aura; in fact, current best evidence is that aura is intrinsicially neuronal (a la spreading depression of Leao) rather than vascular (something causing vasoconstriction and secondary neuronal ischemia).  Migraine without aura, however, is a fuzzier issue.  There do not seem to be objectively measurable changes in brain function.  The Copenhagen mafia (Lauritzen, Olesen, et al) have done local CBF studies on migraine without aura, and (unlike migraine with aura, but like tension-type) they found no changes in LCBF.  From one (absurd) perspective, *all* pain is neurologic, because in the absence of a nervous system, there would not be pain.  From another (tautologic) perspective, any disease is in the domain of the specialty that treats it.  Neurologists treat headache, therefore (at least in the USA) headache is neurologic.  Whether neurologic or not, nobody would disagree that disabling headaches are common.  Perhaps my fee-for-service neurologic colleagues, scrounging for cases, want all the headache patients they can get.

We've got guns, they've got a monarch and an economy on the verg of collapse.  Finger pointing across the Atlanticis a waste or time.          Canada has been blaming the U.S. for their problems for years. The simple fact of the matter is this:  Ten years ago they crowed about how great their system was because they'd gotten rid of the guns and the U.S. would be so much better if they'd just get into the divine light shining from the North.  We pointed out that it was cultural differences, and pointed to their pre-control crime rates.  We also pointed out that the history of the entire world contained smuggling, and that whenever something was wanted, it was smuggled in.        If the problem were based on U.S. guns, it would have surfaced years before.         Now more Canadian criminals want guns.  And they are being provided. Canada has its own version of the drug problem.  Yet drugs are prohibited in the U.S.          Saw a news report out of Britain that armed crime is on the rise, and several police agencies are considering have permanent \\\"firearms officers\\\" to deal with it.

Qualifications -- one of the worse finishes in last year's prediction contest.  AL East -- 1993  1.  Baltimore Orioles Why the Orioles?  Well, I pondered long and hard, and it all came down to this:   -- The Blue Jays are going the wrong direction.   -- Can't bring myself to pick the Yankees   -- Milwaukee was a fluke   -- Indians aren't ready to contend   -- Red Sox were bad last year, and didn't get any better   -- Detroit's pitching will be the new definition of \\\"replacement level\\\" \\\"But you don't really think the Orioles will win, do you.\\\"  No.  As a matter of fact, I can't see any team in the American League winning either division on paper (with the possible exception of the Yankees, who I hate).  But some- body has to win, so I pick the Orioles.  \\\"You don't really think that Brady Anderson is going to repeat, do you?\\\"  No.  I'm basing the Orioles prediction on the expectation of big years from Cal Ripken and Glenn Davis.  \\\"Glenn Davis?  That's insane\\\".  Yes.  So, without further ado: STRONG POINTS:  Hoiles, Ripken some years, Olson, getting rid of Billy Ripken. WEAK POINTS:  Segui may start.  Valenzuela (the original 30-something) may be   the fifth starter.  Oates puts his best hitters at the bottom of the lineup.   (Does anybody else think that might be a calculated maneuver to minimize   the effect of a slumping Ripken?  If you can't move Ripken out of the #3   spot, why not move the rest of the line up?) WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Glenn Davis wins comeback player of the year. WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  In a tight pennant race, team trades for Pecota. ObPrediction:  \\\"The Streak\\\" continues.  Harold Reynolds leads the team in   caught stealing.  2. New York Yankees. STRONG POINTS:  Abbot, Key, Perez.  Could have best pitching in American   League.  Boggs should improve on Hayes. WEAK POINTS:  Mattingly still considered best hitter.  The Steinbrenner    factor.  (The Yankees lost to the Mets.  Can wholesale changes be far   behind?)  Never count on rookie pitchers (i.e. Wickman & Millitello) to   win a division. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Boggs hits over .300 WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Howe gets arrested again. ObPrediction:  Mattingly won't top a 700 OPS.  3.  Toronto Blue Jays STRONG POINTS:  Management willing to make big deals.  Management has eerie   power to convince other teams its prospects are not suspects.  Olerud.   Guzman.  Alomar. WEAK POINTS:  The Jackson for Bell trade has shaken my faith in Gillick.   Losing Stewart may hurt rotation (that's *really* a bad sign).  No one in   the outfield can get on base.  Pitching is thin behind Guzman and Ward. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Jack Morris considered Cy Young contender in August WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Club makes no major deals in August. ObPrediction:  Morris will post better ERA and WHIP totals than last year.  And   have a losing record.  4.  Milwaukee Brewers STRONG POINTS:  Pitching staff was exceptional -- last year. WEAK POINTS:  Molitor gone.  Surhoff at third?  Why?  Eldred can't keep it up. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Listach and Eldred play like last year. WOULD BE BAD SIGN:  Bones plays like last year. ObPrediction:  Surhoff won't finish the year at third.  5.  Cleveland Indians STRONG POINTS:  Baerga, Belle, Nagy WEAK POINTS:  Pitching staff thin -- losing Olin really hurts.  Starts Felix   Fermin. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Bielecki's ERA is consistent with his Atlanta starts. WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Ted Power -- bullpen ace. ObPrediction:  Alomar will be back on the DL by the all-star break.  6.  Boston Red Sox STRONG POINTS:  Clemens, Viola, Clemens, Detroit, Clemens WEAK POINTS:  Most incompetent GM in baseball.  Key free agent signing -- Andre   Dawson.  Burks is gone -- Hatcher in center. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Rainouts in between Clemens starts. WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Clemens on the DL ObPrediction:  Russell will make Sox fans forget Reardon.  Interpret that how   you will :->  7.  Detroit Tigers STRONG POINTS:  Tettleton, Phillips, Whitaker WEAK POINTS:  If Fielder keeps declining, he'll be a shortstop this year.   Worst rotation in baseball entirely replaced -- but not necessarily better.   This year could be *very* ugly. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Cecil Fielder deserving the MVP. WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Cecil Fielder not whining about deserving an MVP. ObPrediction:  Cecil *won't* lead the league in RBIs.  One more division to go.... --  Dale J.

Jim,  There are a couple of things about your post and others in this thread that are a little confusing. An atheist is one for whom all things can be understood as processes of nature - exclusively. There is no need for any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything. There is no purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by physics, chemistry, biology, etc.; everything is random, nothing is determnined. This would also have to include human intelligence of course and all its products. There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it acquire intelligence, it's just a happy accident. For an atheist, no event can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less value than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about- an event can have value.  The products of our intelligence are acquired from our environment, from teaching, training, observation and experience and are only significant to the individual mind wherein they reside. These mental processes and the images they produce for us are just electrical activity and nothing more; content is of no consequence. The human mind is as much a response to natural forces as water running down a hill. How then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing the values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? On what grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? It seems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, you have to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but what in nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke to establish your values. Since every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what difference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or otherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The only way an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the objection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn't like it - that's it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer that it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries no weight in any \\\"absolute\\\" sense. That you don't like what God told people to do says nothing about God or God's commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled with a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That your objections -seem- well founded is due to the way you've been conditioned; there is no \\\"truth\\\" content. The whole of your intellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality. I didn't make these rules, it's inherent in naturalistic atheism and to be consistent, you have to accept the non-significance of any human thought, even your own. All of this being so, you have excluded yourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil, etc. and cannot participate. Your opinion about the Bible can have no weight whatsoever.\",\"Has David Wells landed with a team yet?

For instance, 'No one should ever deliberately inflict pain on another simply to take pleasure in his suffering' might be thought of as a plausible example.  Even in a world of sadists who all rejected it, the contention remains true, just as '5 + 7 = 12' remains correct even if there is no one left to count.  The problem for the objectivist is to determine the status of moral truths and the method by which they can be established.  If we accept that such judgements are not reports of what is but only relate to what ought to be (see naturalistic fallacy) then they cannot be proved by any facts about the nature of the world.  Nor can they be analytic, since this would involve lack of action-guiding content;  'One ought always to do the right thing' is plainly true in virtue of the vords involved but it is unhelpful as a practical guide to action (see analytic and synthetic).  At this point the objectivist may talk of 'self-evident truths', but can he deny the subjectivist's claim that self-evidence is in the mind of the beholder?  If not, what is left of the claim that some moral judgements are true?  THe subjectivist may well feel that all that remains is that there are some moral judgements with which he would wish to associate himself.  To hold a moral opinion is, he suggests, not to know something to be true but to have preferences regarding human activity.\\\"\",\"Date: 19 Apr 93 19:57:21 GMT    From: jhart@agora.rain.com (Jim Hart)     \\\"Simply?\\\" \\\"Everyone\\\" should have this attitude?

Shortstop:  Vizcaino vs Weiss...Vizcaino is excellent defensively, but is an automatic out at bat. Weiss isn't much better with the stick. Even.  Third Base:  Dave Magadan vs Buechelle...Magadan has a higher OBP and is a better hitter. Buechelle has more power and is better defensively (I think) Edge to Florida.  Catcher:   Santiago vs Wilkins...Wilkins is OK, but Santiago is better. Edge to Marlins  Left Field:  Conine vs Maldonado...Wow! 4 for 4 yesterday...I know Conine has potential. I watched him play at Omaha the last couple years. Until he actually proves himself, I give Maldonado the edge, however, like at 1B, this is position where Florida might be even or better *if* the player there has a huge year.  Center:  Scott Pose vs Wilson/May...Edge to May, even if Wilson. Hopefully the Cubs will use may and save Wilson for pinch running and the like. May isn't Ken Griffey Jr, but he will hit .275 with 15 homers if he plays full time.  Right:  Felix vs Sosa...Felix Jose has occasional power and a bad OBP. So does Sosa, but Sosa also has speed and a good glove. Edge to Cubs  Starters:  Aquino? Armstrong? Hammond? A lot of fifth starters here. The Cubs won't remind anyone of the Brave staff, but Morgan-Castillo-Guzman-Hibbard is average to OK...better than the Marline. Edge to Cubs  Middle Relief:  Even. The Cubs have some decent middlemen, and so do the Marlins. Carpenter anf Klink or decent, but so are Assenmacher and McElroy.  Closer:  A healthy Harvey is a big edge to the Marlins. Meyers is decent, but no Harvey. Of course, the Cubs may have a few more games to save. Look for 30 saves, 5 blown from Meyers, and 25 saves, 3 blown (with a better ERA) for Harvey. Edge Florida.

However, there are those who use the church to bolster themselves.  This is evident in many letters.

Such passages go throughout the letters and Jesus does warn about them (Matthew 24:4-14).  But look at the promise in this last part.

It is extremely easy to use, make reports, etc.  I own both it and Paradox, and I almost never use Paradox.  If you need to  build up a complicated application, then Paradox is the way to go.  I have heard horror stories about the Access programming being extremely cryptic. Since you seem like you will probably be doing fairly small stuff (work/ home use and you have not used a database before), I recommend Approach.  I  have found only one small thing which I would like it to do more easily: I have one database where the order in which the records are entered must  be different than what is the logical ordering.  To permanently reorder (to  use the old DBASE III command) the records requires sorting the records  appropriately (no problem, since I almost always use them in this order) exporting the database to another database (which can still be an Approach  database), and then copying the exported files back to the original  filename.  This is a small weakness, considering the other items I really  like about Approach.  It is also a little slower than Paradox (other than  the loading, Paradox takes forever and a minute to load).  Paradox also  takes a lot of memory (both hard disk (around 12MB) and RAM).\",\" I'm afraid he isn't.

Additionally, use of real alternatives ISN'T totally legal - you're not allowed to export really good crypto equipment except to the government's friends (e.g. the Australian government) you can only export even BAD crypto equipment with their permission, and the regulators who control the cellular telephone companies make sure there are only two competitors, so Joe's Garage Cellular can't start offering a secure service.  \",\"Hello.

As a result of the spacecraft entering Contingency Mode on April 9, all payload instruments were automatically powered off by on-board fault protection software.  Gamma Ray Spectrometer Random Access Memory was successfully reloaded on Monday, April 19.  To prepare for Magnetometer Calibrations which were rescheduled for execution in Flight Sequence C9 on Tuesday and Wednesday of next week, a reload of Payload Data System Random Access Memory will take place this morning beginning at 10:30 AM.  Over this weekend, the Flight Team will send real-time commands to perform Differential One-Way Ranging to obtain additional data for analysis by the Navigation Team.  Radio Science Ultra Stable Oscillator testing will take place on Monday .  The Flight Sequence C9 uplink will occur on Sunday, April 25, with activation at Midnight, Monday evening April 26.  C9 has been modified to include Magnetometer Calibrations which could not be performed in C8 due to Contingency Mode entry on April 9.  These Magnetometer instrument calibrations will allow the instrument team to better characterize the spacecraft-generated magnetic field and its effect on their instrument. This information is critical to Martian magnetic field measurements which occur during approach and mapping phases. MAG Cals will require the sequence to command the spacecraft out of Array Normal Spin state and perform slew and roll maneuvers to provide the MAG team data points in varying spacecraft attitudes and orientations.\",\"    J.N. Darby was one of the founders of the \\\"Plymouth Brethren\\\" and an early supporter of dispensationalism.  F.F. Bruce highly approved of his translation.  He also translated the Bible into several other languages.   This was from the same fellow who did Young's Concordance, which was a standard reference work, similar to Strong's concordance.   I believe that these just follow standard reference works.   Some are by Larry Pierce (\\\"Brethren\\\"), some are by Baptists, and I think that Thompson (of chain reference fame) was Presbyterian)   Another standard reference work that has been around for decades. A new version was just released and is available through Christian Book Distributers.   C.I. Scofield was the creator of the Scofield Reference Bible.  For many people (but not me), this is THE STUDY BIBLE.  The notes are strongly dispensational.   These are probably the most accurate Strong's numbers available. \",\":  : >  : > HELP!!! : > my wife has informed me that she wants a convertible for her next car. :  : : FYI, just last week the PBS show Motor Week gave the results of what they  : thought were the best cars for '93.

Needless to say I was smiling a bit by the time it was over ...)  :*)  Watch out for that darned \\\"convertible tan\\\" tho...\",\" Rather, people kill people with guns.  The sad truth is: sometimes that is good, or at least, better than the alternative.   Ok.  There are about 1400 fatal firearm accidents per year [1], and the number has been in decline since early this century [2].  Most of these accidents involve rifles or shot guns, not handguns.  ...  In fact there are both guns and bullets designed specifically for that.  The idea that my Ruger Mark II Bull Barrel (a semi-auto 0.22 caliber handgun) was designed to kill or hurt people, even for self defense, would, I'm sure, come as a surprise to its designer.  It certainly isn't why I have it.  It certainly would hurt someone if you shot them with it, and might even kill them, but it is simply wrong to say it was designed to kill people.   In fact, that is what happens most of the time.  Most self defensive uses of firearms don't involve firing any shots.  Most criminals would prefer not to be shot, and will go to some effort not to be, including doing what you say when you point a gun at them.  If you were called on to design a tool, that could be easily carried, to immediately stop someone attacking you, what would it be?  A handgun is about the best anyone has come up with and experience shows it does work the best.[3]   Certainly, no one argues that handguns (of the type we are discussing) aren't deadly weapons.  However, it simply isn't true to say that all of them were designed to kill people.  Moreover, what exactly is wrong with having deadly weapons?  There are times when it is perfectly legitimate to use deadly force, e.g. in self defense.  I consider it not just my right, but my duty to defend myself and my family, and that includes having and knowing how to use the tools to do that.  \\\"The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government.\\\"  - T. Jefferson.  I think what Jefferson said is still true.   Not very often compared to other use.[3]   This isn't that common either, at least when compared to other uses.  It is very rare that a non-violent person will suddenly \\\"get-pissed\\\" and kill someone, gun or not.  In most cases, the people who murder have long histories of violence.  If you have good reason to believe that these people wouldn't kill if they didn't have a gun, feel free to present it.   Right, but there are times when killing things is called for.  I hope I never have to shoot a person, but I've had to kill a number of animals from rodents to cows, and when I do, I don't want them to suffer any more than is necessary.  I prefer they die instantly, but failing that, I want them to drop so I can quickly finish them with the next shot, and failing that, I don't want them to go fast or far.  I try to choose the best weapon and ammunition I have to try to achieve that goal for the size of animal I'm after, but it doesn't always work as I plan.  Without belaboring the point, people who are overly impressed with the killing or shopping power of guns, particularly handguns, haven't used them much for that purpose.

In 1932, the accidental deaths by firearm per  1,000,000 people was 24.03. In 1987, it was 5.74. The decline has been  steady, consistent, and a fairly straight line when plotted. At the rate  of the last sixty years, it will reach zero sometime around 2025 AD.  CONCLUSION ========== Firearms have been a declining factor in accidental deaths for over  sixty years, despite rising per-capita gun ownership.    [1] = Year. [2] = Population. [3] = Accidental deaths. [4] = Accidental deaths per 1,000,000.

The only thing that has happened is that  the two sides have exchanged roles.  The USA has a higher imprisonment rate (400 per 100,000 population) than any country in Europe by a factor of 10 or so.  In California, it is over 600 per 100,000 population.  The prison population in California is now over 100,000, a quadrupling since 1980.  Most of these inmates were convicted under the drug prohibition laws.  Police now confiscate property, without trial, under a \\\"good faith probable cause\\\" standard, in the name of depriving the horrible ghastly drug dealers of their ill-gotten gains.  Conduct an opinion poll, and a majority will answer \\\"yes\\\" if you ask them whether civil liberties and due process should be diluted in order to Send Our Young People The Message That We Are Serious About Winning The War On Drugs.  I don't know whether anyone has measured such a figure among gun owners, but I would expect the same result.  They certainly seem to vote that way.  According to Jack Herer's book _The Emperor Wears No Clothes_, over TWELVE MILLION YEARS of prison time have been served under the marijuana prohibition laws, by people who were minding their own business and causing no harm to others (and less harm to themselves than users of tobacco, with 400,000 confirmed kills/year).  Under the \\\"War on Drugs\\\" campaign of \\\"zero tolerance\\\" due process protections have eroded, and mandatory sentences of ten years without parole have proliferated.  By and large, gun owners have voted for the politicians who favor such measures.  And now, all the precedents--not only legal, but political:  \\\"My fellow Americans, we must send our young people the message that we are serious about winning the War On Murder\\\"--are going to be applied to the oncoming wave of gun prohibition laws.  Gun owners are about to get a taste of the medicine they voted for believing it would be used only on those with different tastes in recreational drugs.

Thanks in advance.\",\"I've been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest. I've  transcribed some of my notes below.  Since my note taking ability is by no means infallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is  granted to copy this without restriction.  Michael Sternberg, Cheif of Operations of RIMSAT, was invited to speak at an informal lunch held by ACDIS here on the campus of the University of Illinois. ACDIS is an organization on campus that deals with Arms Control, Disarmament and International Security.  RIMSAT was considered an appropriate topic because the company is using Russian launchers and satellites.  I think it also helped that his daughter is a grad student in the International Relations program.  The concept behind RIMSAT apparently began when Matt Neilson (?) went to Tonga to visit a friend.  While he was there, he somehow ended up visiting the king, who happened to be a big TV fan.  Matt bought the King a satellite dish, which  the king thought was really nifty.  Since Tonga has a GNP of about $70 million, His Majesty asked if there was any way to make money off this.  Matt thought there probably was, so at his suggestion, Tonga applied for 31 geosynchronous satellite slots.  While this isn't entirely off the wall, it was very unusual, seeing as Tonga was a tiny kingdom with no space program, and 31 is a lot of slots.  The whole thing was debated in the appropriate regulatory agency and Carl Hilliard (who is apparently a respected space lawyer) wrote several opinions supporting Tonga's case.  Eventually Tonga ended up with 7 slots, ranging from  70 E to 170 E (slots are designated by the longitude over which they reside). According to Sternberg, four of these, from 130 E to 142 E are the best in the world because they are excellently placed for communications between Hawaii and  the Pacific Rim.   RIMSAT was formed to use these slots. It was officially formed in Nevis as a tax haven.  They tried for a few years to raise funds in the west, however, to fill 7 slots with western satellites launched on western launchers would have cost approximately $2 billion.  It's not easy to raise that kind of money. Eventually, they hit upon the idea of using Russian hardware.  They began  negotiating with Glavkosmos for hardware.  Mr Sternberg describes operating in  Moscow in such harsh terms that I don't think I'll visit there for a long time. Besides a significant lack of creature comforts, he was not happy with the way that people operate.  For example \\\"everybody can sell you everything.\\\"   Everyone can show the proper documents and licenses that indicate they are the only ones who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by.  Eventually, RIMSAT arranged a deal with Glavkosmos for 6 satellites at a cost of $150 million.  However, Glavkosmos lost favor after the coup.  Sternberg says that this is because they were basically a bunch of KGB operatives who  went to trade shows and picked up lots of brochures.  Since Glavkosmos was out of power, he had to renegotiate the deal with the new authorities.  He again described life in a Moscow hotel in rather unfavorable terms.  Eventually, he worked out a deal and on Dec 4, 1992 he met with Koptev, who heads the  Russian space program, to sign the deal.  Koptev insisted on a few concessions before signing and according to Sternberg he arranged these new rules to  allow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing as RIMSAT.  The next step was to meet with the builders of the hardware, NPO Applied  Mechanics -- NPO PM to use their acronym.  This organization is located in  Siberia (can't figure out how to spell the town, I need an atlas) and has built about 1500 vehicles since the dawn of the space age.  Sternberg commented that siberians are very different from Musovites.  They are hard workers, honest people who team up to get things done, very much like midwesterners.  At this point there were some comments from the audience that agreed with his opinion on both siberians and midwesterners :-)  Sternberg had lots of good things to say about NPO PM.  His company is  apparently lookng for $100 million to invest in the firm to become 50% partners.It apparently costs the Russians about $4 million to build a satellite that would sell for $50 million in the west.  If you want to give them  specifications, they'll build you a satellite.  For the particular satellites that RIMSAT will be using, costs run about $378,000 per transponder year.  This compares to $810,000 t/y in the U.S.  They can sell their time for about $1.1 million compared to $2.6 million in the U.S.  RIMSAT will launch their  satellites on Protons.  To get the best prices, they bought in bulk.  They  have the rights to twelve launches, so if any of you need a lift I can give you their address.  The first launch is scheduled for October and they are getting one used satellite from the Russians, which is being moved into place now.  Tidbits:  *  Sternberg says this kind of thing has to be done by entrepreneurs, not big business because big business is just like what they have over there, except that \\\"we have better paper, both in the bathroom and in the copier.\\\"  *  Russian launches are self insured.  The promise to replace a failed launch within 9 months.  *  Major investors in RIMSAT include Russell 20/20, which is a huge retirement fund organization, Cellsat, which is a big telecom business in southeast Asia, and a fund operated by some of the big names in U.S aerospace which he says is sort of an insurance policy for them if this really takes off.  *  He downplayed the instabilites in the ex-USSR saying that we are worried partly because we aren't used to seeing Russia as anything but an unvarying monolith.  Italy gets a new government \\\"every two weeks\\\" but we don't worry  because we're used to it.  He predicted that once we get used to seeing what really goes on in Russia we won't worry about their stability as much.  *  Part of the problem with cooperative ventures is the problem of transfering money.  The central bank has a policy of taking hard currency payments, putting 25% in their coffers and replacing the rest with the \\\"equivalent\\\" value in  rubles.  To get around this, RIMSAT pays their hard currency into an Austrian bank account.  NPO PM then pays their contractors with foreign currency so that the only the contractors get swindled by the government.  *  One of the big problems RIMSAT has had is stonewalling by the western  satellite industry.  However, Intelsat recently bought three of the same type of satellites, which was rather reassuring.  *  The biggest worry most people have about russian satellites is the primitive technology and shorter lifetime.  The older Gorizont (Horizon) satellites have a lifetime of about 5 years, while the more modern Express satellites compare well with western technology and last about 8 years.  While this is much  shorter than 15 years for western satellites, Sternberg downplayed the  difference.  At these prices they can afford to launch new ones.  In addition, shorter lifetimes mean that they can replace their equipment with newer technology so they will be able to compete better than older, out of date hardware. \",\"When I left, it was 4-3, Blues with 2:00 to go!

Also consider that it looks like Denning has some decent NSA / government connections, which is always a plus for an academic institute that wants more government funding and work tossed their way.  Despicable, yes; career limiting, well, the publicity probably outweighs the drawbacks.  And there are a whole bunch of people who think the whole thing is just peachy keen. If it's only going to be used against drug dealers, child pornographers, and terrorists, well it must be good. :p\",\" The Proton has been used in 2, 3, and 4 stage versions.  The two stage version was used for the first 3 launches, while the 3 and 4 stage versions are used today.  The four stage version is used mostly for escape (and geosynchronous?) orbits, while the 3 stage version is used for low earth orbits.  Since this is the version that launched Mir and the Salyuts (and the add-on modules for Mir), as long as Centaur is smaller than Mir (which I believe it is), it should fit under the shroud.  I vaguely recall that the Russians are developing a LH2/LOX upper stage for the Proton.\",\" : >People who reject God don't want to be wth Him in heaven.

First, it is best that she see  a doctor.  However, every time I had kidney stones, I saw my doctor and the only thing they did was to prescribe some pain killers and medication for a urinary tract infection.  The pain killers did nothing for me...kidney stones are extremely painful.  My stones were judged passable, so we just waited it out.  However the last one took 10 days to pass...not fun.

All of the analog electronics are working  fine, I have ordered a PIC ICE (not vice versa) since the PICs are so  cheap and low-power, but I am having a devil of a time finding any  LCD displays in the 6-8 digit range that are priced as low as I need.  I  am looking for somthing in the range of $1 in quantities of about  1000-10,000.  Mainstream distributors like Almac cannot help me without a part  number, or when they do look around for something in their line  they find a $15 8-digit LCD.  Even Digikey's cheapest offering is $5 in  quantity.  I know LCD displays like this must exist because I see whole  calculators for sale for $4.99, meaning the retailer probably buys it  for $3.50 and the wholesaler probably gets it for $2.50 or so.  This  $2.50 includes assembly labor, packaging, sales, transportation,  import duties, the case and keyboard, the PC Board, the processor  chip, the solar cell --- and the LCD.  The LCD can't cost much.  If anyone could put me in touch with some manufacturers and/or  distributors that handle such things I would be much obliged.  -Joe Betts betts@netcom.com \",\"As the subjects says, Windows 3.1 keeps crashing (givinh me GPF) on me of   late.  It was never a very stable package, but now it seems to crash every   day.  The worst part about it is that it does not crash consistently: ie I   can't reproduce crashes, and they are not always GPF's in the same   application. Sometimes I can recover by simply closing the application   that caused an error, but other times, windows acts very strange, and I   need to re-boot.  Some background:  I have a Leading Edge 486sx25 with Phoenix BIOS.  When I   first got it it had 4Mg of memory.  It ran windows fine (not too many   GPF's).  Then, a couple of weekends ago, I installed Lotus 123 for windows   (with ATM), a game card and an additional 4  1Mg SIMMS.  The Leading edge   machine is kind of strange, in that it has the IDE controler built into   the motherboard, the CPU is actually on a sparate board that plugs into   the motherboard and the SIMMS it uses are Macintosh SIMMS! Apparently I   was told that the Leading Edge had the parity bit built into the mother   board.  The original 4Mg 80ns SIMMS where of the 2 chip variety from   SAMSUNG, and the ones I installed are 8 chip SIMMS. They are recognized   fine by the BIOS RAM check. The game card is a generic $20 gamecard.  The reason why I mention the hardware like this is that sometimes   rebooting the machine using the reset button or ctl-alt-del still leaves   the machine kind of flaky, but turning it on and off doesn't.   I haven't tried taking out the RAM or the game card, because as I said   these GPF are not reproducible at will.  I have gone through and entire   day using the computer with no problems and then I might get 5 or so GPF's   in the sppace of 20 minutes?  What can I do.  This situation is most annoying... Are there any good   diagnostic tools for hardware? Do you think that this might be a software   problem (ie EMM386 etc.)?

Neto):  This all sounds suspiciously like my company might have something to do with this.  Background first: Megatek has a series of framebuffers designed as X accelerators. For the most part these are designed for Sun SBUS and Sun (and other vendor's) VME systems.  That said, Megatek products support multi-screen and/or multi-display on a sigle workstation. Most of our cards have a keyboard/mouse port which can be used to provide additional displays. For example, say you hade a Sparcstation with an Sbus expansion chassis. You could put in six frambuffers, allowing a total of six screens in the system. You could then attach from 1 to 6 keyboard/mice, allowing you to mix and match any combination of screens and displays. You could have 1 6-screen display, 3 2-screen displays, 6 1-screen displays, or 1 2-screen display and 1 4-screen display. Basically any combination.  Because of this, we at Megatek try to be very careful about the use of the words multi-screen and multi-display. They are quite different in meaning, and (at least in X) have exact definitions.  The reason I ramble like this is the mention of an upper limit if 12 screens in a display. As it so happens, there's a define in the server that determines the most screens supported (server/include/misc.h, MAXSCREENS). As released my MIT, this is 3. As released by Megatek, this is 12.  As such, the most screens supported by a single Megatek display (i.e. X server) is 12. If someone construed this to be a limitation of X I'm sorry, but clearly (as pointed out so well by Mr. Neto) this is not the case.  We just did it here because nobody has ever asked us for more. Of course, I could say \\\"Buy all you want, we'll support more.\\\" -- \",\"Does anybody out there have or used to have an HD controller from Perstor System Inc.

If the system is really secure, then why does the government have to keep the algorithm secret?  There are plenty of encryption algorithms that don't depend upon nondisclosure to be secure, so why in the world use one that does?  There are reasons, of course, but I certainly can't think of any honest ones.  Next, you assume we can \\\"trust\\\" the escrow houses. But the last time I checked, EVERY SINGLE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT has experienced unauthorized disclosure, corruption, and even fabrication, of supposedly secure data. The govt is saying \\\"Yeah, but NOW we're serious, so you can trust us.\\\"  Bullcrypt.   And finally, although you didn't state it explicitly, you implicitly assume that the warrant mechanism in this country is safe and reasonable. The case in Ventura County of a man shot and killed by officers serving a deliberately fraudulant warrant tells me that the govt has a long ways to go on this score.  Remember that all this is to catch the drug dealers, right?

Who will be able to afford, and be sufficiently motivated, to purchase this expensive, inconvenient higher protection?  Somebody with lots of extra cash...

The above effect is clear, but there are other effects as well.  If Olerud hits a double, any runner on first will score; if Alomar legs an extra base onto a hit in the gap, the runner on first may need to hold at third.  Thus Olerud's doubles have more advancement value than Alomar's.  (Of course, Alomar is more likely to score after hitting a double.)  Another reason not to give too much extra value to baserunning is that the runs created formulas work for very fast and very slow teams.  No team in the 1950's ran much, but some teams certainly had faster players than others.  Still, the current runs created formulas work just as well in the 1950's for all teams.    Bill James gives the 1955-1958 Senators as an example.  They used Harmon Killebrew regularly as a pinch runner, and in 1957, stole 13 bases with 38 times caught stealing.

Hi, I'm new to this group so please bear with me!  Two years ago I wrote a Sunview application for fast animation of raster files. With Sunview becoming rapidly obselete, I've finally decided to rewrite everything from scratch in XView. I put together a quick test, and I've found that XPutImage() is considerably slower (factor of 2 on average?) than the Sunview command pw_rop() which moves image data from memory pixrects to a canvas. This was on a Sparc IPX. It seems that: (1) the X protocol communication is slowing things down; or (2) XPutImage is inefficient...or both! My question is, what is the fastest way in X11R5 to dump 8 plane image data to a window? Can I take advantage of the fact that the client is running on the same machine as the server? Or am I stuck with XPutImage() (in which case I might as well give up now...)?  All help appreciated...thanks!

I believe a legitimate question was asked.  Why shouldn't cost and safety be used (at least in part) to determine legality?  I'd like to see you *prove* that drug legalization is an idiotic idea. Seems to me the evidence from Great Britain is pretty convincing that  drug legalization is a good idea.  Even such a noted conservative as William F. Buckley supports it.  Your examples (except for prostitution) fail miserably to meet both criteria (safer AND cheaper).  Obviously, killing people is not \\\"safe\\\".

Atheists have this ground against us and I believe they are right about *some* who call themselves 'christians'.\",\"    Is it appropriate for the Lord not to reveal certain  things before the world (i.e., publish them widely)?  These things sacred to Himself.  He may place any  pre- or post-conditions He feels are necessary.  Moreover, there are precedents in scripture where knowledge of sacred things is withheld:  1. After the Transfiguration Jesus instructed Peter, James, and John to \\\"tell the vision to no  man, until the Son of man be risen again from  the dead\\\" (Matt. 17:9).   If we were living at the time of Savior, there would be no (public) record of this event.  2. A faithful friend of Paul experiences a vision  of \\\"paradise\\\" when he \\\"heard unspeakable words,  which it is not lawful for a man to utter\\\" (2 Cor. 12:4). This person heard something which Paul can not  write to the Corinthians (and us).  3. There is an incident recorded in the Book of Mormon where words uttered by \\\"babes\\\" were  \\\"forbidden that there should not any man write them (3 Nephi 26:16, the entire text follows for those of you without access to the BOM).  3 Nephi 26:16 Behold, it came to pass on the morrow that the  multitude gathered themselves together, and they both saw and heard these children; yea, even  babes did open their mouths and utter marvelous things; and the things which they did utter were forbidden that there should not any man write them.  Some LDS scholars speculate that these words which could not be written are the sacred portions from temple we are to withhold from  the world (but it could be something else).   There is much we can discuss about the temple  ordinances.  We can discuss regarding baptisms and other vicarious ordinances for the dead. We can discuss certain concepts regarding the endowment (\\\"the ritual\\\"). However, there are certain elements I can not discuss with anyone (including other saints) outside of the temple. As a portion of the endowment, we receive the tokens and signs that will permit us access to Heaven.

The structure  of the US government does try to combat this tendency to some extent, but  fighting entropy is always a losing battle.  Most people would rather have  comfort than freedom.  The paradox is that you can't really have the former,  in the long term, unless you have the latter.  One of the reasons that I probably come across to some people as a weird  cross between a libertarian and an \\\"establishment tool\\\" is that I end up  taking an utterly pragmatic view of government.  I don't get up in arms when  the government fails to protect the interests of the people, because in my  lifetime it never has--therefore, I have no expectation that it will.    As a result, I protect my own interests rather than expecting the government  to be \\\"fair\\\".  I will use strong cryptography when I think it is needed,  whether or not it is legal at the time.  Same thing with anything else the  government would rather not see in private hands--that's their problem.   What's important to me is using the right tool for the job.  If it's legal,  so much the better.  If it is not, but does not violate my (very strong)  sense of personal ethics, I will use it anyway as long I think it is worth  it.  Expecting the government to actually protect the interests of its  citizens, except by accident, is utter folly.  Even Jefferson, one of the  major architects of the American system of government, figured that in a  couple hundred years it would become so corrupt and self-serving that it  would be time dismantle it and try again, by revolution if necessary.

He threw 2 straight fastballs over the plate to Bonds in the 1st last night, got away with the first one, but Bonds hit the second one out of the park.  Then in the 3rd, when Clark was at third base with one out, Maddux did not intentionally walk Bonds, and Bonds dropped a single to left-center.       The Braves announcers pointed out that McGee as a leadoff hitter has not scored a run yet.  He will always hit around .300, but I'm concerning about his on-base percentage.

Having said that, if you can tweak the programs being run (by adding in calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort of thing), you could probably run 15-20 people on a given machine before you started seeing slowdowns again (this time from network bandwidth). It all really depends on what the programs are doing (ie. you're going to see a slowdown from X-bandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all doing network things also...)\",\"I have two 4 meg SIMMS that I am trying to sell.

Some of them are very serious while others are completely benign.  Having \\\"a few irregular beats\\\" on an EKG could be serious depending on what those beats were and when they occurred, or could be of no significance.  Low blood potassium levels probably predispose people with underlying heart disease to develop arrhythmias.  Very low potassium levels are clearly dangerous, but it is not clear how much of a problem low-end-of-normal levels are:  a lot of cardiologists seem to treat anyone with even a mildly low-normal potassium level. \",\"             When did Bill start doing endorsements?

The story is this: I bought a car out of state, and I'm trying to get the safety inspection in Pennsylvania. The problem is that the car has  aftermarket tint on all windows except the windshield. The tint is rather weak, and you can clearly see the inside of the car through the tint.  The inspection garage said that they won't pass it unless I get a waiver from the state police. So I went to the state police - the officer told me that aftermarket tint is illegal, and I can get a waiver only for a pre-84 car or for a medical reason. I asked him to show me the section of the vehicle code that says it's illegal.  He showed it to me and the paraghaph said that you can't have tint, if you can't see the inside of the car because of the tint. When I told him that you can in fact see the inside very well, he shut the book and said \\\"It's just illegal, and in fact we can have someone give you a ticket for it right now.\\\" Well, won't argue with that...  Since the vehicle code says it's OK as long as you can see through the tint, I'd like to keep it (I'll re-read the vehicle code in the library).  I'd also like to get some sort of paper from the police that says it's OK, so I can get the inspection, and so that I won't get in trouble for the tint later on. I also wouldn't mind registering a complaint against that officer - he really pissed me off.  So does anyone have any experience getting that sort of a paper from the police, especially in Pennsylvania? Does anyone have any experience registering a complaint against an officer? I called the station  later on today, but they basically said there is no place where I could register a complaint against an officer... And if I do decide to keep the tint and get a ticket anyway, how much of a chance do I stand to succesfully appeal the ticket in court?  Any comments about it will be welcome!\",\" But what if the geologists are wrong and these people are warning of a non-existent danger?  Analogies can only push an argument so far (on both sides).  Both Melinda's and yours assume the premises used to set up your respective analogies are true and thus the correct conclusion will arise.  The important point to note is the different directions both sides come from. Christians believe they know the TRUTH and thus believe they have the right (and duty) to tell the TRUTH to all.    Christians can get offended if others do not believe (what is self-evidently to them) the TRUTH. Non-christians do not believe this is the TRUTH and get offended at them because they (christians) claim to know the TRUTH.  (BTW this argument goes for anyone, I am not just bagging christians)  Neither side can be really reconciled unless one of the parties changes their mind.  As Melinda pointed out, there is no point in arguing along these lines because both approach from a different premise.  A more useful line of discussion is WHY people believe in particular faiths.

ADVOCATE OF LUNAR POWER SYSTEM AS ENERGY SOURCE FOR THE WORLD     On April 21, the OASIS and Ventura County chapters of the National  Space Society will sponsor a talk by Lunar Power System (LPS) co- inventor and vice-president of the LPS Coalition, Dr. Robert D. Waldron.  It will be held at 7:30 p.m. at the Rockwell Science Center in Thousand Oaks, CA.     Dr. Waldron is currently a Technical Specialist in Space Materials Processing with the Space Systems Division of Rockwell International in Downey, California.  He is a recognized world authority on lunar materials refinement.  He has written or coauthored more than 15 articles or reports on nonterrestrial materials processing or utilization.  Along with Dr. David Criswell, Waldron invented the lunar/solar power system concept.     Momentum is building for a coalition of entrepreneurs, legal experts, and Soviet and U.S. scientists and engineers to build the Lunar Power System, a pollution-free, energy source with a potential to power the globe.     For the past three years members of the coalition, nearly half from California, have rejuvenated the commercial and scientific concept of a solar power system based on the Moon.     The LPS concept entails collecting solar energy on the lunar surface and beaming the power to Earth as microwaves transmitted through orbiting antennae.  A mature LPS offers an enormous source of clean, sustainable power to meet the Earth's ever increasing demand using proven, basic technology.     OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of Space Industrialization) is the Greater Los Angeles chapter of the National Space Society, which is an international non-profit organization that promotes development of the space frontier.

But, as you put, Being the source of \\\"all\\\" existence, including one's own, would mean that God came from nothing, a concept alien to Christianity and Theism.  It is better to understand the classical concepts of Necessary and Contingent existence.  God exists necessarily, always.  God created contingent beings.  This is a coherent solution to existence, so long as the concept of God is coherent.    Not a very good answer.

OK, suppose the NY State Police want to tap a suspect's phone.  They need a warrant, just like the old days.  But unlike the old days, they now need to      (a) get two federal agencies to give them the two parts of        the key.  Now, what happens if there's a tiff between the two escrow houses? Posession/release of keys becomes a political bargaining chit.  State and lower-level police agencies have to watch the big boys play politics, while potentially good leads disappear, lives and property are lost, statutes of limitations run out, etc.  Not to mention: a moderately clever person who suspects the police are after her/him will be buying new phones faster than tap requests can be processed.  Or using stolen ones.  [Will the Turing Police come and arrest you for transmitting without a dialing license?]  There's also bureacracy and security problems -- within each escrow house,  how will requests for key disclosure be authenticated?  Put in enough safeguards of the kind bureaucrats and activists feel comfortable with, and  it might take a LONG time to get that key.  [Even when a request is approved,  how is the key going to be disclosed?  Will it be encrypted by a Clipper-type chip for transmission?  In a bureaucracy the size of the Federal Government, with a databank of the necessary size, and data traffic of the projected volume, there's going to be a lot of weak links.  How many of  these kinds of problems will be open for public or \\\"expert\\\" scrutiny?]    Furthermore, the Feds might be leery of handing completed keys around,  even to State Police agencies: a trust and security issue.  This would be  an especially acute issue if some other State's Police had mishandled a  key, resulting in lawsuits, financial settlements, and political  embarassment.  So, the Feds implement it this way:      (b) some federal agency gets the keys, performs the tap, and        turns the results over to the NY State Police.  But let's say Cuomo's been causing some problems over a Clinton Aid-To-Urban-Areas proposal.  Or there just happens to be a turf war going on between the State cops and the Justice department on a case. Now, not only do we have the keys as a political chit, we have an extra player in the game *and* we have the tap's tapes as another bargaining chit.  Again, the State Police lose.  I understand that (legal) wiretaps are quite expensive to maintain. In scenario (b), who pays the bill?\",\"  I think you are vastly oversimplifying things. We know that early Christians suffered totures because of their witness to Christ.  For example:  ACT 5:40    His speech persuaded them. They called the apostles in and had             them flogged. Then they ordered them not to speak in the name of             Jesus, and let them go.  ACT 5:41    The apostles left the Sanhedrin, rejoicing because they had been             counted worthy of suffering disgrace for the Name.  It appears that the Jewish rulers of that time had a particular aversion to even hearing Jesus's name. ACT 5:28    \\\"We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name,\\\" he said.             \\\"Yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and are             determined to make us guilty of this man's blood.\\\"  Finally, the first apostle's death, James of Zebedee was certainly not by Rome's hand any more than the first martyr Stephen.     The problem was that if one believed in the Resurrection, then one must believe in Jesus as truly being the Son of God and what He stood for and preached during His ministry on Earth.  That would have been extremely difficult for some people, especially those that had plotted to kill Him.   \",\"To:All  Hi,  Does anybody have the source code to the externel processes that comes with 3D  Studio, and mabe som kind of DOC for writing the processes your self.   /Lars  +++ Author: Lars_Jorgensen@p7.syntax.bbs.bad.se, Syntax BBS, Denmark\",\"can anyone give me more information regarding endometriosis?   i heard it's a very common disease among women and if anyone can provide names of a specialist/surgeon in  the north carolina research triangle  park area (raleigh/durham/chapel  hill) who is familiar with the condition, i would really appreciate it.  thanks.   --Naomi\",\"My friend brought a subaru SVX recently.

Bye.\",\"Note: I am cross-posting (actually, emailing) this to  bit.listserv.catholic while main posting goes to  soc.religion.christian.  [Quotations omitted.  This is in response to a question about the Immaculate Conception.  I explained it, but left justification up to our Catholic readers.  --clh]  There is no direct reference in the Holy Scripture except for the mention of Mary's _blessedness_/full of grace in the \\\"Annunciation\\\" by Angel Gabriel in Luke 1:26-28   And in the 6th month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto  a city of Galilee, named Nazareth.  To a virgin espoused to a  man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's  name was Mary.  And the angel came unto her and said, _\\\"Hail,  thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed  art thou among women.\\\"_  Now, now, hold that line of thought - \\\"the Lord is with Mary & blessed art thou among women\\\" - while you read on....  In the book, \\\"First Lady of the World, A Popular History of Devotion to Mary\\\" by Peter Lappin:  The _Immaculate Conception_ matter is really far more complicated than the _Assumption_.  This arose in 430 AD.  It is quite possible that the feast of _Mary's Conception_ under the title \\\"The Conception of Saint Anne\\\", originally commemorated the _physical miracle_ of a woman _beyond the age_ of child bearing, conceiving a daughter, just as Elizabeth had conceived John the Baptist.  A transfer in emphasis from the physical miracle wrought in Anne to the miracle of grace wrought by God in the soul of Mary was _logical_.  Mary is the incorruptible timber \\\"out of which was hewn the _tabernacle_ of Christ's sinless body\\\"; she is \\\"God's Eden, in whom there is no tree of knowledge, and no serpent that harms.\\\"  Her perfect beauty and spotlessness find their exemplar in Christ, her purity in that of the Father.  At the time of the Council of Ephesus, she was hailed as \\\"innocent, without blemish, immaculate, inviolate, spotless, holy in soul and body, who was blessed as a lily from among thorns, unlearned in the evil ways of Eve\\\". ... At the end of the thirteenth century, an Irish Franciscan, John Duns Scotus (1266-1308),...God maintained that it was a  greater thing for Him to preserve His (the Son) mother from all sin _than to use His power to clease her from it later_. ...  Now let's go to the discussion of baptism and original sin. From \\\"Pocket Catholic Cathechism\\\" by John A. Hardon:  Baptism - Concupiscence Remains after Baptism. Concupiscence or the tendency to sin remains in the baptized but since it is left to provide trial, it has no power to injure those who do not consent and who by the grace of Christ Jesus, manfully resist (Canon 5).  Original gifts of Adam and Eve before their fall: In the light of the foregoing, we see that our first parents were originally gifted three times over: -They had the natural gifts of human beings especially the  power to think and to choose freely. -The had the _preternatural_ gifts of bodily immortality  and of integrity, or the internal power to control desires. -They had the _supernatural_ gifts of sanctifying grace,  the virtues of faith, hope, and charity and the corresponding  title to enter heaven. By their disobedience, they lost the _supernatural and preternatural_ gifts entirely, and were weakened (without losing) their natural capacity to reason and to choose freely.  Baptism restores the _supernatural_ life lost by Adam's sin.  It _does not_ restore the _preternatural_ gifts but gifts as a title to a glorified restoration of our bodies on the last day...  Going back to _Immaculate Conception_ (I am not sure if this interpretation is in any other books but it may be another contribution to the 'puzzle'):  Given the miracle of St. Anne bearing a child at a non-childbearing age, AND Christ was not yet born  AND _there was no baptism yet_ on Mary's birth but STILL, the Angel Gabriel's greetings was: \\\"Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you. Blessed art thou amongst women\\\".  Even Mary was confused about this greeting.  Mary could very well have possessed all of the _treefold original gifts above_ given to our first parents (Adam and Eve before their sin):     Hail Mary (Example of praise given by the Angel Gabriel)     Full of grace (natural, preternatural, supernatural)     The Lord is with you (At those times, God would                 definitely want to be with those He                 has made _blessed_)     Blessed art thou amongst women (that says it all)  At the conception, God made Mary _full of grace and blessed_ as the 'tabernacle' for the coming body of Christ and so,  Immaculate Conception of Mary is true and Mary still has maintained her Immaculate Heart. \",\"hey...

Researchers have found that eating a cup of yogurt a day drastically     reduces a woman's chances of getting vaginal candida, a yeast infection.   For the year-long study, researchers at Long Island Jewish Medical     Center in New Hyde Park, New York, recruited 13 women who suffered from  chronic yeast infections. For the first 6 months, the women each day ate 8 ounces of yogurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus. For the second  6 months, the women did not eat yogurt. The researchers examined the     women each month and found that incidents of colonization and infection  were significantly lower during the period when the women ate yogurt.      The fungus Candida albicans can live in the body without doing harm.   It is an overproliferation of the fungus that leads to infection. The    researchers concluded that the L. acidophilus bacteria found in some     brands of yogurt retard overgrowth of the fungus. Streptococcus          thermophilus and L. bulgaricus are the two bacteria most commonly used   in commercial yogurt production. Neither one appears to exert a          protective effect against Candida albicans, however. Women who want to   try yogurt as a preventive measure should choose a brand that lists      acidophilus in its contents.                                             --- end ---                                                ===================================  InfoTrac - Health Reference Center ~ Oct '89 - Oct '92   THE MATERIAL CONTAINED IN Health Reference Center ~ Oct '89 - Oct '92 IS PROVIDED   ONLY FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS   MEDICAL ADVICE OR INSTRUCTION.

I think I have a problem with the stereo sound output on my Quadra 900, but I am not totally sure because my roomate has the same problem on his PowerBook 170.  Any info or experience anyopne has would be greatly appreciated.  When I hook my Quadra up to my home stereo system, the following types of sounds (mono, as far as I can tell) all play fine through BOTH speakers:  system beeps  (already provided ones such as Indigo and ones I record)  Armor Alley Spectre Spaceward Ho!   But, the following games only play out of the left channel:  Lemmings Out of This World  (awesome game, BTW) Glider 4.0 OIDS   But still, STEREO system beeps do play in stereo, through BOTH speakers. (The one I'm specifically referrring to is Apocolyptic Beginning, which my roommate downloaded from some ftp site (sumex?))   All of the symptoms are the same on my rommates 170 (he can't run OOTW because he doesn't have color).  We're both running system 7.1    Does anyone with Lemmings or the other three games I mentioned above get sound out of both speakers on a Mac II class, Quadra, LC, PowerBook 140 or greater, Centris, SE/30, etc... (stereo) machine?  I used to have a Mac II, and I sort of rememeber Lemmings playing in stereo on that machine, not just on the left channel.  (I could be mistaken, though.  If there were a problem with the Quad 900's and PB 170's, I am wondering why the system beeps still play in stereo?  If there isn't a problem with our machines, I wonder why the 4 games above are apparantly written to support only one channel of stereo when they could just use mono sounds so the mono sound would at least come out of both speakers  (like Spectre, etc. do)?  Quadra 900's and PowerBook 170's have the same ROMS (to my knowledge), so maybe this is a ROM problem?  (if so, though, why wouldn't System 7.1 patch over this problem?)

The point is that any eugenic solution to the Jewish Problem as Elias has proposed smacks of pure Nazism.  The fact that Elias' proposal cast the entire \\\"problem\\\" as one of the abnormal presence of Israeli society in the Middle East, and that he buried a slam against U.S. aid to Israel in the midst of his \\\"even-handed\\\" solution of the Jewish Question, made it obvious what  he had in mind: disolving the Jewish polity.  That *is* a Nazi doctrine: rectification of the \\\"abnormal presence\\\" of the Jewish people within a  larger body politic.  Whether your \\\"solution\\\" involves gas, monetary  incentives to the poor Jews to marry out, or as Feisal Husseini has  said, \\\"disolve the Zionist entity by forcing it to engage the normal  surrounding Arab culture,\\\" you are engaged in a Nazi project.  Just as obvious is your statement: \\\"I will not comment on the value or lack of value of Elias's proposal.\\\"  Still striking the glancing blow, right Brendan?

Being a PhD-student at David Chaum's cryptography-group, our group has a long history in research in the field of privacy-protecting cash systems.  The report is called CS-R9323.ps.Z, contains 77 pages, and can be retrieved from  ftp.cwi.nl   (192.16.184.180)  from the directory pub/CWIreports/AA. The postscript-file is suitable for 300dpi laserprinters.  ==================================================================== ABSTRACT (from coverpage): We present a new off-line electronic cash system based on a problem, called the representation problem, of which little use has been made in literature thus far. Our system is the first to be based entirely on discrete logarithms.  Using the representation problem as a basic concept, some techniques are introduced that enable us to construct protocols for withdrawal and payment that do not use the cut and choose methodology of earlier systems. As a consequence, our cash system is much more efficient in both computation and communication complexity than any such system proposed previously.    Another important aspect of our system concerns its provability. Contrary to previously proposed systems, its correctness can be mathematically proven to a very great extent. Specifically, if we make one plausible assumption concerning a single hash-function, the ability to break the system seems to imply that one can break the Diffie-Hellman problem.     Our system offers a number of extensions that are hard to achieve in previously known systems. In our opinion the most interesting of these is that the entire cash system (including all the extensions) can be incorporated in a setting based on wallets with observers, which has the important advantage that double-spending can be prevented in the first place, rather than detecting the identity of a double-spender after the fact. In particular, it can be incorporated even under the most stringent requirements conceivable about the privacy of the user, which seems to be impossible to do with previously proposed systems. Another benefit of our system is that framing attempts by a bank have negligible probability of success (independent of computing power) by a simple mechanism from within the system, which is something that previous solutions lack entirely. Furthermore, the basic cash system can be extended to checks, multi-show cash and divisibility, while retaining its computational efficiency. ====================================================================  Cryptographers are challenged to try to break this system!    I made a particular effort to keep the report as self-contained as possible.  Nevertheless, if you have any questions, please e-mail to me and I will try to reply as good as I can. Any comments are also welcome!  Stefan Brands, \",\"          All right.  Not saying I know any more than the average salesguy, I'll give  your question a shot.   The key issue that I bought my BJ-200 on was ink drying speed.  You really  have to try awful hard to get the BJ-200 ink to smear.  The HP DeskJets need  10-15 seconds to completely dry.  In both cases, however, do not get your  pages wet.  Unlike laser printers, the material on your pages is INK, not  toner.  But that should go without saying.  My PC has very little memory (only 2Meg RAM), so the BJ-200 takes a little  while to print ----- but every application I use takes a while to run.  Once  the computer is solely printing, it purs like a kitten and puts pages out  every 15-30 seconds, depending on how detailed your graphics are.    The BJ-200 can do Windows soft fonts.  I'm assuming that the DeskJet can, or  HP wouldn't sell many......  Size is another factor.  The BJ-200 is much smaller, but the HP is built  like a tank.  I bet the BJ-200 would get damaged first.  Finally, the print quality.  I LOVE the BJ-200's resolution.  It looks like  a good laser quality print.  The HP's I've used.....they look like ink.  Not  as impressive.  \",\"you consider those I got from you to be such.  Yes, You state the reference, and then YOU claim it's a good or fair treatment.

It may not use the exact words as quoted above but I'm sure many will agree that the same message is being issued.  Later on when I get back home I will try to find the precise section(s) but you can do the research for now (I hope).  I also realize that Yasser Arafat renounced the _Covenant_ *to the Western media only* but he has yet to inform the PNC officially and enequivocally of his exact intentions on this issue.  Therefore, as far as we are concerned the _Covenant_ still stands as the \\\"Bible\\\" (so to speak) of the mainstream Palestinian National movement!    As a staunch pro-Israel activist I can confidently say that Bnai Brith has NOT influenced my opinions on the Arab-Israeli conflict.  As I mentioned above, just a little research on the subject will lead anyone to reach a similar conclusion on the Palestinian National movement (the PLO in most cases).  BB does not properly speak for me nor many of the people around me who share my views.   What 1948 situation?  A negative situation I presume?  Is this the same \\\"situation\\\" when the Jordanian occupiers of East Jerusalem would not allow the Jews to go worship at the HOLIEST SITE IN JUDIASM?  Was this an example of Qu'ranic law being exercised?  If not, I have another suggested reading for you... get into the \\\"soc.culture.arabic\\\" newsgroup where the posters have been debating the topic \\\"Jews in the Qu'ran\\\" (and may I remind you the people doing the debating appear to be devout Muslims with some knowledge of the Qu'ran). You will find that Jews aren't really viewed positively by the Qu'ran (to put it lightly).  So how do you think Jews (or any other non-Islamic religion) will be treated by an Islamic state governed by the words of the Qu'ran?  I think the 1948-1967 \\\"situation\\\" in Jerusalem will return *at best*!  What do you think?   All I have to say to that is, once again, see s.c.a - \\\"Jews in the Qu'ran\\\" and think again.  \\\"Freedom of choice\\\" is *definitely* not an option in Qu'ranic law especially for non-Muslims and ALL women!  Remember the Gulf War?  I'm sure you saw the reports about how women had few rights in Saudi Arabia (an Islamic state).   Probably nothing!  Aside from how to break the news to his Palestinian brethren that the _Covenant_ is \\\"null and void\\\" without getting assassinated himself!   In conclusion, Ahmed, you should go to the library and find the _Palestinian National Covenant (1964)_ and read it VERY CAREFULLY.  By the way, Redpath Library DOES have it in stock because that is exactly where I found it when I was doing my research.

I'm the Virtual Reality market manager for Silicon Graphics, so perhaps I can help a little.    Unfortunately, while SGI systems were used to create the special effects for both Terminator 2 and Lawnmower Man, those are film-quality computer graphics, rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time.  Each frame of computer animation for those films took hours to render on high-end parallel processing computer systems. Thus, that level of graphics would be difficult, if not impossible, to acheive in real time (30 frames per second).     It depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is. True immersive visualization (VR), requires the rendering of complex visual databases at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frames per second.  This is a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot training. If the frame rate is too low, the user notices the stepping of the frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene, so the motion of the graphics is not smooth and contiguous.  Thus the graphics system must be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex data representations.  Additionally, the frame rate must be constant.  If the system renders 15 frames per second at one point, then 60 frames per second the next (perhaps due to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was visible before), the user can get heavily distracted by the medium (the graphics computer) rather than focusing on the data. To maintain a constant frame rate, the system must be able to run in real-time.  UNIX in general does not support real-time operation, but Silicon Graphics has modified the UNIX kernel for its multi-processor systems to be able to support real-time operation, bypassing the usual UNIX process priority-management schemes.  Uniprocessor systems running UNIX cannot fundamentally support real-time operation (not Sun SPARC10, not HP 700 Series systems, not IBM RS-6000, not even SGI's uniprocessor systems like Indigo or Crimson). Only our multiprocessor Onyx and Challenge systems support real-time operation due to their Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) shared-memory architecture.  From a graphics perspective, rendering complex virtual environments requires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real-time multi-sample anti-aliasing.  Of all of the general purpose graphics systems on the market today, only Crimson RealityEngine and Onyx RealityEngine2 systems fully support these capabilities. The anti-aliasing is particularly important, as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an unfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment.    You can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to develop VR applications, but that is starting at a pretty low level. There are off-the- shelf software packages available to get you going much faster, being targeted directly at the VR application developer.

A:  In the US, currently Virgina and the District of Columbia prohibit     all usage of radar detectors.  New York prohibits their use in     large trucks.  In Canada, they are illegal in Manitoba, Ontario,     Quebec, Newfoundland and PEI (Prince Edward Island).  They     are apparently are illegal through most, if not all, of Europe.     Legislation which would make them illegal is pending in many other     jurisdictions; chances of such legislation passing varies a great deal.  Q:  Where are Radar Detector Detectors used?  Do they really work?  A:  Usage is spreading rapidly; initially they were used only in Canada,     but now they are appearing in New York and Virginia.  It is unsafe     to assume that they are not in use in Connecticut and D.C.     They work by detecting a certain frequency radiated by many currently     available super Het radar detectors; some brands of detector radiate     more strongly than others, and are thus more likely to be spotted.     New radar detectors are becoming available which may not be detected     by the current generation of detector detectors.  Note that a     detector may only be spotted by one of these devices if it is turned     on.  Q:  What is VASCAR?  Is it some kind of Radar?  A:  VASCAR is nothing more than a fancy stopwatch and time-speed-distance     computer.  It depends on the operator pressing buttons as the target     vehicle passes landmarks.  No radar signals are emitted by a VASCAR     system.  Q:  What is Ka band radar?  Where is it used?  Should a radar detector be     able to handle it?   A:  Ka band has recently been made available by the FCC for use in the US     in so-called photo-radar installations.  In these installations, a     low-powered beam is aimed across the road at a 45 degree angle to the     direction of traffic, and a picture is taken of vehicles which the     radar unit determines to have been in violation of the speed limit.     Tickets are mailed to the owner of the vehicle.  Because of the low     power and the 45 degree angle, many people believe that a radar     detector cannot give reasonable warning of a Ka band radar unit,     although some manufacturers of radar detectors have added such     capability anyway.  The number of locales where photo-radar is in use     is limited, and some question the legality of such units.  Best advice:     learn what photo radar units look like, and keep track of where they     are used (or else, don't speed.)  Q:  Do radar jammers work?  Are they legal?  A:  Quick answer:  No, and Not in the USA.     Detailed answer:  Cheap radar jammers do not work well at all.     Jammers that work are expensive and usually the property of the     military.  Jammers are a major violation of the regulations of the     Federal Communications Commission of the USA.  Driving technique and Vehicle Dynamics Questions:  Q:  What are understeer and oversteer?  A:  Understeer and oversteer are terms describing the behaviour of a     car while cornering near the `limit' (limit of adhesion, that is.)     Most drivers do not normally drive hard enough for these terms to     be descriptive of the situations they encounter.  Simply put, they     tell whether the car wants to go straight in a corner (steer `less',     or `understeer') or it wants to turn more in a corner (`oversteer'.)     Understeer is commonly designed into most production cars so that     untrained drivers, inadvertantly traveling too fast, won't get into     trouble.  Understeer may also be induced by using too much throttle     in a corner.  Oversteer is designed into some more performance     oriented cars; it may be induced by lifting on the throttle (Trailing     throttle oversteer, or TTO).  In extreme cases, lifting on the throttle     may induce so much oversteer that the car reacts by fishtailing or     spinning.      Some technical details:  in a corner at speed, the tires on the car     will develop what are called `slip angles'; the slip angle is the     angular difference between the direction that the car is traveling     and the direction that the steering wheel is directing the car to     travel.  In understeer, the front wheels have a greater slip angle     than the rear wheels.  In oversteer, the rear wheels have a greater     slip angle than the front wheels.  Q: What is a rev-matched downshift?  A: When downshifting, the engine must be rotating faster in the lower gear    than it was in the higher gear.  However, during a downshift, normally    you declutch and lift your foot from the throttle, so the revs drop    rather than increase.  In rev-matched downshift, you blip the throttle    before re-engaging the clutch so that the engine will already be up to    the new speed.  This results in a much smoother and faster downshift.  Q: What does heel-and-toe mean?  A: Heel-and-toe is a technique used to do a rev-matched downshift while    braking.  This is normally challenging, because you need the right foot    for both the brake and throttle.  It is called heel-and-toe because you    use one end of the foot on the brake, and the other on the throttle to    match revs for the downshift.  In many modern cars this is a misnomer;    often you must use the ball of the foot on the brake and the right side    on the throttle.     Note that some race car drivers will skip the clutch, and just use the    left foot on the brake and the right foot on the throttle, accomplishing    the same thing.  Q: What is double-clutch downshifting?  A: While your right foot is doing the above, your left foot can do one of    three things:  nothing, declutch once, or declutch twice.  The reason for    declutching twice is to match the speeds of the two shafts in the    transmission to the speed of the engine.  This is usually coupled with    rev-matching, so that while the engine is in neutral and the clutch    engaged, the throttle is blipped and both shafts of the transmission    speed up.     The procedure is as follows:    (0) declutch    (1) move gearshift lever to neutral    (2) engage clutch    (3) match revs    (4) declutch    (5) move gearshift lever to next lower gear    (6) engage clutch     This sounds like a lot of work, but with practice it becomes natural.    The problem that double-clutching solves is normally the function of the    synchronizers within the gearbox.  In transmissions without synchros or    with very worn synchros, double-clutching makes it much easier to shift.    Basically, if you double-clutch well, you are not using the synchros at    all.  This is generally unnecessary on street cars with synchros in good    condition.  Q: What do the numbers for acceleration from 0-60, 1/4 mile, skidpad, and    slalom times in the Auto Magazines really mean?  May they be compared?  A: In short, 1) not as much as the magazines want you to believe, and    2) almost never.     In more detail:  the acceleration numbers (0-60mph and 1/4 mile times    in the US) may be vaguely compared as long as they all come from the    same source.  Testing procedures vary so much from magazine to magazine    that comparing a Road & Track number to a Car & Driver number is quite    pointless.  Keep in mind, too, that the same variation applies from    driver to driver on the street; the driver is a major (often *the*    major) part of the equation.     Skidpads vary, and even if they didn't, skidpad figures are really    only tests of the stickiness of the stock tires; they change radically    when tire compounds change.  DO NOT make any assumptions about the    comparative handling of, say, two sports sedans based on skidpad numbers.    This is not to suggest that skidpads are without value, however. Skidpads    are an excellent educational tool at driving schools.  They are simply    of limited value in the comparison of anything except tires.     Slalom times are slightly more useful; they test some small parts of the    automobile's transient response.  However, they are also heavily influenced    by the stock rubber on the car, and they do not test many corners of the    car's envelope.  They DO NOT tell you all you need to know before making    a buying decision.  For example, they don't tell you what the rear end    of the car will do on a road which suddenly goes off-camber.  When a car    has an adjustable suspension, these tests are usually done in the `sport'    setting, which may be quite unsuitable for daily driving.  The list of    caveats could go on for page after page.  Q: My buddy claims that wide tires don't make any difference, according    to his freshman physics textbook, and that you can't ever accelerate    or corner at more than 1.0G.  Does he know what he's talking about?  A: 1) in short:  he hasn't got a clue.     2) in more detail: the equations for friction used in freshman physics    textbooks presume that the surfaces are smooth,  dry and non-deformable,    none of which properly apply to tire traction except in the case of a    stone cold tire on dry pavement which is far below its proper operating    temperature.     Pavement is _never_ smooth; it is always irregular to a greater or lesser    extent.  Tires, which are not really dry and solid (as rubber is a    substance which in its natural form is liquid, and which has only been    coerced into a semblance of solidity by chemical magic), deform to match    the surface of the pavement which a vehicle is traveling over.  In a tire    at operating temperature, grip is actually generated by shear stresses    inside the deformed rubber, and not by anything even remotely resembling    friction in the freshman physics sense of the term.  The colder a tire    is relative to its operating temperature, the closer its behaviour will    be to the traditional concept of friction; if much hotter than the its    proper operating temperature, the more likely the possibility of some    part of the tire actually ``reverting'' to liquid, which is mostly like    to happen deep in the tread, causing characteristic blisters and chunking.    (This latter, though, is almost completely unlikely to happen in normal    street driving, so unless you're a competition driver or do a lot of    high speed track driving, don't worry about it.)     Because tire traction is completely out of the domain of simple friction,    it does not obey the freshman physics equation at all; thus dragsters    accelerate at more than 1.0G and race cars corner and brake at more than    1.0G.  Because simple friction does not apply, it is actually possible    for different sized contact patches to generate differing amounts of    grip.  An actual analysis of tire behavior would require techniques    such as Finite Element Analysis, due to the complexity of the mechanism.  Misc. Questions:  Q:  What does <name or acronym> stand for?

A:  No.  Porsche is a publicly held company, controlled by the Porsche and     Piech families.  Porsche has extensive business dealings with VW/Audi,     which causes some confusion.  Since currently Porsche is in some     financial difficulty, there is a possibility that Mercedes or VW may     be interested in purchasing the company in the near future, but this     is only speculation at this time.\",\"  Computer: 286-25 mhz Bus: ISA (12.5 mhz) Drive: Maxtor 7213A (213 mb)                                      config.sys / autoexec.bat                       MS DOS 5             no           WIN 3.1                      smartdrv.sys        cache         smartdrv.exe  CORE (V 2.7)         6950 k/sec          1390 k/sec     1395 k/sec Norton SI (V 5.0)     730 k/sec           980 k/sec      982 k/sec  I'd still like to here from people with VLB-IDE.

On a serial RS-232 nine-pin port, use a female DB-9 connector and connect pins 1 to 7 to 8; 2 to 3; and 4 to 6 to 9.  For serial RS-232  25-pin ports, you'll need a female DB-25 connector with pins 1 to 7; 2 to 3; 4 to 5 to 8; 6 to 11 to 20 to 22; 15 to 17 to 23; and 18 to 25 connected.

Client Software: SunOs 4.1.1, X11R5 Server Hardware: Sun IPC Server Software: SunOs 4.1.1, Open Windows 3.0 (w/ patch 100444-37)  A Motif 1.2.2 application will periodically hang when run against the OpenWindows 3.0 server (xnews). The pulldown is displayed but then no button actions have any effect. Sometimes pressing <Return> will unstick the application but not usually. It looks like the pulldown is grabbing the focus and never letting go. Other windows on the display continue to get updated so the server isn't hanging. If I log in from another terminal and kill the Motif application then everything gets back to normal. The same application when run against other X servers (including MIT X11R5 Xsun, DecWindows, Tektronix X terminal) has no problems. This is obviously a OpenWindows problem but I need a work-around since most of our customers are OpenWindows users.  I have tried the following things:      1. Installing the latest version of the OpenWindows server patch        (100444-37).      2. Using mwm (version 1.2.2) instead of olwm.      3. Applying the patch specified in the Motif FAQ (question 110).        This had the effect of disabling the point-and-click method of        menu interaction (as opposed to the click-and-drag method), and        screwing up the menu mnemonics keys. It did seem to help, but I        was still able to get the application to hang.  Repeat By:  This is an intermittent problem so you'll have to try several times.  Click and release on a menu heading (pulldown menu will pop up)  Click and release on a menu item  Repeat until application hangs   Any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.\",\"  Well, I've provided examples to show that the trend was general, and you (or others) have provided some counterexamples, mostly ones surrounding mating practices, etc.  I don't think that these few cases are enough to disprove the general trend of natural morality.  And, again, the mating practices need to be reexamined...   No, but mating practices are a special case.  I'll have to think about it some more.   Indeed.  But, while the natural system is objective, all objective systems are not the natural one.  So, the terms can not be equated.  The natural system is a subset of the objective ones.   I don't claim that homosexuality is immoral.  It isn't harmful, although it isn't helpful either (to the mating process).  And, when you say that homosexuality is observed in the animal kingdom, don't you mean \\\"bisexuality?\\\"   This is standard jargon.  Read any textbook.  The \\\"we\\\" forms are used throughout.   That's right.  The goals themselves aren't inherent.   You could, but such would contradict observations.   But a postulate is something that is generally (or always) found to be true.  I don't think your postulate would be valid.   Yes, and I think the goals of survival and happiness *do* work.  You think they don't?  Or are they not good goals?\",\"Hi folks, ] Does anybody know for a good 32-bit C++/C compiler for OS/2 that supports OS/2 API and Microsoft windows (maybe Windows NT)?  thanx\",\" There is a widget already defined for GL.  It is the GlxMDraw (motif) or GlxDraw (athena) widget.  It is similar to a XmDrawingArea, except that it allows you to use GL calls to render into the window.  Look at glxlink, glxunlink, glxgetconfig, and glxwinset in the man pages.   The GlxMDraw widget works pretty well.  OpenGL will be an improvement.

I think I'll be saving almost $200.  Any opinions?\",\"  In the South Lebanon area, only Israeli (and SLA) and Lebanese troops  are present. Syrian troops are deployed north of the Awali river.  Between the  Awali river and the \\\"Security Zone\\\" only Lebanese troops are stationed.   That is your opinion and the opinion of the Israeli government. I agree peace guarantees would be better for all, but I am addressing the problem as it stands now.  Hopefully a comprehensive peace settlement will be concluded soon, and will include security guarantees for both sides.  My proposal was aimed at decreasing the casualties in the interim period.  In my opinion, if Israel withdraws unilaterally it would still be better off than staying. The Israeli gov't obviously agrees with you and is not willing to do such a move.  I hope to be be able to change your opinion and theirs, that's why I post to tpm.   As I explained, I contend that if Israel does withdraw unilaterally I believe no attacks would ensue against northern Israel.  I also explained why I believe that to be the case.  My suggestion is aimed at reducing the level of tension and casualties on all sides. It is unfortunate that Israel does not agree with my opinion.     That is too bad.    Because Israel is not occupying the \\\"Security Zone\\\" free of charge. It is paying the price for that.  Once Israel withdraws it may have lost a bargaining chip at the negociating table but it would save some soldiers' lives, that is my contention.    If Lebanon were willing to agree to  That is completely untrue.  Hizbollah is now a minor force in Lebanese politics.  The real heavy weights are Syria's allies.  The gov't is  supported by Syria.  The Lebanese Army is over 30,000 troops and unified like never before.  Hizbollah can have no moral justification in attacking Israel proper, especially after Israeli withdrawal. That would draw the ire of the Lebanese the Syrian and the Israeli gov'ts.  If Israel does withdraw and such an act  (Hizbolllah attacking Israel) would be akin to political and moral  suicide.  Basil\",\" how can >this possibly be fair to the infants?  What do you mean fair?  God is just, giving to everyone what they deserve. As all infants are in sin from the time of conception (cf Romans 5.12, Psalm 1.7), they cannot possibly merit heaven, and as purgatory is for the purging of temporal punishment and venial sins, it is impossible that origianl sin can be forgiven.  Hence, the unbaptized infants are cut off from the God against whom they, with the whole of the human race except Mary, have sinned.  Which is why Jesus said, \\\"Truly, truly I say to you, no one can enter the Kingdom of God unless he is born of water and Spirit\\\" which is the true meaning of born again (John 3.5).  Thus, as infants are in sin, it is very fair for them to be cut off from God and exlcuded from heaven.  As St. Augustine said, \\\"I did not invent original sin, which the Catholic faith holds from ancient time; but you, who deny it, without a doubt are a follower of a new heresy.\\\"  (De nuptiis, lib. 11.c.12)\",\"     Agressive actions are taken by both sides. Tough talk is done by both sides. When an arab leader is menacing to throw all jews in the water is also tough talk, I think. And killing people is mildly agressive (justified, in your opinion  if they are israeli soldiers, justified, in others' opinion if they are jews, not justified at all in others opinion).  When Brad wrote the article about 3 Israelis killed, ther was a lot of pride  and satisfaction in his lines. That's what I feel disgusting. We may agree  or not when a killing is 'technically' murder, but being enthousiastic about it?   And again, I may appreciate some of your points, but you are not objective. That is not a blame, just a remark. \",\"Had a deal with Jay Hayes from Deleware and was ripped off do not deal with this guy and if you know him go to his door with a bat!

Think of him as a young Dann Bilardello.  I can't begin to fathom why the Pirates have been so afraid of losing this guy, who's been in AAA most of the last 5 seasons.  The Pirates released Kirk Gibson last year because Prince was out of options, then eventually sent Prince down anyway, and he cleared waivers without a peep. He's another year older, and still can't hit; why do they think he wouldn't clear waivers now?  Why would they care?\",\" How was this trade bad? I seem to recall Ratelle and Middleton making a pretty good centre - right wing combination, and the Bruins also got Brad Park in the deal (and they also lost Vadnais and somebody else). After the trade, the  Bruins were in two finals and one semi-final, all of which, of course, they  lost to Montreal (which should please you to no end). I doubt, however, keeping Esposito would have made a difference in those series, as he did not for the Rangers in '79 (or any of his years in Boston, for that matter).

I had a BMW R100RS that was a wheelie monster! Of course it didn't have the initial power burst to just twist it into the air - I had to pop the clutch. I also had to replace front fork seals a few times as well. The fairing is a  bit heavy to be slamming down onto those little stantion tubes all the time.

From your post, you apparently find the idea that something is wrong with African Americans, value-wise, culture wise or something, very appealing. I never cease to be amazed at how eager non african americans are to embrace theories about our problems which basically assert that something is wrong with us. The socio-economic factors which we know help  to produce high crime levels, like poverty, which exists among us in large  proportion, I mean when it comes to discussion of african american problems, we somehow become exempt from all these types of factors, and the problem is  laid at the doorstep of some neboulous dysfunction we supposedly have. But  nobody attributes crime amongst white americans to dysfunction. No, that has  socioeconomic factors to it, but for africa americans, its gotta be a  dysfunction.  Basically, I think this tendency for non african americans to believe that something is wrong with us exists because non african americans don't want to deal with the possiblility that the society is deeply biased against african americans, and that this is about 80% of the problem. It could not possible be that the society is so deeply racist and structured against us, that this has a very effective negative effect on us. No, something is wrong with us. Non african americans are quick to disregard what we have to say, because they  are so busy trying to find something wrong with us, instead of taking a good  hard look at the thing we say are doing us damage.

God's love  is unconditional, unqualified, unfathomable.  We are capable of  rejecting God's love but He never fails to love us.  These verses do not show that God's love is qualified but rather that He  is opposed to evil.  I am uncomfortable with the tract in general because there seems to be  an innappropriate emphasis on Hell.  God deserves our love and worship  because of who He is.

From the union was  born Kathleen Scott  Forbes,  who  married  James  Crombie  from Aberdeen. They  had a  daughter Jane,  who married David  Littlejohn.  Their  daughter  Ruth  married William Gill. Ruth Silvia Gill, the grandmother of Lady  Diana,   married  Lord  Fermoy,   and  their daughter, Frances  Ruth Burke Roache,  married the eight Earl of Spencer, who  was the father of Lady Diana.

Anyway, the Armenians tore apart the Ottoman Empire's eastern provinces, massacred 2.5 million defenseless Turkish women, children and elderly  people, burned thousands of Turkish and Kurdish villages and exterminated  the entire Turkish population of the Armenian dictatorship between  1914-1920. Such outrageous sleight of hand that is still employed today  in Armenia brings a depth and verification to the Turkish genocide  that is hard to match. A hundred years ago Armenians again thought  they could get whatever they wanted through sheer terror like the  Russian anarchists that they accepted as role models. Several Armenian  terror groups like ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle  resorted to the same tactics in the 1980s, butchering scores of innocent Turks and their families in the United States and Europe. It seems that  they are doing it again, at a different scale, in fascist x-Soviet Armenia  today.   Source: Stanford J.

Their hope was their participation in the Russian  success would be rewarded with an independent Armenian state carved out of  Ottoman territories.

Here is my $0.02 on this and related subjects.  One is curious to know the real reasons behind this and related public relations campaign about Iran in recent months. These include:  1) Attempts to implicate Iran in the bombing of the New York Trade    Center. Despite great efforts in this direction they have not    succeeded in this. They, however, have indirectly created    the impression that Iran is behind the rise of fundamentalist    Islamic movements and thus are indirectly implicated in this matter.  2) Public statements by the Secretary of State Christoffer and    other official sources regarding Iran being a terrorist and    outlaw state.  3) And finally the recent broadcast of the Frontline program. I     suspect that this PR campaign against Iran will continue and    perhaps intensify.  Why this increased pressure on Iran? A number of factors may have been behind this. These include:  1) The rise of Islamic movements in North-Africa and radical    Hamas movement in the Israeli occupied territories. This    movement is basically anti-western and is not necessarily    fueled by Iran. The cause for accelerated pace of this     movement is probably the Gulf War which sought to return    colonial Shieks and Amirs to their throne in the name of    democracy and freedom. Also, the obvious support of Algerian    military coup against the democratically elected Algerian    Islamic Front which clearly exposed the democracy myth.    A further cause of this may be the daily broadcast of the news    on the slaughter of Bosnian Moslems.  2) Possible future implications of this movement in Saudi Arabia    and other US client states and endangerment of the cheap oil    sources from this region.  3) A need to create an enemy as an excuse for huge defense    expenditures. This has become necessary after the demise of    Soveit Union.  The recent PR campaign against Iran, however, seems to be directed from Israel rather than Washington. There is no fundamental conflict of interest between Iran and the US and in my opinion, it is in the interest of both countries to affect reestablishment of normal and friendly relations. This may have a moderating effect on the rise of radical movements within the Islamic world and Iran .\",\"Tigers' manager Sparky Anderson gets his 2,000th career win as moments ago, the Tigers completed a two game sweep over the Oakland A's at Tiger Stadium by beating the A's 3-2. Here are the highlights:       R    H   E                  Oakland  2    9   0       Detroit            3    7   1  Chad Krueter scored Skeeter Barnes from 1st with an RBI double in the  bottom of the ninth against none other than Dennis Eckersley to give the Tigers the victory.  Barnes also had an RBI single to score Thurmond to tie the score in the ninth, also off Eckersley (sp?).  The A's got their runs on an RBI single by McGwire in the 1st and a solo homer by Reuben Sierra in the 6th.  Deer doubled home Kirk Gibson in the 7th for the other Tiger run.  John Doherty pitched another strong game for the Tigers, once again lasting through the seventh inning.  He was relieved by Bolton and then David Haas in the 8th, and Haas got the win.  Bobby Witt started for the A's, and was replaced by Honeycutt in the 6th, followed by Goose Gossage in the 8th, and finally Eckersly in the 9th.  Doherty gave up both of the A's runs, while Witt gave up the first Tiger run and Eckerseley gave up the last two.  In the post game interview (on WJR radio in Detroit), Sparky Anderson said its one of the few times he's gotten emotional in his managing career.  It was a big moment for him, and I'm sure all of us Tiger fans are unanimously very happy for him.  And what a way to get number 2,000!.  Considering the circumstances, I think it might be appropriate to say:                  WOOF!      Go Tigers!\",\"Mark Singer brings up the Strawberry Incident, where he lost a homerun and the fan caught it.   Yes, I think he should have done more to get out of the way.  As much as fans want to catch a ball, they really should be aware that winning the game is more important.  As a Dodger fan, he has to be aware that this is the home stadium, and that entails helping the home team win in any way possible.  As soon as the ball was hit that far, his first instinct should be to root for Darryl to catch it, not to try to catch it himself, particularly when he is sitting that close.  I enjoy the attitude of the Wrigley fans, where they are against  visiting team home runs so much, they actually throw them back on the field.  Now, this has nothing to do with whether Darryl could have caught it or not.  Sure, he probably screwed up, but the fan should realize his first responsibility is to get out of the way and help the team win. \",\"North heavy Duty hi hat stand $45    older stand... but definately in working shape.. could  use a little clean up.  comes with clutch and felts, etc..

Apparantly the problem only occurs when TAB characters are used immediately preceding the equation frame.  The work around when equations are expected to touch the right margin is to delete at least one preceding TAB and use SPACE to align the frame (or use set frame where placed w/no text wrap around).  Unforutnately, once the page run-on has occured you are hosed. So the moral of the story is use only SPACE characters to align equation frames.

Both protests would be denied, of course.  The umpire's judgement determines the garbage thing, although I think the game should be called (but that's my personal opinion...doesn't matter).

If someone responds, I will repost it when I get it; otherwise, I will re-write it in a day or two and post it.  Sorry about that.  #8 LARRY DEPALMA  Season: 3rd Acquired: '91-92, free agent from Minnesota Grade:  I (C-/D+)  No netter/fan watching the Sharks, including me, knows where DePalma was at the end of the season; the Sharks appeared to still have his rights, but he wasn't in San Jose, he wasn't in Kansas City, and his name hasn't appeared on the waiver wire.  And that kind of invisibility was prevalent for the most part for DePalma.  After being called up October 30 against the Tampa Bay Lightning, DePalma had an excellent week, scoring 5 points in 3 games while playing good defense.  Unfortunately, the 27-year-old DePalma then disappeared the rest of the way, getting just 3 more points in 15 more games, and generally looked lethargic and uninterested on both ends of the ice.  He then was sent down to Kansas City, walked out from there, and was suspended and later reinstated when it was revealed that he was injured; he then promptly disappeared from the watching eyes of Shark Bytes (as the mailing list is now known to Sharks officials) faithful, and neither the Sharks nor we miss him.  #10 JOHAN GARPENLOV  Season: 3rd Acquired: '91-92, trade with Detroit for D Bob McGill and 8th round   pick in '92 entry draft from Vancouver Grade:  A/A-  After an early slump, Garpenlov was nothing short of inspirational the rest of the way, finishing with 66 points in 79 games, second highest total on the team, as he clicked well with team MVP Kelly Kisio and right wing Rob Gaudreau.  Kisio got most of the credit, but Garpenlov, finishing second in the MVP voting, clearly demonstrated his playmaking and scoring skills, as he was seen making excellent centering passes as well as finishing passes to him by putting the puck past opposing goaltenders, getting a club-high 14 power- play goals.  Contrary to his previous rep, Garpenlov also showed that despite his small size (5' 11\\\", 183 lbs.), he was willing to throw himself around when necessary, albeit not very successful yet.  He also still needs to work on his defense, although he improved tremendously throughout the season, and was actually quite a good penalty killer by the end of the season.  He will be a major key to the offense next year.  #15 DAVID BRUCE  Season: 5th Acquired: '91-92, from St. Louis in expansion draft Grade:  I (?)  After a banner '91-92, when he led the team in power-play goals (10) and was third in total scoring (38 points in 60 games), Bruce was bothered virtually all of this season with a groin injury, which kept him out of the lineup for all by 17 games this season.  Of course, it is difficult to speculate how well he would have done this season had he not been affected by the injury, but the 28-year-old Bruce was effective with a man up or a man short in the Sharks' first season, and was expected to be a strong offensive leader this season as well.  The injury appears serious, which is a shame, because otherwise he may have a much brighter future for now; instead, his future with the Sharks next season appears clouded.  #18 MARK PEDERSON  Season: 3rd Acquired: '92-93, trade with Philadelphia for C/LW Dave Snuggerud Grade:  I (B)  It is difficult for me to understand the Flyers' decision to unload Pederson, after a very good offensive season last season (40 points in 58 games), but after riding the pine early in the season, Pederson was summarily sent to the Sharks in exchange of the defensive-minded Snuggerud, and he finished with 41 games combined with the Flyers and the Sharks.  He was also limited by injuries this season, and this limited his production (17 points).  But when healthy, Pederson appears impressive, with a good scoring touch, good size (and the willingness to throw it around, although he's not considered a physical forward), and good speed.  He also does not appear to be a liability on defense, but the Sharks probably have to wait until next season to see how much, exactly, Pederson can do.  #20 JOHN CARTER  Season: 4th Acquired: '91-92, free agent from Boston Grade:  I (B+/B)  Carter was definitely one of the hardest workers on the team, and the hard work worked wonders, as at times he looked great on ice.  However, although he did look great at times, the fact that he received just 16 points (in 55 games) for his efforts is a sign that there is only so much his hard work can do, and the Sharks confirmed that by sending him to Kansas City with about 20 games left in the season.  Carter, who will turn 30 on May 6, always hussled, but as a result, was sometimes trapped too deep within the offensive zone while forechecking, but he was generally a credit on the defensive end, but he is probably of limited utility in that capacity, and he did not impress offensively, although he was one of the best Sharks at drawing penalties.  He is very unlikely to be back next season.  #28 JEAN-FRANCOIS QUINTIN Season: 1st Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  I (B+/B)  I don't understand why the Sharks didn't let Quintin play any more than the 14 games he played this season.  He was generally hard-working and creating opportunities offensively, and appeared, at age 23, ready for regular NHL duty, at least for a team like the Sharks, finishing with 7 points in those 14 games while not being a defensive liability.  Shoulder injury in training camp before the '91-92 season limited Quintin, the team's leading scorer in exhibition games despite sitting out the final two, to just 29 games with the Sharks and the Blades that season, but he looked impressive.  He should be a solid contender for regular duty next season.  #41 MARK BEAUFAIT  Season: 1st Acquired: 2nd round pick in 1991 supplemental draft Grade:  I (?)  After a all-star season at Kansas City, Beaufait got a cup of coffey with the Sharks late in the season when the Blades knocked down a playoff spot and the Sharks decimated with injuries, playing 5 games and scoring a goal for his only NHL point thus far.  Despite small size (5' 9\\\", 165 lbs.), Beaufait was not shy to throw himself around when necessary, and looked pretty good at times, although it's too early to judge him based on 5 NHL games, in which he played mostly left wing, away from his center position at Northern Michigan and Kansas City.  #42 JAROSLAV OTEVREL Season: 1st Acquired: 8th round pick in 1991 entry draft Grade:  I (?)  Like Beaufait, Otevrel also played away from his normal position when he was up for his cup of tea (7 games) midway through the season.  He was generally very much of a defensive liability, and did not show much offensively either, although that may be more indicative of the lack of ice time he got in those 7 games.  He may need another season to work on his defense, but once his defense is acceptable, he should be ready.  #44 MICHEL PICARD  Season: 1st Acquired: '92-93, trade with Hartford for LW Yvon Corriveau Grade:  I (B-/C+)  The 23-year-old Picard, although he perennially tore up the minors, seems to be close to being out of chances, for some reason, after being acquired by the Sharks but failing to impress the management in 25 games, scoring 4 goals for his only points, and he spent most of the rest of the way in Kansas City. He was not particularly strong defensively, and despite his offensive brilliance in the minors, he has failed thus far to score in the NHL, although he has been given limited opportunities.  He may be the Sharks' bait in the expansion draft.  #45 DODY WOOD  Season: 1st Acquired: 3rd round pick in 1991 entry draft Grade:  I (D+/D, although perhaps I shouldn't give a grade at all)  I have been accused of knocking on Wood too much. :-)  Then, it is probably no surprise to you that I am thoroughly unimpressed by Wood thus far, although 13 games is a small example.  He was generally a nonfactor on offense, was not particularly good defensively, and took too many silly penalties, losing many fights in the process and gathering 69 penalty minutes in those 13 games, projecting to to 446(!) in an 84-game season.  He's not ready, and needs at least another season at KC, where he can work on his fighting skills, if nothing else.  His relatively small size (5' 11\\\", 181 lbs.) does not give much possibility that he can survive, at this stage, as an enforcer.\",\"Anyone who knows this answer off-hand, please answer me by e-mail  quickly ;).

Whether you agree with that or not, we don't have one now, : and military experts agree that the quality of the armed forces is superior : with a volunteer army than with draftees.  Finally, the government has us : on many lists in many computers (the IRS, Social Security Admistration and : Motor Vehicle Registries to name a few) and it can find us if it needs to. : Maintaining yet another list of people is an utter waste of money and time. : Let's axe this whole department, and reduce the deficit a little bit.   More \\\"gridlock\\\" talk from another relic of the past.  The Selective Service system creates jobs and is an investment in  the future of america......and whats wrong with that?   We need jobs because at this point in the recovery, the economy should have generated 10 billion jobs and since it has not, the government has to step in and help.  Shutting down selective service would cost \\\"good jobs\\\" and we can't do that.     What we really need is to involve selective service in a more closely directed manner.  We need the selective service involved in environmental protection, high-speed rail, commuter aircraft,  civil rights, national service and health care.  Every dollar we put into selective service now will get us $10 less spending in future.   I really believe now to think about it that selective service is long-past due for the creation of a cabinet position.    Your not beyond hope, just get back on america's side and start doing your part for change.  What Bill needs from you now is support for the economic stimulus and health care reform.

For this reason, I use the \\\"factory defaults\\\" for position/size on the ATI card and adjust each mode individually (only the first time) at the monitor.

If you have corrections or answers to other frequently asked questions that you would like included in this posting, send email to leech@cs.unc.edu (Jon Leech).      If you don't want to see the FAQ, add 'Frequently Asked Questions' to your KILL file for this group (if you're not reading this with a newsreader that can kill articles by subject, you're out of luck).      The FAQ volume is excessive right now and will hopefully be trimmed down by rewriting and condensing over time. The FAQ postings are available in the Ames SPACE archive in FAQ/faq<#>.      Good summaries will be accepted in place of the answers given here. The point of this is to circulate existing information, and avoid rehashing old answers. Better to build on top than start again. Nothing more depressing than rehashing old topics for the 100th time. References are provided because they give more complete information than any short generalization.      Questions fall into three basic types:      1) Where do I find some information about space?      Try your local public library first. The net is not a good place to ask     for general information. Ask INDIVIDUALS (by email) if you must. There     are other sources, use them, too. The net is a place for open ended     discussion.      2) I have an idea which would improve space flight?      Hope you aren't surprised, but 9,999 out of 10,000 have usually been     thought of before. Again, contact a direct individual source for     evaluation. NASA fields thousands of these each day.      3) Miscellanous queries.      These are addressed on a case-by-case basis in the following series of     FAQ postings.       SUGGESTIONS FOR BETTER NETIQUETTE      Read news.announce.newusers if you're on Usenet.     Minimize cross references, [Do you REALLY NEED to?]     Edit \\\"Subject:\\\" lines, especially if you're taking a tangent.     Send mail instead, avoid posting follow ups. (1 mail message worth  100 posts).     Internet mail readers: send requests to add/drop to SPACE-REQUEST  not SPACE.     Read all available articles before posting a follow-up. (Check all  references.)     Cut down attributed articles (leave only the points you're  responding to; remove signatures and headers). Summarize!     Put a return address in the body (signature) of your message (mail  or article), state your institution, etc. Don't assume the  'reply' function of mailers will work.     Use absolute dates. Post in a timely way. Don't post what everyone  will get on TV anyway.     Some editors and window systems do character count line wrapping:  keep lines under 80 characters for those using ASCII terminals  (use carriage returns).

My suspicion is that it is draining somewhere.   Do you have any idea about what is causing this problem? Please help since my mechanic and me are clueless!...\",\" Gee!  Maybe I've misjudged you, Russell.  Anyone who agrees with something  I say can't be all bad.  ;-)  Seriously, I'm not sure whether I misjudged you or not, in one respect.   I still have a major problem, though, with your insistence that science  is mainly about avoiding mistakes.  And I still disagree with your  contention that nobody who doesn't use methods deemed \\\"scientific\\\"  can possibly know what's true and what's not.     Okay, so let's see if we agree on this: FIRST of all, there are degrees  of certainty.  It might be appropriate, for instance, to demand carefully  controlled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth (to the  extent that there is any such thing) the effectiveness of a certain  treatment. On the other hand, highly favorable clinical experience, even  if uncontrolled, can be adequate to justify a *preliminary* judgement that a treatment is useful.  This is often the best evidence we can hope for from investigators who do not have institutional or corporate support. In this case, it makes sense to tentatively treat claims as credible but to reserve final judgement until establishment scientists who are qualified and have the necessary resources can do more careful testing.  SECONDLY, it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of  evidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal.     I come to this dispute about what science is  not only as a mathematician but as a veteran of many arguments in sci.psychology (and occasionally in sci.med) about NLP (Neurolinguistic Programming).  Much of the work done to date by NLPers can be better categorized as informal exploration than as careful scientific research.  For years now I have been trying to get scientific and clinical psychologists to just take a look at it, to read a few of the books and watch some of the videotapes (courtesy of your local university library).  Not for the purpose of making a definitive judgement, but simply to look at the NLP methodology (especially the approach to eliciting information from subjects) and look for ideas and hypotheses which might be of scientific interest.  And most especially to be aware of the *questions* NLP suggests which might be worthy of scientific investigation.  Over and over again the response I get in sci.pychology is  \\\"If this hasn't been thoroughly validated by the accepted form of empirical research then it can't be of any interest to us.\\\"    To me, the ultimate reducio ad absurdum of the extreme \\\"There've got to be controlled studies\\\" position is an NLP technique called the Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure.  Simple phobias (as opposed to agoraphobia) may not be the world's most  important psychological disorder, but the nice thing about them is that  it doesn't take a sophisticated instrument to diagnose them or tell  when someone is cured of one.  The NLP phobia cure is a simple  visualization which requires less than 15 minutes.  (NLPers claim that it can also be used to neutralize a traumatic memory, and hence is useful in treating Post-traumatic Stress Syndrome.)  It is essentially a variation on the classic desensitization process used by behavioral therapists.  A subject only needs to be taken through the technique once (or, in the case of PTSD, once for each traumatic incident).  The process doesn't need to be repeated and the subject doesn't need to practice it over again at home.  Now to me, it seems pretty easy to test the effectiveness of this cure.  (Especially if, as NLPers claim, the success rate is extremely high.)   Take someone with a fear of heights (as I used to have).  Take them up  to a balcony on the 20th floor and observe their response.  Spend 15  minutes to have them do the simple visualization.  Send them back up to  the balcony and see if things have changed.  Check back with them in a  few weeks to see if the cure seems to be lasting.  (More long term  follow-up is certainly desirable, but from a scientific point of view  even a cure that lasts several weeks has significance.  In any case,  there are many known cases where the cure has lasted years.  To the best  of my knowledge, there is no known case where the cure has been reversed  after holding for a few weeks.)  (My own cure, incidentally, was done with a slightly different NLP technique, before I learned of the Fast  Phobia/Trauma Cure.  Ten years later now, I enjoy living on the 17th floor of my building and having a large balcony.)    The folks over in sci.psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to make this simple test.  They claim that only an elaborate outcome study will be satisfactory --- a study of the sort that NLP practitioners,  many of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice, can ill  afford to do.  (Most of them are also just plain not interested, because  the whole idea seems frivolous.  And since they're not part of the scientific establishment, they have no tangible rewards to gain  from scientific acceptance.)   The Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure is over ten years old now and the clinical  psychology establishment is still saying \\\"We don't have any way of  knowing that it's effective.\\\"    These academics themselves have the resources to do a study as elaborate  as anyone could want, of course, but they say  \\\"Why should I prove your  theory?\\\"  and  \\\"The burden of proof is on the one making the claim.\\\"   One academic in sci.psychology said that it would be completely  unscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn't  been described in a scientific journal.  (It's described in a number of  books and I've posted articles in sci.psychology describing it in as much  detail as I'm capable of.)    Actually, at least one fairly careful academic study has been done (with  favorable results), but it's apparently not acceptable because it's a doctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal.  To me, this sort of attitude does not advance science but hinders it.   This is the kind of thing I have in mind when I talk about \\\"doctrinnaire\\\"  attitudes about science.    Now maybe I have been unfair in imputing such attitudes to you, Russell.   If so, I apologize.    -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems  less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \",\"Misc.

Canada is in no imminent danger of being overtaken as the primary  supplier of players...Sweden, Finland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia are all relatively small countries, and cannot really produce players at a greater rate than they are already producing them, and the potential influx from the former Soviet Union is severely blunted because the system has been raided and is starved for finances and will take a decade or two, to recover and become a real threat, and the US will just maintain its slow increase.  Canada should continue to supply 60% plus of the top hockey players in the world for the forseeable future.  Besides we need the European hockey market if hockey is to take its rightful place besides soccer as the two predominant world sports...and since soccer is essentially boring, unlike hockey.   Canadians are under no threat...the European numbers will soon saturate, if they haven't already...and by the time Russia comes online again, the NHL should be a world league, and there will be many more teams to stock and many more jobs for Canadian hockey players.  In the near team, the percentage of Canadians will mostly decline because of  Americans, not because of Europeans.

If you have an obvious hernia sac coming down  into your scrotum, or a bulge in your groin that is brought about by increasing intra-abdominal pressure.... Sometimes is not that obvious. The hernia is small and you can only  detect it by putting your finger into the inguinal canal.  Whether you have a recurrent hernia, or this is related to the previous operation, I can't tell you. The person that examined you is in  the best position to make that determination.  Are there non-invasive ways of diagnosing a hernia? Every now and then  folks write about CT scans and ultrasounds for this. But these are far too expensive, and unlikely to be better than a trained examining finger.   ====================================\",\" [ description of experiment deleted ]   [ more deleted ]   A few years ago a friend and I took some 256 grey-level photos from a 1 bit Mac Plus screen using this method. Displaying all 256 levels synchronized to the 60Hz display took about 10 seconds. After experimenting with different aperture settings and screen brightnesses we found a range that worked well, giving respectable contrast. The quality of the images was pretty good. There were no visible contrast bands.  To minimize the exposure time the display program built 255 different 1 bit frames. The first contained a dot only for pixels that had value 255, the second only for pixels that had value 254, etc. These frames were stored using a sparse data structure that was very fast to 'or' onto the screen in sequence. Creating these frames sometimes took 5-10 minutes on that old Mac, but the camera shutter was closed during that time anyway. And yes, we wrote directly to the screen memory. Mea culpa.  Our biggest problem was that small images were displayed in the top left corner of the screen instead of the center. It took an extra week to have the film developed and printed, because the processors took the trouble to manually move the all images into the center of the print.

Researchers try to limit this kind of effect by  performing studies that are \\\"blind\\\" in various ways.  Some of these are:    o  The subjects of the study do not know whether they receive a       placebo or the test treatment, i.e., whether they are in the      control group or the test group.    o  Those administering the treatment do not know which subjects       receive a placebo or the test treatment.    o  Those evaluating individual results do not know which subjects      receive a placebo or the test treatment.  Obviously, at the point at which the data is analyzed, one has to  differentiate the test group from the control group.  But the analysis is quasi-public: the researcher describes it and presents the data on which it is based so that others can verify it.    It is worth noting that in biological studies where the subjects are animals, such as mice, there were many cases of skewed results because those who performed the study did not \\\"blind\\\" themselves.  It is not considered so important to make mice more ignorant than they already are, though it is important that in all respects except the one tested, the control and test groups are treated alike.\",\"My insurance company encourages annual physicals, and at my age [42] i'm thinking that BIannual physicals, at least, might be a good idea.

(There's a gripe in the industry that nuclear power uses 1900 vintage steam technology).  So it's more important in nuclear plants to get the cold end of the system as cold as possible.  Hence big cooling towers.           Oil and gas fired steam plants also have condensers, but they usually are sized to get the steam back into hot water, not most of the way down to ambient.  Some plants do cool the condensers with water, rather than air; as one Canadian official, asked about \\\"thermal  pollution\\\" de-icing a river, said, \\\"Up here, we view heat as a resource\\\".           Everybody runs closed-cycle boilers.  The water used is  purified of solids, which otherwise crud up the boiler plumbing when the water boils.

I owned a 1985 Toyota Celica GT.  I decided to buy myself a gift - a more exotic car.  Front runners included the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Porsche 924 (1987 model years). I narrowed it down to those two.  I liked the simplicity and handling (and snob appeal, too) of driving a Porsche.  The Supra Turbo was less money and had more features and performance - almost a personal luxury car.  It had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 924. I was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924, but i decided to stop by my insurance agent's office on the way.  I asked about what would happen to my rate with either car.   \\\"If you buy the Supra, your rate classification will be the same as the Celica (the '85 Celica was considered a subcompact and for that year was rated as one of the safest cars), with a slight increase because the car will be 2 years newer.  Our lower-risk division will continue to handle your account.   \\\"If you buy the Porsche 924, we'll have to change you to the standard [higher] rate company and your rate will double.  And if you go with a 944, it's another story again - we'll cover the rest of this year, but cancel you after that.\\\"   \\\"But the Supra is much faster than the 924, and the 924 is actually faster than the [standard] 944.  That doens't make sense.\\\"    That's what the book says.  We don't insure Corvettes, either.  For some reason, the underwriters consider Supras - and their drivers - as very traditional and conservative.\\\"   I eventually went with the Supra for a number of reasons.  The Porsche dealer had a nice salesman to get me interested, but a tough high-pressure guy in the back room.  At equal monthly payments, it would have taken a year longer to pay for the Porsche, plus its higher insurance.

Xavier(eXtension AV class for IntERviews) is a C++ class library that adds multimedia capability to InterViews. It allows composite multimedia objects to be built from media objects.  Specifically, it adds audio and video objects to the classes available in InterViews 3.0.1/3.1, and it does so without changing the source code for the original classes (though several configuration files for InterViews need to be changed via a patch file).    Currently, the Xavier audio classes are only supported on SUN workstations with an audio interface, such as the SPARCstation2.  Xavier has been tested in the following environments:  SUN:   Machine : SPARCserver470 SPARCstation-IPC   OS      : SUN-OS4.1.1 or later   C++     : SUN C++ ver2.1  NEC(EWS):   Machine : EWS4800/210,230   OS      : EWS-UX/V(Rel4.0) WSOS41 Release5.1,Release5.2   C++     : C++ Release3.1  It can be obtained via anonymous ftp from            interviews.stanford.edu in /pub/contrib/           (Xavier.large-demo.tar, and Xavier.tar)  We are preparing a mailing-list for information regarding Xavier.

Give a man a fishing rod, and he'll laze around fishing and never do anything.\\\"  With that in mind, I reprint (without permission, so sue me) relevant information posted some years ago on this very problem.  Note the early use of PostScript technology, predating many of this year's papers listed in the April 1st SIGGRAPH Program Announcement posted here a few days ago.  -- Eric   Intersection Between a Line and a Polygon (UNDECIDABLE??),  by Dave Baraff, Tom Duff   From: deb@charisma.graphics.cornell.edu  Newsgroups: comp.graphics  Keywords: P, NP, Jordan curve separation, Ursyhon Metrization Theorem  Organization: Program of Computer Graphics   I think that this is a very difficult problem.  To start with, lines and polygons are semi-algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of points.  Here are a few off-the-cuff ideas.  First, we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated.  Now, the Jordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into exactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions.  Thus, the line lies completely inside the polygon, the line lies completely outside the polygon, or possibly (but this will rarely happen) the line intersects the polyon.  Now, the phrasing of this question says \\\"if a line intersects a polygon\\\", so this is a decision problem.  One possibility (the decision model approach) is to reduce the question to some other (well known) problem Q, and then try to solve Q.  An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem.  In recent years, many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a new language called PostScript.  (See \\\"PostScript Language\\\", by Adobe Systems Incorporated, ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).  So, given a line L and a polygon P, we can write a PostScript program that draws the line L and the polygon P, and then \\\"outputs\\\" the answer.  By \\\"output\\\", we mean the program executes a command called \\\"showpage\\\", which actually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon.  A quick examination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q, and thus the original problem.  There are two small problems with this approach.    (1) There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into the  reduced problem Q.  So, we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of  Choice (or equivalently, Zorn's Lemma).  But the use of the Axiom of  Choice is not regarded in a very serious light these days.   (2) More importantly, the question arises as to whether or not the  PostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper; or in  other words, will it halt?   Now, PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a  Turing Machine might do; thus the halting problem (for PostScript) is  undecidable.  It is quite possible that the original problem will turn  out to be undecidable.   I won't even begin to go into other difficulties, such as aliasing, finite precision and running out of ink, paper or both.  A couple of references might be:  1. Principia Mathematica.  Newton, I.

The C Programming Language. Kernighan, B and Ritchie, D.  4. A Tale of Two Cities. Dickens, C.  --------  From: td@alice.UUCP (Tom Duff) Summary: Overkill. Organization: AT&T Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill NJ  The situation is not nearly as bleak as Baraff suggests (he should know better, he's hung around The Labs for long enough).  By the well known Dobbin-Dullman reduction (see J. Dullman & D. Dobbin, J. Comp. Obfusc. 37,ii:  pp. 33-947, lemma 17(a)) line-polygon intersection can be reduced to Hamiltonian Circuit, without(!) the use of Grobner bases, so LPI (to coin an acronym) is probably only NP-complete.  Besides, Turing-completeness will no longer be a problem once our Cray-3 is delivered, since it will be able to complete an infinite loop in 4 milliseconds (with scatter-gather.)  --------  From: deb@svax.cs.cornell.edu (David Baraff)  Well, sure its no worse than NP-complete, but that's ONLY if you restrict yourself to the case where the line satisfies a Lipschitz condition on its second derivative.  (I think there's an '89 SIGGRAPH paper from Caltech that deals with this).  --\",\"  First of all, I resent your assumption that you know why I am threatened by science, or even that I am threatened at all, although I admit the latter.  The reason I am threatened by Science has nothing to do with my need for proof of my Lord's existence-- God reveals Himself in many ways, including, to some degree, Science.   My problem with Science is that often it allows us to assume we know what is best for ourselves.  God endowed us with the ability to produce life through sexual relations, for example, but He did not make that availible to everyone. Does that mean that if Science can over-ride God's decision through alterations, that God wills for us to have the power to decide who should and should not be able to have  children?  Should men be allowed to have babies, if that is made possible.   People have always had the ability to end lives unnaturally, and soon may have the ability to bring lives into the world unnaturally.  The closest thing to artificially created life is artificially created death, and as God has reserved judgement about when people should die to Himself, I believe we should rely on God's wisdom about how people should be brought in to the world.   This is not to say that I reject all forms of medical treatment, however.  Treatment that alleviates pain, or prevents pain from occuring, is perfectly acceptable, I believe, as it was acceptable for Jesus to cure the sick.  However, treatment that merely  prolongs life for no reason, or makes unnecessary  alterations to the body for mere aesthetic purposes,   go too far.  Are we not happy with the beauty God gave us?   I cannot draw a solid line regarding where I would approve of Scientific study, and where I would not, but I will say this:  Before one experiments with the universe to find out all its secrets, one should ask why they want this knowledge.  Before one alters the body they have been given, they should ask themseles why their body is not satisfactory too them as it is.  I cannot make any general rules that will cover all the cases, but I will say that each person should pray for guidance when trying to unravel the mysteries of the universe, and should cease their unravelling if they have reason to  believe their search is displeasing to God.\",\" Where were you brought up?

I own a turbocharged one, and I would never buy a turbocharged vehicle unless I knew the owner and his/her driving/maintenance habits.   I have been wondering about that myself.  The '90 AWD models and the '91s were identical (except for the ABS option).     Yes.  Some owners had problems with the transaxles.  Using synthetic lubricants in the transaxles solved the problem in most cases.  The problem was not unique to the AWDs, however.  It was common to all models.  The Galant VR4 and GSX had the same transaxle, but I didn't see those listed in CR.   I don't know of any major complaints in this area, except that the battery that was installed at the factory had a low current rating.    The first FWD models (those built before May 1989) were recalled for brake upgrades.  Some FWD and AWD owners had problems with warped rotors.  Those of us who insist on using manual torque wrenches every time the lug nuts are tightened have never had a problem.   I can refer you to someone who has gone through a set of pads in one day!  It all depends on how you drive.  It seems that most owners have been getting between 40-70k on a set of pads.

This is very typical of the elitist Liberal attitude that The People  are incapable of thinking for themselves.  This elitist attitude will be the eventual undoing of the arrogant liberal tide sweeping America, as The People begin to realize more and more that they are being treated like errant children and robbed of their freedoms by a bunch of Utopian arrogent socialist jerks.         Although I find myself often disagreeing with the populist rationale of Mr. Limbaugh, I find him entertaining and I often agree with his  conclusions.  The fact that he sends liberal reactionaries like these idiots through the roof makes him all the more entertaining.     Actually, I find Limbaugh's oratory less than sizzling and his debating skills sometimes lacking, even though his conclusions are often correct.  I would suggest that a bankrupt leftist ideology that hopes to use concentrated  political power and a loaded gun to force everyone to do the \\\"right\\\" things (where \\\"right\\\" is defined by the elitist academics who lead the movement) is showing an acute case of \\\"myopic social perspective\\\", not to mention arrogance and utter stupidity.  Limbaugh is certainly far from perfect, but his opponents in the established body politic and the media are the ones arguing for Federal control of virtually all aspects of the lives of the Citizenry, and for the elimination of local control over Affairs Public.    Perhaps Limbaugh has a following because The People are tired of being treated  like errant children by a self-important group of arrogant controlling myopic  people who have no understanding of how life operates outside of the \\\"oughta-be's\\\" inside their own hopelessly closed minds.     OK, let us take your word for that and work with it.  A nice specific incident.     Hmmm, \\\"Congress shall pass no law regarding an establishment of religion, nor prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\\\"  Liberal translation: \\\"the federal government (as long as it is run by Liberals) may force local school districts to include certain iconic content in Christmas displays, while prohibiting others.\\\"  I think Limbaugh has you on this one.  It seems to me that he is arguing for LESS imposition of the federal government into religion.  Nice job on the specificity of that one, too.    [Analysis of historical/modern communication media deleted]    Ah yes, it is a conspiracy of profound proportions.  Methinks that you may be a bit resentful of Mr. Limbaugh's success because you attribute it primarily to luck (how, after all, could anyone with profound differences of opinion from yourself have become successful without the operation of conspiracy or blind luck!)  Do you feel this same level of knee-jerk resentment against lottery winners, or do you congratulate them on their good fortune?     This should be great fun, since it is the Liberal movement in America that is pushing the hardest for centralized fascist control of The People and business (government/business 'partnership' indeed), and Mr. Limbaugh  is the populist nemesis of that movement.  I have read Mr. Limbaugh's book, and although it was not the most literary piece I have read in recent memory it certainly did not contain \\\"venom\\\" at all, let alone \\\"venom\\\" comparable to an individual who callously murdered millions out of racism.     A very serious tone in that oratory.     You neglect to mention that Mr. Limbaugh (have you ever listened to his show,  BTW?) continuously encourages his audience to think for themselves rather than blindly following any media icon, himself included.  You yourself mention  that he makes no bones about his show being strictly about his own opinions. He also adopts a rather satirical approach, and presumes his audience to be intelligent enough to distinguish satire from seriousness (and he says as much). This is in contrast to the average mass-media show, in which the audience is treated as society's intellectual lowest common denominator.  I am sure that Adolf Hitler was a master of satire; I am sure he was just kidding when he said that the Jews were the cause of Germany's problems and needed to be exterminated.     This is not religion, it is clearly a perverse worship of race.  Since Christ was a Jew, it seems quite unlikely that Hitler's characterization of the Aryan as \\\"the highest image of the Lord\\\" fits with Christian doctrine.     Private religious schools have a vastly better record of success than publicly funded schools.  American history is indeed primarily Judeo- Christian.  I suppose that Mr. Limbaugh pointing out facts is equivalent to Adolf Hitler worshiping the Aryan race.  I think you might be reaching just a wee bit here.     Definite suggestion that the government should control the entertainment industry here.    Just a guess here, but I don't think that Mr. Limbaugh would advocate government control of Hollywood.  You should perhaps call his radio show to confirm this.  I believe this is more a criticism of Hollywood and the depraved moral values it espouses, not an advocation of government control  of Hollywood.  90's Liberals, on the other hand, want to have complete government control  of our school systems, so that the government can teach The People at an early age the \\\"right\\\" way to view religion and morality.  I believe Mr.  Limbaugh is against this, as his satirical use of the \\\"young heads full of mush\\\" hyperbole indicates.     Pretty strong conspiracy theory insinuated here, with an implicit plea for government power to be used to break up the conspiracy.     Indication here that \\\"Elements of the Media\\\" (since career is a self-selected categorization, perhaps an inferred 'larger percentage than represented in the populace at large') has a leftist bias.  Doesn't sound too unreasonable. No insinuation that CNN should not report in an objective fashion, only that for reporters to say that they do not have any personal bias in the situation is disingenuous to megalomaniacal.  You may disagree, and it may well be exagerrated, but it is not an unreasonable  opinion; and Mr. Limbaugh goes well out of his way to make sure that his  audience knows that these are his opinions, unlike most other reporting that  purports to achieve perfect objectivity but in actuality will in some degree  or other, in a statistical sense, reflect the biases of the reporters.  Who  is being disingenuous here, Mr. Shaw or Mr. Limbaugh?  Again, you should ask Mr. Limbaugh himself, but I expect that he would oppose government control of the media.              It is indeed depressing to see such myopia and tiresome Liberal arrogance. Liberals love to play games with paradigms as a way of discrediting people who disagree with them.  Why don't you challenge conservative ideology on an intellectual level rather than engaging in ludicrous comparisons? Perhaps the underpinnings of your ideology are intellectual only in that they exist in your mind, not the real world.     Perhaps there are a few among the intellectually challenged who percieve Rush Limbaugh as a hate-monger, but in my experience he has been spreading laughter at the ludicrous self-importance of the Left, not hatred.  As to Mr. Bush, you may be correct about his fascist economic leanings. Mr. Reagan, on the other hand, did his best to reverse the fascist trend of government involvement in business.  Mr. Clinton is increasing fascism in America through \\\"business/government partnership\\\" and increased levels of taxation.  Perhaps you should not have skipped your vocabulary classes in grade school.     Hmmm.  Seems to me that Limbaugh is not in any way comparable to Hitler because he has not murdered six million Jews and many, many others out of racism.  I come from a mixed-race family, so I am quite well attuned to racism; I don't hear any coming from Rush Limbaugh.  The only place I hear  racism coming from these days and being taken seriously is from the Liberal  Left.  The Liberal Left is the movement I see trying to get America hooked on the opiates of Socialized Medicine, Socialized Transportation, Socialized Education, etc.  The Left already has America hopelessly addicted to  that Liberal drug, the Social Security Chain Letter.  It is quite clear to me that while the Hitler analogy does not really apply to either Rush  Limbaugh or William Jefferson Clinton, if one of the two is closer than  the other it is clearly the Fascist Clinton.

For example, incorrect English constructs such as \\\"its raining\\\" or \\\"it's window id\\\" annoy me. However, there comes a time when popular usage starts to dictate the way things really are in the world. Indeed, the fact that X won out over NeWS was really down to popular opinion (I know, we all think it's(!) technically superior as well!).  On a related topic, who is to say that \\\"color\\\" is more or less correct than \\\"colour\\\" - being Irish, and hence using English English as opposed to American English, I always use the latter except, of course, for API terms such as \\\"XAllocColor\\\" and \\\"colormap\\\".  In a world that uses the term \\\"Windows\\\" to refer to Microsoft Windows, perhaps the time has come to accept \\\"X Windows\\\" as a valid term for X. I think that this is a more concise and uncluttered term than, say, \\\"the X Window System\\\" and, let's face it, almost everyone uses it. Ultimately, we all need product sales to more than just X-literate people. In this respect, product recognition is important and a short, snappy, descriptive title (\\\"X\\\" is positively obscure) will help when dealing with the average punter (it's sad - I thought I was a software engineer!). Indeed it is unfortunate that X did not become popularly known as Windows and let MS worry about whether it should be called \\\"Microsoft Windows\\\" or \\\"the Microsoft Window System\\\" or how about just plain \\\"Microsoft\\\"!  To summarise (or should that be \\\"summarize\\\") the point of this message: I think there are far more pressing issues facing the X community than worrying about subtle distinctions in the naming of the window system (or should that be \\\"windowing system\\\"). Whatever gets recognised is fine by me. I agree that one should be careful in interpreting what trade papers say. However, I would be reluctant to come to this conclusion purely on the basis of how they name the X Window System. \",\"+ +I know of no law, either on the books or proposed, that bans motorcycles +from any place that i want to go to.

Therefore there would be no way of detecting a radar detector any more than there would be of detecting whether some one had a radio in their car.  \",\"  As you point out, the experiments would be difficult. But we know enough about the physics of the situation to do some calculations. There are in fact three effects contributing to leaning the bike over to begin a turn.   1. Gyro effect causing a torque which twists the bike over.   2. Contact patch having shifted to one side, causing bike to fall over.   3. Contact patch being accelerated to the side, causing a  torque which twists the bike over.  Take an average bike/rider, average bike wheel, and at speeds of 5, 15, and 50 mph (say) calculate how much twist of the bars would be needed to produce (say) 20 degrees of lean in (say) 2 seconds by each effect alone. My guess is that at slow speeds 2 is dominant, and at high speeds 3 is dominant, and at all speeds 1 contributes not far off bugger all, relatively speaking.  By the way, a similar problem is this: how does a runner who wants to run round a corner get leaned into the corner fast? Is there a running group where we could start \\\"counter-footing\\\" arguments and have them all falling over as they tried to work out how they go round corners?\",\"  Perhaps it was Trottier.  It happened behind the Habs goal if I recall. Gainey simply didn't have his head up as he was picking up the puck.   If Gilmour was taken completely by surprise, as Gainey was, then yeah, I would have to say that Doug wasn't playing \\\"technically\\\" smart  hockey.  In any case, to claim as Greg did, that Gainey *never* made  a technical mistake is absolutely ludicrous.   Good for you.  You'd only be displaying your ignorance of course, but to  each his own...   I think Gainey should feel honoured to know that he is remembered at  all.   Certainly pluggers are an integral part of any team.  And that is simply because there are not enough solid two-way players to go  around.  Who would you rather have as your \\\"checking\\\" centre?  Doug Gilmour or Doug Jarvis?  For that matter I would take either Gretzky or Mario as my \\\"checking\\\" centres.  Do you think Gretzky could cover Bob Gainey?    You're wrong again.  The Selke is awarded to the forward that does the best job defensively and this may or may not be the best plugger.  If  Gilmour does the best defensive job in the league I don't see why he  should be out of the running simply because he also contributes offen- sively.  Settle down?

I don't know how much the teaching of countersteering in the beginner course really helps the tuchus steerers. I was one, I guess that I always steered a bicycle that way, and I only got the hang of countersteering in normal riding *after* the course. I could do the countersteering swerves in the course no problem, but I only started using it in my normal riding when I decided that my turning at speed (off-ramps and the like) was a lot more difficult that it should have been. I knew how it works (although that's currently up for debate) definitely knew *that* it works, as I could do it in swerves, but only figured it out later in my normal riding. Just a data point. I think that it's not a bad idea to bring the idea up, but it's best to let everyone tuchus-steer for the first lesson or two, so they can learn to shift gears before they have to worry about proper handlebar technique.   I have. In our beginner course we had passenger training. Sometime during the lesson the instructor would hop on the back of the bike, and the student would take him for a ride. If the student did not give the instructor the \\\"you are a sack of potatoes\\\" passenger speech, the instructor would steer the bike and make a general nuisance of himself.

The NEC is sharper, flatter, less distorted, and more stable.  I have heard  complaints from people about the NEC FG series having some quality control  problems but mine has been in use for about a year with no problems at all.  There was nothing really broken with the Viewsonic but overall it did not  match up.  I used my ATI Graphics Ultra in setup mode to push the  frequencies to their limits and the Viewsonic exhibited some problems that  the NEC did not.  I personally like the non-etched NEC with the OCLI filter  and the tube on the 17 was not as nice.  The 17 had some uncorrectable  pincusion and edge distortion problems.  Also, it would change brightness  when I switched modes and I was constantly having to fiddle with the  controls.  And the yoke was crooked and I had no way to compensate for the  raster that tilted downhill.  On the postive side, although not as handsome  as the NEC, the 17 had a smaller footprint and was not as heavy.  I have heard that Panasonic owns Viewsonic and the model 17 is being sold  through OEM channels with a Panasonic label on it.  If it's available that  way at a lower cost I could get more serious about it.  For now the NEC has  my vote but I'm searching for one of the new, cheaper, NEC 5FGe's to see if  it's just as good as its older brother the 5FG before I decide which one to  buy.

I can never keep the Nanao models  straight and don't have any place I can walk in to get a good comparison of  all models.  --   Standard employer disclaimers apply   \",\"Perhaps one way of getting away from this cripple chip that the U.S. government seems to be pushing would be to come up with a good alternative. For example, how about a scheme using RSA, and some hybrid of DES-CFB and another strong stream cipher (Maybe IDEA-CFB)?  This could be substantially the same as the cripple chip, except that instead of key-registration, the police could demand that you give up your secret key to them (with a court- issued warrant).  Then, they could read the last few months of wiretapped messages you've sent, and assuming you've committed no crimes, you could generate a new key pair and go about your business.  I find that I'd be willing to pay RSA for the right to use such a system, especially given the alternative.  If you were unwilling to give up your secret key, then you'd probably stay in jail (has anyone got a real legal precedent for this?).    This would allow court-issued warrants to be used to gather information on suspected criminals, but it couldn't be done in secrecy, and there would be enormously less likelihood of corruption or theft of escrowed keys.

Astacio pitched ok, but had control trouble all night. In the first, he walked a batter, balked him to second, then a single scored the run, with the batter taking second on the throw home.  Another single made the score 2-0 Cards.   Lasorda tried a new line up featuring Butler, Reed, And Piazza batting third!  Darryl and Eric were benched in favor of Snyder and Webster.   Piazza homered in the first to make the score 2-1 Cards. The Dodgers tied the game in the second on a two out single by Offerman.   By the fourth inning, Astacio had already made about 80 pitches, but the score was still 2-2.  The Dodger defense made SEVERAL impressive plays.  Piazza looked GREAT behind the plate, gunning down a runner trying to steal second, throwing a runner out at first who had strayed a bit from first base, etc.   Karros also made a spectacular play, keeping a ball from going into the outfield.  The runner on first was so sure that ball was going through, he just kept running past second.  Karros got up and threw to third and EASILY got the runner at third.   My heart sank in the 7th when Gross got up to warm up in the bullpen.   Astacio was lifted for a pinch hitter, and when Gross entered the game with the score still 2-2, Dodger fans just KNEW it was over.   Gross was relieving because he stunk on Tuesday, pitching just 2 1/3 innings, forcing Lasorda to use much of his bullpen.  The 15 inning game had the same effect the next night...so only Gross was fresh given his light work out Tuesday.   Gross lived up to his name.  He walked the first batter, gave up a hit to the second, and walked the bases loaded.  After a grounder resulted in a force at home, Zeile lifted a scoring fly ball to make it 3-2 Cards.  Gross paid little attention to the runners, and the next thing you knew, the Cards had stolen a fourth run.  The runner on first was eventually tagged out in the run down, but the 4th run had scored long before that.   Meanwhile, the Dodgers mounted little offense after the second inning. Lee Smith pitched the ninth.  He had little trouble getting Karros and Wallach (does anyone have trouble with Wallach these days?). Cory Snyder collected his first hit as a Dodger, a single, but that was all the offense the Dodgers could mount.  Smith got his third straight save against the Dodgers and all I got was my free Dodger cap and a good look at Piazza.  If Piazza keeps this up all year, he will be a strong candidate for rookie of the year honors.  Though its really early, Karros is already showing signs of a sophomore jinx year.   The final score...Cardinals 4 runs on 7 hits. Dodgers 2 runs on 7 hits.\",\"Hi I am a Sociology student and I am currently researching into  young offenders.

Considering all the murders of innocent Israelis at the hands      of Arab death merchants, I see nothing wrong with the advice.       As usual, the bias of the 'Center for Policy Research' echoes     through this newsgroup.  Here we have an enraged Likudnik who     is venting his spleen, and you portray it as if this is going     to become policy.  You don't say what the response to Matza's     suggestion was.  Do do not mention whether he was refering to     terrorists caught in the act, which could be a clear cut case     of self-defence.  Would you care to elaborate on this, or was     this all you wanted to say on the matter.  Why don't you give     up this 'Center for Policy Research' crap, and just post your       biases without trying to legitimize them with a pompous name?       A laudable precaution.

The     absurdity of your respectable name cannot hide your bias.      In your effort to portray Israel in an unfavorable light, you      have accomplished nothing, except to prove that a respectable      sounding label like the Center for Policy Research is nothing      but a smoke screen for someone with a heavily biased attitude      against Israel and the need to vent it.  You \",\"Hi.  I am working on a project for my marketing class and I'd like to ask your help.  The assignment is to come up with a product and create a marketing plan for it.  Technical issues are not terribly important at this point.  Well, my group's plan is to market a \\\"full page\\\" monitor for laptop computers.  It would be a third-party product to be installed by authorized repair centers (like Newer Technology's PaletteBook screen).  The idea is that the screen would fold in such a way that you would get twice the screen height of a normal screen (remember, technical issues aside!).  In fact, by adjusting the fold of the screen and the monitor configuration, you could have regular OR \\\"full\\\" height.  The screen would probably be monochrome. The motivation behind this is that laptop computers seem to be very popular among business people.  Business people also commonly use word processing and spreadsheet applications for which it is very convenient to see a large portion of the document.  Because of the target users and applications, color screens aren't really a neccessity.  We could hopefully keep the cost between $2000 and $3000.  Now, please don't write this off as completely ridiculous.  I really need some constructive feedback.  So, if you would, please reply to me via email and let me know: 1. If you would consider buying a \\\"full page\\\" laptop screen 2. How much you would be willing to pay for it 3. Any helpful commentaries on the idea  Also, if you take this idea and make a lot of money off it (doubtful, but who knows!), please send me some.  Thanks in advance!!!\",\" I apologize to the moderator, but the first quote was deleted and I would like to respond to both.  As for the \\\"goal we can never achieve\\\", the reward comes from the trying.  Paul makes a clear claim that we are to continue straining for the prize over in Philippians 3:10-16.  Only by not living out the commands do we stagnate and become lukewarm, to be spit out by Jesus. As it says in 1 John 5:3:  \\\"This is love for God:  to obey his comands.\\\" That obedience is our straining to achieve for God.  Of course, this requires work on our part.  As for the quote in James, Satan doesn't care what we believe.  What matters is the results of our belief (works).  If one truly has faith in what one believes, one will either act on that faith or be lying to oneself about believing in the first place.    Stan, as for your first line, you have a very good point.  Obedience by obligation (grudgery) is not what God desires.  Instead, look at how many times the Bible talks about being joyous in all situations and when doing God's work.  Being begrudged by the work has no value.  Also, we should do the work necessary whenever we can, not just when we feel Jesus' presence.  Feelings can deceive us.  However, as Paul states to Timothy in 2 Timothy 4:2:  \\\"Preach the Word; be prepared in season and out of season; correct, rebuke and encourage--with great patience and careful instruction.\\\"  Also, remember that Paul tells Timothy in 1 Timothy 4:16:  \\\"Watch your life and doctrine closely.  Persevere in them, because if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers.\\\" So, in order to do the work necessary, we need to be sure that we are correct first.  Remember Jesus' warning in Matthew 7:3-5 not to be hypocritical about what we do.  The best way to accomplish this is to be a disciple completely in both thought and deed.  \",\"Thanks to whoever posted this wonderful parody of people who post without  reading the FAQ!

Thanks,\",\"THE HAMAS WAY of DEATH        (Following is a transcript of a recruitment and training videotape made last summer by the Qassam Battalions, the military arm of Hamas, an Islamic Palestinian group. Hamas figures significantly in the Middle East equation. In December, Israel deported more than 400 Palestinians to Lebanon in response to Hamas's kidnapping and execution of an Israeli soldier. A longer version appears in the May issue of Harper's Magazine, which obtained and translated the tape.)        My name is Yasir Hammad al-Hassan Ali. I live in Nuseirat [a refugee camp in the Gaza Strip]. I was born in 1964. I finished high school, then attended Gaza Polytechnic. Later, I went to work for Islamic University in Gaza as a clerk. I'm married and I have two daughters.      The Qassam Battalions are the only group in Palestine explicitly dedicated to jihad [holy war]. Our primary concern is Palestinians who collaborate with the enemy. Many young men and women have fallen prey to the cunning traps laid by the [Israeli] Security Services.      Since our enemies are trying to obliterate our nation, cooperation with them is clearly a terrible crime. Our most important objective must be to put an end to the plague of collaboration. To do so, we abduct collaborators, intimidate and interrogate them in order to uncover other collaborators and expose the methods that the enemy uses to lure Palestinians into collaboration in the first place. In addition to that, naturally, we confront the problem of collaborators by executing them.      We don't execute every collaborator. After all, about 70 percent of them are innocent victims, tricked or black-mailed into their misdeeds. The decision whether to execute a collaborator is based on the seriousness of his crimes. If, like many collaborators, he has been recruited as an agent of the Israeli Border Guard then it is imperative that he be executed at once. He's as dangerous as an Israeli soldier, so we treat him like an Israeli soldier.      There's another group of collaborators who perform an even more loathsome role -- the ones who help the enemy trap young men and women in blackmail schemes that force them to become collaborators. I regard the \\\"isqat\\\" [the process by which a Palestinians is blackmailed into collaboration] of single person as greater crime than the killing of a demonstrator. If someone is guilty of causing repeated cases of isqat, than it is our religious duty to execute him.      A third group of collaborators is responsible for the distribution of narcotics. They work on direct orders from the Security Services to distribute drugs as widely as possible. Their victims become addicted and soon find it unbearable to quit and impossible to afford more. They collaborate in order to get the drugs they crave. The dealers must also be executed.      In the battalions, we have developed a very careful method of uncovering collaborators, We can't afford to abduct an innocent person, because once we seize a person his reputation is tarnished forever. We will abduct and interrogate a collaborator only after evidence of his guilt has been established -- never before. If after interrogation the collaborator is found guilty beyond any doubt, then he is executed.      In many cases, we don't have to make our evidence against collaborators public, because everyone knows that they're guilty. But when the public isn't aware that a certain individual is a collaborator, and we accuse him, people are bound to ask for evidence. Many people will proclaim his innocence, so there must be irrefutable proof before he is executed. This proof is usually obtained in the form of a confession.      At first, every collaborator denies his crimes. So we start off by showing the collaborator the testimony against him. We tell him that he still has a chance to serve his people, even in the last moment of his life, by confessing and giving us the information we need.      We say that we know his repentance in sincere and that he has been a victim. That kind of talk is convincing. Most of them confess after that. Others hold out; in those cases, we apply pressure, both psychological and physical. Then the holdouts confess as well.      Only one collaborator has ever been executed without an interrogation. In that case, the collaborator had been seen working for the Border Guard since before the intifada, and he himself confessed his involvement to a friend, who disclosed the information to us. In addition, three members of his network of collaborators told us that he had caused their isqat. With this much evidence, there was no need to interrogate him. But we are very careful to avoid wrongful executions. In every case, our principal is the same: the accused should be interrogated until he himself confesses his crimes.       A few weeks ago, we sat down and complied a list of collaborators to decide whether there were any who could be executed without interrogation. An although we had hundreds of names, still, because of our fear of God and of hell, we could not mark any of these men, except for the one I just mentioned, for execution.      When we execute a collaborator in public, we use a gun. But after we abduct and interrogate a collaborator, we can't shoot him -- to do so might give away our locations. That's why collaborators are strangled. Sometimes we ask the collaborator, \\\"What do you think? How should we execute you?\\\" One collaborator told us, \\\"Strangle me.\\\" He hated the sight of blood. \",\" I remember one he hit circa 1976 at Wrigley Field that went across the street (in dead center field) and hit a house on the roof.

BACKGROUND  ----------   The racing listserver (boogie.EBay.sun.com) contains discussions   devoted to racing and racing-related topics. This is a pretty broad   interest group. Individuals have a variety of backgrounds: motojournalism,   roadracing from the perspective of pit crew and racers, engineering,  motosports enthusiasts.   The size of the list grows weekly. We are currently at a little  over one hundred and eighty-five members, with contributors from  New Zealand, Australia, Germany, France, England, Canada  Finland, Switzerland, and the United States.   The list was formed (October 1991) in response to a perceived need   to both provide technical discussion of riding at the edge of   performance (roadracing) and to improve on the very low signal-to-noise   ratio found in rec.motorcycles. Anyone is free to join.   Discussion is necessarily limited by the rules of the list to   issues related to racing motorcycles and is to be \\\"flame-free\\\".     HOW TO GET THE DAILY DISTRIBUTION  ---------------------------------   You are welcome to subscribe. To subscribe send your request to:           race-request@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM    Traffic currently runs between five and twenty-five messages per day  (depending on the topic).      NB: Please do _not_ send your subscription request to the        list directly.    After you have contacted the list administrator, you will receive  an RSVP request. Please respond to this request in a timely manner  so that you can be added to the list. The request is generated in  order to insure that there is a valid mail pathway to your site.    Upon receipt of your RSVP, you will be added to either the daily  or digest distribution (as per your initial request).   HOW TO GET THE DIGEST DISTRIBUTION  ----------------------------------   It is possible to receive the list in 'digest'ed form (ie. a  single email message). The RoadRacing Digest is mailed out   whenever it contains enough interesting content. Given the  frequency of postings this appears to be about every other  day.   Should you wish to receive the list via digest (once every   30-40K or so), please send a subscription request to:           digest-request@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM    HOW TO POST TO THE LIST  -----------------------   This is an open forum. To post an article to the list, send to:           race@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM    Depending on how mail is set up at your site you may or may  not see the mail that you have posted. If you want to see it  (though this isn't necessarily a guarantee that it went out)  you can include a \\\"metoo\\\" line in your .mailrc file (on UNIX  based mail systems).    BOUNCES  -------   Because I haven't had the time (or the inclination to replace  the list distribution mechanism) we still have a problem with  bounces returning to the poster of a message. Occasionally,  sites or users go off-line (either leaving their place of  employment prematurely or hardware problems) and you will receive  bounces from the race list. Check the headers carefully, and  if you find that the bounce originated at Sun (from whence I  administer this list) contact me through my administration  hat (race-request@boogie.EBay.sun.com).

In fact, it is often chosen (besides its other merits) because it shoots like a revolver does basically.  It can limit the training time (read budget $$$) due to the fact there are no 'external' safties other than the trigger, hence less training time required.    Smith & Wesson (among other types) are chosen due to the fact taht they do have the external safties (hammer drop,as well as mag drop) which if properly used have saved many lives when 'Mr. Bad' snatched the gun from the officer and tried to shoot said officer the gun was on safe and would not fire.  This point had been made in many articles in various  gun magazines.  If fact, one author (can't remember who) staged a little test where he had a revolver and a S&W on safe laying on a table and asked people with little firearms experience to on his signal, grab the gun and shoot a target.  He timed the people using each gun.  The revolver times were pretty close, but some of the times with the S&W were in minutes, or the person just gave up because they could not figure out the saftey.   You don't often see Colt 45 autos issued due to the light trigger which can be accidentally fired in a stress situation, opening the issuing city,county, etc.. to lawsuits, bad press, etc..   Of course any problem can be overcome with enough training, but such training is not always available to budget crunched departments.  I know if I were a Cop I would want something like a S&W just for the off chance of the gun getting taken away.  The safety doesn't guarantee that 'Mr. Bad' won't figure it out and shoot me, but it could buy enough time to draw a second gun and shoot 'Mr. Bad' before it's too late.   Don't think I am too biassed here just because I have had 3 Glocks in my possession at one time, because I have had a .45 as well.  In fact, it was my first handgun.  Remember, the ultimate 'safety' is YOU the operator, and no safety is going to stop an negligent discharge (note I don't say accidental) if you break the rules of gun handling.   As per the part of being light weight and looking cool, I agree 100%.  I wouldn't rule it out as a first purchase.  \",\"Hi All  Hope you all had a Blessed Easter.

Or are we all of a sudden going to draw parallels to Nazi Germany and Communist Russia?  The point of the matter is that; yes this is a serious problem.  But it is not the end of the world.  Guess what?  We're doing something now you can't do in a Communist country or Nazi Germany.  We're complaining about it, (or rather, you're complaining about it) and nobody is shooting at us.    (Or, rather, if they're shooting at me, they have real bad aim.  (:-) )  GUESS WHAT PEOPLE?  You live in one of the few countries in the world where a person can complain without getting shot at.    People are always complaining that somebody did this wrong, or somebody did that wrong, or whatever.  Sit down and figure out two things:  1)  What have they done right? 2)  How much worse can it get?  And you'll find that you and I, are pretty damn lucky.  So let's talk about it, get some action going, decide what's going on.  But let's not overreact!     \",\"This just in...

No problems.  Got it home and put it on the center stand. :    The next day I pushed it off the center stand in preparation for going : over to a friend's house to pose.  You guessed it.  It got away from me : and landed on its right side.   :    Scratched the lower fairing, cracked the right mirror, and cracked the : upper fairing.   :    *DAMN* am I stupid!  It's going to cost me ~$200 to get the local : body shop to fix it.  And that is after I take the fairing off for them. : Still, that's probably cheaper than the mirror alone if I bought a  : replacement from BMW.  You got off cheap.  My sister's ex-boyfriend was such an incessant pain in the ass about wanting to ride my bikes (no way, Jose) that I finally took him to Lindner's BMW in New Canaan, CT last fall where I had seen a nice, used K100RS in perfect condition.  After telling everyone in the shop his Norton war stories from fifteen years ago, signing the liability waiver, and getting his pre-flight, off he went...  Well, not quite.  I walked out of a pizza shop up the street, feeling good about myself (made my sister's boyfriend happy and got the persistent wanker off my ass for good), heard the horrendous racket of an engine tortured to its red line and then a crash.  I saw people running towards the obvious source of the disturbance... Jeff laying under the BMW with the rear wheel spinning wildly and someone groping for the kill switch.  I stared in disbelief with a slice hanging out of my mouth as Matty, the shop manager, slid up beside me and asked, \\\"Friend of yours, Steve?\\\".  \\\"Shit, Matty, it could have been worse.  That could been my FLHS!\\\"  Jeff hadn't made it 10 inches.  Witnesses said he lifted his feet before letting out the clutch and gravity got the best of him. Jeff claimed that the clutch didn't engage.  Matty was quick. While Jeff was still stuttering in embarrassed shock he managed to snatch Jeff's credit card for a quick imprint and signature.  Twenty minutes later, when Jeff's color had paled to a flush, Matty presented him with an estimate of $580 for a busted right mirror and a hairline crack in the fairing.  That was for fixing the crack and masking the damaged area, not a new fairing.  Or he could buy the bike.  I'm not sure what happened later as my sister split up with Jeff shortly afterwards (to hook up with another piece of work) except that Matty told me he ran the charge through in December and that it went uncontested.  \",\"  No matter how \\\"absurd\\\" it is to suggest that a common moral system created by mankind is absolute, it is not contrary to reason to suggest that a common moral system created by mankind is sensible. In fact, for the Bible to be of any use to mankind as a moral code, it must be interpreted by mankind and a workable moral system created for everyday use.  The Jewish Talmud is the result of centuries of Biblical scholars analysing every word of the Torah to understand the morality behind it. The Children of Israel were given a very strict set of Moral, Civil, Judicial and Ceremonial Laws to follow and yet this was clearly not enough to cover every instance of moral dilemma in their Society. For a Christian, the situation is no better.  It seems to me that the only code of morality that we have from the Judeo- Christian God is that which is contained in the Bible (which we can see from the diverse opinions in the Christian newsgroups is not clear). There may well be an absolute morality defined by the Judeo-Christian God for mankind to follow but it seems that we only have a subset simply because the concept was written down by man.  This leads to the problem of defining morality for our society. If we take the divine Morality then we have a code of practice which may be interpreted in many different ways (as an example, consider the immolation of heretics in the fifteenth century and the interpretation of the Bible which allows a man to do that to another man under the precept to administer Justice). If we take an agnostic Morality then we have a code of practice that can be modified to suit society (with all the danger that this implies). Alternatively, we could take the basis of the Judeo-Christian morality and interpret/extend this to create and justify a code of morality which suits the society we live in and enables the people to live Righteously (as many Christian and Non-Christian philosophers have done).  Whatever the driving force behind the definition of morality for our society, I think the important aspect is the result.  David.  --- On religion:\",\"PATRICK 1st rd: Pens over Isles in 4.

Compression was a little low, but very even across the four cylinders (+/- 5 psi).  They said that it was tested a little cold, so that would explain the low  numbers (around 90).  Does this sound right?  Otherwise, the bike looked great.  No signs of road rash, and no rust.  This bike looks great!  It is now in the shop getting tuned and new tires.

The only problem is these Indiana winters--my heater controls don't work.  The car has vacuum operated control switches for the vents.  Right now it is stuck in the \\\"vent\\\" mode.  It will blow warm air, but I can't switch the air flow to either the floor (I can live without this) or the defrost (I can't  live without this).  I probably could just jam the air deflector to the  defrost position, but this blows a lot of air in my face and is, well, kind of like putting a vacuum cleaner in reverse.  I have taken parts of the dash off and looked at the vacuum system and I think the problem (or part of it) is with the two diaphragms which control up/down and outside/inside air flow.  THe diaphragm which controls outside(vent)/in- side(no vent) air is cracked most of the way around, and the other one is probably damaged too, considering the advanced age of the car.  Two questions:   1)  Is there anything I should be aware of about this (other than  the fact that I should move from Indiana) ?   2)  In the event that replacement diaphragms aren't available, is there  a way to \\\"fix\\\" this?

I bought the adapters from Asante instead of Apple.   That's not true. Only the DECstation 5000/200 comes with a Thinwire (BNC, coaxial) Ethernet connector. The 5000/25, 5000/133 and 5000/240 all have a single 15-pin AUI Ethernet connector only. I distinctly remembered this because when got the 5000/200 first and I thought all of them are going to be Thinwire. I eventually had to go back and ordered DESTAs (DEC's oversized version of an AUI-to-BNC adapter that MUST be used with a transciever cable) for the rest of the stations.  My advise to the very original poster (Beverly?) is:  (1) If all you want is to create a LAN with two workstations and won't add     machines to it EVER, go for Thinwire regardless of the media type. Going     for UTP (unshielded twisted pair) wiring requires a concentrator which     means extra money and I believe these units come with at least 6 ports.     As for Thicknet, it's a nightmare and cabling is expensive. Avoid it     unless you have no choice (e.g. the two machines are two floors parts).  (2) On the Mac side, you will need:     - one Thinwire media adapter (from Apple or third-party).     - MacX (make sure you get version 1.2; 1.1.7 won't run on System 7.1).     - MacTCP (which comes with MacX; if you get MacX v1.2, you should be       getting MacTCP v1.1.1 with it. Don't use earlier versions on a Centris).     - you may or may not need a 25ohm terminator depending on the       Thinwire media adapter. So just ask the sales if the adapter is       self-terminated or not.     - configure MacTCP to use \\\"Ethernet\\\".  (3) On the DECstation side, you will need:     - for a Model 200, you will only need a T-connector.     - for Models 25, 125, 133, 240, you will need an AUI-to-BNC adapter.       Get one that can be plugged in directly to the AUI port of the       DECstation. This way you save the cost of a transciever cable       (a 15-pin AUI male to a 15-pin AUI female cable).     - get a 25ohm terminator.

Material covered will include structural and informational  molecules, the basic organization of the cell and of genetic  material, the \\\"central dogma\\\" of gene expression, and selected  other topics in the area of structure, function, and regulation as  relates to current computational approaches.  Dr. Noordewier has  appointments in both Computer Science and Biology at Rutgers, and  has extensive experience in basic biological research in addition  to his current work in computational biology.  12:00-2:45pm \\\"Introduction to Artificial Intelligence for   Biologists\\\"  Dr. Richard Lathrop (MIT & Arris Corp.)  An overview of the field of artificial intelligence will be  presented, as it relates to actual and potential biological  applications.  Fundamental techniques, symbolic programming  languages, and notions of search will be discussed, as well as  selected topics in somewhat greater detail, such as knowledge  representation, inference, and machine learning.  The intended  audience includes biologists with some computational background,  but no extensive exposure to artificial intelligence.  Dr.  Lathrop, co-developer of ARIADNE and related technologies, has  worked in the area of artificial intelligence applied to  biological problems in both academia and industry.  3:00-5:45pm \\\"Neural Networks, Statistics, and Information Theory   in Biological Sequence Analysis\\\" Dr. Alan Lapedes (Los Alamos   National Laboratory)   This tutorial will cover the most rapidly-expanding facet of  intelligent systems for molecular biology, that of machine  learning techniques applied to sequence analysis.  Closely  interrelated topics to be addressed include the use of artifical  neural networks to elicit both specific signals and general  characteristics of sequences, and the relationship of such  approaches to statistical techniques and information-theoretic  views of sequence data.  Dr. Lapedes, of the Theoretical  Division at Los Alamos, has long been a leader in the use of such  techniques in this domain.  3:00-5:45pm \\\"Genetic Algorithms and Genetic Programming\\\"   Prof. John Koza (Stanford University)  The genetic algorithm, an increasingly popular approach to highly  non-linear multi-dimensional optimization problems, was originally  inspired by a biological metaphor.  This tutorial will cover both  the biological motivations, and the actual implementation and  characteristics of the algorithm.  Genetic Programming, an  extension well-suited to problems where the discovery of the size  and shape of the solution is a major part of the problem, will  also be addressed.  Particular attention will be paid to  biological applications, and to identifying resources and software  that will permit attendees to begin using the methods.  Dr. Koza,  a Consulting Professor of Computer Science at Stanford, has taught  this subject since 1988 and is the author of a standard text in  the field.  3:00-5:45pm \\\"Linguistic Methods in Sequence Analysis\\\"   Prof. David Searls (University of Pennsylvania)   & Shmuel Pietrokovski (Weizmann Institute)  Approaches to sequence analysis based on linguistic methodologies  are increasingly in evidence.  These involve the adaptation of  tools and techniques from computational linguistics for syntactic  pattern recognition and gene prediction, the classification of  genetic structures and phenomena using formal language theory, the  identification of significant vocabularies and overlapping codes  in sequence data, and sequence comparison reflecting taxonomic and  functional relatedness.  Dr. Searls, who holds research faculty  appointments in both Genetics and Computer Science at Penn,  represents the branch of this field that considers higher-order  syntactic approaches to sequence data, while Shmuel Pietrokovski  has studied and published with Prof. Edward Trifinov in the area  of word-based analyses.

We have the problem that after certain crashes the card disappears from the system, and lets crash the Mac then.  Okay, we don't use the card quite like one should, because we simulate errors in the 68000. Before every instruction some specified registers are masked, eg. to simulate a stuck-at-1-error in certain bits.  Normally, the \\\"crash instance\\\" of A/ROSE notices a crash, sets a flag and stops working. By reading the mentioned flag the Mac can notice a card crash. That works fine for almost all crashes, but as said, sometimes the card doesn't set the flag and disappears from the system.  The documentation of A/ROSE does not tell us anything about its behavior when crashing, and so at the moment we are trying to understand by analyzing the assembler code, and that's both frustrating and lengthy.  So, can anyone help?

Yes, he does have a second alternator.  Yes, he calls the rig an \\\"electronic brake\\\" since the engine noticeably slows when the key is down.  My car, unfortunately, has so much computer junk under the hood that it's astonishingly sensitive to RFI.  If I key a 2W HT over the engine with the hood open, the car loses timing due to the RF leaking into the  distributor pickup.  Very poor design.  I will, however, point out that ham radio operators are usually quite willing to help when interference is detected.  Remember that any interference is wasted power; if I put out 1W in the TV band, that's 1W that I am not putting out in the band I am trying to transmit on, and 1W can often be the difference between a nice card hanging on the wall, and nothing.  CBers, however, are usually not as helpful.  Most illegal CBers, however, will stop operation when you inform them of a problem.  The rest of them will stop operation when you inform the local FCC office of the problem (in writing, and giving details and addresses). \",\"      Nothing but errors and omissions here! \",\"  The problem is that Motif uses XGrabKey to implement menu accelerators, and these grabs are specific about which modifiers apply.  Unfortunately, the specification for XGrabKey doesn't allow AnyModifier to be combined with other modifiers, which is exactly what would be desired in this case: \\\"Ctrl Any<Key>q\\\".   This is true for accelerators and mnemonics, which are implemented using event handlers instead of grabs; it's not true for menu accelerators.  If you're a Motif implementor, I'd suggest lobbying to get the Xlib semantics changed to support the feature I described above.  Otherwise, change the documentation for menu accelerators to properly set the user's expectations, because menu accelerators are NOT the same thing as translations.   If you mean \\\"menu accelerator\\\", no it's not possible.  That's according to the definition of the XmNaccelerator resource in the XmLabel manual page.   I can't think of a reason why not.   There is a workaround for Motif users.  In addition to the normal menu accelerator you install on the XmPushButton[Gadget], set an XtNaccelerators resource on the shell (TopLevel or Application).  Install the shell's accelerators on itself and all of its descendants with XtInstallAllAccelerators (shell, shell).  For example,    applicationShell - mainWindow - menuBar - fileCascade        -- filePulldown - openPushbutton          - exitPushbutton    *openPushbutton.accelerator = Ctrl<Key>O   *openPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+O   *exitPushbutton.accelerator = Ctrl<Key>Q   *exitPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+Q    *applicationShell.accelerators = #override\\\\n\\\\     Ctrl<Key>O: PerformAction(*openPushbutton, ArmAndActivate)\\\\n\\\\     Ctrl<Key>Q: PerformAction(*exitPushbutton, ArmAndActivate)  You have to write and add the application action PerformAction, which you can implement by using XtNameToWidget on the first argument and then XtCallActionProc with the rest of the arguments.  I tested out something similar to this.  To shorten development time, I used TeleUSE's TuNinstallAccelerators resource to install the accelerators on the shell, and I directly invoked the Open and Quit D actions instead of asking the pushbuttons to do it for me, but the more general approach I described above should work.\",\"I have a 512k VRAM chip for sale.

BTW: the DOE handles reactor fuel, and merely leases it to reactors.  The NRC certifies these reactors.  The military have their own sources.  A private citizen has none of these official sources.    That's freshman-level chemistry.  Big deal.  Can you make it work?  That's PhD-level physics.  Big difference.    So you admit that there's no law that could stop you?  Physics aside, could you make one if you had the funds and time?  The answer is yes.  So, do we lock you up now because of this?  Surely you can see where the comparison with anti-gun laws comes into play here?    Precisely why it's not as readily utilized as you seem to have been lead to believe.

A family sedan designed to be operable at 85mph doesn't suddenly become operable at 130mph because you added some plastic aero effects, slightly wider tires, and a much larger engine.  That's what the SHO is -- a slightly modified family sedan with a powerful engine.  They didn't even bother improving the *brakes.*  The Mustang is essentially the same deal as the SHO -- a big power plant stuck in a mid-size sedan, with almost no other modifications. I have real-life experience with the Mustang -- it handles like a brick (except when you're invoking oversteer, of course, something I personally avoid doing on the highway) and stopping power is inadequate even from 80mph.  Lots of accelleration -- but the rest of the car is not up to par.  I picked the Porsche example because they are designed with speed in mind.  It didn't have to be the 911 -- it could have been the much cheaper 944 or one of several Mercedes or Audi models.  All of these cars are fairly expensive -- but so are the parts that make them drivable at high speed.  This should be elementary.  There are a few things to keep in mind about Europe, since you brought it up.  My Autobahn knowledge is admittedly second-hand, but I believe the following to be true:  1. Drivers are much better disciplined in Europe than they are here. 2. The roads comprising the Autobahn are much better designed than    they are here, and usually include animal fences.  This makes them    far more predictable than most US highways. 3. Not all of Europe is the Autobahn.  Most places in Europe have    speed limits that aren't out-of-line with what we used to have in    the US -- if my friends weren't lying to me they're typically not    much higher than 120km/h.  I strongly suspect you won't find a lot of Rabbit owners doing 120mph (nearly 200km/h) on the Autobahn, but I could be wrong.  Some people have no respect for their own lives.

The scribe Matthew is perhaps the most eager to draw out what he thinks are prophetic answers in the career of Jesus of Nazareth.  As you will see, Matthew's main strategy is to take various Old Testament passages, often not even about the promised Messiah, and apply them to the circumstances in the New Testament.  We must also bear in mind the question of the authenticity of the accounts.  Since the gospels were written at least 35 years after Jesus was executed, we do not know how much happened exactly as stated.  But, for purposes of analysis, we will take particular claims at face value.  Immanuel:         We begin, of course, at the beginning.         (Mt 1.21-22):  \\\"[Mary] will bear a son, and you,        Joseph, will name him 'Jesus' (which means G'd is        salvation), for he will save his people from their        sins.\\\"  All this happened to fulfil what the lord had        spoken by a prophet:         [Isaiah 7.1-16]:  In the days of Ahaz (c. 750 BCE),        king of Judah, Rezin of Syria and Pekah of Israel made        war on Jerusalem (capitol of Judah), but could not        quite conquer it.  When the house of David (i.e. Ahaz        and his court in Judah) were told of this, ...its        heart and the heart of its people shook...   And, the        lord G'd said to Isaiah, \\\"go to meet with Ahaz...\\\"         ...And the lord spoke to Ahaz (through prophet Isaiah,        naturally) saying, \\\"Ask a sign of G'd your lord.  It        can be as deep as Sheol or as high as heaven.\\\"  But,        Ahaz said, \\\"I won't ask; I will not put the lord to a        test.\\\"  Then (Isaiah) said, \\\"Hear then, O house of        David.  Is it not enough for you to weary men, that        you must weary my god too?  Therefore, the lord        himself will give you a sign:  Behold, a young woman        is with child and will bear a son, and name him        \\\"Immanuel,\\\" which means, \\\"G'd is with us.\\\"   He will        eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse evil        and choose good.  For, before the child knows how to        refuse evil and choose good, the land of the two kings        you dread will have been deserted...  Matthew homes in on just the sentence that is in italics.  Further, he the Hebrew word \\\"almah,\\\" (young woman), as specifically, \\\"virgin.\\\"  But, this is not a prophecy about the Messiah.  It is not a prophecy about an event to happen 750 years later.  It is not a prophecy about a virgin (bethulah) mother.  In short, it not about Jesus.  Matthew has made use of a verse out of context, and tries to make it fit the specific case of Mary.  It should be noted that if we want to read the prophecy in a general manner, a very general one, it can be made to fit Mary.  Mary, virgin or not, was indeed a young woman with child.  Of course, the fit is shady and has problems.  Jesus, while thought of by later Christians to be G'd walking among men, was never called by the name, Immanuel.  If Christianity wished to claim this prophecy for Jesus, it becomes at best a cut-and-paste prophecy... a second class prophecy.   Not too convincing.  Egypt:         After Jesus's birth in Bethlehem, Matthew tells about a quick (and elsewhere unmentioned) excursion to Egypt, as if he wishes to liken Jesus to Moses.  This was done to escape an alleged infanticidal rampage of the king, Herod.         [Mt 2.15]  ...and remained there until the death of        Herod.  This was to fulfil what the lord had spoken:        \\\"Out of Egypt I have cal-led my son.\\\"   What the lord really said was this.         [Hosea 11.1]  When Israel was a child, I loved him.         And, out of Egypt I called my son.  The more I called        them (my people), the more they went from me; they        kept sacrificing to the Ba'als, and kept burning        incense to idols.  Matthew conveniently omits the rest of Hosea's oracle.  But, it was indeed Israel that, once called out of Egypt, wanted to return.  This is history.  Jesus is certainly not being spoken of here.  And, if we are to draw some kind of parallel here, we wind up with a Jesus that flees and resists G'd.   Again, this prophecy is just not as convincing as Matthew probably had hoped.  Rachel Weeps:          While Jesus is off vacationing in Egypt, Matthew says that King Herod sought to kill him, and thus ordered the executions of all young male children.  Matthew then writes,         [Mt 2.17-18]   By this, that which was spoken by the        prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:         \\\"A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and loud        lamentation-- Rachel weeping for her children;        she refused to be consoled, because they were        no more.\\\"     The reference is to a passage in Jeremiah 31.15, referring to the carrying off of Israel into exile by Sargon (of Assyria) in 722 BCE.  Rachel, the ancestor of the major tribes of Israel, Ephraim, and Manasseh, is said to weep for her descendants who are \\\"no more.\\\"  It is metaphorical, of course, since Rachel lived and dies before the Hebrews were even in the Egyptian exile.        It is interesting to note that it was Leah, not Rachel, who was the ancestor of the Judeans (the land where Jesus and Bethlehem were).  If anyone should do weeping for her \\\"children,\\\" it is Leah.  The only connexion that Rachel has with Bethlehem is that the legends have it that she was buried north of the city, \\\"on the way to Ephrath, (Bethlehem).\\\"        As for Herod and his infanticide, it is rather unlikely that such an event actually occurred.  One never knows, but the event is not mentioned or alluded to anywhere else in the Bible, nor is it mentioned in any of the secular records of the time.  Herod was particularly unliked in his reign, and many far less evil deeds of Herod were carefully recorded.  This might be a prime example of how events were added to Jesus's life to enhance the message of the church's gospel.        Because of the whole story's similarity to the tale of the infant Moses in Egypt, it is highly likely that it is a device set up by Matthew to add prophetic, yet artificial, approval of Jesus. It is not surprising that Matthew conveniently neglects to mention the rest of the Jeremiah quote.   The \\\"children\\\" the prophet speaks of are not dead, but exiled in the Assyrian Empire.  G'd comforts the weeping Rachel, saying that the children will be returned-- he will gather them back together.  Of course, this would not suit Matthew's purpose, as the children he speaks of are dead for good.  Again, the \\\"prophecy\\\" Matthew sets up is not even that, and to anyone who bothers to check it out, is not too convincing.  The Nazarene:         We do not even have to go to the next chapter to find another Matthean prophecy.  After leaving Egypt, Joseph & wife take the infant Jesus to live in the city of Nazareth,          [Mt 2.23]  ...that what was spoken of by the prophets        might be fulfilled, \\\"He shall be called a Nazarene.\\\"  First thing we notice is that Matthew does not mention the name of the prophet(s) this time.  Second, we have to ask who \\\"He\\\" is.  There are no Messianic prophecies speaking of a Nazarene.  Worse, there are no prophecies, period, mentioning a Nazarene.  Still worse, there are no Nazarenes mentioned in the Old Testament at all.  In the book of Judges, an angel tells Samson's mother that she will,         [Judges 13.5]  \\\"...conceive and bear a son.  No razor        shall tough his head, for he will be a Nazirite to his        god from the day of his birth.  He will deliver Israel        from the hands of the Philistines.\\\"  This is of course not a prophecy of Jesus, or the messiah of G'd.  But, it is the best that can be found.  Obviously, Matthew has begun to go overboard in cut-and-paste prophecies, in that he is simple making them up now.  Bearing our Diseases:         Jesus next goes around healing people of physical illnesses and disabilities.         [Mt 8.17]   This was to fulfil what was spoken by the        prophet Isaiah, \\\"He took our infirmities and bore our        diseases.\\\"  As expected, the verse quoted in Isaiah is quoted out of context, and a few words are skewed to fit the Christian scheme.  We have,         [Is 53.4]  Surely he, [the suffering servant], has        borne our sickness, and carried our pains.  From a reading of the surrounding passages in Isaiah, we know that the prophet is speaking in present tense of the collective nation of Israel, Jehovah's chosen servant and people.  He speaks to the Israelites suffering in exile, in the voice of the gentile nations that look upon it.  This image is deeply ingrained in Jewish identity --an image of a chastised, yet cherished, Israel as the instrument of the nations' salvation by G'd.       The verses speak of Israel taking on the sicknesses which are the literal and metaphorical manifestations of guilt and discipline.  They do not speak of a \\\"servant\\\" going around and healing people.  Notice that the servant in Isaiah takes on the sicknesses and pains of the nations (and individual Jews).  Jesus, as we all know, did not take the diseases onto himself.  The verses here in Isaiah are not a prophecy of something to come, but rather something that had already happened.  While it is believed that Jesus took on the eternal punishment of hell, he did not bear the illnesses he healed.  So, while someone might want to say that, figuratively, Jesus reenacted the deeds of Israel in his spiritual atonement, he has to admit that Matthew's parallel misses where he intended it to have its effect.   Silent Messiah:        Upon healing multitudes of commoners, it is said that Jesus ordered them to keep quiet, presumable so that he wouldn't arouse the attention of the local rulers.         [Mt 12.15-21]  This was to fulfill what was spoken by        the prophet Isaiah.            \\\"Behold my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved,        with whom my soul is pleased.  I will put my spirit on        him, and he will announce justice to the Gentiles.  He        will not wrangle or cry aloud, nor will anyone hear        his voice in the streets.  He will not break a bruised        reed or quench a smoldering wick until he brings        justice to victory, and the gentiles will hope in his        name.\\\"  The Isaiah passage quoted reads,         [Is 42.1-4]  Behold my servant whom I uphold, my        chosen, in whom my soul delights.  I have put my        spirit on him, and he will bring forth justice to the        nations.  We will not cry or lift up his voice, or        make it heard in the street.  He will not break a        bruised reed, or quench a smoldering wick.  He will        faithfully bring forth justice.  He will not fail        (burn dimly) or be discouraged (bruised) until he has        established justice in the earth.  And the coastlands        await his law.  You see, Matthew has conveniently left out part of the passage, because it does not suit the dealings of Jesus.  Christians could never think of Jesus failing, never would the \\\"light\\\" of mankind burn dimly.  But, the servant nation of Israel will indeed come to an end when its job is done.  When the gentiles come to embrace G'd there will no longer be a chosen people, but rather all will be the children of G'd.  Also, the ending phrase has been changed from the Judaic \\\"...the coastlands await his law.\\\" to the Christologic, \\\"the Gentiles will hope in his name.\\\"   While the original proclaims the Torah law of Jehovah, the other rewrites it to fit its strange doctrine of \\\"believing in the name.\\\"  If one has any doubt the servant referred to is not Jesus, one has only to read the whole chapter, Isaiah 42, and hear about the beloved but blind and imperfect servant, \\\"a people robbed and plundered...\\\"   So, we see that when Matthew's attempt at \\\"prophecy\\\" is examined, it crumbles.  Three Days and Three Nights:        Now we come upon a prophecy supposedly uttered by the very mouth of the god Jesus himself.  He speaks of his crucifixion and resurrection.         [Mt 12.40]   For as Jonah was in the belly of the        whale for three days and three nights, so will the Son        of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and        three nights.  Before any further discussion can occur, it is necessary to know how the Jews understood days.  As far as day names went, each was 24 hours long, lasting from sunset 6pm to the following sunset 6pm.  What was referred to as a \\\"day\\\" was the period of light from 6am to the ending sunset at 6pm.  Thus, according to our time scale, a sabbath day began at 6pm Friday evening, and lasted until 6pm saturday evening.  This is why the Jews celebrate their sabbath on the daylight portion of Saturdays, instead of Sundays.  (It seems like a real miracle that Christians didn't forget that Saturday was indeed the seventh and last day of the week!)  Thus, when days and nights are referred to together, 12 hour daylight portions and 12 hour night periods are being spoken of.  Thus, Jesus says that he will be in the grave, or in hell, or otherwise unresurrected for three days and three nights.        As the good book tells us, Jesus was crucified on the \\\"ninth hour,\\\" which is 3pm, Friday afternoon.  He then was put into the grave sometime after that.  Then, Jesus left the grave, \\\"rose,\\\" before dawn of what we call Sunday (The dawn after the sabbath was over).  What this means is that Jesus was, using our time for clarity, in the grave from 6pm Friday night to some time before 6am Sunday morning.  We could also add a little time before 6pm Friday, since the bible is not specific here.  What this means using Jewish time is that he was in the grave for one day, two nights, and possibly a couple of hours of one day.  Certainly this is a problem for Jesus prediction.  There is absolutely no way we are even able to have his death involve three days and three nights --even using modern time measurements.   We then are led to suspect that this error is another one of Matthew's little mistakes, and that the gospel writer put false words into his god's mouth.   And no matter who made the prediction, it is more than unconvincing... it is counter-convincing.  Hearing & Understanding:       Jesus tool on a habit of speaking to his vast audiences in parables-- stories in which a deeper meaning could be found, if you were already one of the elect, those chosen to understand the message of Jesus.  He reasons that those who can understand the parables are the ones he wants.  If the people cannot understand them, there is no need to bother with them, since they will not accept the \\\"plain\\\" message any better.  Matthew says,         [Mt 13.14-16]  With them [the audience] indeed in        fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says,          \\\"You will indeed hear but never understand; and you        will indeed see, but never perceive.  Because this        people's heart has grown dull, their ears are heavy of        hearing, and they have shut their eyes so the they        would not perceive with them, her with their ears, and        understand with their heart, and turn for me to heal        them.\\\"  The original Isaiah passages are part of his earlier works, his call to the ministry.  This is in 740 BCE, when Israel is flourishing, right before it falls under the authority of Assyria.  Isaiah sees the good times ending, and also a vision from G'd, calling him to bring reform to Israel and Judah.         [Is 6.9-13]  And G'd said, \\\"Go, and say to this        people, `Hear and hear, but do not understand; see and        see, but do not perceive.'   Make the heart of this        people fat, make their ears heavy, and shut their        eyes, so they will not see with their eyes, or hear        with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and        turn and be healed.\\\"  Then Isaiah said, \\\"How long,        lord?\\\"  And he said, \\\"Until the cities lie waste        without inhabitant, and houses without men, and the        land is utterly desolate, and the G'ds take men far        away, and forsaken places are many in the land.  And        though a tenth will remain in it, it will be burned        again, like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still        stands when the tree is felled.\\\" The holy seed is its        stump.  Here we see that it is really G'd who causes the people of Israel to stop listening to the prophet's warnings, but reaffirms the promise made to Solomon's (and David's) seed/lineage.  If you read the rest of Isaiah, you find that this is done to fulfil the plan of G'd to use Israel as a servant, a light to the nations.  (Look at Isaiah 42.18-25, 48.20, 49.3)      We see that Matthew has cut-and-pasted just a little portion of Isaiah's verse, to suit his own gospel needs.  More than that, he has altered the words, to make it fit the people who didn't understand Jesus's stories.  And, as we see, Isaiah's verses are not prophecies, but rather commands from G'd to him, in the present.   Once again, Matthew's prophecy falls flat on its face.        Matthew tries again to make Jesus's parables look like they have the prophetic approval.         [Mt 13.35]  ...he said nothing to them without a        parable.  This was to fulfil what was spoken of by the        prophet, \\\"I will open my mouth to them in parables.  I        will utter that which has been hidden since the        foundation of the world.\\\"  Matthew really botches up here.  He attempts to quote not from a prophet, but from the Psalms.         [Ps 78.2-4]  I will open my mouth in parable.  I will        utter dark sayings of old, things that we all have        heard and known, things that our fathers have told us.         We will not hide them from their children, but tell to        the coming generation the glorious deeds of the        lord...  As was pointed out, the verses in the Psalms do not really come from a prophet.  You might also want to know that earlier copies of Matthew's gospel even inserted Isaiah's name as this prophet.  Apparently, later scribes caught the error and tried to cover some of it up.      Perhaps the most significant part of this is that, once again, Matthew has altered the Old Testament Scriptures.  As Jesus has said earlier, he speaks in parables so that some will not understand them.  The parables in the Psalms are not to be hidden.  Further, they speak of things \\\"known, that our fathers have told us.\\\"  Jesus deals with things \\\"hidden since the foundation of the world.\\\"  Indeed Jesus dealt in a lot of secrecy and confusion.  This is in direct opposition to the parables in the Psalms.  No wonder Matthew had to rewrite them!   And still once again, Matthew's artificial prophecies fall flat on their face.  But, Christians rarely look at this.  Matthew's prophecies aren't the only things about Christianity that are beginning to look bad.   Excuses of Little Faith:         In Mt. 17.14-21, we see that the disciples are able to go around casting out demons, except in one case.  Not knowing what epilepsy was, the people thought those with the disease were possesed with demons.  It is no wonder that the disciples were unable to \\\"dispossess\\\" the epileptic.  But, Jesus, perhaps no more enlightened than they, is reported to have rebuked them, saying they didn't have enough faith.   This seems strange.  Why was this demon special?  It seems that either a true believer has faith or he does not.  Apparently, enough faith will allow someone to move mountains.  Of course, you will find no one, these days that can move real mountains.  No one parts seas.  The only miracles the Charismatics can speak of are those rumoured to happen on trips to Mexico or some faraway place.  Major miracles are making some old woman's arthritis feel better on Sunday morning T.V.         And the gods, including Jesus, are always shrouded in ancient lore and writings, protected from the skeptics in their sacred pasts.  They are either dead, sleeping, or hiding in heaven, with people rumouring about their imminent return and their great miracles of days long gone.  Yet, life goes on.         Tales of mystics, stories of miracles-- all in a distant time or a distant place.  Gods used to reveal themselves to men in the old days, Jehovah too.  But, now they are silent.  All the theologians give are various excuses as to why we don't get to see God anymore.         We're too lazy; we're not zealous enough; we're        sinful; it's just his \\\"plan\\\"; we put too many of our        own demands on G'd's appearance; if we had the right        faith, if we  were willing to meet G'd on his terms...       Yet, even the most pious of men have not seen G'd.  You, dear reader, have not seen G'd.  Not literally, you know that to be true. (I know that's presumptuous and bold.  But, searching your heart, you know what I mean.)  All that we've seen religions do is make people feel good and content about not seeing G'd.  They say our little faith does not merit us to see G'd.  Sometimes, they say, \\\"See the love in these people you worship with... see the lives of people change... that is seeing G'd.\\\"   Thus people get lulled to sleep, satisfied with turning G'd into the everyday sights.   But, that is not seeing G'd as I am speaking of... it is not seeing G'd the way people used to see.         What we see in the world that is good, is the compassion of human hearts, the love given and taken by men and women, the forgiveness practised by Christian & Atheist alike, beauty created by the mind of man.  These are the things that are done; these are what we see.  But, it is said this is so only because everybody has little faith.   Jesus Rides on an Ass:         Shortly after accepting the role of the Jewish messiah king, Jesus requests a donkey be brought in for him to ride into Jerusalem.           [Mt 21.5]  This took place to fulfil what was spoken        by the prophet, saying,         Tell the daughter of Zion, \\\"Behold, your king is        coming to you, humble, mounted on an ass, and on a        ass-colt.\\\"  Of course, the passage quoted from Zechariah 9.9 reads a little differently.         Lo, your king comes to you; he is triumphant and        victorious, humble, and riding on an ass, on an ass-        colt... he will command peace to the nations.  There isn't all that much difference here, except that Zechariah only involves one animal  --an ass-colt--  while Matthew reads the poetic wording slightly differently.  Thus, he has Jesus call for both a colt and an adult ass.  From Matthew's version, we get a comical picture of the divine Christ sweating it to straddle two donkeys.  This could inevitably lead to a theological, proctological dilemma!   We find that in the account written earlier by St. Mark, only the colt was called for and brought to Jesus.  This indeed fits the verses of Zechariah properly, and shows us that in Matthew attempt to use prophetic verses, he has bungled.  Now, excluding many respectable Christians I have met, I have noticed that while Christ is thought to have ridden on asses, the situation is often reversed nowadays...         Then, entering the Jerusalem temple, the priests were angered at people and youngsters calling Jesus the messiah.  But, Jesus replied as we might expect Matthew to have done,         [Mt 21.16]  Haven't you read?  `Out of the mouth of        babes and sucklings thou has brought perfect praise.'  It is more likely that Matthew made this response up since Jesus was never one to point out such little \\\"prophetic\\\" things AND since, as we might expect, the quote is in error, which seems to fit Matthew's track record quite well.  We might ask Jesus or Matthew, \\\"Haven't you read?\\\" for the source reads,         [Psalms 8.1-2]  O YaHWeH our lord, how majestic is        your name in the whole world!   You, whose glory is        chanted above the heavens by babes and infants, you        have founded a bulwark against your foes to still the        enemy and the avenger.  The passages hardly need comment.  There is no \\\"perfect praise\\\" spoken of in the psalm, and what praise is there is given to G'd, not his messiah king, and not Jesus.  As mentioned, it seems to be just one more case of Matthew's pen making up convenient prophetic scripture.  YHVH said to  my lord...:        Jesus is said to have asked from whom the promised Jewish messiah-king is to be descended.  The Jews agree-- it is king David.  But, then Jesus counters by quoting Psalms 110,         \\\"The LORD said to my Lord, sit at my right hand, until        I put your enemies under your feet.\\\"  Taken at face value, Jesus is denying the necessity of Davidic descent.  One assumes he is in opposition to their answer.  Of course, the Christian answer is that he agrees, but is trying to make some hidden point, to reveal some mystery about the divine nature of the messiah-king.  It's tempting to believe this, if one is a Christian and not interested in matters of investigation.  But, there are problems.        In Jesus's time, the psalm was thought to be about the messiah.  And, it is easy to see why David might refer to the messiah as his superior.  We need only look at the scriptures about the messiah to see that he is expected to be a great king, bringing the Jews to times even better than those under David's rule.  Of course, the Jews listening had no good answer, and the passage could indeed refer to a divine messiah, such as the Christians worship.  The problem lies in the meaning of this psalm, an error that apparently several Jews of Jesus's time had also made.  One must remember that there were various factions among the Jews, often as a result of different expectations of the messiah-king.  Jesus was apparently one of these adventists, like his audience, who thought the messiah's advent was imminent, and who interpreted Psalms 110, among others, as being messianic. What is the problem, then?  Psalm 110 literally reads,         YHVH's utterance to my lord:  \\\"Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your        footstool.\\\"         YHVH sends forth your mighty scepter from Zion.  Rule        in the midst of your foes!  Your people will offer        themselves freely on the day you lead your host on the        holy mountains.           \\\"You are a priest of the order of Melchizedek        forever.\\\"  The word \\\"lord\\\" is often mistakenly capitalised by Christian bibles to denote divinity in this lord.  But, in the Hebrew, the word is \\\"adoni,\\\" and no capitalisation exists.  Adoni simply means \\\"lord,\\\" a generic term as we would use it.  It is used often in the scriptures to refer to kings and to G'd.  It is merely an address of respect.         There is nothing in the text itself to imply that the word refers either to divinity or to the messiah-king.  That this is supposed to be written by David is not certain.  The title of the psalm translates to either \\\"a psalm of David,\\\" or \\\"a psalm about David.\\\"  It seems fitting to assume it to be written by a court poet, about David's covenant and endorsement from G'd.  If the psalm had been written by David, it is unlikely that he would be talking about the messiah.  The idea of a perfect king, descended from David, was not present in David's age.  We have extensive tales of David's doings and sayings-- none of which include any praises of a messiah.      Many of the psalms show evidence of being written long after David was dead, in times of the exile when G'd had put his show of favour for David's kingdom on hold.        The description in the psalm fit David very well.  David was promised by G'd a rise to power, victory over his enemies, successful judgement among the nations he conquered.  He achieved the priesthood common to Melchizedek in being a righteous king, enabled to bless the people.   It all fits.       We do not have to blame this problem on Matthew alone, though.  Here, there is not artificial prophecy alluded to, though his use of the scripture is rather questionable.  Still, this event is common to the other gospels too.  So, we let Matthew off a little more easily this time.  It is interesting to note, though, how Matthew dresses up the event.  The earlier gospel of Mark tells the tale with Jesus simply speaking to a crowd.  Matthew has the Pharisees, who became the religious competition of an infant Christianity, be the target of Jesus's question.  As we might expect, Matthew writes that the event ends up by embarrassing the Pharisees.  Such power is the pen.  Moses & Jesus, Had it Together All Along...:         We leave the gospel story of Matthew momentarily to see a pseudo-prophecy in John's gospel.  The gospel story of John deserves special treatment, because it seems to be so far removed from the real events of Jesus's career as told by even Matthew.  But, for the moment, we will just look at one verse.  The early church leaders founded a religion on the Jewish hopes of a messiah king, and on an artificial extension of the original promises made by G'd.  When constructing the history of Abraham, Moses wrote of a promise of land and nationhood to the Jewish people.  While this was accomplished eventually, under the rule of king David, the Christians who came along later decided that they would claim the fulfillment of the promise.  But, to do so, they expanded on the promise, preaching about a heavenly kingdom.         [John 8.56] (J.C. speaking) Your father, Abraham,        rejoiced to see My day.  He say it and was glad.  It would be nice to tie in approval for Jesus from Abraham, but, Abraham knew nothing of Jesus or a messiah, or anything Christian.  I have tried, and failed to find any event in the Old Testament which corresponds to John's little prophecy.  It is par for the course to see St. John making up Old Testament backings, just like his forerunner Matthew.  Many Christians know that their faith has many of its foundations in such fraud, and it is surprising they still cling to it.  The Potter's Field:        We are told that Jesus was betrayed while in Jerusalem by one of his followers, Judas Iscariot.   Matthew writes,         [Mt 27.5-10]  And throwing down the pieces of silver        in the temple, [Judas] departed... But, the chief        priests, taking the silver, said, \\\"It isn't lawful for        us to put it in the treasury, since it is blood        money.\\\"  So they... bought a potter's field with it to        bury strangers in... Then was fulfilled what was        spoken by the prophet Jeremiah,         \\\"And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price        of him on whom a price had been set by some of the        sons of Israel, and they gave them for the potter's        field, as the lord directed me.\\\"  This prophecy is an utterly gross bastardisation of Old Testament Scripture.  First, Matthew has made a mistake regarding the name of the prophet.  It is Zechariah who utters the verses which Matthew makes use of.         [Zech. 11.12-13]  ...And they weighed out my wages,        thirty shekels of silver.  Then YHVH said to me, \\\"Cast        them to the treasury,\\\" --the lordly price at which I        was paid off by them.  So I took the thirty shekels of        silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of        YHVH.  First of all, the verses of Zechariah do not deal with a betrayer of the messiah, or of G'd.  The deal with a shepherd, most likely a priest, chosen to serve a function of presiding over the people shortly before G'd would send Judah and Israel into conflict with one another.  The word, \\\"treasury,\\\" had been replaced by the King James Scholars with \\\"to the potter,\\\" precisely because this made Matthew's quote fit better.  But, this is a blatant error.  The correct translation of the Hebrew is indeed \\\"treasury,\\\" which also makes perfect sense in Zechariah's context, whereas \\\"potter's field\\\" is totally unrelated.  Whether the mistranslation was intentional or not seems to be beyond speculation.  However, given Matthew's track record, one finds it hard to resist the notion of intentional dishonesty.       Of course, Matthew would have ample reason for altering the text.  The thirty pieces of silver match Judas's situation, and if as most Christians seem to be, the reader is willing to disregard the contextual incongruity, Matthew might have another prophecy to toss around.  However, the correct translation of Zechariah directly contradicts the situation with Judas and the high priests.  The high priests would not put the money in the treasury.  The worthless shepherd of Zechariah does exactly the opposite!  Of course, to the average Thursday-Night Bible student, the \\\"prophecy\\\" as presented by Matthew would be taken at New Testament face value.  To those, Matthew's work is convincing enough.  Wine, Vinegar, & Casting Lots:        Then, Jesus is led away to be crucified.         [Mt 27.34-35]  ...they gave him vinegar to drink,        mingled with gall; but when he tasted it, he would not        drink it.  And, when they had crucified him, they        divided his garments among them by casting lots: that        it might be fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet,         \\\"They parted my garments among them, and upon my        vesture did they cast lots.\\\"  First of all, the vinegar offered to Jesus is actually common sour wine, of the type that Roman soldiers drank regularly.  We find that right before Jesus dies, the soldiers themselves give him some to drink --not polluted with gall.         [Jn 19.28-30]  Jesus... said, \\\"I thirst.\\\"  A bowl of        vinegar stood there, so they put a sponge full of the        vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth.  When he        had received the vinegar, he said, \\\"It is finished;\\\"  But, Matthew seems to be drawing on, not a passage from the prophets, but one from the Psalms.         [Ps 69.20-28]  I looked for pity, but there was none;        and for comforters, but I found none.  They gave me        poison for food (lit. they put gall in my meat), and        for my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink...  Add        to them punishment upon punishment, may they have no        acquittal from thee.  Let them be blotted out of the        Book of the Living.  Of course, the sour wine offered to Jesus is done at his request of drink.  This does indeed seem to be a show of pity.  The psalm quoted is about David and his political and military enemies.  It is not about the messiah or Jesus.  It is then not surprising that we run into further problem when we see that the \\\"Jesus\\\" in the psalm asks G'd for the damnation of the \\\"crucifiers,\\\" whereas the Jesus of the gospels says,         [Lk 23.34]  Jesus said, \\\"Father, forgive them, the        don't know what they do!\\\"  Further, Matthew misses with his attempt to create prophecy by having gall (a bitter substance) put into Jesus's drink, not his meat, as the psalm stipulates.         With the \\\"prophecy\\\" of the vinegar faulty, we naturally ask, \\\"What of the casting of lots?\\\"  This brings up the 22nd Psalm, which deserves discussion all by itself.  Suffice it now to say that the fact that Jesus's clothes were divided as told is no great thing.  It turns out that this happened often to any felon in those days.  As we will soon see, it is perhaps the least erroneous passage of the psalm when applied to Jesus.  It does indeed bring up the interesting question as to the quality of Jesus's clothes.  For a man so removed from worldly possessions, his ownership of clothes worthy of casting lots raises some suspicions.  The 22nd Psalm:        This psalm is attributed to David, as a lament of his condition under the attack of his enemies.  It becomes a song of praise to YHVH and of hope.  Taken out of context, parts of it seem to fit the plight of Jesus at the crucifixion quite well.  We will examine the primary passages.         Verse 1-2:  My god, my god! why have you forsaken me?!         Why are you so far from helping me, far from the words        of my groaning?  Oh, my god, I cry by day, but you        don't answer, and by night, but find no rest.  Jesus is said to have cried the first sentence while on the cross.  This suggests that the whole psalm is really about Jesus, rather than king David.  Of course, the rest of the first stanza does not fit as nicely to Jesus or his execution.  Jesus is not pictured as complaining about the whole ordeal, he is supposed to be like \\\"the lamb led mute before its shearers.\\\"  Indeed, Jesus doesn't do much groaning, even when on the cross.  He certainly does not cry by both day and night on the cross.         6-8:  But, I am a worm, and no man-- scorned by men...         All who see me mock at me.  They make faces and wag        their heads;  \\\"He committed his cause to YHVH.  So let        him deliver him... for he delights in him.\\\"  This seems to fit Jesus's execution pretty well, with the exception of the Holy messiah being called a worm.         12-13:  Many bulls encompass me... they open their        mouths widely at me like a ravening and roaring lion.         16-18:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of        evildoers encir-cle me, they have pierced my hands and        feet.  I can see all my bones... They divide my        garments among them, and cast lost for my raiment.         19-21:  But you, YHVH, be not far away!  ...Deliver my        soul from the sword, my life from the power of the        dog!  Save me from the mouth of the lion, and my        afflicted soul from the horns of the wild bull!  It would seem quite convincing, and I'm sure the early Christian fathers who wrote of this prophecy thought so too.  Unfortunately, this prophecy has a fatal flaw.  The words \\\"have pierced\\\" really do not exist in the psalm.  The correct Hebrew translation is,         16:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of        evildoers encircles me, like the lion, they are at my        hands and feet...  In Hebrew the phrase \\\"like the lion\\\" and a very rare verb form which can mean \\\"pierced\\\" differ by one phonetic character.  The word in the Hebrew text is literally, \\\"like the lion\\\" (ka'ari), which makes sense in the context, and even further fits the animal imagery employed by the psalm writer.  It is convenience that would urge a Christian to change the word to \\\"ka'aru.\\\"   But, to add the needed (yet artificial) weight to the \\\"prophecy\\\" this is just what the Christian translators have chosen to do.  While the correct translation does not eliminate the psalm from referring to Jesus, its absence does not say much for the honesty of the translators.         Apart from the erroneous verse 16, the psalm does not lend itself to Jesus so easily.  Verse 20 speaks of the sufferer being saved from a sword rather than a cross.  This naturally fits the psalm's true subject, king David.  As a side note, we now know that crucifixions did not pierce the hands, the palms, but rather the forearms.  This doesn't say much in favour of the traditional thought of a resurrected Jesus showing his disciples the scars on his palms.  But then, facts aren't bound by our religious beliefs.        Matthew escapes culpability this time, as he does not attempt to draw many direct links between this psalm and his lord Jesus.  But the psalm, like many others, was on the minds of all the gospel writers when they compiled the stories and interpretations of Jesus's life and death.  How much these scriptures may have contributed to what actually got written down is a question that has serious repercussions for Christian theology.  It is easy to see, for those who are not faithful fundamentalists, how some of the events in the New Testament might have been \\\"enhanced\\\" by scribes such as the eager Matthew.  But, it does less to speculate than to simply investigate scriptural matters and prophetic claims.  So far, this has not said good things for St. Matthew.  The reference to the piercing looks a lot like Jesus's crucifixion.  John's gospel recount, written about 70 years after the fact, tells us at Jesus's execution,         [Jn 19.34,37]  But one of the soldiers pierced his        side with a spear, and out came blood and water...        these things took place that Scripture be fulfilled...        \\\"The will look on him whom they've pierced.\\\"  Of course, this is built on a passage taken blatantly out of context.   Prophet Zechariah tells us how much of the nation of Israel will split off from Jerusalem and Judah and go to war with them.         [Zc 12.7-10]  And YHVH will give victory to Judah...        And on that day, I will seek to destroy the nations        that come against Jerusalem (in Judah).  And I will        pour a spirit of compassion and supplication... on        Jerusalem so that when they look on him who they have        pierced, they will mourn, and weep bitterly over him        like you weep over a firstborn child.  John's attempt to make up prophecy is perhaps weaker that Matthew's attempts.  Matthew, at least, usually excontexts more than just one passage.  John's errors are grossly obvious and blatant here.  It does not speak well for any of the gospel writers, as it helps to show how the prophetic aspects of their religion were founded.    Reckoned with Transgressors:         After his arrest, Jesus is quickly executed for claiming the Jewish kingship, messiahship.   According to one version of the gospel tale, Jesus gets executed along with two thieves.         [Mk 15.27]  And with him they crucified two robbers,        one on his right, one on his left.  And so the        scripture was fulfilled which says,         \\\"He was reckoned with the transgressors.\\\"  Here, Mark is trying to link Jesus to a passage in Isaiah 53, about the servant nation of Israel.  The passage is not about the messiah, for if one reads the whole chapter of Isaiah 53, and its surrounding chapters, one sees that the servant is a nation.  The verses are also about what this servant has gone through in the past, not a prediction of what is to come, in any event.  The servant is thought of as a criminal.  This also happens to fit the description of Jesus.  Had the passage really been about the messiah, it still is not at all clear why executing Jesus between two thieves would fulfill the \\\"prophecy\\\" in Isaiah.  Jesus would more fittingly fulfill it with his whole ministry.  He was considered a blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout his career.   Locking onto a single event is a rather poor way to steal prophecy, at least in this case, as we see that Mark could have had made a better analogy with general comparisons.         Mark goes on to tell us how \\\"those who were crucified with [Jesus] also reviled him.\\\" [15.32]  This is to be expected from a couple of robbers.  Of course in his later recount, St. Luke decides to change some things.  Luke tells us,         [Lk 23.39-43]  And one of the criminals who was hanged        with him railed, \\\"Aren't you the messiah?! Save        yourself, and us!\\\"  This certainly fits with Mark's recount, which tells how the people who crucified Jesus said, \\\"Save yourself!\\\" and that the robbers did the same.  But then Luke goes on,         But the other [criminal] rebuked [the first] saying,        \\\"Don't you fear G'd, since you are under the same        sentence of condemnation?  And we, indeed justly so,        for we are receiving the due reward for our deeds.         But, this man has done nothing wrong. And he said,        \\\"Jesus, remember me when you come in your kingdom.\\\"         And Jesus answered, \\\"Verily I say to you, today you        will be with me in paradise.\\\"  Now, this little dialogue seems highly contrived.  It stretches the imagination a bit to see this picture of one ruffian rebuking his fellow criminal with such eloquent speech.  We have a rather strange picture of a criminal lamenting over the goodness of his punishment and the justness of his suffering.   Such a man, apparently noble and of principle, doesn't seem likely to have been a robber.  We wonder at the amount of theatrics created by Luke.  Of course, Luke's recount also disagrees with Mark's.   Luke has only one criminal revile Jesus, not both.  It is easy enough to discount the discrepancy because the account was made up, but those who wish to believe it is all part of the error free words of G'd do not have this avenue open.  This is yet another example of a writer trying to take an Old Testament passage and expand it and reinterpret it to suit his theology.  In this case, the embroidery creates some embarrassing problems, as we have seen.  The End of the World--        Mt. 24:         Now comes perhaps one of the most extraordinary and embarrassing passages in the New Testament.  It is found in all three of the synoptic gospel stories, and casts some of the most unfavourable doubt on the whole theory of Christianity.  Jesus mentions the destruction of the Jewish temples and buildings, and his disciples ask him about this, and about the end of the world which he has been warning about.         The disciples: Tell us, when will this [the temple's        destruction] be, and what will be the sign of your        coming, and of the close of the age?         Jesus: Take care that no one leads you astray, for        many will come in my name, saying, \\\"I am the christ.\\\"          ...you will hear of wars and rumours of wars... for        this must take place, but the end is not yet.   For,        nation will rise against nation... all this is but the        beginning of the birthpangs.              They will deliver you up... put you to death,        and false prophets will arise and lead many astray.        ...But he who endures to the end will be saved.  This        gospel will be preached throughout the whole world, a        testimony to the nations, and then the end will come.              So, when you see the desolation spoken of by the        prophet Daniel, ...let those who are in Judea flee to        the mountains.               Immediately after the tribulation of those days,        the sun will be darkened... the stars will fall from        heaven... then will appear the sign of the Son of Man        in heaven, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn,        and see the Son of Man coming... and he will send out        his angels... and gather his elect...              Learn the lesson of the fig tree: as soon as its        branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves, you know        that summer is near.  So also, when you see all these        things, you will know that He is near, at the very        gate.  Truly I say to you, this generation will not        pass away until all these things take place...              But, of the day and hour, no one knows; not the        angels, not the Son, but only the Father... Therefore,        you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming        at an hour you do not expect.  From this, it is clear that Jesus thought the world would in within the lifetimes of at least some of his disciples.  He tells them that although he doesn't know the exact day or hour, that it will come, and thus they must be ready.  Theologians have wet their pants in panic to find some way out of this Holy Error.  But, unfortunately, Jesus made himself to explicit.  He told his disciples that their generation would still be around at the End, and that they in particular should prepare for it, prepare to be swept away.       There have been some who resorted to removing the inerrant nature of the Bible, and said that the phrase, \\\"this generation shall not pass away...\\\" really means \\\"this race of people will not pass away...\\\"  Of course, the word for generation is used many times to refer to exactly that, the generation of the disciples.  It is an interesting notion that when God decided to learn Greek, he didn't learn it well enough to make himself clear.  But. it is quite obvious from the rest of the dialogue that the disciples (at least some of them) are supposed to live to the End of the World.  The charge of mistranslation is completely blown away by looking at the Apostles' responses.  It becomes abundantly clear from Rev. 22.7, 1 Peter 4.7, 1 John 2.18, and Rev. 22.20, that Jesus meant exactly what he said.  The End was very near.         For 2,000 years, Christians have rationalised this 24th chapter of Matthew, or ignored its meaning altogether.  For 2,000 years, they have waited for their executed leader to come back, hearing of wars, and rumours of wars, sure that He is coming soon.  Surely He must be.  All we must do is wait.  Can you imagine how tired He must be, sitting around up there, being holy, waiting for just the right moment to spring?          So, shortly after his crucifixion, Jesus of Nazareth, (Joshua-ben-Joseph), died.   It is said that after three days, or three days and three nights, or three periods of time, or three eternal seconds --or three of whatever they can decide makes for less trouble-- he was seen again, resurrected, glowing with divine radiance.  Then the Saviour decided it wasn't in the best interests of his new religion to stick around, and therefore disappeared from sight into heaven.  So the story goes, anyway.  As has been seen, there were many things attributed to Jesus when people got around to writing the gospel stories down.  To them, Jesus was the fulfiller of all prophecy and scripture.  We have seen, though, that this matter is quite shaky.  But, throughout Church history, Christians have held fast to faith, in simple belief.  What doctrinal objections could not be solved with argumentation or brute force, faith and forgetfulness kept away from question.  To question and investigate has never been the easiest way to treat matters.  Thus for 2,000 years, the prophecies cited in the New Testament have gone on largely accepted.  Things may well continue that way for some time.  Pausing a moment to consider the way the doctrines of Christianity have been accepted and used (properly or improperly) to support wars and persecution, I suppose there is one prophecy of which Christianity can securely keep hold.\",\"Does anyone out there have or know of,  line drawing USA map?

For those of you not familiar with the Moscow Aviation Institute, it is the leading Russian school of higher education dedicated to the training of aircraft and spacecraft designers.  It specializes in airframe design, powerplant design, control systems, and power systems. Virtually all of the major former Soviet airframe designers (Tupolev, Su, Iluchine, Migoyan, etc.) were schooled at MAI.  I had the opportunity to tour the two museums that are maintained at MAI.  The aircraft include Mig23, Su 27, Yak 38, the cockpit of an F-111(!), among others.  It was a fascinating and eye opening experience, expecially given the fact that the museum was, until a year or so ago, closed to virtually everyone.  I also had the opportunity to see some of the experiments being conducted with plasma drive engines for future space craft use.

Jack, there is a difference between using the network for commercial purposes and advertising in newsgroups.  Business communication is okay.  Advertising to hundreds of thousands of users around the planet who have no desire to receive advertising is not okay.      Those of us who pay for Internet access are constrained only     by our innate good taste and no have no \\\"administrator\\\" to      guide(?) us.

No doubt at some point the Internet, like everything else, will become grotty enough to carry advertising.  At that time I hope it is confined to its own newsgroups and not on discussion groups---like misc.writing. \",\"In responding to the post below I have considered issues far outside the scope of revisionism and principally have considered the political implications of a racist ideology and its inevitable outcome. Thus it is tangentially relevant to soc.history and alt.revisionism but I have directed followups to t.p.m since it is principally consideration of the political lessons to be drawn from the history of the NAZI party that I deal with.     Let us assume for the sake of argument that this was indeed the case? Does this mean that Hilter would have been in any way less guilty of mass murder because he aquiesced rather than participated as an active and ardent supporter?  One of the important things to realise about the NAZIs is that the system was far more evil than any single member. Once created the NAZI party itself was a murder machine that would inevitably commit genocide, there was noone within it strong enough to prevent it. Remember that Hitler did not originaly lead the NAZI party nor was he particularly powerful within it until his oratory allowed the party to come to power. Had Hitler reneged upon the emotiaonal expectations which he had created within the ranks of  his supporters he would have been replaced as he had himself replaced the old guard who he beleived were unable to grasp the intellectual implications of their rhetoric.   This is why all parties that espouse NAZI style race supremacy ideologies must be considered as dangerous and as evil as the NAZIs. The idea that one \\\"race\\\" of people is inherently superior to another and that the greatest goal of humanity is to achieve racial perfection has only one logical outcome, the gas chambers of Auschwitz.  The NAZI party is not simply the tale of a supremely evil single man who lead an entire country astray, beyond the evil of individuals there was the evil of the system itself which was self generating and self perpetuating. Hitler was an extreemly evil person who built his party arround an ego cult centered on the demonstration of his own power, this does not however mean that he was as entirely free from political constraints as he and his propagandists worked so hard to assert. The myth that racism can produce a strong government that can cure a nations ills must be  emphatically rejected. In the same way we must accept a distinction between a govenrment that demonstrates its strength and one that is able to  govern decisively in the manner it beleives is best. I would accept only the latter as a \\\"strong\\\" government since most displays of strength are made necessary by an essential weakness.  It is important to understand that the NAZIs were not stupid nor were they amoral in the sense that they lacked moral scruples. They acted in the same manner as the Spanish Inquisition - murder and torture in the cause of morality. The fault of the NAZIs lies in their axioms, not in their logic nor in their implementation of those axioms. Thus all such parties such as the National Front or David Dukes Klu Klux Klan front who assert the truth of those axioms must be considered for what they are, advocates of a system that would commit genocide.   The conclusion that Hitler was not only responsible but imensely evil is inescapable from the historical record. It is important though to not let the conclusion be reached that the NAZIs espoused a set of ideas that were basically correct but had an unfortunate proponent. The evils of the concept of race supremacy are primary. Although this most emphaticaly does not excuse individual culpability this is nevertheless secondary.  No matter what the promises made by a racist, supremacist party upon  election those promises will be broken as soon as circumstances permit. If this requires the replacement of the leaders that originally made the pledges, that will occur. Hatred is a supreme justifier. It also creates a dynamic of its own when those in government allow it reign. For many in government politics is a method of providing a justification for their own existence through a demonstration of their importance. A  rhetoric of hatred inevitably develops the question of action since the continued existence of an object of hatred is inevitably a reminder of the essential impotence of the politician. Thus we have the US raid on Tripoli which has little purpose beyond a demonstration of power. It is important to realise that there is no quantum jump between the politics of the right and those of the extreeme right but a progression from the reinforcement of popular predjudice to action being taken on the basis of that predjudice. In the same way the extreeme left trace their route to despotism through their assertion of the subjugation of the individual to ideology.  It is important though that in attempting to understand the dynamics of political systems that this is not used to excuse the participants. The leaders of a nation take on a supreme moral burden but not only do so voluntarily are required to stive to do so. Thus to take on such a  task without a fundamental examination of the logical progression of ones set of axioms to its conclusion in itself is a moral crime. Furthermore in taking on such a duty one is obliged to put the interest of the whole before personal concerns, even of personal security.  Although it was inevitable that a party such as the NAZIs, based upon hatred and an idolisation of the symbols of power should have saught to commit genocide it was not inevitable that they should succeeded. Each member of the system had an ability to create a change within it that had a possibility of changing the dynamic. Realising that the individual cannot hope to  control a system does not mean accepting that the individual cannot  affect the system. \",\"I have several people sharing my machine and would like to set up separate environments under Windows for each of them.

The first attempt failed in the summer  of 1992 (the voting deadline was August 31, 1992).  The voting rules  state that another attempt for creating newsgroups can be started  after a six month waiting period (in this case, it is March 1, 1993).  This is the first attempt at creating comp.os.os2.multimedia and  comp.os.os2.bugs.   This document contains:  *  the background showing the need for these proposals  *  the proposed charters for these proposals  *  voting instructions  *  a voting ballot  *  some example ballots  *  the voting rules  *  the voting schedule  *  the Mass Acknowledgement   Background:   The creation of two, free, 32-bit compilers for OS/2 2.x (gcc/2  and emx/gcc; read comp.os.os2.programmer for details) has spurred  a continuing deluge of software ported from UNIX platforms, such  as emacs, less, awk, grep, sed, xscheme, ispell, flex, yacc, and  much more.  Borland has released its C/C++ compiler for OS/2 2.x,  allowing for easier porting of DOS and Windows software.   Much of the PC hardware and drivers were written for DOS, and  later, Windows.  As more people are discovering OS/2 2.x, the  number of people asking questions about OS/2's compatibility  with their hardware increases, as does the questions on the  availability of drivers for their hardware, installation  procedures, etc.   Multimedia is becoming popular.  OS/2 2.0 supports Windows  Multimedia Extensions using Win-OS/2 3.0.  Furthermore, IBM is  including direct multimedia support in OS/2 starting with version  2.1 (in addition to using Win-OS/2 3.1).   Any non-trivial software will have bugs -- OS/2 is not exempt,  especially since IBM is constantly adding new features to OS/2.  So far, IBM has issued system patches and corrective service disks  (e.g.  the Service Pak) for free (free from BBSs and ftp sites, or  for free plus a small media charge for diskettes -- read  comp.os.os2.misc for details).   Proposed Charters:   (a)  create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting (unmoderated)    It will provide a forum for developers of ported software so   as to coordinate efforts, avoid duplication of effort, and   spur additional development.  The group will also cover   topics such as porting from other platforms (such as DOS,   Windows, UNIX, etc), toolkits which aid in program   portability (including porting tools such as Mirrors), and   so forth.   (b)  rename: comp.os.os2.programmer.misc (unmoderated)    To keep the structure of the OS/2 newsgroup heirarchy   orthogonal, comp.os.os2.programmer should be renamed to   comp.os.os2.programmer.misc.    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc will still be the newsgroup   for OS/2 programmers to discuss programming issues and   technical aspects of OS/2 in an unmoderated setting.   (c)  create comp.os.os2.setup (unmoderated)    It will be devoted to OS/2 system setup topics, including the   availability of device drivers, compatibility information,   installation procedures, system requirements, and overall   performance optimization.   (d)  create comp.os.os2.multimedia (unmoderated)    It will provide a forum for discussion of multi-media issues.   (e)  create comp.os.os2.bugs (unmoderated)    It will provide a forum for OS/2 system bug reports, bug   diagnosis and work arounds, the availability of system   patches and corrective service disks, and so forth.    [Note that discussion of bugs in applications belong in other   newsgroups, and discussion of bugs in OS/2 betas belong in   comp.os.os2.beta]   How to Vote:   To cast your vote, fill out the ballot below and e-mail it to me.

He also opposes the creation of  comp.os.os2.setup and comp.os.os2.bugs.  He does not have a view  on the creation of comp.os.os2.multimedia.    Example Ballot #2:   (a) comp.os.os2.programmer.porting: yes  (b)    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc: yes  (c)              comp.os.os2.setup: yes  (d)         comp.os.os2.multimedia: yes  (e)               comp.os.os2.bugs: yes   (f)       voter's last, first name: Doe, Jane   In this example, Jane Doe favors the creation or rename of all  the proposals.   Voting Rules:   * One vote per person.  If you vote more than once, only the most    recent vote will be counted.   * Votes must be mailed to me by the person voting.  Proxy voting,    forwarding, posting votes to a newsgroup, etc. will not be counted.   * Do not ask how the votes are going.  The status of the votings    will be revealed only after the poll closes.   * I will acknowledge votes by Mass Acknowledgement (ACK).  I will    post the ACK twice (see Schedule below).   * If you need help for using your editor, using e-mail, how    voting works in general, etc. then ask an expert at your site.    Also see the ``How To Create a New Newsgroup'' article which is    posted to news.answers on a regular basis.   * If you need any clarifications on voting procedures for this    CFV, send me e-mail at mlevis@ringer.cs.utsa.edu.   * When the voting period is over (see Schedule below), a proposal    passes if both of the following formulas are true:    1)  the number of YES votes exceeds the number of NO votes        by at least 100 (i.e. YES >= NO + 100, or YES - NO >= 100).    2)  the number of YES votes exceeds at least twice the        number of NO votes (i.e. YES >= 2 * NO, or YES - NO >= NO).    In other words, a proposal passes if:        YES - NO >= max (100, NO)    where max() returns the highest number given to it.   Schedule:   The voting period started on March 29 when the first CFV was posted  by David Lawrence (the news.announce.newgroups moderator).   This third CFV is a repeat of the first CFV, but it also has the  Mass Acknowledgement (ACK) of names and e-mail addresses of those who  have already voted -- re-send your vote if it is not there.  If you  have not voted yet, vote now!   The voting period will end at 11:59:59 pm (Central Time), on  April 24, 1993.  Votes received after that time will not count.  The voting results and tally will be posted shortly after that  date.   Mass Acknowledgement:   Here is the list of people who have already sent in their ballots  as of 12:01 am (Central Time) on April 15, 1993:                            bdubbs@cs.tamu.edu Aiyagari,

It was interesting to see Bonds hit Maddux so well.  I'm not sure if Barry was after revenge against the Braves or what but he stroked three very pretty hits (1b, 2b, hr) for 5 rbi's.  The Giants as a team are doing a lot of surprising things this year in addition to Bonds.  There has been some good pitching and some hitters seem to be swinging much better.  Clayton's defense has been superb. McGee seems to like leading off this year.  Manwaring is driving the ball. So on & so forth.

On major highways, 3 or more lanes in each direction, keeping to the extreme right blocks folks who are entering.

There are two very long entry ramps which all the hurry-up yahoos dive into cause they want to get ahead. When we get to the point where these ramps merge, all hell breaks lose. The result is that traffic which was moving at 55 on the VA side of the bridge, stalls on t'other side. If these dingbats had stayed in lane, allowed the folks coming up the two ramps to merge, we would still be doing 55. Instead we do start- stop for 4 miles.

A button widget, when pressed, will cause a new item to be drawn in the Window.  This action clearly should not call XCopyArea()  (or equiv) directly; instead, it should register the existence of the new item in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler that handles \\\"regular\\\" expose events (e.g. window manager-driven exposures) take care of rendering the new image.  Using an expose event handler is a \\\"proper\\\" way to do this because at the time the handler is called, the Xlib Window is guaranteed to be mapped.  The problem, of course, is that no expose event is generated if the window is already visible and mapped.  What we need to do is somehow \\\"tickle\\\" the Window so that the expose handler is hit with arguments that will enable it to render *just* the part of the window that contains the new item.\",\"Well my last two motorcycles have been shaft driven and they will wheelie.

Jon Noring  --   Charter Member --->>>  INFJ Club.\",\"subscribe comp.graphics quit \",\" This a \\\"tried and true\\\" method utilized by guerilla and terrorists groups: to conduct operations in the midst of the local populace, thus forcing the opposing \\\"state\\\" to possible harm innocent civilians in their search or, in order to avoid the deaths of civilians, abandon the search. Certainly the people who use the population for cover are *also* to blaim for dragging the innocent civilians into harm's way.  Are you suggesting that, when guerillas use the population for cover, Israel should totally back down? So...the easiest way to get away with attacking another is to use an innocent as a shield and hope that the other respects innocent lives?   Your damn right Israel insists on some sort of \\\"demilitarized\\\" or \\\"buffer\\\" zone. Its had to put up with too many years of attacks from the territory of Arab states and watched as the states did nothing. It is not exactly surprizing that Israel decided that the only way to stop such actions is to  do it themselves.   What? So the whole bit about attacks on Israel from neighboring Arab states  can start all over again? While I also hope for this to happen, it will only occur WHEN Arab states show that they are *prepared* to take on the  responsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attacks on Israel from their  soil. They have to Prove it (or provide some \\\"guaratees\\\"), there is no way Israel is going to accept their \\\"word\\\"- not with their past attitude of  tolerance towards \\\"anti-Israel guerillas in-residence\\\".  Good lord, Brad. What in the world goves you the idea that UN troops stop anything? They are ONLY stationed in a country because that country allows them in. It can ask them to leave *at any time*; as Nasser did in '56 and '67. Somehow, with that \\\"limitation\\\" on the troops \\\"powers\\\" I don't think that Israel is going to be any more comfortable. Without a *genuine* commitment to peace from the Arab states, and concrete (not intellectual or political exercises in jargon) \\\"guarantees\\\" by other parties, the UN is worthless to Israel (but, perhaps useful as a \\\"ruse\\\"?).   Perhaps you are aware that, to most communities of people, there is the feeling that it is better that \\\"many of us die fighting against those who attack us than for few to die while we silently  accept our fate.\\\" If,however, you call on Israel to see the sense of  suffering fewer casualties, I suggest you apply the same to Palestinian, Arab and Islamic groups.   From Israel's perspective, \\\"concessions\\\" gets it NOTHING...except the  realization that it has given \\\"something\\\" up and now *can only  hope* that the other side decides to do likewise. Words *can be taken back* by merely doing so; to \\\"take back\\\" tangible items (land, control of land) requires the sort of action you say Israel should stay away from.   Israel put up with attacks from Arab state territories for decades  before essentially putting a stop to it through its invasion of Lebanon. The entire basis of that reality was exactly as you state above: 1) Israel  would express outrage at these attacks and protest to the Arab state  involved, 2) that state promptly ignored the entire matter, secure  in the knowledge that IT could not be held responsible for the acts  committed by \\\"private groups\\\", 3) Israel would prepare for the next  round of attacks. What would Israel want to return to those days (and don't be so idiotic as to suggest \\\"trust\\\" for the motivations of present-day Arab states)?  Ah, ok...what is \\\"different\\\" about the present situation that tells us that the Arab states will *not* pursue their past antagonistic  policies towards Israel? Now, don't talk about vague \\\"political factors\\\" but about those \\\"tangible\\\" (just like that which Israel gave up) factors that \\\"guarantee\\\" the responsibility of those states. Your assessment of \\\"difference\\\" here is based on a whole lot of assumptions, and most states don't feel confortable basing their existence on that sort of thing.   It has not. Without the support, and active involvement, of Syria, Lebanon would not have been able to accomplish all that has occurred. Once Syria leaves who is to say that Lebanon will be able to retain  control? If Syria stays thay may be even more dangerous for Israel.

But to suggest that a *disease* is a *punishment* for certain types of sin I think is  taking things much too far.  If we got some kind of mouth disease for lying, would any of us have mouths left?  What if we developed blindness every time we lusted after someone or something?  I dare say all of us would be walking into walls.  Yes, sin can have terrible consequences, but we need to be *real* careful when saying that the consequences are a *punishment* for  sin.  The Jews of Jesus's time believed that all sickness was the result of a sin.  Then Jesus healed a blind man and said that man was blind to show the glory of God, not because of sin.  If AIDS, or any other STD is a *punishment\\\" for sexual sin, what do we do with  diseases like cancer, or multiple sclerosis, which are just as debilitating and terrible as AIDS, yet are not usually linked to a specific behavior or lifestyle?  Atonement is *extremely* important, but I think you've missed the mark about as far as you can by suggesting that AIDS is an atonement for sin. The atonement for sin is JESUS CHRIST - period.  This is the central message of the Gospel.  A perfect sacrifice was required for our sins, and was made in the Lamb of God.  His sacrifice atoned for *all* of our sins, past present and future.  God does not require pennance for our sins, nor does he require us to come up with our own atonement.  He has graciously already done that for us.  To suggest that AIDS or  some other consequence is an atonement for sins is literally spitting on the sacrifice that Jesus made.  In case you couldn't tell, I get *extremely* angry and upset when I see things like this.  Instead of rationalizing our own fears and phobias, we need to be reaching out to people with AIDS and other socially unacceptable diseases.  Whether they got the disease through their own actions or not is irrelevant.  They still need Jesus Christ, no more and no less than we do.  I've said this before, but I think it's a good analogy.  People with AIDS are modern-day lepers.  Jesus healed many lepers.  He can also heal people with AIDS, maybe not on this earth, but in an ultimate sense.  My next-door neighbor has AIDS. She has recently come to have a much deeper and more committed  relationship with God.  Her theology isn't what I would want it to be, but God's grace covers her.  The amazing thing is that she is gaining weight (she's had the disease for over 2 years) and her health is excellent apart from occassional skin rashes and such.  She attributes her improvement in her health to God's intervention in her life.  Who are we to suggest that her disease is some kind of punishment?  It seems to me that God is being glorified through her disease.  Paul Overstreet, the country singer, has a good song title that I  think applies to all of us - But for the Grace of God, There Go I (or something like that).

Their faults were in intelligence (military and civilian definitions apply), tactics (attacking during DAYLIGHT??), methodology (the FBI stated that it is against government policy to assault a position where there are non-combatants/potential hostages without attempting negotiations first), and legality.  The BATF's jurisdiction is TAXES on firearms and tobacco.  They are a branch of the department of the treasury.  They have very curiously backed away from their claims of illegal weaponry to push the child-abuse charges... The BATF has no jurisdiction over non-firearms/tobacco issues! And the charges of child-abuse had been investigated in the past with no violence and no validation.  This was a clear case of first the BATF, then the FBI, having watched too many Rambo movies...  My opinion is that the agent in charge should be charged with executing an illegal raid, criminal negligence, murder, civil rights violations, and breaking his/her oath to uphold and defend the Constitution of the US.  The warrant should be unsealed to reveal to the  public what justification the BATF thought it had in committing an armed assault on American citizens.

We were invited in by the government of S. Vietnam.  (I guess  we \\\"invaded\\\" Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War, eh?)  Mexico?  We have  invaded Mexico 2 or 3 times, once this century, but there were no missiles  for anyone to shoot over here at that time.  Hawaii?  We liberated it from  Spain.  So if you mean by the word \\\"invaded\\\" some sort of military action where we cross someone's border, you are right 5 out of 6.  But normally \\\"invaded\\\" carries a connotation of attacking an autonomous nation. (If some nation \\\"invades\\\" the U.S. Virgin Islands, would they be invading the Virgin Islands or the U.S.?)

Since I've addressed these issues in this newsgroup in the not too distant past, I won't go into them again now.  What is wrong with the above observation is that it explicitly gives the impression (and you may not in fact hold this view) that the common (perhaps even the \\\"correct\\\") approach for a scientist to follow is to sit around having flights of fancy and scheming on the basis of his jealousies and petty hatreds.  It further at least implicitly advances the position that sciences goes \\\"forward\\\" (and it is not clear what this means given the context in which it occurs) by generating in a completely non-rational and even random way a plethora of hypotheses and theories that are then weeded out via the \\\"critical function\\\" of science.  (Though why this critical function should be less subject to the non-rational forces is a mystery. If experimental design, hypotheses creation, and theory construction are subject to jealousies and petty hatreds, then this must be equally true of the application of any \\\"critical function\\\" concerning replication. This is what leads one (ala Feyerabend) to an \\\"anything goes\\\" view.)  True, the generation part *can* be totally irrational.  But typically it is *not*.

Our   three year old daughter suffers from this disease.  Below is a press release   that appeared in local newspapers.  Hope you can join us.   On Saturday, April 24 as part of Communiversity in Princeton, a local family   will be having a bake and craft sale to raise money for and create public   awareness about a rare disease called Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis.  Bill and Marlene Stern's daughter Lindsay is afflicted with this disease   characterized by tumors attacking the inside of the larynx, vocal cords and   trachea.  Caused by a virus, the tumors grow, block the air passages and would   lead to death from suffocation without continual surgery to remove the growths.    Three year old Lindsay has undergone 11 operations thus far since her diagnosis   last year and faces the prospect of over a hundred operations throughout her   lifetime.    Even though the disease is hardly a household word, it has affected the lives   of enough people to inspire the formation of the Recurrent Respiratory   Papillomatosis Foundation,  a non-profit foundation whose goals are to provide   support for patients and families by networking patients and publishing a   newsletter, enhance  awareness of RRP at the local and national level, and aid   in the prevention, cure, and treatment.  Since medical researchers know that the virus causing the disease is similar to   those viruses causing warts, they feel a cure would be within reach if money   were available for research.  Because RRP is rare, it not only gets scant   attention but also paltry funds to search for a cure.  Part of the RRP   Foundation's mission is to change that.   Anyone interested in contributing items to the bake and craft sale, please call   Marlene or Bill at 609-890-0502.  Monetary donations can be made at the   Foundation's booth during Communiversity, April 24th, 12 to 4 p.m., in downtown   Princeton, or sent directly to:\",\"   I think you will find that the active Linux and 386BSD communities are   populated by enthusiasts who would object to paying *any* money for software.

But many years have passed since then, and what existed then can today no longer be found even in South American countries, or in the former Communist countries.  But it appears that this is still possible in Israel of 1993.  The Chair of the Knesset Committee on Law, the Constitution and Justice, MK David Zucker, sent a letter on this subject early this week to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice, and the Cabinet Legal Advisor.  Ma'ariv has obtained the content of the letter:  \\\"During the past several years a number of Israeli citizens have been imprisoned for various periods for security offenses.  In some of these cases a legal publication ban was imposed not only on the specifics of the crimes for which the prisoners were convicted, but even on the mere fact of their imprisonment.  In those cases, after being legally convicted, the prisoners spend their term in prison without public awareness either of the imprisonment or of the prisoner\\\", asserts MK Zucker.  On the other hand Zucker agrees in his letter that, \\\"There is absolutely no question that it is possible, and in some cases it is imperative, that a publication ban be imposed on the specifics of security offenses and the course of trials.  But even in such cases the Court must weigh carefully and deliberately the circumstances under which a trial will not be held in public.  \\\"However, one must ask whether the imposition of a publication ban on the mere fact of a person's arrest, and on the name of a person sentenced to prison, is justified and appropriate in the State of Israel.  The principle of public trial and the right of the public to know are not consistent with the disappearance of a person from public sight and his descent into the abyss of prison.\\\"  Zucker thus decided to turn to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice and the Cabinet Legal Advisor and request that they consider the question.  \\\"The State of Israel is strong enough to withstand the cost incurred by abiding by the principle of public punishment.  The State of Israel cannot be allowed to have prisoners whose detention and its cause is kept secret\\\", wrote Zucker.  The legal counsel of the Civil Rights Union, Attorney Mordechai Shiffman said that, \\\"We, as the Civil Rights Union, do not know of any cases of security prisoners, Citizens of Israel, who are imprisoned, and whose imprisonment cannot be made public.  This is a situation which, if it actually exists, is definitely unhealthy.  Just like censorship is an unhealthy matter\\\".  \\\"The Union is aware\\\", says Shiffman, \\\"of cases where notification of a suspect's arrest to family members and lawyers is withheld.  I am speaking only of several days.  I know also of cases where a detainee was not allowed to meet with an attorney -- sometimes for the whole first month of arrest.  That is done because of the great secrecy.  \\\"The suspect himself, his family, his lawyer -- or even a journalist -- can challenge the publication ban in court.  But there are cases where the family members themselves are not interested in publicity.  The journalist knows nothing of the arrest, and so almost everyone is happy...\\\"  Attorney Yossi Arnon, an official of the Bar, claims that given the laws as they exist in Israel today, a situation where the arrest of a person for security offenses is kept secret is definitely possible.  \\\"Nothing is easier.  The court orders a publication ban, and that's that.  Someone who has committed security offenses can spend long years in prison without us knowing anything about it.\\\"  -- Do you find this situation acceptable?  Attorney Arnon: \\\"Definitely not.  We live in a democratic country, and such a state of affairs is impermissible.  I am well aware that publication can be damaging -- from the standpoint of security -- but total non-publication, silence, is unacceptable. Consider the trial of Mordechai Vanunu: at least in his case we know that he was charged with aggravated espionage and sentenced to 18 years in prison.  The trial was held behind closed doors, nobody knew the details except for those who were authorized to.  It is somehow possible to understand, though not to accept, the reasons, but, as I have noted, we at least are aware of his imprisonment.\\\"  -- Why is the matter actually that serious?  Can't we trust the discretion of the court?  Attorney Arnon: \\\"The judges have no choice but to trust the presentations made to them. The judges do not have the tools to investigate.  This gives the government enormous power, power which they can misuse.\\\"  -- And what if there really is a security issue?  Attorney Arnon: \\\"I am a man of the legal system, not a security expert.  Democracy stands in opposition to security.  I believe it is possible to publicize the matter of the arrest and the charges -- without entering into detail.  We have already seen how the laws concerning publication bans can be misused, in the case of the Rachel Heller murder.  A suspect in the murder was held for many months without the matter being made public.\\\"  Attorney Shiffman, on the other hand, believes that state security can be a legitimate reason for prohibiting publication of a suspect's arrest, or of a convicted criminal's imprisonment.  \\\"A healthy situation?  Definitely not.  But I am aware of the fact that mere publication may be harmful to state security\\\".  A different opinion is expressed by attorney Uri Shtendal, former advisor for Arab affairs to Prime Ministers Levi Eshkol and Golda Meir.  \\\"Clearly, we are speaking of isolated special cases.  Such situations contrast with the principle that a judicial proceeding must be held in public. No doubt this contradicts the principle of freedom of expression.  Definitely also to the principle of individual freedom which is also harmed by the prohibition of publication.  \\\"Nevertheless\\\", adds Shtendal, \\\"the legislator allowed for the possibility of such a ban, to accommodate special cases where the damage possible as a consequence of publication is greater than that which may follow from an abridgment of the principles I've mentioned. The authority to decide such matters of publication does not rest with the Prime Minister or the security services, but with the court, which we may rest assured will authorize a publication ban only if it has been convinced of its need beyond a shadow of a doubt.\\\"  Nevertheless, attorney Shtendal agrees: \\\"As a rule, clearly such a phenomenon is undesirable. Such an extreme step must be taken only in the most extreme circumstances.\\\"\",\" All your friend really has to do is find a Registered Dietician(RD).

But this is *irrelevant*.  You're talking about averages, when we have lots of information about THIS PLAYER IN PARTICULAR to base our decisions on.  I might as well say \\\"We know that very, very few people are more than 7 feet tall, so chances are that Manute Bol is really only 6 foot 4.\\\"   Why isn't Lopez likely to hit that well?  He hit that well last year (after adjusting his stats for park and league and such); he hit better (on an absolute scale) than Olson or Berryhill did.  By a lot.  As for rushing...  If there really is a qualitative difference between the minors and the majors that requires a period of adjustment (and I don't believe there is), then wouldn't you rather waste Lopez's 22-year old good season than his 23-year old very good season or his 24-year-old excellent season?  The sooner you get him acclimated, the more of his prime you get to use.   The point was not that 17 AB is a significant sample, but rather that he hadn't done anything in spring training to cause even a blockhead manager to question whether his minor league numbers were for real, or to send him down \\\"until he gets warmed up\\\".   Most players are *never* ready for the bigs.  What does this have to do with Javy Lopez?   See above.     But I could apply the same reasoning to Frank Thomas or Barry Bonds.  Most players aren't that good, so they probably won't be that good this year either.   And demonstrated inabilities to hit their way out of a soap bubble.   Not superstars, not stars, not even good players.  Maybe average, if we're being charitable.   Ummm.  Justice is a very fine hitter.  Pendleton might have another big year in his bat, but he might also spend the season in Hamstring Hell.  Gant is a big question mark.  The Bream/Hunter platoon is decent (not excellent) and has rotten OBP or SLG (depending on who's in).  Blauser is a very valuable bat... for a shortstop.    Wanna bet?  The difference between Lopez's bat and Olson/Berryhill could be 20 or 30 runs over the course of the season.  Given a choice between a player with experience and a player who can play, I'll take the latter every time.   Just like Keith Mitchell did?   That was me, and you so far your only counter-proposal is that they really don't understand how good Lopez is, or overvalue experience, or some combination of the two.  I think my interpretation was more flattering to the organization.

Reproduced under open license granted by Audio Books, Inc.  -----------------------------------------------------------------  This is the Dr. Beter AUDIO LETTER(R), 1629 K St. NW, Washington, DC  20006.     Hello, my friends, this is Dr. Beter.  Today is April 30, 1982, and this is my AUDIO LETTER(R) No. 74.    It's now been almost one month since war broke out in the South Atlantic.  On the surface it seems that it's only a dispute between Argentina and Great Britain over the barren, wind-swept Falkland Islands and South Georgia Island.  In reality, it's far more than that.     The so-called Falklands crisis is just the visible tip of a giant military operation.  During this month of April 1982, fierce naval battles have taken place--not only in the South Atlantic but also in the South Pacific.  Up to now most of the hostilities have been kept under wraps by wartime censorship on all sides.  But as I say these words, the naval war in the Southern Hemisphere is about to come to the surface.     Beginning today, April 30, a total naval and air blockade of the Falklands by the Royal Navy has begun.  At the same time a counterblockade has been declared by Argentina in the same area.     To be effective, a blockade must be imposed over a period of time, but the Royal Navy does not have that much time.  Winter is coming on in the South Atlantic, and the British supply lines are overextended.  Having come this far, Her Majesty's navy cannot simply drop the blockade and sail away in a few weeks time without drawing blood from Argentina.  As a result the British will be forced to undertake military operations very soon no matter how risky they may be.     There is also another reason why the Royal Navy now has no choice but to engage the Argentine forces in combat.  That reason, my friends, is that the Royal Navy has already suffered losses in secret combat this month.  Up to this moment there will be no way to explain away the damage which has been sustained by the British fleet.  Only when publicly admitted fighting erupts will the British dare to admit that they have suffered battle losses.  To obtain that cover story, the British have no choice but to sail into combat; but in doing so, they will be risking even heavier losses on top of those already sustained.  In short, my friends, Her Majesty's navy has sailed into a trap.     The events now unfolding in the South Atlantic carry strange, ironic echoes of the past.  For weeks now we've been hearing countless commentators referring to the British task force as an \\\"armada\\\" (quote).  The British of all people ought to be very uneasy with that description.  The original Spanish Armada 400 years ago was renowned as a seemingly invincible fighting force, but it came to grief in a naval disaster so complete that it changed the course of history--and it was none other than the English navy that destroyed the Spanish Armada.     The original Spanish Armada put to sea in 1588 during the reign of England's Queen Elizabeth I.  The Armada was an invasion fleet carrying thousands of crack fighting men to invade England.  They were met by the daring sea dogs of Sir Francis Drake.  Drake and his small, fast ships turned the tables on the Spanish Armada by changing the rules of battle.  The English fleet was equipped with new longer-range guns, and it stayed upwind and out of reach.  From there the English pounded, smashed, and shattered the big ships of the mighty Armada.  When it was all over, barely half the Spanish fleet was left to limp back to port.  Drake's defeat of the Spanish Armada was a shock to the world.  It opened the door for England under Queen Elizabeth I to start its expansion into a truly global empire.     Today, 400 years later, history seems to have come full circle.  Queen Elizabeth II is witnessing the dismantling of the world empire whose heyday began under Queen Elizabeth I, and now the cultures of England and of Spain are once again in confrontation.  Once again a so-called armada is preparing for invasion, but this time the armada is British, not Spanish.  Four hundred years ago Sir Francis Drake was the hero of the day; today, the ghost of Francis Drake is once again on the scene.     The South Atlantic war zone is at the eastern end of the Drake Passage around the southern tip of South America.  The defeat of the Spanish Armada four centuries ago broke the back of Spain's naval supremacy, and now the defeat of the new British armada may well break the back of what remains of the once glorious Royal Navy.     My three special topics for this AUDIO LETTER are:  Topic #1--THE MILITARY SECRET OF SOUTH GEORGIA ISLAND Topic #2--THE SECRET NAVAL WAR OF THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE Topic #3--THE ROCKEFELLER FEAR CAMPAIGN AGAINST NUCLEAR WAR.  Topic #1--When the Falkland Islands crisis began early this month it looked at first like a tempest in a teapot.  For a century and a half since 1833, the Islands have been controlled by Great Britain.  During that entire time, British sovereignty over the Falklands has been disputed by Argentina.  There have been countless threats by Argentina to seize the Islands, which it calls the Malvinas, but the threats have always come to nothing in the past and Britain has never even gotten very worried about them.     The Islands are four times as distant from Argentina as Cuba is from the United States, and they are not much of a prize.  After 150 years of occupancy, the Falklands are home to fewer than 2,000 British settlers and a lot of sheep.  In short, the remote Falkland Islands hardly look like something to fight over, and yet here we are watching another crisis take place.  We are watching as war erupts between Great Britain and Argentina.     The Thatcher government is acting as if it has forgotten all about its usual preoccupation with the Soviet threat at NATO's doorstep.  Instead, Britain is throwing almost everything it's got at Argentina---aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, submarines, assault ships--you name it.  Luxury cruise ships have even been commissioned and turned into troop carriers overnight.  Wave after wave of additional assault troops have been activated and sent to join the fleet even after it sailed.  Ships and submarines have been pulled off station from normal NATO duty and sent to reinforce the task force.  The initial 40-ship force has grown steadily over the past several weeks into an armada numbering over 70.  Over two-thirds of the entire Royal Navy has already been deployed to the South Atlantic off Argentina.     Watching all this, a lot of people are asking: What's this fight really all about?  The most popular answer suggested in the major media is \\\"oil.\\\"  Vast deposits of oil are known to exist under the continental shelf between Argentina and the Falklands, but that has been known for nearly 10 years.  In no way does it explain the timing of the sudden military offensive by Argentina this month, and oil explains even less about the Argentine seizure of South Georgia Island.     South Georgia Island is 800 miles east of the Falklands with no known oil deposits anywhere near it; and compared to South Georgia, the Falklands are an island paradise.  South Georgia Island is covered with rugged mountains, treacherous valleys, glaciers, and semi-permanent snow.  Most of it is uninhabitable.  On top of all that, Argentina has absolutely no legal or historical claim to South Georgia Island.  In that respect it stands in sharp contrast to the Falklands.     In the early 1830s the Falklands were occupied for a while by Argentine colonists.  In 1833 the British expelled them and took over the Island.  For that and other historical reasons, Argentina argues that the Falklands really belong to Argentina, not Britain.     But no such argument is possible for South Georgia Island.  It has always been controlled by Britain, never by Argentina or Spain.  The Argentine seizure of South Georgia Island looks even more unreasonable from a military point of view.  Argentina's leaders are military men and they think in military terms.  They were well aware ahead of time that far-off South Georgia Island could not possibly be held for long.  By seizing it they were setting themselves up to absorb a military defeat, as the Island was retaken by Britain.  So the question is: Why did Argentina's military junta bother with the seemingly worthless South Georgia Island at all?     My friends, the answers to all these questions are military, not political or economic.  South Georgia Island possesses an enormous military secret.  It's a giant underground installation buried under the mountains at the northwest end of the Island.  The real reason for the so-called Falkland crisis is this secret installation, together with two other similar installations which I will describe shortly.     The secret military complexes have been in existence for many years; they are not new.  What is new is the accelerated nuclear war timetable of the American Bolshevik war planners here in Washington.  For the past two months I've been reporting the details of this new war plan to you as quickly as I can obtain and verify them.     The plan calls for NUCLEAR WAR ONE to erupt by September of this year 1982!!  It is this fast-approaching nuclear war threat that caused the so-called Falklands crisis to erupt now.     What is going on now is a coordinated effort to spoil part of the Bolshevik grand strategy for the coming nuclear war.  The mutual enemies of the American Bolsheviks here--namely, the Rockefeller cartel--and Russia's new rulers in the Kremlin are behind the present crisis.  They are trying to ruin Phase #3 of the \\\"PROJECT Z\\\" war plan which I revealed last month.  That phase is to be world domination by the American Bolsheviks after both Russia and the United States have been destroyed in NUCLEAR WAR ONE.  As I mentioned last month, the key to this plan is the existence of secret weapons stockpiles in various places around the world.     The American Bolshevik military planners here in America are working with other Bolshevik agents in key military positions of other countries to set off war.  Having done that, they intend to ride out the nuclear holocaust they have caused, safe and cozy in Government war bunkers!  When the warring nations finally lie smoldering and exhausted, the Bolsheviks will leave the shattered remains of their host countries.  They will rendezvous at the secret weapons installations and bring their weapons into the open.  They will confront the world with the only remaining fresh, up-to-date, powerful military force on earth; and using that military power, they will become the undisputed rulers of the world--that is, they plan to do all this, and they plan to pave the way for world domination very soon by setting off NUCLEAR WAR ONE in a matter of months.  The Rockefeller cartel and Russia's new anti-Bolshevik rulers are working together in a race against time to try to head off the Bolshevik war plan.     Last month I mentioned that the Bolsheviks here are benefitting from war preparations which were started by the Rockefellers long ago.  It has only been about three years since the Rockefellers were dislodged as the prime movers of the United States Government by the Bolsheviks.  Since that time the United States Government has been a house divided, torn by internal power struggles between rival Bolshevik and Rockefeller factions.  But before that, the United States had been dominated for decades both economically and politically by the Four Rockefeller Brothers.     In 1961 the Brothers launched a new long-range plan for world domination.  It was a two-prong strategy, half visible and half secret, which I first described long ago in AUDIO LETTER No. 28.  It was a plan for the United States to arm to the teeth in secret while appearing to disarm gradually.  Without repeating all the details, the basic idea was grandiose yet simple.  By deliberately appearing weak, the Rockefeller-controlled United States would maneuver itself into a nuclear war with Russia.  Then the secret weapons, including superweapons, would be unleashed to smash Russia and take over the world.     When they set the grand plan in motion in 1961, the Rockefeller Brothers were looking ahead to a nuclear war by the late 1970s.  Their military analysts concluded very early that the war being planned would have very different effects on the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.  Both superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, are located well up in the Northern Hemisphere; so are the other full-fledged nuclear powers--Great Britain, France, Red China, and India.  By contrast, the strategic targets for nuclear war in the Southern Hemisphere are relatively few and far between.  In other words, it was expected that the coming nuclear war would be essentially a Northern Hemisphere war.     In an all-out nuclear holocaust it is known that serious radioactive fallout will gradually spread to affect even areas not initially hit by war.  But there are limits to how far the war clouds can spread.  It was discovered long ago that there is very little mixing between the air of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.  In the northern half of our planet, cold air from the North Pole works its way southward towards the equator, then it works its way back to the north as warm air.  A mirror image of this process takes up the southern half of the planet.  Northern and Southern Hemisphere air meet in the equatorial zone, but very little of the air changes places.     The military conclusion, my friends, is this: the coming nuclear war could ruin large areas of the Northern Hemisphere for generations to come; but if the calculations are right, the Southern Hemisphere could escape virtually unaffected by the war.  This was music to the ears of the Four Rockefeller Brothers.  A quick look at the globe of the world shows why.  The Rockefeller cartel has dominated Latin America ever since World War II.  As I discussed in my very first monthly AUDIO LETTER, Nelson Rockefeller solidified the cartel grip on Latin America during the war.  He accomplished this as so-called \\\"Coordinator of Hemispheric Defense\\\" for then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt.  So that takes care of the South American continent and its natural resources.     Then there is the African continent.  There, too, Rockefeller control was already in effect over wide areas of Black Africa, especially south of the equator.  All this was thanks to the efforts of John D. Rockefeller III, as I detailed in AUDIO LETTER No. 36.     Looking around the globe, the most important remaining land masses from the standpoint of world domination are Australia and New Zealand.  Thanks to World War II, both were wide open to the Rockefellers.     The Rockefeller Brothers decided to establish secret military installations in the Southern Hemisphere for use after the coming war.  By this means they expected to become the masters of the surviving southern half of planet Earth after the Northern Hemisphere war.  Then, as the Northern Hemisphere gradually recovered from the nuclear holocaust, the Rockefeller empire would be able to pick up the pieces.  In this way the third generation Rockefeller Brothers expected their family dynasty to inherit the Earth.     In order to control the Southern Hemisphere militarily after the war, some means would have to be available to project military power onto any land mass.  For example, revolts against Rockefeller domination would require troops--not a blast from the beam weapons on the Moon.  The most critical factor for postwar military domination of the world was found to be a navy.  A minimum of two secret naval fleets would be required--one based in the South Atlantic, the other in the South Pacific.  Since the reserve naval fleets were to be kept secret until after the Northern Hemisphere nuclear war, they could not be built in existing shipyards.  New construction facilities had to be built and they had to be hidden.  To hide an entire shipyard is no small task; they take up a lot of space.  On top of that, it was essential that the ships remain hidden after they were built.  The best way to achieve that was to combine the shipyard and naval base into one over-all secret installation.  Finally, the secret naval installation had to be invulnerable to nuclear attack; otherwise if its existence were ever discovered prematurely, the secret navy might be wiped out.     The combined requirements for secrecy, space, and protection against attack were formidable; but one day in 1959, while all these plans were still in the early stages of development, the answer presented itself.  During a so-called banking trip to Sweden, David Rockefeller was given a tour of a unique hidden naval port.  The port is hollowed out from solid granite cliffs which come right down to the water.  The entrance to the port is a gigantic hole in the side of the cliff which can be sealed off with enormous steel doors.  Inside this big doorway on the water a huge cavity has been hollowed out to accommodate ships.     The Rockefeller Brothers and their military adviser decided that a bigger, more secret, better protected version of the Swedish hidden port was just what they wanted.  A survey of candidate sites was then initiated.  The site survey covered coastal areas throughout the Southern Hemisphere.  Many areas were rejected very quickly because the topography was wrong.  Other areas were rejected because they were too close to the equator.  Still others had to be ruled out because there were too many people living nearby, making the desired level of secrecy impossible.  Finally, it was essential that the sites chosen for the secret naval installations be totally secure politically.     At last the sites for the secret naval installations were selected.  In the South Pacific, extreme southern New Zealand was selected.  This is what I was alluding to in AUDIO LETTER No. 71 three months ago when I called attention to New Zealand's extreme importance in the coming war.     In order to obtain the necessary space, the secret New Zealand naval installation had to be divided up into two sites located close together.  One is at the extreme southwest tip of South Island where the mountain range known as the Southern Alps comes down virtually to the water's edge.  The other part of the installation is built into the northwest tip of Stewart Island, which is off the tip of South Island.  The Stewart Island facility is hollowed out within a rise known as Mt. Anglem.     The New Zealand location met all the requirements.  Ever since World War II the government of New Zealand has been tied even closer to the United States than to Great Britain.  The location is far from the equator, and the installations are buried deep under mountains, protected from nuclear attack.  They are also too deep to be reached by particle-beam attacks, and the New Zealand site is well situated to command the entire South Pacific.     In the South Atlantic an even more perfect site was found.  That site, my friends, is South Georgia Island.  It is located perfectly for naval domination of the entire South Atlantic.  The tall, rugged mountains provided a perfect location for the secret installation at the northwest tip of the 100-mile long island.  It is controlled by Great Britain whose government, like that of New Zealand, was willing to cooperate; and South Georgia Island was virtually uninhabited except for a whaling station on the northeast coast.  The whaling station was some 50 miles away from the secret new installation which was being built, but Britain took no chances.  In 1965 the whaling station was closed down.  Since that time there have been no inhabitants on South Georgia Island except for a few dozen alleged Antarctic scientists.     Construction of the secret naval facilities--two in New Zealand, one on South Georgia Island--began in the early 1960's.  The techniques were adapted from those used previously to build other large underground facilities, such as the NORAD installation inside Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado; however these techniques were adapted in radically new ways to achieve construction access directly from the sea instead of overland.  In this way, the sheltering mountain was left undisturbed in appearance both during and after construction.     The cuts in the mountain side which were necessary to let ships in and out were kept as small as possible and were well camouflaged.  Like the Swedish hidden naval port arrangement, the entrances to the secret installations can be sealed up.  When sealed, the entrance is virtually impossible to detect unless you know exactly where it is; and unlike most large construction projects, there are no tailings or piles of leftover rock lying around to attract attention.  The man-made caverns which house the secret naval installations are enormous, but all the rock and debris was disposed of at sea.     Once the secret naval facilities were built, they had to be outfitted for ship construction and docksite storage.  The fake disarmament of the United States during the 1960s contributed greatly to this task.  From 1961 to 1968 one man played a pivotal role in this elaborate Rockefeller scheme.  He was then-Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara.  All through the 60's McNamara presided over the public paring back of America's visible military power.  This included the closing down and dismantling of entire shipyards.  What we were not told was where all that shipyard equipment went afterwards.  Where it went, my friends, was to the new secret installations which were being outfitted in New Zealand and South Georgia Island!     The secret naval installations have been used as duplication facilities to reproduce certain ships and submarines designed and built here in the United States.  As Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger told Congress recently, it is cheaper to build two ships at a time.  That is especially true if the second ship is an exact duplicate of the first.  This has become even more true in recent years through the use of computerized manufacturing techniques.     The secret naval fleets which have been built at the secret installations are made up of duplicates--exact duplicates of certain other ships and submarines.  They are all nuclear powered--nuclear \\\"subs\\\"; nuclear cruisers; nuclear destroyers; and yes, nuclear aircraft carriers, three of them.  A secret twin was built for the U.S.S. Nimitz, for the U.S.S. Eisenhower, and for the newly-launched U.S.S. Carl Vincent.  All have been financed through the gigantic cost overruns, so called, that we constantly hear about in the Defense Department; and all three carriers have been provided with a full complement of aircraft whose manufacture was financed the same way!     The ships of the secret American Bolshevik naval fleets are all duplicates of other nuclear-powered vessels.  Even so, the secret naval ships possess one key difference.     Last month I revealed that the so-called \\\"Stealth Program\\\" has succeeded in developing a kind of electromagnetic invisibility shield.  This technique makes an object invisible from a distance by distorting light waves in its vicinity.     A whole new fleet of Phantom war-planes are now going into crash production that use this principle; and, my friends, all of the secret American Bolshevik navy ships have already been outfitted with similar Stealth-field equipment!  The Stealth principle is actually easier to apply to ships than to airplanes because there is more room for the powerful equipment that generates the field.     After NUCLEAR WAR ONE, the secret Stealth navy of the American Bolsheviks would be light years ahead of any other navy left on earth.  It would be perfect for the intended role of world domination.  The Rockefellers set it all in motion long ago, my friends, but three years ago they lost control of the United States Military.  Now it's the American Bolsheviks who are in control, and they are bent on war.     These secret naval installations have precipitated what is being called the \\\"Falklands crisis.\\\"  Topic #2--In AUDIO LETTER(R) No. 73 last month I described \\\"PROJECT Z\\\", the new Bolshevik three-phase strategy for NUCLEAR WAR ONE.     An elite group of American Bolshevik military planners here are flushing out the plan right now at a secret war-room here in Washington.  It's a plan by which the United States will strike the first nuclear blow, followed by all-out thermonuclear war with Russia.     Having set off the holocaust, the Bolsheviks here and in certain other countries plan to rise it out safe in comfortable war bunkers.  Finally after NUCLEAR WAR ONE fizzles out in stalemate, they plan to leave behind the ashes of the United States and her allies.  Activating Phase #3 of their grand strategy, they plan to unveil their secret weapons, especially their secret naval fleets.  With these they plan to conquer and rule what is left of the world.  The United States as we know it will be dead and gone; but in the eyes of the Bolsheviks themselves, this outcome will constitute victory.     Up to now the nuclear war timetable which I first revealed two months ago is still on track.  They are still shooting for nuclear war to begin by September of this year 1982!  Time is fast running out.     The Bolsheviks here are sprinting as fast as they can toward war; but, my friends, the Bolsheviks are not the only runners in this race.  They have two deadly enemies, both of whom are equally determined to trip up the Bolsheviks.  One enemy of the Bolsheviks here is the Rockefeller cartel; the other enemy is the new anti-Bolshevik ruling clique in Russia; and now these two mutual enemies of the Bolsheviks are pooling their efforts in certain ways.     In AUDIO LETTER No. 71 three months ago I reported that a limited, new anti-Bolshevik coalition was in the works between the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians.  The January 26 meeting between Haig and Gromyko in Geneva, Switzerland, was a turning point in the formation of this coalition.  It is now a reality, and is responsible for the so-called \\\"Falkland crisis\\\" now dominating the headlines.  It should be emphasized that this new relationship between the Rockefeller cartel and Russia falls far short of a true alliance.  They have very major disputes to be settled between them, but for the time being they have called a truce between themselves to deal with their mutual deadly enemy--the Bolsheviks here in America.     The first priority of the Russians and the Rockefellers is to slow down the Bolshevik preparations for imminent nuclear war.  If they can do that, time is on the side of the Rockefeller cartel in certain political movements which I discussed last summer in AUDIO LETTER No. 67.  A slow-down in the nuclear war timetable will also give more breathing space for additional anti-Bolshevik actions to be implemented.     The joint Rockefeller-Russian planners decided by mid-February that military action against the Bolsheviks was essential very quickly.  No other type of action had any hope of taking effect fast enough to prevent nuclear war by the end of this summer.     The exact details of the \\\"PROJECT Z\\\" war plan are not known to either the Rockefellers or the Russians, but the general outlines are known to be as I described last month.     It was decided that military action should be devised that would undermine Phase #3 of the Bolshevik war plan--that is, the Bolshevik-controlled secret naval installations and fleets in the Southern Hemisphere should be attacked and crippled.  By working together, the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians were able to devise an attack plan which neither could have carried out alone.  The Rockefeller group, who built and originally controlled these bases, provided detailed Intelligence about the best way to attack them.  The Russians with their enormous military machine provided the muscle to actually carry out the attack.     It was essential to devise a scheme that would enable both secret fleets in the South Atlantic and South Pacific to be attacked.  Survival intact of either fleet would leave the Bolshevik war plan still workable.     Military analysts concluded very quickly that a direct assault on the New Zealand facilities was out of the question.  There was no combination of commandos, frogmen, or other military force which could possibly keep an attack secret from the outside world.  Any attack on the New Zealand bases would set off the very war which the Rockefellers and Russians want to prevent.     But the situation in the South Atlantic was a different matter.  In a way, the greatest asset of South Georgia Island was also its Achilles' heel.  The extreme isolation which protected the secrecy of the South Georgia base also made a covert military assault feasible.  The key lay with Argentina and her long-standing claims to the Falkland Islands.     As I mentioned in Topic #1, the Rockefeller cartel has dominated all of Latin America for decades.  Cartel operatives were sent to Argentina to work out a deal with the government military junta there.  The historic dispute over the Falkland Islands was to be used to provide a ruse, a military cover, to enable the South Georgia base to be attacked.  The Argentine generals were not told everything about the situation by any means, but they were told enough to make clear what they were to do.     As an inducement to cooperate, the Argentine leaders were promised handsome rewards.  They were guaranteed that after the shooting was over, the Falkland Islands would remain in Argentine hands.  This guarantee included the promise of covert military assistance as needed against the Royal Navy.  And to bolster the troubled Argentine economy, it was promised that the Rockefeller cartel will help develop the immense offshore oil reserves.  With these combined promises of military glory and financial rewards, the Argentine military junta agreed to the plan.     On March 19 Argentina carried out Act #1 in the joint attack plan.  A group of Argentine scrap-metal merchants, of all things, landed at the abandoned old whaling station on South Georgia Island.  Supposedly they were there to dismantle the old buildings and cart them off to sell.  While they were at it they also raised the Argentine flag over the work-site.  The British, always nervous about South Georgia Island, promptly reacted as expected.  The British Antarctic survey ship \\\"Endurance\\\" put 22 Marines ashore.  They drove off the scrap merchants and tore down the Argentine flag.     The incident provided the desired excuse for the Argentine Junta to bring the simmering 150-year-old Falklands dispute to a boil.  From time to time in the past, Argentina has claimed that South Georgia is part of the Falklands because it is administered that way by Britain.  That argument is very flimsy but it now came in very handy.  It was nothing new to hear this from Argentine leaders, so there was no hint of what was really afoot.     During late March, Argentine military forces started assembling for an assault on the Falklands.  \\\"Nothing new\\\", thought the British high command.  Argentina has carried out threatening maneuvers in the past many times.  It was believed that they were about to do it again; but on April 2 Argentine forces did the unexpected.  After many past false alarms, this time they actually invaded and seized the Islands.  All Argentine public statements emphasized the long-standing historical claims to the Falklands themselves; but just for good measure, the next day a small Argentine force also seized far-off South Georgia Island.  The force was so small that it gave the appearance initially that it was just a side show from Argentina's point of view; however, the small contingent of 22 Royal Marines were overpowered and bundled off the Island along with a group of 13 alleged scientists.  That was the moment of payoff in the joint Rockefeller-Russian attack plan.     Thanks to the elaborate distraction staged by the Argentine forces, a special commando team got onto the Island undetected.  Based on the detailed Rockefeller information about the base, the team moved to a location on the mountain directly above the cavernous secret base.  Special high-speed drilling equipment was set up by the Rockefeller members of the team while the Russian members concentrated on military defense.  By late that evening, April 3, the military high command in London finally learned what was really taking place.  The secret South Georgia base was under attack by virtually the only means possible.  The joint Rockefeller-Russian team were drilling a shaft down through the mountain toward the hollowed out cavern inside.  It was only a matter of time until their drill would break through the ceiling of the giant hidden naval base.  Once the hole was made, the next step was obvious.  The Rockefeller-Russian team would put a weapon of some kind through the hole.  The best guess was that it would be a nerve gas.     The shock waves that went through the highest levels of the British government on the evening of April 3 can hardly be described, my friends.  The Thatcher government, like the so-called Reagan Administration here in America, is Bolshevik controlled.  That's why Margaret Thatcher always says, \\\"Me, too\\\" any time the Reagan Administration says or does anything against Russia.  Both governments are party to the secret nuclear war plan in complete betrayal of the people of their respective countries, and on the evening of April 3 they suddenly discovered that their precious war plan was in deep, deep trouble.     Immediately the Thatcher government started assembling a naval armada to sail for the South Atlantic.  Haste was the order of the day.  The drilling on South Georgia Island was proceeding around the clock.  The best estimates were that the drilling would break through into the roof of the naval base in about three weeks, on or about April 24.  If help did not reach South Georgia by then, the secret installation might be doomed.  The forces stationed at the installation itself were unable to defend themselves under the circumstances.  Their mighty naval ships were ships in a bottle.  They did not dare open the bottle to sail out to fight because the Russian commandos were armed with tactical and nuclear weapons.  To open the blast-proof entrance doors would be suicide.     On April 5, just two days after South Georgia Island was seized, some 40 naval ships began moving out of British ports.  The same day Lord Carrington was sacked as Foreign Minister.  He was forced to resign, my friends, because he had assisted the Rockefeller attack plan by downplaying the Argentine attack preparations.     That same day, April 5, New Zealand, the home of the other secret naval fleet, broke diplomatic relations with Argentina.  The two hidden New Zealand facilities had been placed on \\\"Red Alert.\\\"  As a precautionary measure, all submarines at the twin base were ordered to sea.  Several surface ships were already at sea undergoing \\\"sea trials\\\", but that still left seven (7) major ships inside the hidden twin naval base including one of the nuclear aircraft carriers I mentioned earlier.     On that busy day of April 5, Argentina's Foreign Minister, Costa Mendez, was at the United Nations in New York.  He was alarmed by the deployment of such a large part of the Royal Navy.  Costa Mendez hurried here to Washington to seek reassurances from certain officials.  He got them!     For the next two weeks or so the news was filled with stories about the allegedly slow movement of the British fleet while negotiations went on.  That, my friends, was only a cover story.  The Royal Navy was actually joining up and moving as rapidly as possible toward South Georgia Island.  If the task force arrived in time to save the secret base, a major battle was likely.  The official stories about \\\"slow movement\\\" of the British armada were intended to give a cushion of time for that battle.  If need be, the fleet would have several days to retake South Georgia Island, then it could move on to arrive near the Falklands on the announced schedule.  In this way the crucial importance of South Georgia Island would be hidden and the big secret preserved.     It was initially expected that advance elements of the British fleet would reach the vicinity of South Georgia Island within two weeks.  That would have been soon enough to attack the joint Rockefeller-Russian commando team and stop the drilling before it was completed.  But Russian Cosmospheres and submarines made a shambles of the plan.     Key advance elements of the South Georgia attack contingent left Ascension Island early April 14, two days before it was announced officially.  Shortly after they did so, they ran into trouble.  Russian Cosmospheres and attack submarines closed in on a single ship which was critical to the planned counterassault on South Georgia Island.  The Cosmospheres bombarded the bridge and combat information center of the ship with neutron radiation.  In moments the ship was without any command, its communications and radar silenced.  Then a Russian \\\"sub\\\" closed in and quickly finished off this key British ship with torpedoes.  It broke apart with secondary explosions and sank rapidly.  So far as is known, there were no survivors.     This unexpected shock in the mid-Atlantic produced two results, both important:  First, it caused a slowdown in the race toward the South Atlantic by the British armada.  The task force had to be regrouped into a configuration better suited for an enroute defense, but that cost valuable time.  Public announcements from London about the progress of the fleet reflected this slowdown.  The timetable for arrival on battle stations near the Falklands started stretching out longer and longer.  All this bought extra time for the joint commando team on South Georgia Island.  The drilling continued.  The other result of the sinking was equally important.  Word was flashed to the South Pacific Stealth navy to prepare for possible action.  It was obvious that the Russian Navy was getting involved in the Atlantic, which meant that the Royal Navy could be in big trouble.  During the dead of night, early April 15, the seven Stealth ships put to sea from their twin secret bases in southern New Zealand.  They deployed to a secret operational headquarters area in the Antipodes Islands, 450 miles southeast of New Zealand.  Their electromagnetic shields were operating to provide protection from attack.  These shields make it impossible to communicate with the outside world or even to see it, as I explained last month; but once they arrived at the Antipodes, the Stealth ships hooked up to buoys equipped with shielded communication cables to the Island headquarters.  The Antipodes headquarters, in turn, was in constant touch with the South Georgia base by way of a transoceanic cable around the tip of South America.  The deployment of the available ships of the South Pacific Stealth fleet was exactly what the joint Rockefeller-Russian planners had hoped for.  The ships had been flushed out from their essentially invulnerable hiding place in New Zealand!     The British ship's sinking of April 14 was also followed by other events.  On April 15 the Argentine Navy started moving out of port.  The same day, Alexander Haig arrived again in Buenos Aires.  Supposedly he was there as a diplomat, but in reality he was there as a General, dealing with Generals.  Haig is the top Governmental operative of the Rockefeller cartel, as I have revealed in the past.  He was making sure that the Argentines did not get cold feet and back down at that critical moment.  Four days later, April 19, Haig left for Washington.  As he boarded his plane, Haig somberly told reporters, \\\"Time is running out.\\\"  And so it was, my friends, for the secret South Georgia base.     The very next day, April 20, the drill broke through into the hollowed-out cavern of the naval base.  Bolshevik military analysts in London had not expected that it could be completed until at least the following weekend.  The British fleet was still out of range.     The weapon which the commando team inserted down through the long hole was a small, compact Russian neutron bomb.  When it was detonated inside the confines of the huge artificial cave, the effects were devastating.  The intense radiation instantly killed everyone inside the base.  Also the heat and blast effects of the bomb are believed to have damaged all the ships inside sufficiently to badly disable them.     Meanwhile, Russian Cosmospheres and submarines were converging on the Stealth ships which were near the Antipodes Islands awaiting orders.  From a distance, the ships were invisible to the eye due to their protective shields, which also protect against beam-weapon attack; but they were sitting ducks for the tactics which the Russians employed.     Floating overhead, the Cosmospheres located the seven ships using their Psychoenergetic Range-Finding equipment known as PRF.  As I have reported in the past, there is no method known by which PRF can be jammed.  The Cosmospheres radioed the exact locations of the ships to the attack submarines.  The \\\"subs\\\" were armed with special non-homing, non-nuclear torpedoes designed to explode on impact.  More sophisticated torpedoes would have been thrown off course or detonated prematurely by the protective shield of each ship; but these simple torpedoes just cruise right through each invisibility field to strike the ship and explode.  Within 15 minutes after the attack began, all seven Bolshevik Stealth ships were on their way to the bottom, and with them went their Bolshevik Commanders and mercenary crews collected from around the world.     The South Pacific action took place just after sunset local time.  The time here in Washington was around 2:00 P.M. April 23.  That evening Secretary of State Haig was seen briefly in public with the new British Foreign Minister, Francis Pym.  Pym was wearing the artificial pseudo-smile which diplomats are taught always to display in public.  But not Haig.  Haig was grinning from ear to ear, and no wonder.  The joint Rockefeller-Russian military operation had been a brilliant success.  The secret Bolshevik South Atlantic fleet had been virtually wiped out, bottled up inside South Georgia Island; and the South Pacific fleet, while not totally wiped out, had been badly crippled.  By working together, the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians had won the secret naval war of the Southern Hemisphere.  Topic #3--As I say these words, news reports give the impression that war is about to erupt in the South Atlantic, but the real war in the Southern Hemisphere is already over.  What we are watching now is the beginning of its bloody aftermath.  That aftermath is the battle for the Falkland Islands.  They have been promised to Argentina as a reward for her role in the secret war.     At this moment the Bolsheviks here in Washington are pressing for a public announcement that the United States will side with Britain.  As soon as that takes place, military action will heat up fast around the Falklands.  Britain has no choice but to fight.  She has already suffered casualties which cannot be explained without a public battle; but by fighting, the Bolsheviks in Britain are running the risk of a humiliating and tragic defeat for the Royal Navy.     Meanwhile, the Rockefeller strategists here are now concentrating on a fast-building, anti-nuclear-war campaign.  On all sides now we are hearing about the so-called \\\"nuclear freeze movement.\\\"  There are documentaries, articles, publicity of all kinds to sensitize us to the terrors of nuclear war.  In recent months, there have even been referenda popping up on election ballots dealing with the nuclear war issue.  Medical doctors are banding together to warn the public about what would happen if there were a nuclear war.     We are being told that all this is just popping up spontaneously.  We are now 37 years into the nuclear age and nothing like this has ever gained so much momentum before, yet now we are supposed to believe that millions of Americans have spontaneously gotten the same ideas at the same time.  If you believe that, my friends, I give up.  Movements like this never, and I mean never, develop without leadership, organization, and money--and plenty of it.     What we are watching is the Rockefeller public relations machine at work.  As I've explained in the past, the Rockefeller cartel cannot afford to let a nuclear war take place.  If it does, they will lose everything because they are not in a position to control it.  Instead, the deadly enemies of the Rockefeller cartel, the Bolsheviks here, will win out if there is a war; and so the Rockefeller faction is now doing everything in its power to prevent a nuclear war.     The present anti-nuclear-war orientation of the Rockefeller cartel creates certain temporary common interests between them and Russia; but as Russia's new rulers know very well, this does not spring from any great moral perspective on the part of the Rockefeller group.  It's purely a matter of practical necessity right now for the Rockefellers.     The Russians regard the United States as a house divided, and they are exploiting that division by working in careful ways with the Rockefellers.  Their first priority is to rid the world of the deadly Bolshevik menace of all-out, even suicidal, nuclear war; but once that is done, they know that there will be a day of reckoning with the Rockefeller cartel some day.     The Rockefeller group is working toward a definite objective with their new anti-nuclear-war propaganda.  That objective is renewed power--and power that moves them closer to their old dream of WORLD GOVERNMENT.  The Bolsheviks here have unwittingly provided fertile ground for the powerful new Rockefeller antiwar campaign.  Under Bolshevik control, the so-called Reagan Administration has become so hawkish that it's scaring people.  The Rockefeller antiwar campaign is designed to capitalize on that latent fear as a tool of power.     These days the smell of war is in the air.  The Falklands crisis is helping to make that more intense.  The Rockefeller propaganda machine is now paving the way for the argument that surrender of sovereignty is the only way to avoid war.  A new super-United Nations of sorts is now in the works to fill the bill.  It will have teeth!  As presently envisioned, the new organization will be based in Geneva, Switzerland.  The working name, though this may be changed, is the \\\"World Nonproliferation Council.\\\"  The plan is to bring it into being as the outgrowth of nuclear nonproliferation treaties, but its true purpose will be to use fear--the fear of war--to control us all.                         LAST MINUTE SUMMARY     Now it's time for my Last Minute Summary.  In this AUDIO LETTER I have reported on the reasons behind the so-called Falkland Islands crisis.  The crisis erupted because of secret Bolshevik-controlled naval installations in the Southern Hemisphere.  These have been attacked by joint action of the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians in an attempt to slow down the nuclear-war timetable.  The attacks were successful, but the results remain to be seen.  One result, though, is that the Royal Navy has now been drawn into a trap.  Britain's Waterloo at sea may well be at hand.     My friends, two factions are struggling for control over our United States--the Rockefeller cartel and the Bolsheviks.  They differ in style but both seek to control us through fear.  If we are ever to rise above their trickery, it must be through the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, our only hope.  As the Scripture tells us, our Lord \\\"...has not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, of love, and of a sound mind.\\\"  We must learn to wage peace.  As our Lord declared long ago, \\\"Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called sons of God.\\\"\",\" That's nothing.  They wouldn't let the British buy Inmos Transputer systems because of security concerns.  And we designed the damn things! \",\"  Or, _documentation_ for the program ;-).  A lot of shareware out there is  very similar in the approach - send in your money, and you get  documentation, and a free upgrade to the latest version.  Perhaps even  support of some small degree.  Whatever you want to offer that is \\\"better\\\"  than the circulating version.   Figure about 50%, as I have seen.   It doesn't really hurt legit users.

The company hopes this single-stage rocket technology demonstrator will be the first step towards a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) rocket ship.          The white conical vehicle was scheduled to go to the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico this week.  Flight tests will start in mid-June.          Although there wasn't a cloud in the noonday sky, the forecast for SSTO research remains cloudy.  The SDI Organization -- which paid $60 million for the DC-X -- can't itself afford to fund full development of a follow-on vehicle.  To get the necessary hundreds of millions required for a sub-orbital DC-XA, SDIO is passing a tin cup among its sister government agencies.          SDIO originally funded SSTO research as a way to cut the costs for orbital deployments of space-based sensors and weapns.  However, recent changes in SDI's political marching orders and budget cuts have made SSTO less of a priority.  Today, the agency is more interested in using DC-X as a step towards a low-cost, reusable sounding rocket.          SDIO has already done 50 briefings to other government agencies, said Col.  Simon \\\"Pete\\\" Worden, SDIO's deputy for technology.  But Worden declined to say how much the agencies would have to pony up for the program. \\\"I didn't make colonel by telling my contractors how much money I have available to spend,\\\" he quipped at a press conference at McDonnell Douglas Astronautics headquarters.          While SDIO has lowered its sights on the program's orbital objective, agency officials hail the DC-X as an example of the \\\"better, faster, cheaper\\\" approach to hardware development.  The agency believes this philosophy can produce breakthroughs that \\\"leapfrog\\\" ahead of evolutionary technology developments.          Worden said the DC-X illustrates how a \\\"build a little, test a little\\\" approach can produce results on time and within budget.  He said the program -- which went from concept to hardware in around 18 months -- showed how today's engineers could move beyond the \\\"miracles of our parents' time.\\\"          \\\"The key is management,\\\" Worden said. \\\"SDIO had a very light hand on this project.  We had only one overworked major, Jess Sponable.\\\"          Although the next phase may involve more agencies, Worden said lean management and a sense of government-industry partnership will be crucial. \\\"It's essential we do not end up with a large management structure where the price goes up exponentially.\\\"          SDIO's approach also won praise from two California members of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee. \\\"This is the direction we're going to have to go,\\\" said Rep.  George Brown, the committee's Democratic chairman. \\\"Programs that stretch aout 10 to 15 years aren't sustainable....NASA hasn't learned it yet.  SDIO has.\\\"          Rep.  Dana Rohrbacher, Brown's Republican colleague, went further. Joking that \\\"a shrimp is a fish designed by a NASA design team,\\\" Rohrbacher doubted that the program ever would have been completed if it were left to the civil space agency.          Rohrbacher, whose Orange County district includes McDonnell Douglas, also criticized NASA-Air Force work on conventional, multi-staged rockets as placing new casings around old missile technology. \\\"Let's not build fancy ammunition with capsules on top.  Let's build a spaceship!\\\"           Although Rohrbacher praised SDIO's sponsorship, he said the private sector needs to take the lead in developing SSTO technology.          McDonnell Douglas, which faces very uncertain prospects with its C-17 transport and Space Station Freedom programs, were more cautious about a large private secotro commitment. \\\"On very large ventures, companies put in seed money,\\\" said Charles Ordahl, McDonnell Douglas' senior vice president for space systems. \\\"You need strong government investments.\\\"          While the government and industry continue to differ on funding for the DC-XA, they agree on continuing an incremental approach to development.  Citing corporate history, they liken the process to Douglas Aircraft's DC aircraft.  Just as two earlier aircraft paved the way for the DC-3 transport, a gradual evolution in single-stage rocketry could eventually lead to an orbital Delta Clipper (DC-1).          Flight tests this summer at White Sands will \\\"expand the envelope\\\" of performance, with successive tests increasing speed and altitude.  The first tests will reach 600 feet and demonstrate hovering, verticle take-off and landing.  The second series will send the unmanned DC-X up to 5,000 feet.  The third and final series will take the craft up to 20,000 feet.          Maneuvers will become more complex on third phase.  The final tests will include a \\\"pitch-over\\\" manever that rotates the vehicle back into a bottom-down configuration for a soft, four-legged landing.          The flight test series will be supervised by Charles \\\"Pete\\\" Conrad, who performed similar maneuvers on the Apollo 12 moon landing. Now a McDonnell Douglas vice president, Conrad paised the vehicles aircraft-like approach to operations.  Features include automated check-out and access panels for easy maintainance.          If the program moves to the next stage, engine technology will become a key consideration.  This engine would have more thrust than the Pratt & Whitney RL10A-5 engines used on the DC-X.  Each motor uses liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants to generate up to 14,760 pounds of thrust          Based on the engine used in Centaur upper stages, the A-5 model has a thrust champer designed for sea level operation and three-to-on throttling capability.  It also is designed for repeat firings and rapid turnaround.          Worden said future single-stage rockets could employ tri-propellant engine technology developed in the former Soviet Union. The resulting engines could burn a dense hydrocarbon fuel at takeoff and then switch to liquid hydrogen at higher altitudes.\",\"I was wondering if it's possible to change the window icons OLWM uses for things like xterm.

But He does REQUIRE    that we believe and trust Him. In Hebrews it says that God spoke    of old by the prophets (the old testament), but in these last days    he has spoken to us by His son Jesus Christ. And we learn of    Him through the pages of the New Testament. The Bible tells us    what we need to believe. For those who have never heard, I leave    them in God's capable care, He will make himself known as he    desires. It behooves each one of us to act upon the knowledge    we have. If you reject the claims of Jesus, and still go to    heaven, then the joke's on me. If you reject him and go to hell,    that's no joke, but it will be final.      Gerry\",\"(Robert L.

After a nice, long rant about how people need to take personal responsibility for their economic and social lives, all of a sudden 1960's radicals (such as me, I guess) are responsible for poor people's lifestyles?  Tell me how that works--or do you think that poor people are just too dumb to think for themselves?  There are many reasons for the disintegration of the family and support systems in general among this nation's poor.

PDT                  Q   I had two questions for both Presidents, so you  could probably answer for Boris, too.  (Laughter.)              THE PRESIDENT:  I'll give you my answer, then I'll  give you Yeltsin's answer.  (Laughter.)              Q   The first is that this is the meeting of the  Presidents, so the money that's being promised is government  money, and naturally it's going to be distributed through the  government.  But you've indicated that three-quarters are going  to be going to businesses.  So the question is how the Russian  businesses themselves are going to be consulted, if ever?  What  are the priorities, because there are several association of  Russian businessmen existing already, so will they be invited to  participate in setting up priorities for investment?                This is the first.  And second, to you.  We know  that polls, public polls in America do not show that Americans  are very enthusiastic about giving this aid.  Like Newsweek polls  say that about 75 percent don't approve it, and New York Times  published that 52 percent support if it just prevents civil war;  42 percent if it fosters democratic reform; and only 29 percent  if it just personally supports Yeltsin.  How are you going to  sort of handle this problem that Americans themselves are not  very enthusiastic?  Thank you.              Q   I have a question, I'm sorry -- is there going  to be a translation of everything into Russian?  No, just the  answers.  Just the answers.  Okay.              THE PRESIDENT:  The answer to the first question is,  it depends on what kind of aid we're discussing.  For example,  the funds that will be set up for financing new businesses will  obviously go to those businesses who apply and who seem to be  good risks and make the application.  The privatization fund will  be used to support the privatization of existing public  enterprises.  Then there are some other general funds in the  Democracy Corps and other things which people in Russia will have  some influence over the distribution of.                With regard to your second question, let me say that  I would think that there would be people in both countries who  would not feel too warmly toward simply the American government  giving money to the Russian government.  There's opposition to  that in Russia.  And in our country, throughout our whole history  there has been an opposition to foreign aid of all kinds.  That  is, this has nothing to do with Russia.  If you look at the whole  history of America, any kind of aid program has always been  unpopular.                What I have tried to tell the American people is, is  this is not an aid program, this is an investment program; that  this is an investment in our future.  We spent $4 trillion -- trillion -- on armaments on soldiers and other investments  because of the Cold War.  Now, with a democratic government in  Russia, with the newly independent states, the remainder of them  working on a democracy and struggling to get their economies  going, it seems to me very much in our interest to make it  possible to do whatever we can for democracy to survive, for the  economy of Russia to grow because of the potential for trade and  investment there, and for us to continue the effort to reduce  nuclear weapons and other elements of hostility on both sides, on  our side and on the Russian side.                So I don't see this as an aid program; this is an  investment for the United States.  This is very much in the  interest of the United States.  The things I announced today, the  second stage of the program, which I hope to put together next  week, in my view are things that are good for my country and for  the taxpayers and workers of my country.                Russia is a very great nation that needs some  partnership now, some common endeavor with other people who share  her goals.  But it would be a great mistake for anyone to view  this as some sort of just a charity or an aid issue.  That's not  what it is, it's an investment for America and it's a wonderful  investment.                Like all investments, there is some risk.  But  there's far less risk with a far greater potential of return than  the $4 trillion we spent looking at each other across the barrier  of the Cold War.              Q   Mr. President, first of all thank you very  much, indeed, for coming here and talking to us.  In the memory  of the living correspondents, this is the first time an American  President is doing this to the Russian press corps, so it's kind  of a very measured breakthrough.                I have two questions.  One, in your introductory  remarks of the other press conference, you mentioned in brief  that you discussed the START II and START I issues.  Could you  tell us:  Did you reach an agreement with President Yeltsin as to  what might be done in order to have Ukraine join the ratification  of START I and the NPT regime?  And my second question is, how  confident you are that the United States Congress would be eager  to support you in lifting Jackson-Vanik and other restrictions  inherited from the Cold War?                PRESIDENT CLINTON:  First, we discussed the issue of  Ukraine with regard to START I and NPT, and generally, with  regard to the need to proceed to have the other independent  states all be non-nuclear; but also to have the United States  develop strong relationships with them.  We know that one thing  that we could do that would increase, I think, the willingness of  the Ukraine to support this direction is to successfully conclude  our own negotiations on highly enriched uranium, because that  would provide not only an important economic opportunity for  Russia, but also for Ukraine, and it would show some reaching out  on our part.  But we agreed that basically the people who signed  off on the Lisbon Protocol have got to honor what they did, and  we agreed to continue to press that.              I, myself, have spent a good deal of time trying to  reassure Ukraine's leaders, specifically the President and the  Foreign Minister, that I want strong ties with Ukraine, that the  United States very much wants a good relationship with Ukraine,  but that, in order to do what we need to do together to  strengthen the economy of Ukraine and to have the United States  be fully supportive, the commitment to ratify START I and to join  the NPT regime is critical.              What was the second question?                THE PRESIDENT:  With regard to Jackson-Vanik and  COCOM, I would make two points:  First, I have agreed with the  Republican and Democratic leaders in the Congress that we will,  as soon as I return, have a list of all the legislative and other  restrictions, some of them are regulatory in nature, imposed on  relations between the United States and Russia, that are legacies  of the Cold War.  And we will see whether they're -- how many of  them we could agree to do away with right now, at least among the  leadership of the Congress.              With regard to Jackson-Vanik, I think there will be  an openness to change the law if the Congress is convinced there  are, in fact, no more refusniks, no more people who wish to  emigrate who are not being allowed to.  If the fact is that there  is no one there who would have been -- who the law was designed  to affect, then I think that the desire to keep the law will be  much less.              With regard to COCOM, my guess is, and it's nothing  more than a guess, that the leadership of Congress and indeed my  own advisers, might prefer to see some sort of phased movement  out of the COCOM regime.  But I think they would be willing to  begin it in the fairly near future.              Q   Mr. Clinton, when I read your speech in  Annapolis, I got the impression that you have a completely  different personal -- and I stress that -- personal, not  political approach towards Russia, compared to the approach of  Mr. Bush.  Could you formulate in a few words, what is the  difference between you as a personality and your approach -- the  difference between your approach to Russia and the approach of  Mr. Bush?  And who made you -- why did you cite Akhmatova in the  last part of your speech?              THE PRESIDENT:  Let me say, first, I do not wish to  compare myself with President Bush or anyone else.  I can't say  what was in his heart about Russia.  I can say that since I was a  boy, I have been personally fascinated with the history, the  music and the culture, and the literature of Russia.  I have been  thrilled by Russian music since I was a serious student of music  for more than 30 years now.  I have read major Russian novelists  and many of your poets and followed your ballet and tried to know  as much as I could about your history.                And I went to the Soviet Union -- but it was then  the Soviet Union -- you may know it was a big issue in the last  presidential campaign that I spent the first week of 1970 alone  in Moscow and did not return again until three days before Mr.  Yeltsin was elected President.  But all that time I was away, I  was following events there very closely and hoping for the day  when we could be genuine partners.  So I have always had a  personal feeling about Russia.                I remember, for example -- a lot of you know I like  music very much.  One of the most moving experiences for me as a  musician was when Leonard Bernstein took the New York  Philharmonic to Moscow and played Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony  to the Russians.  And he played the last movement more rapidly  than anyone had ever played it before because it was technically  so difficult.  That is something I followed very closely when it  occurred.                These are things that have always had a big impact  on my life.  And I had just always hoped that someday, if I ever  had the chance to, I could play a role in seeing our two  countries become closer partners.  (Applause.)

Days ago people doubted that ms-windows is not a real OS. I can see why they have such question. Ms-windows confuses many people. Microsoft simulated Mac, but it did a lousy job.  For example:  (1) You can not create hierarchy groups. There is no way to create a group     in a group. (If you know how, please tell me.) (2) Too many system parameters to take care of.  (3) uncomplete documentation. It's not easy to find the reason why causes     an unpredictable error. (4) Group deleting/file deleting     After deleting a group, users have to use file manager to delete files.     But if users forget to delete some related files, the disk will be full     of nonsense files. (5) share problem     Once you create two windows doing compilation and editing in some     language (w/o good editor), there will be a sharing problem. You just     can not open or save the program if it is loaded. It makes sense to     prevent from saving, but not opening.  Microsoft try to compromise between DOS and windows, but they just make  ms-windows a graphical DOS with capacity doing mutiple DOS jobs;  the worst thing is they complicate the environment. The orginal purpose of ms-windows should be to simplify the environment, and make PC easier  to use.      It's by no means easy to satisfy everybody, but if Microsoft want to keep their reputations, they should evaluate the user interface more carefully before products distribute.

reading Deuteronomy chapter 28.\",\" Outbreaks of a chronic-mono-like entity were originally called EBS (or some variant thereof) because most of the people with this disease had elevated levels of antibodies to the EBV virus. But not all of them did, which prompted an official renaming of the disease to Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (this renaming took place in the Annals of Internal Medicine, Jan. 1988, I believe). Now it's also called Chronic Fatigue and Immune Dysfunction Syndrome (CFIDS), since it seems clear that some sort of immune disregulation is causing the probs.  Astonishly, there are still docs who tell people with massively swollen glands, recurrent fevers and nightsweats, etc., that there's nothing wrong with them. This is not the same thing as saying that the syndrome may have a (at least partly) psychological cause. The disagreement among people whose thoughts are worth considering centers on just what the cause is. No one knows, but theories include: psychological stress, some sort of virus (a retrovirus, say most -- maybe one of the newly discovered herpes viruses), environmental toxins, bacteria (and, yes, candida), genes, (and/)or some combo of these.  There's no outright cure at the moment, but different docs try different things, some of which seem to help.  Massive amounts of info on the condition are available these days.

President Clinton's Remarks On Waco With Q/A  To: National Desk  Contact: White House Office of the Press Secretary, 202-456-2100     WASHINGTON, April 20 /U.S. Newswire/ -- Following are remarks by President Clinton in a question and answer session with the press (Part 2 of 2):       Go ahead, Sarah.       Q  There are two questions I want to ask you.  The first is, I think that they knew very well that the children did not have gas masks while the adults did, so the children had no chance because this gas was very -- she said it was not lethal, but it was very dangerous to the children and they could not have survived without gas masks.  And on February 28th -- let's go back -- didn't those people have a right to practice their religion?       THE PRESIDENT:  They were not just practicing their religion, they were -- the Treasury Department believed that they had violated federal laws, any number of them.       Q  What federal laws --       THE PRESIDENT:  Let me go back and answer -- I can't answer the question about the gas masks, except to tell you that the whole purpose of using the tear gas was that it had been tested; they were convinced that it wouldn't kill either a child or an adult but it would force anybody that breathed it to run outside.  And one of the things that I've heard -- I don't want to get into the details of this because I don't know -- but one of the things that they were speculating about today was that the wind was blowing so fast that the windows might have been opened and some of the gas might have escaped and that may be why it didn't have the desired effect.       They also knew, Sarah, that there was an underground compound -- a bus buried underground where the children could be sent.  And they were -- I think they were hoping very much that if the children were not released immediately outside that the humane thing would be done and that the children would be sent someplace where they could be protected.       In terms of the gas masks themselves, I learned yesterday -- I did not ask this fact question before -- that the gas was supposed to stay active in the compound longer than the gas masks themselves were to work.  So that it was thought that even if they all had gas masks, that eventually the gas would force them out in a nonviolent, nonshooting circumstance.       MS. MYERS:  Last question.       Q  Mr. President, why are you still saying that --       Q  Could you tell us whether or not you ever asked Janet Reno about the possibility of a mass suicide?  And when you learned about the actual fire and explosion what went through your mind during those horrendous moments?       THE PRESIDENT:  What I asked Janet Reno is if they had considered all the worse things that could happen.  And she said -- and, of course, the whole issue of suicide had been raised in the public -- he had -- that had been debated anyway.  And she said that the people who were most knowledgeable  about these kinds of issues concluded that there was no greater risk of that now than there would be tomorrow or the next day or the day after that or at anytime in the future.  That was the judgment they made.  Whether they were right or wrong, of course, we will never know.       What happened when I saw the fire, when I saw the building burning?  I was sick.  I felt terrible.  And my immediate concern was whether the children had gotten out and whether they were escaping or whether they were inside, trying to burn themselves up. That's the first thing I wanted to know.       Thank you.       Q  Mr. President, why are you still saying it was a Janet Reno decision?  Isn't it, in the end, your decision?       THE PRESIDENT:  Well, what I'm saying is that I didn't have a four- or five-hour, detailed briefing from the FBI.  I didn't go over every strategic part of it.  It is a decision for which I take responsibility.  I'm the President of the United States and I signed off on the general decision and giving her the authority to make the last call.  When I talked to her on Sunday, some time had elapsed.  She might have made a decision to change her mind.  I said, if you decide to go forward with this tomorrow, I will support you. And I do support her.       She is not ultimately responsible to the American people; I am.  But I think she has conducted her duties in an appropriate fashion and she has dealt with this situation I think as well as she could have.       Thank you.

For example, is this a public key system or a private key system? If the latter, then I don't see how the system could work (given that the keys are tied to the device and not the person).  Further, the escrowed 80-bit keys are split into two 40-bit chunks. I would guess that the availability of one of these 40-bit chunks and a reasonable key-search machine, would allow you to read the traffic. I'm not suggesting that this is a deliberate weakness of the system, but it does make you think. Of course, this is easily fixable by  giving out two 80-bit chunks which could be x-ored to generate the  real 80-bit key.\",\"Hello,  I am not sure if this is the right conference to ask this question, however, Here I go..

Every phone comes with a built in chip and the government has the key to every phone call.  I go and buy a phone and dutifully register the key.   What's to prevent me from swapping phones with a friend or  buying a used phone at a garage sale? Whooa. The secret registered keys just became unsynchronized. When the government comes  to listen in, they only receive gobbledly-gook because the  secret key registered under my name isn't the right one.   That leads me to conjecture that:  1) The system isn't that secure. There are just two master keys that work for all the phones in the country. The part about registering your keys is just bogus.   or   2) The system is vulnerable to simple phone swapping attacks like this.

The training course will discuss the applications of satellite data concerning natural resources, renewable energy and the environment.  The training course, organised for the benefit of francophone African experts, will be hosted by ESRIN, the European Space Agency's establishment in Frascati, which is responsible for coordination with the users of data from ESA's remote sensing satellite. Twenty-four experts in the field of remote sensing, selected from 19 francophone countries from northern, western and central Africa, and three regional African centres, will attend the two-week session. The course will focus on remote sensing techniques and data applications, particularly ERS-1 data.  The ERS-1 satellite, developed by ESA and launched in 1991 with the European Ariane launcher, carries an advanced radar instrument and is the first in a series of radar remote sensing missions that will ensure availability of data beyond the year 2000. The aim of the training course is to increase the potential of experts using the practical applications of radar remote sensing systems to natural resources, renewable energy and the environment, with particular emphasis on applications to geology and mineral prospecting, oceanography and near- coastal areas, agriculture, forestry and meteorology.  The education and practical training programme was developed jointly by the United Nations and ESA. The facilities and the technical support, as well as lecturers and information documents for the training course, will be provided by the Agency. Lecturers at the training course will include high-level experts from other European and African organisations active in remote sensing applications. Funds for the training course are being provided by the United Nations    Trust Fund for New and Renewable Sources of Energy; the primary contributor to that Fund is the Government of Italy.\",\"  Very sensible.     Must you rave so? Fascist x-Soviet Armenian Government engaged in  disgusting cowardly massacres of Azeri women and children. I am really sorry if that fact bothers you.    More ridicule, I take it? Still not addressing the original points made.   Then what seems to be the problem? Did you ever read newspaper at all?   \\\"PAINFUL SEARCH ..\\\"  THE GRUESOME extent of February's killings of Azeris by Armenians in the town  of Hojali is at last emerging  in Azerbaijan - about 600 men,  women and  children dead  in the  worst outrage  of the four-year war over Nagorny Karabakh.  The figure  is drawn  from Azeri investigators,  Hojali officials and casualty lists published in the Baku press. Diplomats and aid workers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates.  The 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one of the last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full control of Nagorny Karabakh,  the subject of a new  round of negotiations in Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fighting retreat and  a massacre, but  investigators say that most  of the dead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was first suppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku. Later  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-stricken Azerbaijan's wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2,000 dead.  The State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov,  the cheif investigator of a 15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  \\\"Hojali Disaster\\\", said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum on preliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman Memmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed in the Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and more than 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700 dead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswoman of the Azeri Ministry of Defence.  FranCois Zen  Ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the International Red Cross  in Baku, said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of Agdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosque from  Hojali, most  of  them  civilians. \\\"We  did  not count  the bodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy,\\\" Mr Zen Ruffinen said. \\\"We have some idea since we gave the body bags and products to wash the dead.\\\"  Mr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the number of  dead in the  massacre. \\\"Don't  get worked up.  It will take  several months  to  get a  final  figure,\\\" the  43-year-old lawyer said at his small office.  Mr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years to reach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714 wounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist uprising in Baku in January 1990.  Those  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  power three weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly what  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70 miles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians.  Officially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, being the  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the republic's forensic department. \\\"This  is just a small percentage of the dead,\\\" said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic's chief forensic scientist. \\\"They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the chaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury our dead within 24 hours.\\\"  Of these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14 years old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 and axes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highland snows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs of deliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penises cut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov's report. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those believed to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said.  Files  from  Mr  Rasulov's  investigative  commission  are  still disorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, six policemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, the names of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. The most heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so far comes  from Towfiq  Manafov,  an Azeri  investigator  who took  a helicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  27 February.  \\\"There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to count properly: 470-500  in Hojali, 650-700 people  by the stream and the road and 85-100  visible around Nakhchivanik village,\\\" Mr Manafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter pilot.  \\\"People waved up  to us for help. We saw  three dead children and one  two-year-old alive  by  one  dead woman.  The  live one  was pulling at her arm for the mother to get up. We tried to land but Armenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had to return.\\\"  There  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  in circulation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last few months and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in Hojali at the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages taken over by Armenian forces.  THE INDEPENDENT, London, 12/6/'92   HEROES WHO FOUGHT ON AMID THE BODIES  AREF  SADIKOV sat  quietly  in the  shade of  a  cafe-bar on  the Caspian Sea  esplanade of Baku and  showed a line of  stitches in his trousers, torn  by an Armenian bullet as he  fled the town of Hojali just over three months ago, writes Hugh Pope.  \\\"I'm still  wearing the same  clothes, I don't have  any others,\\\" the  51-year-old carpenter  said,  beginning his  account of  the Hojali disaster. \\\"I was wounded in five places, but I am lucky to be alive.\\\"  Mr Sadikov and  his wife were short of  food, without electricity for more than a month, and cut off from helicopter flights for 12 days. They  sensed the  Armenian noose was tightening  around the 2,000 to  3,000 people left in  the straggling Azeri town  on the edge of Karabakh.  \\\"At about 11pm  a bombardment started such as we  had never heard before,  eight  or  nine   kinds  of  weapons,  artillery,  heavy machine-guns, the lot,\\\" Mr Sadikov said.  Soon neighbours were  pouring down the street  from the direction of  the  attack. Some  huddled  in  shelters but  others  started fleeing the town,  down a hill, through a stream  and through the snow into a forest on the other side.  To escape, the  townspeople had to reach the Azeri  town of Agdam about 15  miles away. They  thought they  were going to  make it, until at  about dawn  they reached a  bottleneck between  the two Armenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak.  \\\"None of my group was hurt up to then ... Then we were spotted by a  car on  the road,  and the  Armenian outposts  started opening fire,\\\" Mr Sadikov said.  Azeri militiamen fighting their way  out of Hojali rushed forward to force  open a  corridor for the  civilians, but  their efforts were mostly  in vain.  Mr Sadikov  said only  10 people  from his group of  80 made it  through, including his wife  and militiaman son.  Seven  of  his  immediate  relations  died,  including  his 67-year-old elder brother.  \\\"I only had time to reach down  and cover his face with his hat,\\\" he said, pulling his own big  flat Turkish cap over his eyes. \\\"We have never got any of the bodies back.\\\"  The first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire. One hero  of the  evacuation, Alif  Hajief, was  shot dead  as he struggled to change  a magazine while covering  the third group's crossing, Mr Sadikov said.  Another hero,  Elman Memmedov, the  mayor of Hojali, said  he and several others  spent the whole day  of 26 February in  the bushy hillside, surrounded by  dead bodies as they tried  to keep three Armenian armoured personnel carriers at bay.  As the  survivors staggered the  last mile into Agdam,  there was little comfort  in a town from  which most of the  population was soon to flee.  \\\"The night  after we reached  the town  there was a  big Armenian rocket attack. Some people just  kept going,\\\" Mr Sadikov said. \\\"I had to  get to the  hospital for treatment. I  was in a  bad way. They even found a bullet in my sock.\\\"  Victims of  war: An  Azeri woman  mourns her  son, killed  in the Hojali massacre in February  (left).

Thanks a lot \",\" A question for you - can you give me the name of an organization or a philosophy or a political movement, etc., which has never had anything evil done in its name?  You're missing a central teaching of Christianity - man is inherently sinful.  We are saved through faith by grace.  Knowing that, believing that, does not make us without sin.  Furthermore, not all who consider themselves \\\"christians\\\" are (even those who manage to head their own \\\"churches\\\").  \\\"Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.\\\" - Matt. 7:21.   Again, what historical documents do you trust?  Do you think Hannibal crossed the Alps?  How do you know?  How do you know for sure?  What historical documents have stood the scrutiny and the attempts to dis- credit it as well as the Bible has?   Well, it's really a shame you feel this way.  No one can browbeat you into believing, and those who try will probably only succeed in driving you further away.  You need to ask yourself some difficult questions: 1) is there an afterlife, and if so, does man require salvation to attain it.  If the answer is yes, the next question is 2) how does man attain this salvation - can he do it on his own as the eastern religions and certain modern offshoots like the \\\"new age movement\\\" teach or does he require God's help?  3) If the latter, in what form does - indeed, in what form can such help come?  Needless to say, this discussion could take a lifetime, and for some people it did comprise their life's writings, so I am hardly in a position to offer the answers here - merely pointers to what to ask.  Few, of us manage to have an unshaken faith our entire lives (certainly not me). The spritual life is a difficult journey (if you've never read \\\"A Pilgrim's Progress,\\\" I highly recommend this greatest allegory of the english language).   Now I see by your close that one possible source of trouble for you may be a conflict between your politcal beliefs and your religious upbringing.  You wrote that \\\"I (in my own faith) accept and live my life by many if not most of the teachings of christ\\\".  Well, Christ referred to God as \\\"My Father\\\", not \\\"My Mother\\\", and while the \\\"maleness\\\" of God is not the same as the maleness of those of us humans who possess a Y chromosome, it does not honor God to refer to Him as female purely to be trendy, non-discriminatory, or politically correct.  This in no way disparages women (nor is it my intent to do so by my use of the male pronoun to refer to both men and women -  english just does not have a decent neuter set of pronouns).  After all, God chose a woman as his only human partner in bringing Christ into the human population.  Well, I'm not about to launch into a detailed discussion of the role of women in Christianity at 1am with only 6 hours of sleep in the last 63, and for that reason I also apologize for any shortcomings in this article.  I just happened across yours and felt moved to reply.

AT&T obviously knew and participated in the development of the Clipper chip.  This amounts to unfair business practice and gives AT&T an early monopoly on the market [hopefully a non-existant market]. Other companies that compete with AT&T in the cellular market (Motorola, NEC, etc) have grounds to file a complaint over this.   It would seem that the one fact that the government has overlooked in this whole fiasco is the economic standpoint.  As others have mentioned, the most difficulty the Clipper chip faces is an economic one.  Let's face it, the average consumer doesn't care or know that the Clipper is a bad idea.  If there is a perceived need for cellular encryption, then the companies will provide one.  Most likely, a standard will emerge.  But if the Clipper is too expensive (and $25 a chip is way too much) then they will develope their own or buy a cheaper one.

Supposedly only the isopropyl based cleaners actually remove moisture from your fuel tank as they clean your injectors.  And although the  others (ethyl based) do clean injectors they also cause rubber  components in the fuel system to deteriorate, and they don't mix well with water to help remove it from the fuel system.

If (p,q) is an edge, then (q,p) should *not* appear.    If *both* (p,q) and (q,p) appear as edges, then the surface \\\"flips\\\" when you travel across that edge.  This is bad.

Flip those which        are wrong. Mark all of the edges in F as \\\"OK\\\",        and add them to a queue (check for duplicates, and especially        inconsistencies - don't let the queue have both (p,q) and (q,p)).      2) remove an edge from the queue, and go to 1).  If a *marked* edge is discovered to be inconsistent, then you lose.  If step 1) finds more than one face sharing a particular edge, then you lose.       Otherwise, when done, all of the edges will be consistent.  Which means that all of the surface normals will either point IN or OUT.  Deciding which way is OUT is left as an exercise...   \",\"boards injuring his shoulder and they blotted out the injury report.

Ah, ending discrimination is now fascism.  \",\"From article <1993Apr16.162950.25849@newsgate.sps.mot.com>, by markm@bigfoot.sps.mot.com (Mark Monninger):   A couple of months ago I went to a dealership to test drive a car.  Afterwards, we sat down to discuss prices.  I explained that I wanted a car just like the one I drove, but in a different color.  He said he could get one exactly like I wanted from the dealer network within a day.  We then negotiated a price and signed the deal.  Next day, I get a call.  He explains that they goofed, and they had neglected to take into account a price increase. (The last price increase had occurred over 4 months prior to my visit.)  If I still wanted the car, I would have to fork over another $700.  As an alternative, they would honor the price if I bought the car I test drove (which had been sitting around for  6 months and had a few miles on it). I said goodbye.  This was a good example of how they can lowball you and still cover their butts.  It's too bad more people don't demand honesty or these types of dealers would no longer be in business.    The next dealership I went to was straightforward and honest.  First thing the salesman said was, \\\"Lets's see what you have for dealer cost and work out how much profit I should make.\\\"  The deal went through with no problems.\",\"OK...

This disease is  universally and usually rapidly fatal.  After diagnosis in June 1992, the  tumor was growing rapidly despite radiation and chemotherapy.  The forum  member checked extensively on Dr. Burzynki's track record for this disease.   He spoke to a few patients in complete remission for a few years from  glioblastoma following this treatment and to an NCI oncologist who had  audited other such case histories and found them valid and impressive.   After the forum member's father began Dr. Burzynski's treatment in  September, all subsequent scans performed under the auspices of his  oncologist in Chicago have shown no tumor growth with possible signs of  shrinkage or necrosis.  The patient's oncologist, although telling him he would probably not live  past December 1992, was vehemently opposed to his trying Dr. Burzynski's  treatment.  Since the tumor stopped its rapid growth under Dr. Burzynski's  treatment, she's since changed her attitude toward continuing these  treatments, saying \\\"if it ain't broke, don't fix it.\\\"  Dr. Burzynski is an M.D., Ph.D. with a research background who found a  protein that is at very low serum levels in cancer patients, synthesized it,  and administers it to patients with certain cancer types.

Unfortunately I don't have direct quotes handy...  1) Atheists believe that when they die, they die forever.  2) A god who would condemn those who fail to believe in him to eternal death    is unfair.    I don't see what the problem is!  To Christians, Hell is, by definition,  eternal death--exactly what atheists are expecting when they die.  There's no reason Hell has to be especially awful--to most people, eternal death is bad enough.   Literal interpreters of the Bible will have a problem with this view, since the Bible talks about the fires of Hell and such.  Personally, I don't think that people in Hell will be thrust into flame any more than I expect to Jesus with a double-edged sword issuing from his mouth--I treat both these statements as metaphorical.\",\"  Ermenistan kasiniyor...

I would beg to differ with you here.  The properly-formed conscience can be trusted virtually ALL the time.  I am not so sure, though, about something so materialistic as the human brain.  Does that mass of tissue possess anything trustworthy?  Your observation would probably be valid if we were discussing the \\\"mind\\\" of an animal, but the human being is only half animal, as it were; and half spiritual.   ?At the moment he stops speaking, and people start interpreting, the ?possibility of error appears.  Did he mean that literally or not?  We do ?not have any record that he elaborated on the words.  Was he thinking of ?Tran- or Con- substatiation?   He didn't say.  We interpret this passage ?using our brains; we think and reason and draw conclusions.  But we know ?that our brains are not perfect: our thinking often leads us wrong.  (This ?is something that most of us have direct experience of.  8-)  Now you have hit on the purpose of the Church.  It is by necessity the infallible interpreter of divine revelation.  Without the Church,           Christianity would be nothing more than a bunch of little divisive sects.   ?Unless you are infallible, there are very few things you can be certain ?of.  To the extent that doctrines rely on fallible human thinking, they ?cannot be certain.  This argument of yours regarding the certainty of an observation or a conclusion is not necessarily substantiated by experience.  It reminds me of the theoretical physicist who said that you can never be certain of a measurment because the sensor interferes with the field you are trying to measure.  Now, the experimental physicist will reply that although the measurement can never be made with absolute certainty, he is able to determine the certainty with which the measurement can be made, and this knowledge is often sufficient to render the measurement useful enough to allow evidence of the true condition of the field under observation. Therefore, although our minds are finite and susceptible to error, our competence in arriving at inductive insights gives confidence in our ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true, even in areas not subject to the experimental method.   ?Darren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu ?\\\"If any substantial number of  [ talk.religion.misc ]  readers read some ?

Developing tanks, thermometer, trays,       constant-temperature bath, ground glass, mirrors, darkroom      lamps, glassware, el-cheap-o tripods..... and (as they say)                              MUCH   MORE!   o Beautiful Antique Buffet ............................... $1500.00      Solid cherry (no veneer).  Handmade, with very interesting      dovetail corners in the drawers.  Built (we think) around       1880.  Not gaudy or covered with gew-gaws; a simple, elegant       piece of furniture, but too big (60\\\" long, 37\\\" tall, 24\\\"       deep) for our little Cape Cod house.   Will deliver pricier items (ie, over $10) anywhere in the Rochester  area.  (And will consider delivering the others.)  Will deliver any  of it on (or near) UofR Campus between now and graduation.\",\"      Check out the May issue of MacWorld; the new servers are on the cover. Should be at your favorite newstand.\",\"Interestingly enough, in designing the escrow, we may want to use some rather unusual technology, such as sealed boxes of paper, or destructive read memory, rather than typical computer databases, which is fun for a database of hundreds of millions of keys.  The greatest danger of the escrow database, if it were kept on disk, would be the chance that a complete copy could somehow leak out.  You can design lots of protection, but with enough corruption a complete copy is always possible.   Storing it on paper or something very hard to copy at once may actually make sense.  Or a medium that can't be copied -- for example, something with very slow access times or which leaves a destructive trail if it is even read.  Of course then it's hard to backup.  However, I think the consequences of no backup -- the data is not there when a warrant comes -- are worse than the consequences of a secret backup.  An audit trail that reveals when data has been access, that *can't* be erased by the humans involved, is also necessary.\",\"   Does anybody have a collection of occurances of 42?

I have been told that Motif 1.2 can be used with any X, but I have not seen it myself).    Currently, I have X11R5 running on eight different unix platforms, of which only three came with Motif. On those three, I am unable to use the X11R5 libraries to build Motif clients, because I get link errors between the vendor-supplied port of Motif and my X11R5. I anticipate having this same problem when X11R6 becomes available.    The result is that I cannot build Motif clients that rely on X11R5, since I do not have Motif compiled under X11R5. True, I could buy another port of Motif, but that sort of ruins the whole idea of \\\"free\\\", doesn't it?

These are the same people who are now being called thieves for re-claiming houses that they once owned and lived in and never sold to anyone?   I have never heard of NOT being a Jew as a crime.  Certainly in Israel, there is no such crime.  In some times and places BEING a Jew is a crime, but NOT being a Jew??!!   Our brains do not accept your logic, yet, either.   The way you've written this, you seem to accept criticism in the Arab world UNLESS it deflects criticism from Israel, in which case, we have to presume, you no longer support criticism of the Arab world.

This is but another indicator that the criminal caste seems to enjoy more priviliges in today's society than their victims or other law abiding citizens.

Blacks have the same (+- 2%) crime report rate, arrest rate, and incarceration rate for violent crimes.  So I doubt that for violent crimes, that there is any inherent bias mechanism present.  There is a wider discrepancy for all crimes for blacks wrt to 3 categories.  Interestingly enough, the discrepancy is the largest in the Southern United States -- where blacks are incarcerated well BELOW the average in the rest of the United States! Which points to an anti-bias-against wrt blacks.  In any case, for violent crimes and burglary and drug selling, blacks are reported 53%, arrested 44%, and are present in jails/prisons 47% (1988).  Considering that 12% of the population is black, 6% are black males, and some percentage of that is out of the high/low age groups, we do have a situation where (if I remember my old calculations right) 4% of the population commits almost half of the really nasty crimes.  Blacks with similar histories (crime) to whites get the same sentences, except in the South, where they receive around 20% less on paper!!    --  There are actually people that STILL believe Love Canal was some kind of environmental disaster.

Yesterday marked the seating of the jury.  Apparently no other legal activities occurred.  The jury was selected and things start today.  More interesting is what happenned outside.  About a dozen Weaver supporters showed up to stage a protest outside the courthouse.  One woman carried a sign that read, \\\"Who stands trial for the murder of Vicki and (son's name - I forget) Weaver?\\\"  On the evening news she said, \\\"I am here protesting because I believe in freedom of speech and freedom of religion. I thought we all did.\\\"  Nice sound bite (grin)!  The news reporter also interviewed some guy named \\\"Tim\\\" who refused to give his last name.  Not to prejudge the guy, but he looked like a neo-nazi.  He also said he expected many neo-nazis to show up throughout the trial. \\\"Tim\\\" had been handing out leaflets in support of Weaver and Harris and the news had footage of a Boise cop telling him to move along or he'd arrest.  I don't know the finer points of this one.  Perhaps there's a law against political activity within X feet of a courthouse or something (what happenned to the First Amendment?!?).  Most ominous of all was that the local reporter filmed an agent of the Gestapo...err...ATF with a minicam FILMING THE PROTESTORS!  Welcome to the world of Big Brother.  Anyhow, Gerry Spence came out and asked the protestors to leave because he didn't think it would help Weaver's case any.  He said he was confident that, once the evidence came out, that Weaver would be aquitted.

One of the folks involved in those discussions, a spacecraft engineer named Preston Carter, passed the suggestion on to  some entreprenurial types, and Mike Lawson is apparently going ahead with it.  Preston is now at LLNL, and is working with Space Marketing on  the sensors that might be carried.  Actually, that sounds unlikely.  I don't know what the launch vehicle would be, but I would expect it to go on a commercial launcher -- certainly not on the Shuttle -- and the fraction of the cost paid to NASA for, e.g.,  launch support would probably  cover NASA's incremental costs pretty well.   No, as noted, LLNL is involved in lightweight sensor design, per  Clementine and related programs.

This will be the the first time I've taken anyone for an extended ride    (read: farther than around the block  :-).  We'll be riding some twisty,     fairly bumpy roads (the Mines Road-Mt.Hamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans).  Communication:  work out your own system.  Or just slow down and holler back every once in a while.  At reasonable speeds, even on my under-muffled Magna, we can hear each other.  It's only above, say, 45 MPH that you  can't really communicate.  Balance: New passengers are a real pain, because you never know how they're going to react to steering.  Some people catch on immediately and lean with me.  Others are completely skittish about the leaning thing, and keep their bodies perpendicular to the horizon.  This is a pain while turning, but manageable.  The WORST are the passengers who stay perpendicular to the horizon, then REMEMBER in the middle of a turn and WHIP AROUND until they're in the `correct' position.  This always screws up the line I've picked out.  Here's my personal checklist of things to tell passengers:  - attire: helmet, long pants, boots/heavy shoes, jacket.  - Keep feet on pegs at all times, unless I say otherwise.  Do not    get on/off unless I say you can.  (I've had people try to dismount    in traffic, just as I'm pulling in to a parking space!)  - Muffler gets HOT! ('Nuff said)  - We get *GOOD* traction.  We're not going to fall over.  (Many    first-time riders are surprised by how tightly you can turn!)  - Turn dynamics:  sit so that you feel like you're sitting upright and    we're going straight.  Trust your butt, not your eyes -- if you're    confused, close your eyes for a couple of turns to get the feel    of it.  Or just hug me tight.    - Please, no sudden moves -- shift your weight as desired, but be     gradual, so I can compensate.  - Your faceplate is yours to open/close as desired.  - Trust is essential.  Trust the driver (me) to do the right     thing -- I've driven many miles on this thing, and know how    to operate it.  Enjoy the ride.  (This is important to    stress.  For example, one of my first-time passwngers seemed to     watch the speedo like a hawk:  I drove her to the beach down 84,     and whever we topped 35 mph, she'd holler, \\\"SLOW DOWN! I'M SCARED\\\"     I humored her for a while, then simply covered the speedometer with     the spare piece of duct tape I keep stuck to the top of the cluster.    Problem solved:  she watched the scenery instead of the    instruments, and had a much better time.  Based on her    experience driving a Lincoln Continental, she was unwilling to     trust my ability to choose a safe speed for the bike.)  Usually I'll point out the controls, engine, transmission, brakes,  tires, etc. and discuss motorcycle physics a bit too for first-timers. Helps calm their nerves, and gives the bike a chance to warm up.  Watch out for gravel on the Mt. Hamilton road:  there were lots of little mudslides after the last big rain; by now, many of the blind corners will be nicely covered with a carpet of little, round, nearly invisible stones. It doesn't help build trust when you slide out on a blind corner, on the  first trip!  Good luck -- have fun!\",\" Only the most comprehensive survey on sexuality in 50 years.

He came highly touted as a defensive defenseman, but he's clearly much more than that. Great skater and hard shot (though wish he were more accurate). In fact, he pretty much allowed the Kings to trade away that huge defensive liability Paul Coffey. Kelly Hrudey is only the biggest disappointment if you thought he was any good to begin with. But, at best, he's only a mediocre goaltender. A better choice would be Tomas Sandstrom, though not through any fault of his own, but because some thugs in Toronto decided  to threaten his career in order to avoid conceding a goal. Other than that, the award goes to Robert Lang, an uninspiring Czech. Robitaille could easily be MVP, but I'd prefer to give it to Rob Blake who is quietly becoming one of the league's premier defensemen, and if the Kings manage to hold onto him and the  rest of our young defense, it could one day mean that we'll let in fewer goals than Hartford.

Unless the law has been changed recently, carrying a weapon openly is legal in Colorado but concealing it is illegal.

My top is a 46L and the bottom is a 48L.  For the bottom, the waist is far too large, but the thighs fit just right (the 46 had a better waist, but cut off the circulation in my legs, I have large, muscular thighs, and no, I didn't use the thighmaster to get them :-).  The jacket fits me ok in the chest, slightly snug at the waist, and too small in the arms.  I can't imagine finding a one-piece size that would have fit correctly, as even the 2 piece has it's problems (strange, since my V-Pilot jacket fits great all over, and when I tried the matching pants, they fit like a glove as well).  I can only assume the models Aero Design uses to design its suits are in some way different from us real folks.  Also, even though it's related to convienience, you look pretty damn wierd walking around with the tops and bottoms while running errands. I've gotten some really suspicious looks, and sweated a lot while in a store wearing the whole suit, since you can't fit the top and bottom in any motorcycle storage device yet devised (except the trunk in my sidecar rig :-).  With the two piece, I unzip the pants (I generally leave the two pieces zipped together, primarily because the pants fall down unless I pull the cheesy elastic belt-type band real tight), stuff them in one of my spacious BMW saddlebags (the pants just fit), and run errands just wearing the jacket.  Actually, if I know I'll be running errands, I just wear my V-Pilot jacket, but that's just me...  As far as crash protection, I'd say that both suits are probably equal.  It seems that for weather protection, if anything the 2 piece provides a little more because of the jacket overlapping the pants by 3 inches.  The 2 piece is probably a little less comfortable around the waist, just because of the extra layer of stuff, but maybe not.  So I'd have to vote for the two piece.  Despite the slightly odd fit, I still find the suit the most versatile piece of riding clothing I own.  Wouldn't go long distance without it.

It's probably an economic thing: poor people are more likely to commit crimes, and blacks are more likely to be poor.

It is a fact that the inhabitants of Gaza are not entitled to a normal civlized life. They habe been kept under occupation by Israel since 1967 without civil and political rights.   It is a fact that Gazans live in their own country, Palestine. Gaza is not a foriegn country. Nor is TelAviv, Jaffa, Askalon, BeerSheba foreign country for Gazans. All these places are occupied as far as Palestinians are concerned and as far as common sense has it.   It is a fact that Zionists deny Gazans equal rights as Israeli citizens and the right to determine by themsevles their government. When Zionists will begin to consider Gazans as human beings who deserve the same rights as themselves, there will be hope for peace. Not before.  Somebody mentioned that Gaza is 'foreign country' and therefore Israel is entitled to close its borders to Gaza. In this case, Gaza should be entitled to reciprocate, and deny Israeli civilians and military personnel to enter the area. As the relation is not symmetrical, but that of a master and slave, the label 'foreign country' is inaccurate and misleading.  To close off 700,000 people in the Strip, deny them means of subsistence and means of defending themselves, is a collective punishment and a crime. It is neither justifiable nor legal. It just reflects the abyss  to which Israeli society has degraded.   I would like to ask any of those who heap foul langauge on me to explain why Israel denies Gazans who were born and brought up in Jaffa to return and live there ?

Once you've found a bike you're interested in, call some insurance companies for rates. Some bikes are much cheaper to insure than you might think (my EX-500 only costs me $127/year in St. Louis; I'm 27)  For a first bike, I recommend 500cc's or less. And a bike short enough to get both feet on the ground when you stop.   The one piece of advice EVERYONE will give you is to take a Motorcycle Safety Foundation Rider's Course. See a dealer for details. In some states, completion of such a course can give you a break on insurance. It will also teach you to ride properly from the beginning, so you won't learn any bad habits.  Good luck. Riding a motorcycle is the most fun you can have, naked or otherwise.\",\"I have a pair of Oakleys that cost about $100 new a year ago.  I hardly ever wore them because they just don't look right on me.  They are orange and blue and are the \\\"blade\\\" kind (Terminator style).

You apparently think that would be a good idea.  The Federal Government initiated this action against Koresh and his followers, surrounded them for 51 days, engaged in psychological warfare, used heavy military equipment against US citizens on US soil; and now that the compound caught fire while they were pumping in CS gas after knocking holes in the building; disavows all responsibility.  Big Brother is NOT always right. \",\"The problems with Catholic liturgy are likely to continue for some time.  The problem is, in a nutshell, this: the Liturgy is a symbolic action - in other words Catholics do [or should] believe that the _signs_ during the mass - Water, Blessings, Vestments, Altar, Relics, etc - are real. That is the sprinkling of water bestows real, almost tangible, holiness, the Vestments are a real indication of real sacred time. The point of a _symbol_ is that it is understood by all to be connected to an underlying REAL referent. This kind of thinking precludes analysis; holy water is not holy because of anything, it simply IS holy.  But, modern westerners find it extremely difficult, especially if well- educated, to think of the mass as a symbol. We are more likely to see it as a _sign_, ie an action that represents grace, but which could be replaced with other signs. In concrete terms, this means the mass has become a commercial for God's grace rather than the real thing. You can mess around with a commercial in a way you wouldn't dare with the real thing [ask Coca-Cola Co.!]. These attitudes have been encouraged by Liturgy workshops, etc. which instead of focusing on _how_ to do do liturgy, have focused on how to create a meaning in liturgy. You can only create signs, symbols have to come from God [or the heart, or somewhere deeper than analysis. The most dramatic example of this shift in understanding has been in the treatment of the sacred species [the consecrated host and wine]. Now, with pita bread etc, it is common to come away from the altar with hands covered in particles. If the Host is a sign of Grace, this isnt and issue; but Catholics in the past would have been distraught at this real desacration of the real symbol of Jesus' body.  Modern Catholic liturgy  is caught in this epistemological shift. We try to perfrom the old rites, but then we have some liturgomaniac priest get up and 'explain' what we are doing - so we stop doing it and start pretending to do it. This is not a soul filling experience. It doesn't help BTW that we have got stuck witha huge amount of two and three chord ersatz-folk music [again a result of mis-analysis: complicated tunes are in fact easier to remember than simple ones - this was the genius of Wesley and the 19C Anglican hymn writers]. Taize' is only slightly better.  What are we to do? Well I suggest rejecting the parish system if it doesn't work for you. Search out a Church where the liturgy is well prepared not well-explained. They exist in every city. This is not BTW a matter of particular style: the music might be old or new. It is the attitude of the church that counts. Also, note that a conservative liturgy - harking back to pre-Vatican II days, does not necessarily mean the Church will be socially conservative.  In NYC I can recommend:  Corpus Christi - W 12st St.  Corpus Christi - W 12st St. - very conservative liturgy,   St. Joseph's, Greenwich Village.  - Modern, \\\"clean\\\", largely gay  Oratorian Church, Brooklyn - Very beautiful  Avoid, anywhere, anytime a church with electric candles.  Happy Easter: Christos Aneste', Christos Voskrezhne, Christ is Risen\",\"  OK, Doug is right, it would be obstruction of justice, blah blah blah, BUT, saying \\\"I forgot\\\" is a lie, which is just as bad from a moral point of view _IF_ you think \\\"lawfulness\\\" is a good in and of itself (which  admittedly most people do not.)  But there's an even better way out of this. PROVIDED the government is prosecuting you criminally, you can probably plead the fifth amendmeent and thus LEGALLY avoid revealing your key.  The government cannot demand information from a criminal defendant which \\\"may tend to incriminate\\\" that defendant.  Though this has never been applied in the cryptography context (at least as far as I can tell) it seems an obvious application to me.     This may be a common suggestion in this group, but if it's not (I'm new here) I'd love to hear what people have to say about it.  Since I don't really read this group (and since the subject matter is more legal than cryptoid) maybe misc.legal.computing would be an appropriate place?

Being brought up in a Christian household, I often wondered if there was God the Father, where was the mother? Everyone I know who has a father usually as a mother. It just seemed rather unbalanced to me.   Fortunately, my own personal theology, which will probably not fall into line with a lot others, recognized God as a being both without gender and posessing qualities of both genders, as being both a masculine and feminine force. It provides a sense of balance I find sorely lacking in most theologies, a lack which I think is responsible for a lot of the unbalanced ways in which we see the world and treat each other.\",\"I have a 386/33 with 8 megs of memory  I have noticed that lately when I use programs like WpfW or Corel Draw my computer \\\"boggs\\\" down and becomes really sluggish!

I've been away in  New Jersey all week and was surprised to see all the responses when I got back.    To the person asking about nicotine patches, there are four on the market:\",\"Here is some material by Michael Davies on the subject of schism in general and Archishop Lefebvre in particular.  He wrote it around 1990.  The first part of the two-part article was on the scandalous activities of Archbishop Weakland (in this country), but I cut all that.  And I pared down the rest to what was relevant.  Joe Buehler  ...  Schism and Disobedience  According to St. Thomas Aquinas, schism consists primarily in a refusal of submission to the Pope or communion with the members of the Church united to him. On first sight it would appear that, whatever the subjective motivation of the Archbishop, as discussed above, he must be in a state of objective schism as he has refused to submit to the Pope on a very grave matter involving his supreme power of jurisdiction. However, standard Catholic textbooks of theology make it clear that while all schisms involve disobedience not all acts of disobedience are schismatic. If this were so, as was noted at the beginning of this article, it would mean that the number of American bishops who are not schismatic would not reach double figures.  The distinction between disobedience and schism is made very clear in the article on schism in the very authoritative Dictionnaire de Theologie Catholique. The article is by Father Yves Congar who is certainly no friend of Archbishop Lefebvre.  He explains that schism and disobedience are so similar that they are often confused. Father Congar writes that schism involves a refusal to accept the existence of legitimate authority in the Church, for example, Luther's rejection of the papacy. Father Congar explains that the refusal to accept a decision of legitimate authority in a particular instance does not constitute schism but disobedience.  The Catholic Encyclopedia explains that for a Catholic to be truly schismatic he would have to intend \\\"to sever himself from the Church as far as in him lies.\\\"  It adds that \\\"not every disobedience is schism; in order to possess this character it must include besides the transgression of the command of the superiors, a denial of their divine right to command.\\\"Not only does Mgr. Lefebvre not deny the divine right of the Pope to command, but he affirms repeatedly his recognition of the Pope's authority and his intention of never breaking away from Rome. The Archbishop made his attitude clear in the July/August 1989 issue of 30 Days: \\\"We pray for the Pope every day. Nothing has changed with the consecrations last June 30. We are not sedevacantists. We recognize in John Paul II the legitimate Pope of the Catholic Church. We don't even say that he is a heretical Pope. We only say that his Modernist actions favor heresy.\\\"  ...  Intrinsically Schismatic?  The principal argument used by those claiming that Mgr. Lefebvre is in schism is that the consecration of a bishop without a papal mandate is an intrinsically schismatic act. A bishop who carries out such a consecration, it is claimed, becomes ipso facto a schismatic. This is not true. If such a consecration is an intrinsically schismatic act it would always have involved the penalty of excommunication. In the 1917 Code of Canon Law the offence was punished only by suspension (see Canon 2370 of the 1917 Code). Pope Pius XII had raised the penalty to excommunication as a response to the establishment of a schismatic church in China. The consecration of these illicit Chinese bishops differed radically from the consecrations carried out by Mgr. Lefebvre as the professed intention was to repudiate the authority of the Pope, that is, to deny that he has the right to govern the Church, and the illicitly consecrated Chinese bishops were given a mandate to exercise an apostolic mission. Neither Archbishop Lefebvre nor any of the bishops he has consecrated claim that they have powers of jurisdiction. They have been consecrated solely for the purpose of ensuring the survival of the Society by carrying out ordinations and also to perform confirmations. I do not wish to minimize in any way the gravity of the step take by Mgr. Lefebvre. The consecration of bishops without a papal mandate is far more serious matter than the ordination of priests as it involves a refusal in practice of the primacy or jurisdiction belonging by divine right to the Roman Pontiff. But the Archbishop could argue that the crisis afflicting the Church could not be more grave, and that grave measures were needed in response.  It appears to be taken for granted by most of the Archbishop's critics that he was excommunicated for the offense of schism, and the Vatican has certainly been guilty of fostering this impression.  There is not so much as a modicum of truth in this allegation. The New Code of Canon Law includes a section beginning with Canon 1364 entitled \\\"Penalties for Specific Offenses\\\" (De Poenis in Singula Dicta). The first part deals with \\\"Offenses against Religion and the Unity of the Church\\\" (De Delictis contra Religionem et Ecclesiae Unitatem). Canon 1364 deals with the offense of schism which is, evidently, together with apostasy and heresy, one of the three fundamental offenses against the unity of the Church.  But the Archbishop was not excommunicated under the terms of this canon or, indeed, under any canon involving an offense against religion or the unity of the church. The canon cited in his excommunication comes from the third section of \\\"Penalties for Specific Offenses\\\" which is entitled \\\"Usurpation of Ecclesial Functions and Offenses in their Exercise\\\" (De Munerum Ecclesiasticorum Usurpatione Degue Delictis iniis Exercendis). The canon in question is Canon 1382, which reads: \\\"A bishop who consecrates someone bishop and the person who receives such a consecration from a bishop without a pontifical mandate incur an automatic (latae sententiae) excommunication reserved to the Holy See.\\\"  The scandalous attempts to smear Archbishop Lefebvre with the offense of schism are, then, contrary to both truth and charity. A comparable smear under civil as opposed to ecclesiastical law would certainly justify legal action for libel involving massive damages. An accurate parallel would be to state that a man convicted of manslaughter had been convicted of first degree murder.  I must stress that what I have written here is not the dubious opinion of laymen unversed in the intricacies of Canon Law. Canon lawyers without the least shred of sympathy for Mgr. Lefebvre have repudiated the charge of schism made against him as totally untenable. Father Patrick Yaldrini, Dean of the Faculty of Canon Law of the Institut Catholique in Paris noted in the 4 July 1988 issue of Valeurs actuelles that, as I have just explained, Mgr.  Lefebvre was not excommunicated for schism but for the usurpation of an ecclesiastical function. He added that it is not the consecration of a bishop which constitutes schism but the conferral of an apostolic mission upon the illicitly consecrated bishop. It is this usurpation of the powers of the sovereign pontiff which proves the intention of establishing a parallel Church.  Cardinal Rosalio Lara, President of the Pontifical Commission for the Authentic Interpretation of Canon Law, commented on the consecrations in the 10 July 1988 issue of la Repubblica. It would be hard to      The act of consecrating a bishop (without a papal mandate) is not     in itself a schismatic act. In fact, the Code that deals with     offenses is divided into two sections. One deals with offenses     against religion and the unity of the Church, and these are     apostasy, schism, and heresy. Consecrating a bishop with a     pontifical mandate is, on the contrary, an offense against the     exercise of a specific ministry. For example, in the case of the     consecrations carried out by the Vietnamese Archbishop Ngo Dinh     Thuc in 1976 and 1983, although the Archbishop was excommunicated     he was not considered to have committed a schismatic act because     there was no intention of a breach with the Church.  ....  It is not simply unjust but ludicrous to suggest that in consecrating bishops without a papal mandate Archbishop Lefebvre had the least intent of establishing a schismatic church. He is not a schismatic and will never be a schismatic. The Archbishop considers correctly that the the Church is undergoing its worst crisis since the Arian heresy, and that for the good of the Church it was necessary for him to consecrate the four bishops to ensure the future of his Society. Canon Law provides for just such a situation, and even if one believes that the future of the Society could have been guaranteed without these consecrations, the fact that the Archbishop believed sincerely that it could not means, as Canon Law states clearly, that he has not incurred excommunication. Furthermore, while the Vatican allows such prelates as Archbishop Weakland to undermine the Faith with impunity it cannot expect Catholics to pay the least attention to its sanctions against a great and orthodox Archbishop whose entire life has been devoted to the service of the Church and the salvation of souls.  Dr. Eric M. de Saventhem, President of the International Una Voce Association, is one of the best informed laymen in the Church, and he knows the Archbishop intimately. Dr. de Saventhem, like myself, has no greater desire than to see a reconciliation between Mgr. Lefebvre and the Holy See during the Archbishop's lifetime. A quotation from a statement by Dr. de Saventhem which was published in the 15 February 1989 Remnant merits careful study:\",\" Get Norton Desktop.  Put groups within groups, groups on the desktop, icons on the desktop, etc. \",\" First of all, realize that Tesla invented AC power generators, motors, transformers, conductors, etc. Technically, *ALL* transformers are Tesla coils.  In general though when someone refers to a Tesla coil, they mean an \\\"air core resonant transformer\\\". The TV flyback version Tesla coil (see the _Encyclopedia_of_Electronic_Circuits_ V3, 106-1 for diagram) has NOT an air core. It is of a class of circuit called \\\"Oscillating Shuttle Circuit\\\" (OSC). Generally OSC's are highly efficient, but this version uses transistors and resistors, which are very lossy devices. Typically Tesla used active reactances instead of passive resistors, so that he could achieve efficiencies of 99.5%, and better. The usual application of an air-core resonant transformer, or of an OSC, is to produce strong EMI for wireless broadcasts. How well do you think your computer screen would work if we removed the HF HV Tesla (flyback) coil from it? If we were to remove from our homes and industries all Tesla coils, our lights would go dark, our cars would sputter and die, our radios would go silent, our industries would grind to a halt, and we would have to go back to using coal for heat, gas for lamps, horses for transportation, steam for power, and telegraph for communication.

When I rebooted, I found that about 15 files had gotten \\\"cross-linked\\\" which is a pretty serious corruption of the hard drive file system.  I am concerned that Quick C in a DOS window has somehow strayed outside its protected mode world and corrupted the smartdrv.exe disk cache and that is what caused the disk problem.  I thought that DOS programs run in DOS windows were pretty well-contained  by Windows.  If that is true, then maybe the Quick C compiler has nothing  to do with it.

According to Luke 3:23     And when he began his ministry, Jesus himself was about     thirty years of age, being supposedly the son of Joseph,    the son of Eli,  Aside from the fact that Mary is not mentioned, there are two possible interpretations: either Joseph was her father or he was her brother. Clearly this is not acceptable.  A third would be that Joseph, the son of Eli, was her Father and just happened to have the name as the man to whom she was betrothed. But that would seem to be grasping at straws. The most straightforward interpretation is that Luke had no intention of tracing Mary's genealogy (in which case he would have named her) but that he traces her husband's, from David's son Nathan.  The Matthew descendant list most definitely traces down from David's son, Solomon, to Joseph.  Matthew 1:16 reads:     And to Jacob was born Joseph, the husband of Mary, by whom was born    Jesus, who is called Christ.   There are two apparent problems.  The first is, how to reconcile the two paternal genealogies - which diverge with the sons of David, Solomon and Nathan.  The second is, why is any genealogy of Joseph relavent at all, if Joseph had nothing to do with it.  If Joseph was not Jesus's physical father, then the original poster is quite correct, that claims for Jesus's messianic heritage are not based on truth but only on appearances, whatever Jesus's divine nature was.  The second problem is easy, in my mind.  We assume that Joseph was not involved in the conception of Jesus in any way.  However, a Holy Spirit capable of working a physical conception in Mary is also capable of employing the physical agency of Joseph's seed in this work.  In our materialistic times we interpret viginity and its loss solely in terms of a physical act, whereas it is really a matter of purity on a much higher level as well.  The important thing is that neither Mary nor Joseph was conscious of any union between them (they had not \\\"known\\\"each other).  Thus the first gospel's dedication of half its opening chapter to the genealogy of Joseph is quite relevant to Jesus, the Virgin birth not- withstanding.  To the first question there is an answer that creates, to begin with, more problems than it resolves.  It is that the two evangelists are relating  the births of two entirely different children of two entirely different sets of parents.  Except for the names of the parents and the child, and  the birthplace in Bethlehem there is no point in common between the two  stories.  Matthew and Luke converge in their accounts only thirty years later with the Baptism of Jesus in Jordan.  Rudolf Steiner offered his explanation of how these accounts begin with two children and then converge with their accounts of the one Jesus of Nazareth.  He did not derive his resolution from biblical study or speculation, or from other external documents, and the discussion of \\\"how this could be\\\" might bring us beyond the limits of appropriateness for this newsgroup.  In any case, the details are described in Steiner's \\\"The Spiritual Guidance of the Human  Being and of Humanity\\\", \\\"The Gospel of St. Luke\\\", and \\\"The Gospel of St. Matthew\\\".   Whether or not Rudolf Steiner's methods and explanation are accepted as valid, at least this interpretation resolves the apparent contradictions of the two genealogies while leaving the text intact.  As for the passing of one's Jewishness through the mother, this was never an issue with Jesus. No one ever questioned his or Mary's Jewishness.  The issue of the genealogies has to do with his paternal line of descent from David, the king.\",\"   but what is Saturn's motivation here?  they're already selling every car they make, with multiple shifts in the plant.  given this, what possible motivation could they have to lower prices?  cheers,   richard\",\"I have a wonderful Commodore 128 for sale!!!!

The Amiga Zorro II bus is comparable with the ISA bus (7.16 vs 8.33 MHZ). The Amiga has had a pre-emptative multi-tasking  OS since '85 and can operate with 1 MB RAM!  SCSI is used almost exclusively on these systems.  A SCSI controller that transfers data by DMA allows the cpu to request data from the hard drive and continue working while the controller gets the data and moves it to memory.  A controller that allows reselection can operate even better with multiple devices.  This is espically true with SCSI tape units.  For example, when rewinding or formatting a tape, the command is issued to the controller and the bus is released to allow access to other devices on the bus.  This greatly increases productivity or, at least, do something else while backing up your hard drive :-).  Which happens to be what I am doing while reading this group.  Its a long story, but I still use IDE on my 486 except for the CDROM which, thanks to SCSI, I can move between both machines.  If, and when, SCSI is better standardized and supported on the ibm-clone machines, I plan to completely get rid of IDE. --   Wayne Summer        //        AMIGA - Simply the Best.   Palm Bay, FL.

A lynch mob is a majority, remember, outvoting the hangee.

The name of the company is Secure Communicatiions Technology (Information will be given at the end of this message on how to contact them).     Basically they are disturbed about the announcement for many reasons that we are. More specifically however, Mr. Bryen of Secure Communications brought to light many points that might interest most of the readers.     His belief is that AT&T was made known of the clipper well before the rest of the industry. This is for several reasons, several of which are:   - A company of AT&T's size could never be able to make a decision to use    the new chip on the SAME DAY it was announced.   - Months ago they proposed using their own chip for AT&T's secure telephone    devices. AT&T basically blew them off as being not interested at all.    This stuck them as strange, until now...      Also I spoke with Art Melnick, their cryptographer, he expressed several concerns over the new Clipper Chip:    - The obvious backdoor will be able to let many people decrypt the code.    - Once the key is released to authorities the security of the crypto     system is lost forever. These keys can end up in the hands of any agency     of the government.    - The fact that the escrowed keys never change means that the algorithm     is vulnerable over time to an attacker.    - The classified algorithm may hide another backdoor. But he feels that     it is probably to keep people from forging fake serial numbers, or     changing the keys themselves.    - Additionally he feels that the NSA has probably spent enough time and     money in working on a way to keep this chip from being reversed     engineered, that he feels that reverse engineering it will be very     difficult to do. He feels that they have developed a suitable technique     to protect the chip from this attack. Also he feels that the chip is     hardware encoded with the algorithm and not microcoded onto the chip.  Additonally I spoke with Mr. Melnick about their algorithm. He couldn't tell me much about their new agorithm because it hasn't been patented yet. However he told me a little:   - The algorithm will be released for public review after patents have been    granted for it. This is so the crypto community can see that it is    secure.   - The algorithm is called NEA for New Encryption Algorithm.    The details were sketchy because now it is held as a trade secret    until the patent was issued, but I was told that it will incorporate    the following:      - It will have fast encryption of data (Exact specs not given, but       Mr. Melnick stated \\\"Much faster than what an RS-232 can put out.\\\")      - It is a symmetric cipher, just like IDEA and DES.      - It will use 64 bit data blocks for encryption (like DES and IDEA).      - The key length was not given to me, but Mr. Melnick states that       it is _adujustable_ and is \\\"More than adequate for security.\\\"      - The algorithm is written in C and Assembler in software form, and       can be ported to many platforms (Unlike the the Clipper Chip which       is hardware ONLY and cannot be made into software) This I       consider a definite plus for the NEA for widespread use.      - The algorithm will accomodate public key distribution techniques       such as RSA or Diffie-Hellman. This will also be supported in the       hardware chip.      - Right now the projected cost of the NEA chip will be about 10 dollars       for each!! (Clipper will run 25 each chip [that is if it is produced       enough, which probably won't happen]).      - They currently sell a program called C-COM that uses the algorithm       and a special streaming protocol that does not divide the encrypted       data into \\\"blocks.\\\" This could prevent plaintext attacks if you know       what the block header is. This program operates at all supported       RS-232 speeds and uses the software implementation of the algorithm.      - Most importantly: IT DOES NOT HAVE A BACKDOOR!!    Right now the company is afraid that the new clipper chip will put them out of business. This is a very real possibility. So they really need help in stopping the clipper chip from becoming a standard. If you want to contact them, they can be reached at..

Basic Scenario:   I set up a bbs that uses public-key encryption and encryption of  files on disk.  The general setup is designed so that when users   connect they send a private key encrypted using the system public  key and the user's public-private keypair is used to wrap the  one-time session keys used for encrypting the files on disk.  The  result of this is that even if I reveal the system private key it  is impossible for anyone to gain access to the files stored on the  machine.  What is possible is for someone to use the revealed  system private key to entice users into revealing thier personal  private keys during the authentication sequence.  Questions:   Does the fact that the system private key does not provide any  information useful for a search give me any protection as far as  being coerced to reveal the key?  (I doubt it myself..)   It seems providing the system private key does not mean that I am  assisting in \\\"entrapment\\\" (the users would send thier key anyway  and are not being enticed into doing something they would not  otherwise do) but is there any other hook that can be used?   Would the user private-key enticement require wiretap approval?

When I compile the program, it says I have 4.45 meg of RAM so  I can't seem to explain why it crashes.  All it is doing is running in a loop while the operator is idle and after a while of sitting, it will screw up all the variables. This leads me to believe that my stack is filling up and overflowing.    Does the program take memory up when it is calling void functions that do not return anything??   I have been working on this problem for days and I would really appreciate any responce.  If this is not the correct newsgroup, I will gladly re-post, but this is the only I could find.\",\"From: Center for Policy Research <cpr> Subject: Symbiotics: Zionism-Antisemitism   Zionism and the Holocaust -------------------------- by Haim Bresheeth  The first point to note regarding the appropriation of the history of the Holocaust by Zionist propaganda is that Zionism without anti-semitism is impossible. Zionism agrees with the basic tenet of anti-Semitism, namely that Jews cannot live with non- Jews.  The history and roots of the Holocaust go back a long way. While the industru of death and destruction did not operate before 1942, its roots were firmly placed in the 19th Century. Jewish aspirations for emancipation emerged out of the national struggles in Europe. When the hopes for liberation through bourgeois-democratic change were dashed, other alternatives for improving the lot of the Jews of Europe achieved prominence.  The socialist Bund, a mass movement with enormous following, had to contend with opposition from a new and small, almost insignificant opponent, the political Zionists.  In outline these two offered diametrically opposed options for Jews in Europe. While the Bund was suggesting joining forces with the rest of Europe's workers, the Zionists were proposing a new programme aimed at ridding Europe of its Jews by setting up some form of a Jewish state.  Historically, nothing is inevitable, all depends on the balance of forces involved in the struggle. History can be seen as an option tree: every time a certain option is chosen, other routes become barred. Because of that choice, movement backwards to the point before that choice was made is impossible. While Zionism as an option was taken by many young Jews, it remained a minority position until the first days of the 3rd Reich. The Zionist Federation of Germany (ZVfD), an organisation representing a tiny minority of German Jews, was selected by the Nazis as the body to represent the Jews of the Reich. Its was the only flag of an interantional organisation allowed to fly in Berlin, and this was the only international organisation allowed to operate during this period. From a marginal position, the leaders of the Zionist Federation were propelled to a prominence and centrality that surprised even them. All of a sudden they attained political power, power based not on representation, but from being selected as the choice of the Nazi regime for dealing with the the 'Jewish problem'. Their position in negotiating with the Nazis agreements that affected the lives of many tens of thousands of the Jews in Germany transformed them from a utopian, marginal organisation in Germany (and some other countries in Europe) into a real option to be considered by German Jews.  The best example of this was the 'Transfer Agreement' of 1934. Immediately after the Nazi takeover in 1933, Jews all over the world supported or were organising a world wide boycott of German goods. This campaign hurt the Nazi regime and the German authorities searched frantically for a way disabling the boycott. It was clear that if Jews and Jewish organisations were to pull out, the campaign would collapse.  This problem was solved by the ZVfD. A letter sent to the Nazi party as early as 21.  June 1933, outlined the degree of agreement that existed between the two organisations on the question of race, nation, and the nature of the 'Jewish problem', and it offered to collaborate with the new regime:  \\\"The realisation of Zionism could only be hurt by resentment of Jews abroad against the German development. Boycott propaganda - such as is currently being carried out against Germany in many ways - is in essence unZionist, because Zionism wants not to do battle but to convince and build.\\\"  In their eagerness to gain credence and the backing of the new regime, the Zionist organisation managed to undermine the boycott. The main public act was the signature of the \\\"Transfer Agreement\\\" with the Nazi authorities during the Zionist Congress of 1934. In essence, the agreement was designed to get Germany's Jews out of the country and into Mandate Palestine. It provided a possibility for Jews to take a sizeable part of their property out of the country, through a transfer of German goods to Palestine. This right was denied to Jews leaving to any other destination. The Zionist organisation was the acting agent, through its financial organisations. This agreement operated on a number of fronts - 'helping' Jews to leave the country, breaking the ring of the boycott, exporting German goods in large quantities to Palestine, and last but not least, enabling the regime to be seen as humane and reasonable even towards its avowed enemies, the Jews. After all, they argued, the Jews do not belong in Europe and now the Jews come and agree with them.  After news of the agreement broke, the boycott was doomed. If the Zionist Organization found it possible and necessary to deal with the Nazis, and import their goods, who could argue for a boycott ? This was not the first time that the interests of both movements were presented to the German public as complementary. Baron Von Mildenstein, the first head of the Jewish Department of the SS, later followed by Eichmann, was invited to travel to Palestine. This he did in early 1933, in the company of a Zionist leader, Kurt Tuchler. Having spent six months in Palestine, he wrote a series of favourable articles in Der STURMER describing the 'new Jew' of Zionism, a Jew Nazis could accept and understand.  This little-known episode established quite clearly the relationship during the early days of Nazism, between the new regime and the ZVfD, a relationship that was echoed later in a number of key instances, even after the nature of the Final Solution became clear. In many cases this meant a silencing of reports about the horrors of the exterminations. A book concentrating on this aspect of the Zionist reaction to the Holocaust is Post-Ugandan Zionism in the Crucible of the Holocaust, by S. B. Beth-Zvi.  In the case of the Kastner episode, around which Jim Allen's play PERDITION is based, even the normal excuse of lack of knowledge of the real nature of events does not exist. It occured near the end of the war. The USSR had advanced almost up to Germany. Italy and the African bases had been lost. The Nazis were on the run, with a number of key countries, such as Rumania, leaving the Axis. A second front was a matter of months away, as the western Allies prepared their forces. In the midst of all this we find Eichmann, the master bureaucrat of industrial murder, setting up his HZ in occupied Budapest, after the German takeover of the country in April 1944. His first act was to have a conference with the Jewish leadership, and to appoint Zionist Federation members, headed by Kastner as the agent and clearing house for all Jews and their relationship with the SS and the Nazr authorities. Why they did this is not difficult to see. As opposed to Poland, where its three and  a half million Jews lived in ghettoes and were visibly different from the rest of the Polish population, the Hungarian Jews were an integrated part of the community. The middle class was mainly Jewish, the Jews were mainly middle-class. They enjoyed freedom of travel, served in the Hungarian (fascist) army in fronline units, as officers and soldiers, their names were Hungarian - how was Eichmann to find them if they were to be exterminated ? The task was not easy, there were a million Jews in Hungary, most of them resident, the rest being refugees from other countries. Many had  heard about the fate of Jews elsewhere, and were unlikely to believe any statements by Nazi officials.  Like elsewhere, the only people who had the information and the ear of the frightened Jewish population were the Judenrat. In this case the Judenrat comprsied mainly the Zionist Federation members. Without their help the SS, with 19 officers and less than 90 men, plus a few hundred Hungarian police, could not have collected and controlled a million Jews, when they did not even know their whereabouts. Kastner and the others were left under no illusions. Eichmann told Joel Brand, one of the members of Kastner's committee, that he intended to send all Hungary's Jews to Auschwitz, before he even started the expulsions!  He told them clearly that all these Jews will die, 12,000 a day, unless certain conditions were met.  The Committee faced a simple choice - to tell the Jews of Hungary about their fate, (with neutral Rumania, where many could escape, being in most cases a few hours away) or to collaborate with the Nazis by assisting in the concentration process. What would not have been believed when coming from the SS, sounded quite plausible when coming from the mouths of the Zionist leadership. Thus it is, that most of the Hungarian Jews went quietly to their death, assured by their leadership that they were to be sent to work camps.  To be sure, there are thirty pieces of silver in this narrative of destruction: the trains of 'prominents' which Eichmann promised to Kastner - a promise he kept to the last detail. For Eichmann it was a bargain: allowing 1,680 Jews to survive, as the price paid for the silent collaboration over the death of almost a million Jews.  There was no way in which the Jews of Hungary could even be located, not to say murdered, without the full collaboration of Kastner and his few friends. No doubt the SS would hunt a few Jews here and there, but the scale of the operation would have been miniscule compared to the half million who died in Auschwitz.  It is important to realise that Kastner was not an aberration, like say Rumkovsky in Lodz. Kastner acted as a result of his strongly held Zionist convictions. His actions were a logical outcome of earlier positions. This is instanced when he exposed to the Gestapo the existence of a British cell of saboteurs, Palgi and Senesh, and persuaded them to give themselves up, so as not to disrupt his operations. At no point during his trial or elsewhere, did Kastner deny that he knew exactly what was to happen to those Jews.\",\"has                                                        ^^^^^^^^ Oops, I meant fair, not unfair. \",\"   What, pray tell, does this mean?

If we  unthinkingly adopt pantheistic ideas that are opposed to Christianity,  we can pervert our faith.  When we clearly recognize pantheism when we  encounter it we have the opportunity to embrace what is consistent with  Christianity and reject what isn't.      We need to be alert, always thinking and questioning.  We must examine  the underlying assumptions of every book we read, tv program we watch  and socio-political movement we participate in.  Ideas are important.   Philosophies and doctrines are what give form to the events of our  lives.  They are the basis from which we live our lives of love and  service.  The command to love God with all one's mind means no fuzzy- headed drifting from idea to idea.    One Christian who acknowledges this is the Pope.  It is a frequent theme  in his writings.  Indeed, thoughtful Christians from most traditions  recognize that consumerism has no place in the lives of Christians.  It  too is a perversion and dangerous to our faith.

As per request of Hasan:  From _The Revolt_, by Menachem Begin, Dell Publishing, NY, 1977:  [pp. 225-227]      \\\"Apart from the military aspect, there is a moral aspect to the story of Dir Yassin. At that village, whose name was publicized throughout the world, both sides suffered heavy casualties. We had four killed and nearly forty wounded. The number of casualties was nearly forty percent of the total number of the attackers. The Arab troops suffered casualties neraly three times as heavy. The fighting was thus very severe. Yet the hostile propaganda, disseminated throughout the world, deliberately ignored the fact that the civilian population of Dir Yassin was actually given a warning by us before the battle began. One of our tenders carrying a loud speaker was stationed at the entrance to the village and it exhorted in Arabic all women, children and aged to leave their houses and to take shelter on the slopes of the hill.  By giving this humane warning our fighters threw away the element of complete surprise, and thus increased their own risk in the ensuing battle. A substantial number of the inhabitants obeyed the warning and they were unhurt. A few did not leave their stone houses - perhaps because of the confusion. The fire of the enemy was murderous - to which the number of our casualties bears eloquent testimony. Our men were compelled to fight for every house; to overcome the enemy they used large numbers of hand grenades. And the civilians who had disregarded our warnings suffered inevitable casualties.      \\\"The education which we gave our soldiers throughout the years of revolt was based on the observance of the traditional laws of war. We never broke them unless the enemy first did so and thus forced us, in accordance with the accepted custom of war, to apply reprisals. I am convinced, too, that our officers and men wished to avoid a single unnecessary casualty in the Dir Yassin battle. But those who throw stones of denunciation at the conquerors of Dir Yassin [1] would do well not to don the cloak of hypocrisy [2].      \\\"In connection with the capture of Dir Yassin the Jewish Agency found it necessary to send a letter of apology to Abdullah, whom Mr. Ben Gurion, at a moment of great political emotion, called 'the wise ruler who seeks the good of his people and this country.' The 'wise ruler,' whose mercenary forces demolished Gush Etzion and flung the bodies of its heroic defenders to birds of prey, replied with feudal superciliousness. He rejected the apology and replied that the Jews were all to blame and that he did not believe in the existence of 'dissidents.' Throughout the Arab world and the world at large a wave of lying propaganda was let loose about 'Jewish attrocities.'      \\\"The enemy propaganda was designed to besmirch our name. In the result it helped us. Panic overwhelmed the Arabs of Eretz Israel. Kolonia village, which had previously repulsed every attack of the Haganah, was evacuated overnight and fell without further fighting. Beit-Iksa was also evacuated. These two places overlooked the main road; and their fall, together with the capture of Kastel by the Haganah, made it possible to keep open the road to Jerusalem. In the rest of the country, too, the Arabs began to flee in terror, even before they clashed with Jewish forces. Not what happened at Dir Yassin, but what was invented about Dir Yassin, helped to carve the way to our decisive victories on the battlefield. The legend of Dir Yassin helped us in particular in the saving of Tiberias and the conquest of Haifa.\\\"   [1] (A footnote from _The Revolt_, pp.226-7.) \\\"To counteract the loss of Dir yassin, a village of strategic importance, Arab headquarters at Ramallah broadcast a crude atrocity story, alleging a massacre by Irgun troops of women and children in the village. Certain Jewish officials, fearing the Irgun men as political rivals, seized upon this Arab gruel propaganda to smear the Irgun. An eminent Rabbi was induced to reprimand the Irgun before he had time to sift the truth. Out of evil, however, good came. This Arab propaganda spread a legend of terror amongst Arabs and Arab troops, who were seized with panic at the mention of Irgun soldiers. The legend was worth half a dozen battalions to the forces of Israel. The `Dir Yassin Massacre' lie is still propagated by Jew-haters all over the world.\\\"\",\" No.  Patrick Roy is the reason the game was lost, and Ron Hextall is the reason Quebec won.  Everybody said it would come down to goaltending, that goaltending was the key, etc etc.  Well, the key doesn't quite fit if you're Montreal.  The Dionne penalty was kind of a cheesy call, but let's face it; he literally left his feet to throw an elbow.  Blaming Stewart is just an excuse to avoid facing the fact that Roy allowed what was one of the worst goals he could possibly allow.  He even saw the whole shot, dammit.  Besides, Stewart evened things up a bit by calling a Quebec penalty in OT.  Montreal played a solid game (although they still don't know how to clear traffic in front of the net; the loss of Schneider will hurt even more).  Normally I would say that any team that blows a 2-goal lead with less than  five, let alone two, minutes to go in regulation time IN A PLAYOFF GAME  ESPECIALLY needs to be smacked upside their collective heads.  But I don't think this was a team loss (although Keane should have been able to clear  the zone just prior to the first Quebec goal).  Roy is paid big money to  play.  He looked like a player in an industrial league on Sakic's shot.  Demers should start Racicot in the next game.  If not that, he should let the damn team read the papers for the next day or two....and maybe this article, if possible.   I didn't think the wrap-around was as bad as the second goal.  I also didn't think Scott Young should have gotten around the defender (can't remember who) in the first place.  But you are correct, it shouldn't have gone in regardless.   Yep.  Moog looked bad on Mogilny's goal with five seconds left in the second, IMO.  How about Neely though?   Holy shit, what a player.  Speaking of great players, man-oh-man can Quebec skate.  I haven't seen a team so potent on the rush in a long time.  Watching them break out of their zone, especially Sundin, is a treat to watch.  They remind me of the Red  Army.    But I still hate the team.  On the rest of the games:  Didn't St. Louis' winning goal come on a powerplay?  Penalties will cost Chicago dearly, especially against Detroit.

A new national survey says drugs are easier to get, more teens are     using them and fewer deem drug use as risky.       For the last two years, government officials have trumpeted results     from the National High School Survey as signs that the drug war is     being won.  But this year, officials are retreating - drug use by     eighth-graders has risen, according to the survey of 50,000 students     nationwide.      Possible reason for the increase:  more experimentation.  Why?  If     drug use dropped during the '80s, eventually some students will     have fewer \\\"drug-using contemporaries\\\" who act as examples of     substance abuse's drawbacks, says social psychologist Lloyd Johnston,     one of the survey authors.  Each new wave of youths \\\"must be given     the knowledge, skills and motivation to resist using these drugs,\\\"     Johnston says.      This type of resurgence \\\"is possible,\\\" says Eileen Shiff, author of     \\\"Experts Advise Parents\\\" (Delta, $14.95).  But that's not the issue,     she says.  The prevalence of alcohol and drugs among teens today     could result in more alcoholic adults decades from now.      Aggravating the problem:  baby boomer parents - who experimented with     drugs and alcohol as teens - trying to be friends, not parents, to     their children.  \\\"I've even seen parents serving kegs of beer\\\" to     their underage kids and friends, Shiff says.  For a recent graduation,     Shiff and other parents organized an all-night, \\\"lock-in\\\" party where     no booze or drugs were allowed.  \\\"We need to fulfill that parental     role, otherwise the peer group takes over,\\\" she says.      Officials may \\\"talk about the war on drugs, but they really haven't     done anything that I've seen,\\\" says Suzanne Linkous, Scottsdale,     Ariz., 16, a volunteer who talks with teens about drugs, dating and     other issues on a peer counseling and suicide hot line.  Linkous, a     member of USA Today's Teen Panel, says \\\"there's always going to be     experimentation\\\" with drugs.      A real war on drugs could be waged \\\"education-wise,\\\" she says.  But     \\\"some don't want to give kids the facts.  They think it will give     them ideas; it's the same with birth control.

Let's talk practicality, shall we?  If the Monarch tried to do something, what would happen?            But you illustrated the problem very well.          I am contending that there is no state in the Union which does not have ample wealth, if they choose to spend it, to run a perfectly acceptable Education system.  (I further contend that the amount of money being spent now is more then sufficient, but is being spent badly.)          So, tell me Phill.  Were the Republicans also responsible for some of the *huge* increases in social programs?  Or were they *only*  responsible for what you don't like.  (I contend it is Congress which is to blame.  Democrat and Republican alike.)          Most of our worst areas are still better off than most of Europe. In any case, we're talking about *education*.            Yes, I live in once such area.  You're woefully ignorant of the situation.         At the same time some of Tennessee's school districts are closing down, the Governor asked for 7.5 million dollars for bicentenntial celebration license plats.  In almost the same breath he wanted to raise unemployment compensation and reduce taxes which paid into it.          I don't know about the rest of the country, but *our* education problems stem directly from two problems, neither of which are a lack of money in the state.  (BTW, Tennessee is considered a \\\"tax heaven\\\" and our economy is one of the strongest in the country.  *I* see a correlation.)  1)  What money we spend goes primarly to administration. The average administrator makes two and a half times what the average teacher makes, and sucks up an enormous amount of revenue.  And 2) the Governor is making a concerted effort to create an \\\"Education crisis\\\" in order to push for his pet income tax.  Some of the most idiotic programs get funded (like State funds for new art in the county seat) while schools are closing.  It's not a lack of funds.  It's an unwillingness to spend them on what is more appropriate.  Education is *the* parental hot-button.  Education is *always* the first to but cut, because it's easier to get people to pay for their children than ugly art.         It spoke very eloquently on government being based on the consent of the governed.           They did it anyway.  The Continental Congress had its own set of bylaws.  It wasn't quite a government, but a means of making decisions had to be created.  (However low George Washington's opinion of them were.)         Allow me again to speak heresy against the Holy Democratic Orders. So what?  The government was built with a very non-democratic Presidency with fairly broad powers, including the veto.         Yes, and the Senate was intended to act as a balance to this. Too much democracy was intentionally avoided.  It was considered a good thing to place non-democratic blocks to impulsive action.         So long as Congress has something to sell, people will pay for it.  Most congressmen rake in more money than they need.          No, if the \\\"progressives\\\" don't want the \\\"reactionaries\\\" to move backward, they get the same benefit.  41% of the states is a *lot* of people.  And historically laws with that sort of minority arent' very effective, especially since it is usually geographically concentrated.        When wielding the Federal Big Stick I don't see why they shouldn't have to make a better argument than, \\\"more people than not,\\\" agree.                 I'm not a Republican.  I'm a republican.  :-)                And no, I'm neither a Democrat nor a democrat.                Now, I've asked several times, and all you've done is answer \\\"It isn't democratic,\\\" which I knew before I said it.  Why *should* it be democratic?  We don't have a true direct democracy, and few people advocate one.

GB> I hope you meant \\\"inarguably\\\".  Given the choice, I would rather argue <g>.  No arguments about migranous aura; in fact, current best evidence is that aura is intrinsicially neuronal (a la spreading depression of Leao) rather than vascular (something causing vasoconstriction and secondary neuronal ischemia).  Migraine without aura, however, is a fuzzier issue.  There do not seem to be objectively measurable changes in brain function.  The Copenhagen mafia (Lauritzen, Olesen, et al) have done local CBF studies on migraine without aura, and (unlike migraine with aura, but like tension-type) they found no changes in LCBF.  From one (absurd) perspective, *all* pain is neurologic, because in the absence of a nervous system, there would not be pain.  From another (tautologic) perspective, any disease is in the domain of the specialty that treats it.  Neurologists treat headache, therefore (at least in the USA) headache is neurologic.  Whether neurologic or not, nobody would disagree that disabling headaches are common.  Perhaps my fee-for-service neurologic colleagues, scrounging for cases, want all the headache patients they can get.

We've got guns, they've got a monarch and an economy on the verg of collapse.  Finger pointing across the Atlanticis a waste or time.          Canada has been blaming the U.S. for their problems for years. The simple fact of the matter is this:  Ten years ago they crowed about how great their system was because they'd gotten rid of the guns and the U.S. would be so much better if they'd just get into the divine light shining from the North.  We pointed out that it was cultural differences, and pointed to their pre-control crime rates.  We also pointed out that the history of the entire world contained smuggling, and that whenever something was wanted, it was smuggled in.        If the problem were based on U.S. guns, it would have surfaced years before.         Now more Canadian criminals want guns.  And they are being provided.

Qualifications -- one of the worse finishes in last year's prediction contest.  AL East -- 1993  1.  Baltimore Orioles Why the Orioles?  Well, I pondered long and hard, and it all came down to this:   -- The Blue Jays are going the wrong direction.   -- Can't bring myself to pick the Yankees   -- Milwaukee was a fluke   -- Indians aren't ready to contend   -- Red Sox were bad last year, and didn't get any better   -- Detroit's pitching will be the new definition of \\\"replacement level\\\" \\\"But you don't really think the Orioles will win, do you.\\\"  No.  As a matter of fact, I can't see any team in the American League winning either division on paper (with the possible exception of the Yankees, who I hate).  But some- body has to win, so I pick the Orioles.  \\\"You don't really think that Brady Anderson is going to repeat, do you?\\\"  No.  I'm basing the Orioles prediction on the expectation of big years from Cal Ripken and Glenn Davis.  \\\"Glenn Davis?  That's insane\\\".  Yes.  So, without further ado: STRONG POINTS:  Hoiles, Ripken some years, Olson, getting rid of Billy Ripken. WEAK POINTS:  Segui may start.  Valenzuela (the original 30-something) may be   the fifth starter.  Oates puts his best hitters at the bottom of the lineup.   (Does anybody else think that might be a calculated maneuver to minimize   the effect of a slumping Ripken?  If you can't move Ripken out of the #3   spot, why not move the rest of the line up?) WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Glenn Davis wins comeback player of the year. WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  In a tight pennant race, team trades for Pecota. ObPrediction:  \\\"The Streak\\\" continues.  Harold Reynolds leads the team in   caught stealing.  2. New York Yankees. STRONG POINTS:  Abbot, Key, Perez.  Could have best pitching in American   League.  Boggs should improve on Hayes. WEAK POINTS:  Mattingly still considered best hitter.  The Steinbrenner    factor.  (The Yankees lost to the Mets.  Can wholesale changes be far   behind?)  Never count on rookie pitchers (i.e. Wickman & Millitello) to   win a division. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Boggs hits over .300 WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Howe gets arrested again. ObPrediction:  Mattingly won't top a 700 OPS.  3.  Toronto Blue Jays STRONG POINTS:  Management willing to make big deals.  Management has eerie   power to convince other teams its prospects are not suspects.  Olerud.   Guzman.  Alomar. WEAK POINTS:  The Jackson for Bell trade has shaken my faith in Gillick.   Losing Stewart may hurt rotation (that's *really* a bad sign).  No one in   the outfield can get on base.  Pitching is thin behind Guzman and Ward. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Jack Morris considered Cy Young contender in August WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Club makes no major deals in August. ObPrediction:  Morris will post better ERA and WHIP totals than last year.  And   have a losing record.  4.  Milwaukee Brewers STRONG POINTS:  Pitching staff was exceptional -- last year. WEAK POINTS:  Molitor gone.  Surhoff at third?  Why?  Eldred can't keep it up. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Listach and Eldred play like last year. WOULD BE BAD SIGN:  Bones plays like last year. ObPrediction:  Surhoff won't finish the year at third.  5.  Cleveland Indians STRONG POINTS:  Baerga, Belle, Nagy WEAK POINTS:  Pitching staff thin -- losing Olin really hurts.  Starts Felix   Fermin. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Bielecki's ERA is consistent with his Atlanta starts. WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Ted Power -- bullpen ace. ObPrediction:  Alomar will be back on the DL by the all-star break.  6.  Boston Red Sox STRONG POINTS:  Clemens, Viola, Clemens, Detroit, Clemens WEAK POINTS:  Most incompetent GM in baseball.  Key free agent signing -- Andre   Dawson.  Burks is gone -- Hatcher in center. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Rainouts in between Clemens starts. WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Clemens on the DL ObPrediction:  Russell will make Sox fans forget Reardon.  Interpret that how   you will :->  7.  Detroit Tigers STRONG POINTS:  Tettleton, Phillips, Whitaker WEAK POINTS:  If Fielder keeps declining, he'll be a shortstop this year.   Worst rotation in baseball entirely replaced -- but not necessarily better.   This year could be *very* ugly. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Cecil Fielder deserving the MVP. WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Cecil Fielder not whining about deserving an MVP. ObPrediction:  Cecil *won't* lead the league in RBIs.  One more division to go.... --  Dale J.

Jim,  There are a couple of things about your post and others in this thread that are a little confusing. An atheist is one for whom all things can be understood as processes of nature - exclusively. There is no need for any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything. There is no purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by physics, chemistry, biology, etc.; everything is random, nothing is determnined. This would also have to include human intelligence of course and all its products. There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it acquire intelligence, it's just a happy accident. For an atheist, no event can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less value than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about- an event can have value.  The products of our intelligence are acquired from our environment, from teaching, training, observation and experience and are only significant to the individual mind wherein they reside. These mental processes and the images they produce for us are just electrical activity and nothing more; content is of no consequence. The human mind is as much a response to natural forces as water running down a hill. How then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing the values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? On what grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? It seems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, you have to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but what in nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke to establish your values. Since every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what difference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or otherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The only way an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the objection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn't like it - that's it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer that it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries no weight in any \\\"absolute\\\" sense. That you don't like what God told people to do says nothing about God or God's commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled with a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That your objections -seem- well founded is due to the way you've been conditioned; there is no \\\"truth\\\" content. The whole of your intellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality. I didn't make these rules, it's inherent in naturalistic atheism and to be consistent, you have to accept the non-significance of any human thought, even your own. All of this being so, you have excluded yourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil, etc. and cannot participate. Your opinion about the Bible can have no weight whatsoever.\",\"Has David Wells landed with a team yet?

For instance, 'No one should ever deliberately inflict pain on another simply to take pleasure in his suffering' might be thought of as a plausible example.  Even in a world of sadists who all rejected it, the contention remains true, just as '5 + 7 = 12' remains correct even if there is no one left to count.  The problem for the objectivist is to determine the status of moral truths and the method by which they can be established.  If we accept that such judgements are not reports of what is but only relate to what ought to be (see naturalistic fallacy) then they cannot be proved by any facts about the nature of the world.  Nor can they be analytic, since this would involve lack of action-guiding content;  'One ought always to do the right thing' is plainly true in virtue of the vords involved but it is unhelpful as a practical guide to action (see analytic and synthetic).  At this point the objectivist may talk of 'self-evident truths', but can he deny the subjectivist's claim that self-evidence is in the mind of the beholder?  If not, what is left of the claim that some moral judgements are true?  THe subjectivist may well feel that all that remains is that there are some moral judgements with which he would wish to associate himself.

Please help - reply by E-mail to:  traversmorgan@swell.actrix.gen.nz\",\"I posted about this a while ago but without code excerpts noone was able to help me.  The problem is that main_win.win is doing fine, but when I create detail_win.win, it does not receive it's initial expose events until main_win.win receives an event. Here are the relevent calls:  main_win.win = XCreateSimpleWindow (mydisplay, DefaultRootWindow(mydisplay),                 myhint.x, myhint.y, myhint.width, myhint.height,                 main_win.line_thick, fg, bg); XSetStandardProperties(mydisplay, main_win.win, main_win.text,                 main_win.text, None, argv, argc, &myhint); main_win.gc = XCreateGC (mydisplay, main_win.win, 0, 0); XMapRaised (mydisplay, detail_win.win); XMapSubwindows (mydisplay, main_win.win); The event mask for main_win is:         PPosition | PSize | StructureNotifyMask | ExposureMask| KeyPressMask |         EnterWindowMask | LeaveWindowMask; The flags are         PPosition | PSize  I then create detail_win.win with the following calls (hints has new values): detail_win.win = XCreateSimpleWindow (mydisplay, DefaultRootWindow(mydisplay),                 myhint.x, myhint.y, myhint.width, myhint.height,                 detail_win.line_thick, fg, bg); XSetStandardProperties(mydisplay, main_win.win, detail_win.text,                 detail_win.text, None, argv, argc, &myhint); detail_win.gc = XCreateGC (mydisplay, detail_win.win, 0, 0); XMapRaised (mydisplay, detail_win.win); Event Mask and flags are identical to main_win's flags and event mask.   If anybody has any idea why the initial expose events of detail_win.win are not received until main_win.win receives an event I'd love to hear from them. Other that that everything works great so there must be some detail I'm overseeing.

First Base:  Grace vs Destrade...Could Destrade be the second coming of Cecil Fielder? I doubt it. If Destrade performs to the height of expectations, then even, otherwise, edge to Cubs  Second Base:  Sandberg vs Barberie...No contest. Sandberg will be back May 1. Edge to Cubs...a big edge.  Shortstop:  Vizcaino vs Weiss...Vizcaino is excellent defensively, but is an automatic out at bat. Weiss isn't much better with the stick. Even.  Third Base:  Dave Magadan vs Buechelle...Magadan has a higher OBP and is a better hitter. Buechelle has more power and is better defensively (I think) Edge to Florida.  Catcher:   Santiago vs Wilkins...Wilkins is OK, but Santiago is better. Edge to Marlins  Left Field:  Conine vs Maldonado...Wow! 4 for 4 yesterday...I know Conine has potential. I watched him play at Omaha the last couple years. Until he actually proves himself, I give Maldonado the edge, however, like at 1B, this is position where Florida might be even or better *if* the player there has a huge year.  Center:  Scott Pose vs Wilson/May...Edge to May, even if Wilson. Hopefully the Cubs will use may and save Wilson for pinch running and the like. May isn't Ken Griffey Jr, but he will hit .275 with 15 homers if he plays full time.  Right:  Felix vs Sosa...Felix Jose has occasional power and a bad OBP. So does Sosa, but Sosa also has speed and a good glove. Edge to Cubs  Starters:  Aquino? Armstrong? Hammond? A lot of fifth starters here. The Cubs won't remind anyone of the Brave staff, but Morgan-Castillo-Guzman-Hibbard is average to OK...better than the Marline. Edge to Cubs  Middle Relief:  Even. The Cubs have some decent middlemen, and so do the Marlins. Carpenter anf Klink or decent, but so are Assenmacher and McElroy.  Closer:  A healthy Harvey is a big edge to the Marlins. Meyers is decent, but no Harvey. Of course, the Cubs may have a few more games to save. Look for 30 saves, 5 blown from Meyers, and 25 saves, 3 blown (with a better ERA) for Harvey. Edge Florida.  Overall, an edge to Chicago. Neither of these teams will threaten to win anything, of course. e -- msilverm@nyx.cs.du.edu    GO CUBS!!!\",\"day    Brent shows his ignorance once again.

Let's assume a brute-force engine like that hypothesized for DES:  1 microsecond per trial, 1 million chips.  That's 10^12 trials per second, or about 38,000 years for 2^80 trials.  Well, maybe they can get chips running at one trial per nanosecond, and build a machine with 10 million chips.  Sure -- only 3.8 years for each solution.  IDEA uses 128-bit keys.

Authorities sometimes tell people to do evil things.  People who \\\"just follow orders\\\" have tortured and killed others in very large numbers, and protest their innocence afterwards.  When your authority starts telling you to do things, you should ask questions.  Except for situations of pressing need (\\\"I said shut the hatch because the submarine is filling with water!\\\"), any reasonable authority should be able to give at least some justification that you can understand.  Just be sure to listen when authority answers.  (If anybody is interested in questions of psychological pressure and  following orders, you might want to read about a study done by Solomon Ashe  in 1951 on conformity, and another done by Stanley Milgram in 1963 on  obedience.  Both should be in any good book on psychology/sociology.  The  results are both fascinating and terrifying.) \",\"He doesn't contradict himself.  The church is to last for all time. However, there are those who use the church to bolster themselves.  This is evident in many letters.  For instance, Paul talks about the \\\"super-apostles\\\" to the Corinthians (2 Corinthians 11-12), he mentions how people will be led away by miracles, signs, and wonders (2 Thessalonians 2:9-12), he tells Timothy that it is clear that some will abandon the faith and teach lies (1 Timothy 4:1-3) and that some will search for teachers to suit what they want to hear (2 Timothy 4:3-4). Such passages go throughout the letters and Jesus does warn about them (Matthew 24:4-14).  But look at the promise in this last part.  Verse 14:  \\\"And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.\\\"  Even today, there are false teachings.  I can name two which I am well familiar with:  the non-need of baptism and the \\\"praying of Jesus into your life for salvation\\\".  Both are taught.  Both are DEAD wrong.  They have been taken out of context from some verses, interpreted from others, and just plain made up.  The ONLY way Jesus taught is given in Luke 9:23-26 and Luke 14:25-33.  He then commands baptism in Matthew 28:18-20.  The church Jesus founded, though, is alive and well.  It's not being persecuted as much as back then (the laws won't allow it yet), but it is being persecuted.  Joe Fisher\",\"A while back I asked for help in defending a traffic ticket I received.  In short:      The ticket was for not stopping at a stop sign. Given the conditions    I could not stop in time and decided instead of sliding right through the    intersection, I would complete my right-turn and avoid a possible accident.    A police cruiser happened to be approaching the intersection from my left    and gave me the ticket.

It is extremely easy to use, make reports, etc.  I own both it and Paradox, and I almost never use Paradox.  If you need to  build up a complicated application, then Paradox is the way to go.  I have heard horror stories about the Access programming being extremely cryptic. Since you seem like you will probably be doing fairly small stuff (work/ home use and you have not used a database before), I recommend Approach.  I  have found only one small thing which I would like it to do more easily: I have one database where the order in which the records are entered must  be different than what is the logical ordering.  To permanently reorder (to  use the old DBASE III command) the records requires sorting the records  appropriately (no problem, since I almost always use them in this order) exporting the database to another database (which can still be an Approach  database), and then copying the exported files back to the original  filename.  This is a small weakness, considering the other items I really  like about Approach.  It is also a little slower than Paradox (other than  the loading, Paradox takes forever and a minute to load).  Paradox also  takes a lot of memory (both hard disk (around 12MB) and RAM).\",\" I'm afraid he isn't.

That is--you get high quality secure NSA classified technology if you agree    to escrow your key. Otherwise you are on your own.  That's the disturbing part - use of other products IS voluntary, for now, and the press releases talk about the White House's unwillingness to decide that citizens have a right to good commercial crypto gear, and about how commercial alternatives will be permitted as long as they provide key escrow services.  That's a clear implication that they're considering banning alternatives.  Additionally, use of real alternatives ISN'T totally legal - you're not allowed to export really good crypto equipment except to the government's friends (e.g. the Australian government) you can only export even BAD crypto equipment with their permission, and the regulators who control the cellular telephone companies make sure there are only two competitors, so Joe's Garage Cellular can't start offering a secure service.  \",\"Hello.

To prepare for Magnetometer Calibrations which were rescheduled for execution in Flight Sequence C9 on Tuesday and Wednesday of next week, a reload of Payload Data System Random Access Memory will take place this morning beginning at 10:30 AM.  Over this weekend, the Flight Team will send real-time commands to perform Differential One-Way Ranging to obtain additional data for analysis by the Navigation Team.  Radio Science Ultra Stable Oscillator testing will take place on Monday .  The Flight Sequence C9 uplink will occur on Sunday, April 25, with activation at Midnight, Monday evening April 26.  C9 has been modified to include Magnetometer Calibrations which could not be performed in C8 due to Contingency Mode entry on April 9.  These Magnetometer instrument calibrations will allow the instrument team to better characterize the spacecraft-generated magnetic field and its effect on their instrument. This information is critical to Martian magnetic field measurements which occur during approach and mapping phases.

The sad truth is: sometimes that is good, or at least, better than the alternative.   Ok.  There are about 1400 fatal firearm accidents per year [1], and the number has been in decline since early this century [2].  Most of these accidents involve rifles or shot guns, not handguns.  ...  In fact there are both guns and bullets designed specifically for that.  The idea that my Ruger Mark II Bull Barrel (a semi-auto 0.22 caliber handgun) was designed to kill or hurt people, even for self defense, would, I'm sure, come as a surprise to its designer.  It certainly isn't why I have it.  It certainly would hurt someone if you shot them with it, and might even kill them, but it is simply wrong to say it was designed to kill people.   In fact, that is what happens most of the time.  Most self defensive uses of firearms don't involve firing any shots.  Most criminals would prefer not to be shot, and will go to some effort not to be, including doing what you say when you point a gun at them.  If you were called on to design a tool, that could be easily carried, to immediately stop someone attacking you, what would it be?  A handgun is about the best anyone has come up with and experience shows it does work the best.[3]   Certainly, no one argues that handguns (of the type we are discussing) aren't deadly weapons.  However, it simply isn't true to say that all of them were designed to kill people.  Moreover, what exactly is wrong with having deadly weapons?  There are times when it is perfectly legitimate to use deadly force, e.g. in self defense.  I consider it not just my right, but my duty to defend myself and my family, and that includes having and knowing how to use the tools to do that.  \\\"The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government.\\\"  - T. Jefferson.  I think what Jefferson said is still true.   Not very often compared to other use.[3]   This isn't that common either, at least when compared to other uses.  It is very rare that a non-violent person will suddenly \\\"get-pissed\\\" and kill someone, gun or not.  In most cases, the people who murder have long histories of violence.  If you have good reason to believe that these people wouldn't kill if they didn't have a gun, feel free to present it.   Right, but there are times when killing things is called for.  I hope I never have to shoot a person, but I've had to kill a number of animals from rodents to cows, and when I do, I don't want them to suffer any more than is necessary.  I prefer they die instantly, but failing that, I want them to drop so I can quickly finish them with the next shot, and failing that, I don't want them to go fast or far.  I try to choose the best weapon and ammunition I have to try to achieve that goal for the size of animal I'm after, but it doesn't always work as I plan.  Without belaboring the point, people who are overly impressed with the killing or shopping power of guns, particularly handguns, haven't used them much for that purpose.

In 1932, the accidental deaths by firearm per  1,000,000 people was 24.03. In 1987, it was 5.74. The decline has been  steady, consistent, and a fairly straight line when plotted. At the rate  of the last sixty years, it will reach zero sometime around 2025 AD.  CONCLUSION ========== Firearms have been a declining factor in accidental deaths for over  sixty years, despite rising per-capita gun ownership.    [1] = Year. [2] = Population. [3] = Accidental deaths. [4] = Accidental deaths per 1,000,000.

The only thing that has happened is that  the two sides have exchanged roles.  The USA has a higher imprisonment rate (400 per 100,000 population) than any country in Europe by a factor of 10 or so.  In California, it is over 600 per 100,000 population.  The prison population in California is now over 100,000, a quadrupling since 1980.  Most of these inmates were convicted under the drug prohibition laws.  Police now confiscate property, without trial, under a \\\"good faith probable cause\\\" standard, in the name of depriving the horrible ghastly drug dealers of their ill-gotten gains.  Conduct an opinion poll, and a majority will answer \\\"yes\\\" if you ask them whether civil liberties and due process should be diluted in order to Send Our Young People The Message That We Are Serious About Winning The War On Drugs.  I don't know whether anyone has measured such a figure among gun owners, but I would expect the same result.  They certainly seem to vote that way.  According to Jack Herer's book _The Emperor Wears No Clothes_, over TWELVE MILLION YEARS of prison time have been served under the marijuana prohibition laws, by people who were minding their own business and causing no harm to others (and less harm to themselves than users of tobacco, with 400,000 confirmed kills/year).  Under the \\\"War on Drugs\\\" campaign of \\\"zero tolerance\\\" due process protections have eroded, and mandatory sentences of ten years without parole have proliferated.  By and large, gun owners have voted for the politicians who favor such measures.  And now, all the precedents--not only legal, but political:  \\\"My fellow Americans, we must send our young people the message that we are serious about winning the War On Murder\\\"--are going to be applied to the oncoming wave of gun prohibition laws.  Gun owners are about to get a taste of the medicine they voted for believing it would be used only on those with different tastes in recreational drugs.  What goes around comes around. \",\"I was lloking at the Geo Prizm Lsi today (very nice).  Anyway, I had a questions that the salesperson couldn't answer.

Since my note taking ability is by no means infallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is  granted to copy this without restriction.  Michael Sternberg, Cheif of Operations of RIMSAT, was invited to speak at an informal lunch held by ACDIS here on the campus of the University of Illinois. ACDIS is an organization on campus that deals with Arms Control, Disarmament and International Security.  RIMSAT was considered an appropriate topic because the company is using Russian launchers and satellites.  I think it also helped that his daughter is a grad student in the International Relations program.  The concept behind RIMSAT apparently began when Matt Neilson (?) went to Tonga to visit a friend.  While he was there, he somehow ended up visiting the king, who happened to be a big TV fan.  Matt bought the King a satellite dish, which  the king thought was really nifty.  Since Tonga has a GNP of about $70 million, His Majesty asked if there was any way to make money off this.  Matt thought there probably was, so at his suggestion, Tonga applied for 31 geosynchronous satellite slots.  While this isn't entirely off the wall, it was very unusual, seeing as Tonga was a tiny kingdom with no space program, and 31 is a lot of slots.  The whole thing was debated in the appropriate regulatory agency and Carl Hilliard (who is apparently a respected space lawyer) wrote several opinions supporting Tonga's case.  Eventually Tonga ended up with 7 slots, ranging from  70 E to 170 E (slots are designated by the longitude over which they reside). According to Sternberg, four of these, from 130 E to 142 E are the best in the world because they are excellently placed for communications between Hawaii and  the Pacific Rim.   RIMSAT was formed to use these slots. It was officially formed in Nevis as a tax haven.  They tried for a few years to raise funds in the west, however, to fill 7 slots with western satellites launched on western launchers would have cost approximately $2 billion.  It's not easy to raise that kind of money. Eventually, they hit upon the idea of using Russian hardware.  They began  negotiating with Glavkosmos for hardware.  Mr Sternberg describes operating in  Moscow in such harsh terms that I don't think I'll visit there for a long time. Besides a significant lack of creature comforts, he was not happy with the way that people operate.  For example \\\"everybody can sell you everything.\\\"   Everyone can show the proper documents and licenses that indicate they are the only ones who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by.  Eventually, RIMSAT arranged a deal with Glavkosmos for 6 satellites at a cost of $150 million.  However, Glavkosmos lost favor after the coup.  Sternberg says that this is because they were basically a bunch of KGB operatives who  went to trade shows and picked up lots of brochures.  Since Glavkosmos was out of power, he had to renegotiate the deal with the new authorities.  He again described life in a Moscow hotel in rather unfavorable terms.  Eventually, he worked out a deal and on Dec 4, 1992 he met with Koptev, who heads the  Russian space program, to sign the deal.  Koptev insisted on a few concessions before signing and according to Sternberg he arranged these new rules to  allow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing as RIMSAT.  The next step was to meet with the builders of the hardware, NPO Applied  Mechanics -- NPO PM to use their acronym.  This organization is located in  Siberia (can't figure out how to spell the town, I need an atlas) and has built about 1500 vehicles since the dawn of the space age.  Sternberg commented that siberians are very different from Musovites.  They are hard workers, honest people who team up to get things done, very much like midwesterners.  At this point there were some comments from the audience that agreed with his opinion on both siberians and midwesterners :-)  Sternberg had lots of good things to say about NPO PM.  His company is  apparently lookng for $100 million to invest in the firm to become 50% partners.It apparently costs the Russians about $4 million to build a satellite that would sell for $50 million in the west.  If you want to give them  specifications, they'll build you a satellite.  For the particular satellites that RIMSAT will be using, costs run about $378,000 per transponder year.  This compares to $810,000 t/y in the U.S.  They can sell their time for about $1.1 million compared to $2.6 million in the U.S.  RIMSAT will launch their  satellites on Protons.  To get the best prices, they bought in bulk.  They  have the rights to twelve launches, so if any of you need a lift I can give you their address.  The first launch is scheduled for October and they are getting one used satellite from the Russians, which is being moved into place now.  Tidbits:  *  Sternberg says this kind of thing has to be done by entrepreneurs, not big business because big business is just like what they have over there, except that \\\"we have better paper, both in the bathroom and in the copier.\\\"  *  Russian launches are self insured.  The promise to replace a failed launch within 9 months.  *  Major investors in RIMSAT include Russell 20/20, which is a huge retirement fund organization, Cellsat, which is a big telecom business in southeast Asia, and a fund operated by some of the big names in U.S aerospace which he says is sort of an insurance policy for them if this really takes off.  *  He downplayed the instabilites in the ex-USSR saying that we are worried partly because we aren't used to seeing Russia as anything but an unvarying monolith.  Italy gets a new government \\\"every two weeks\\\" but we don't worry  because we're used to it.  He predicted that once we get used to seeing what really goes on in Russia we won't worry about their stability as much.  *  Part of the problem with cooperative ventures is the problem of transfering money.  The central bank has a policy of taking hard currency payments, putting 25% in their coffers and replacing the rest with the \\\"equivalent\\\" value in  rubles.  To get around this, RIMSAT pays their hard currency into an Austrian bank account.  NPO PM then pays their contractors with foreign currency so that the only the contractors get swindled by the government.  *  One of the big problems RIMSAT has had is stonewalling by the western  satellite industry.  However, Intelsat recently bought three of the same type of satellites, which was rather reassuring.  *  The biggest worry most people have about russian satellites is the primitive technology and shorter lifetime.  The older Gorizont (Horizon) satellites have a lifetime of about 5 years, while the more modern Express satellites compare well with western technology and last about 8 years.  While this is much  shorter than 15 years for western satellites, Sternberg downplayed the  difference.  At these prices they can afford to launch new ones.  In addition, shorter lifetimes mean that they can replace their equipment with newer technology so they will be able to compete better than older, out of date hardware. \",\"When I left, it was 4-3, Blues with 2:00 to go!

Also consider that it looks like Denning has some decent NSA / government connections, which is always a plus for an academic institute that wants more government funding and work tossed their way.  Despicable, yes; career limiting, well, the publicity probably outweighs the drawbacks.  And there are a whole bunch of people who think the whole thing is just peachy keen. If it's only going to be used against drug dealers, child pornographers, and terrorists, well it must be good. :p\",\" The Proton has been used in 2, 3, and 4 stage versions.  The two stage version was used for the first 3 launches, while the 3 and 4 stage versions are used today.  The four stage version is used mostly for escape (and geosynchronous?) orbits, while the 3 stage version is used for low earth orbits.  Since this is the version that launched Mir and the Salyuts (and the add-on modules for Mir), as long as Centaur is smaller than Mir (which I believe it is), it should fit under the shroud.  I vaguely recall that the Russians are developing a LH2/LOX upper stage for the Proton.\",\" : >People who reject God don't want to be wth Him in heaven.

I  am looking for somthing in the range of $1 in quantities of about  1000-10,000.

Even Digikey's cheapest offering is $5 in  quantity.  I know LCD displays like this must exist because I see whole  calculators for sale for $4.99, meaning the retailer probably buys it  for $3.50 and the wholesaler probably gets it for $2.50 or so.  This  $2.50 includes assembly labor, packaging, sales, transportation,  import duties, the case and keyboard, the PC Board, the processor  chip, the solar cell --- and the LCD.  The LCD can't cost much.

It was never a very stable package, but now it seems to crash every   day.  The worst part about it is that it does not crash consistently: ie I   can't reproduce crashes, and they are not always GPF's in the same   application. Sometimes I can recover by simply closing the application   that caused an error, but other times, windows acts very strange, and I   need to re-boot.  Some background:  I have a Leading Edge 486sx25 with Phoenix BIOS.  When I   first got it it had 4Mg of memory.  It ran windows fine (not too many   GPF's).  Then, a couple of weekends ago, I installed Lotus 123 for windows   (with ATM), a game card and an additional 4  1Mg SIMMS.  The Leading edge   machine is kind of strange, in that it has the IDE controler built into   the motherboard, the CPU is actually on a sparate board that plugs into   the motherboard and the SIMMS it uses are Macintosh SIMMS! Apparently I   was told that the Leading Edge had the parity bit built into the mother   board.  The original 4Mg 80ns SIMMS where of the 2 chip variety from   SAMSUNG, and the ones I installed are 8 chip SIMMS. They are recognized   fine by the BIOS RAM check. The game card is a generic $20 gamecard.  The reason why I mention the hardware like this is that sometimes   rebooting the machine using the reset button or ctl-alt-del still leaves   the machine kind of flaky, but turning it on and off doesn't.   I haven't tried taking out the RAM or the game card, because as I said   these GPF are not reproducible at will.  I have gone through and entire   day using the computer with no problems and then I might get 5 or so GPF's   in the sppace of 20 minutes?  What can I do.  This situation is most annoying... Are there any good   diagnostic tools for hardware? Do you think that this might be a software   problem (ie EMM386 etc.)? If it helps, i have manage to get GPF's on After   Dark, quicken, Paint shop pro. A lot of them have been in user.exe or   gdi.exe.

The White House said that to assure privacy, each device containing the encryption devices would be assigned two unique \\\"keys\\\" - numbers that will be needed by government agencies to decode messages.     The attorney-general has been assigned the task of arranging that the keys are deposited in two \\\"key-escrow\\\" data bases.

Or is there something that I'm not doing right, and Q6 can actually do that?  Anyway, MYM seems to be able to handle monthly deductions.  In fact, it can apparently do better than that. That is, you can specify monthly, bimonthly, quarterly, even yearly. Anyway, is anyone aware of a comparitive study of the two programs? Or can someone just give me their own personal impressions?

Neto):  This all sounds suspiciously like my company might have something to do with this.  Background first: Megatek has a series of framebuffers designed as X accelerators. For the most part these are designed for Sun SBUS and Sun (and other vendor's) VME systems.  That said, Megatek products support multi-screen and/or multi-display on a sigle workstation. Most of our cards have a keyboard/mouse port which can be used to provide additional displays. For example, say you hade a Sparcstation with an Sbus expansion chassis. You could put in six frambuffers, allowing a total of six screens in the system. You could then attach from 1 to 6 keyboard/mice, allowing you to mix and match any combination of screens and displays. You could have 1 6-screen display, 3 2-screen displays, 6 1-screen displays, or 1 2-screen display and 1 4-screen display. Basically any combination.  Because of this, we at Megatek try to be very careful about the use of the words multi-screen and multi-display. They are quite different in meaning, and (at least in X) have exact definitions.  The reason I ramble like this is the mention of an upper limit if 12 screens in a display. As it so happens, there's a define in the server that determines the most screens supported (server/include/misc.h, MAXSCREENS). As released my MIT, this is 3. As released by Megatek, this is 12.  As such, the most screens supported by a single Megatek display (i.e. X server) is 12. If someone construed this to be a limitation of X I'm sorry, but clearly (as pointed out so well by Mr. Neto) this is not the case.  We just did it here because nobody has ever asked us for more. Of course, I could say \\\"Buy all you want, we'll support more.\\\" -- \",\"Does anybody out there have or used to have an HD controller from Perstor System Inc.

Thanks in advance Don  \",\" The problem with \\\"Let's assume\\\" reasoning is that, taken to the extreme (and you're close), you arrive at \\\"Let's assume this is perfectly OK.\\\"  The assumptions you make are big ones. If the system is really secure, then why does the government have to keep the algorithm secret?  There are plenty of encryption algorithms that don't depend upon nondisclosure to be secure, so why in the world use one that does?  There are reasons, of course, but I certainly can't think of any honest ones.  Next, you assume we can \\\"trust\\\" the escrow houses. But the last time I checked, EVERY SINGLE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT has experienced unauthorized disclosure, corruption, and even fabrication, of supposedly secure data. The govt is saying \\\"Yeah, but NOW we're serious, so you can trust us.\\\"  Bullcrypt.   And finally, although you didn't state it explicitly, you implicitly assume that the warrant mechanism in this country is safe and reasonable. The case in Ventura County of a man shot and killed by officers serving a deliberately fraudulant warrant tells me that the govt has a long ways to go on this score.  Remember that all this is to catch the drug dealers, right?  As others have pointed out, the current proposal will, if deployed, render truly secure encryption much more expensive and inconvenient than Uncle Sam's brand. Who will be able to afford, and be sufficiently motivated, to purchase this expensive, inconvenient higher protection?  Somebody with lots of extra cash...  The following is more true than ever:    \\\"When [strong] encryption is outlawed, only outlaws will have [strong] encryption.\\\" \",\"   Right.

The above effect is clear, but there are other effects as well.  If Olerud hits a double, any runner on first will score; if Alomar legs an extra base onto a hit in the gap, the runner on first may need to hold at third.  Thus Olerud's doubles have more advancement value than Alomar's.  (Of course, Alomar is more likely to score after hitting a double.)  Another reason not to give too much extra value to baserunning is that the runs created formulas work for very fast and very slow teams.  No team in the 1950's ran much, but some teams certainly had faster players than others.  Still, the current runs created formulas work just as well in the 1950's for all teams.    Bill James gives the 1955-1958 Senators as an example.  They used Harmon Killebrew regularly as a pinch runner, and in 1957, stole 13 bases with 38 times caught stealing.

I believe a legitimate question was asked.  Why shouldn't cost and safety be used (at least in part) to determine legality?  I'd like to see you *prove* that drug legalization is an idiotic idea. Seems to me the evidence from Great Britain is pretty convincing that  drug legalization is a good idea.  Even such a noted conservative as William F. Buckley supports it.  Your examples (except for prostitution) fail miserably to meet both criteria (safer AND cheaper).  Obviously, killing people is not \\\"safe\\\".

Atheists have this ground against us and I believe they are right about *some* who call themselves 'christians'.\",\"    Is it appropriate for the Lord not to reveal certain  things before the world (i.e., publish them widely)?  These things sacred to Himself.  He may place any  pre- or post-conditions He feels are necessary.  Moreover, there are precedents in scripture where knowledge of sacred things is withheld:  1. After the Transfiguration Jesus instructed Peter, James, and John to \\\"tell the vision to no  man, until the Son of man be risen again from  the dead\\\" (Matt. 17:9).   If we were living at the time of Savior, there would be no (public) record of this event.  2. A faithful friend of Paul experiences a vision  of \\\"paradise\\\" when he \\\"heard unspeakable words,  which it is not lawful for a man to utter\\\" (2 Cor. 12:4). This person heard something which Paul can not  write to the Corinthians (and us).  3. There is an incident recorded in the Book of Mormon where words uttered by \\\"babes\\\" were  \\\"forbidden that there should not any man write them (3 Nephi 26:16, the entire text follows for those of you without access to the BOM).  3 Nephi 26:16 Behold, it came to pass on the morrow that the  multitude gathered themselves together, and they both saw and heard these children; yea, even  babes did open their mouths and utter marvelous things; and the things which they did utter were forbidden that there should not any man write them.  Some LDS scholars speculate that these words which could not be written are the sacred portions from temple we are to withhold from  the world (but it could be something else).   There is much we can discuss about the temple  ordinances.  We can discuss regarding baptisms and other vicarious ordinances for the dead. We can discuss certain concepts regarding the endowment (\\\"the ritual\\\"). However, there are certain elements I can not discuss with anyone (including other saints) outside of the temple. As a portion of the endowment, we receive the tokens and signs that will permit us access to Heaven.  I must keep this knowledge sacred  and respect the conditions under which it is revealed to me.\",\" Wasn't the beef with the English over \\\"taxation WITHOUT REPRESENTATION\\\", not taxation itself?

Although the article emphasizes voice communication, data and mail encryption is mentioned as well:    It looks like the worst nightmares raised by Dorothy Denning's proposals are coming true.  If the government continues on this course, I imagine that we will see strong cryptography made illegal.  Encryption programs for disk files and email, as well as software to allow for encrypted voice communications, will be distributed only through the \\\"underground\\\".

The structure  of the US government does try to combat this tendency to some extent, but  fighting entropy is always a losing battle.  Most people would rather have  comfort than freedom.  The paradox is that you can't really have the former,  in the long term, unless you have the latter.  One of the reasons that I probably come across to some people as a weird  cross between a libertarian and an \\\"establishment tool\\\" is that I end up  taking an utterly pragmatic view of government.  I don't get up in arms when  the government fails to protect the interests of the people, because in my  lifetime it never has--therefore, I have no expectation that it will.    As a result, I protect my own interests rather than expecting the government  to be \\\"fair\\\".  I will use strong cryptography when I think it is needed,  whether or not it is legal at the time.  Same thing with anything else the  government would rather not see in private hands--that's their problem.   What's important to me is using the right tool for the job.  If it's legal,  so much the better.  If it is not, but does not violate my (very strong)  sense of personal ethics, I will use it anyway as long I think it is worth  it.  Expecting the government to actually protect the interests of its  citizens, except by accident, is utter folly.  Even Jefferson, one of the  major architects of the American system of government, figured that in a  couple hundred years it would become so corrupt and self-serving that it  would be time dismantle it and try again, by revolution if necessary.

He threw 2 straight fastballs over the plate to Bonds in the 1st last night, got away with the first one, but Bonds hit the second one out of the park.  Then in the 3rd, when Clark was at third base with one out, Maddux did not intentionally walk Bonds, and Bonds dropped a single to left-center.       The Braves announcers pointed out that McGee as a leadoff hitter has not scored a run yet.  He will always hit around .300, but I'm concerning about his on-base percentage.  The key in the lineup is Matt Williams, he has to stay hot so that Bonds can hit with runners on base.         The pitching gets a set back as Bud Black is placed on the DL.

So I went to the state police - the officer told me that aftermarket tint is illegal, and I can get a waiver only for a pre-84 car or for a medical reason. I asked him to show me the section of the vehicle code that says it's illegal.  He showed it to me and the paraghaph said that you can't have tint, if you can't see the inside of the car because of the tint. When I told him that you can in fact see the inside very well, he shut the book and said \\\"It's just illegal, and in fact we can have someone give you a ticket for it right now.\\\" Well, won't argue with that...  Since the vehicle code says it's OK as long as you can see through the tint, I'd like to keep it (I'll re-read the vehicle code in the library).  I'd also like to get some sort of paper from the police that says it's OK, so I can get the inspection, and so that I won't get in trouble for the tint later on. I also wouldn't mind registering a complaint against that officer - he really pissed me off.  So does anyone have any experience getting that sort of a paper from the police, especially in Pennsylvania? Does anyone have any experience registering a complaint against an officer? I called the station  later on today, but they basically said there is no place where I could register a complaint against an officer... And if I do decide to keep the tint and get a ticket anyway, how much of a chance do I stand to succesfully appeal the ticket in court?  Any comments about it will be welcome!\",\" But what if the geologists are wrong and these people are warning of a non-existent danger?  Analogies can only push an argument so far (on both sides).  Both Melinda's and yours assume the premises used to set up your respective analogies are true and thus the correct conclusion will arise.  The important point to note is the different directions both sides come from. Christians believe they know the TRUTH and thus believe they have the right (and duty) to tell the TRUTH to all.    Christians can get offended if others do not believe (what is self-evidently to them) the TRUTH. Non-christians do not believe this is the TRUTH and get offended at them because they (christians) claim to know the TRUTH.  (BTW this argument goes for anyone, I am not just bagging christians)  Neither side can be really reconciled unless one of the parties changes their mind.  As Melinda pointed out, there is no point in arguing along these lines because both approach from a different premise.  A more useful line of discussion is WHY people believe in particular faiths.  Personally, I don't mind what anyone believes as long as they allow me mine and we can all live peacefully.  \",\"...   Before or after his kids were shot?    Then why make the comment?

I will probably rent a Chevy Beretta from Alamo. I've been quoted $225 for a week/ $54 for additional days.  This would include free driving distance, but not local taxes (Baltimore).  They also told me all insurance thats necessary is included, but I doubt that,  'cause a friend rented a car last year and it turned out he needed a lot more insurance than what's included in the base price. But on the other hand he didn't rent it from Alamo.  Does anyone have some info on this?  Is $225 a rip-off?  Probability that I'll be needing more insurance? Is the beretta a good rental car?

ADVOCATE OF LUNAR POWER SYSTEM AS ENERGY SOURCE FOR THE WORLD     On April 21, the OASIS and Ventura County chapters of the National  Space Society will sponsor a talk by Lunar Power System (LPS) co- inventor and vice-president of the LPS Coalition, Dr. Robert D. Waldron.  It will be held at 7:30 p.m. at the Rockwell Science Center in Thousand Oaks, CA.     Dr. Waldron is currently a Technical Specialist in Space Materials Processing with the Space Systems Division of Rockwell International in Downey, California.  He is a recognized world authority on lunar materials refinement.  He has written or coauthored more than 15 articles or reports on nonterrestrial materials processing or utilization.  Along with Dr. David Criswell, Waldron invented the lunar/solar power system concept.     Momentum is building for a coalition of entrepreneurs, legal experts, and Soviet and U.S. scientists and engineers to build the Lunar Power System, a pollution-free, energy source with a potential to power the globe.     For the past three years members of the coalition, nearly half from California, have rejuvenated the commercial and scientific concept of a solar power system based on the Moon.     The LPS concept entails collecting solar energy on the lunar surface and beaming the power to Earth as microwaves transmitted through orbiting antennae.  A mature LPS offers an enormous source of clean, sustainable power to meet the Earth's ever increasing demand using proven, basic technology.     OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of Space Industrialization) is the Greater Los Angeles chapter of the National Space Society, which is an international non-profit organization that promotes development of the space frontier. The Ventura County chapter is based in Oxnard, CA.

But, as you put, Being the source of \\\"all\\\" existence, including one's own, would mean that God came from nothing, a concept alien to Christianity and Theism.  It is better to understand the classical concepts of Necessary and Contingent existence.  God exists necessarily, always.  God created contingent beings.  This is a coherent solution to existence, so long as the concept of God is coherent.    Not a very good answer.  If reason cannot by any means understand something then it is likely that \\\"it\\\" is a null concept, something not in reality.\",\"Jiann-ming Su writes  It wouldn't bother me... \",\"How do you beat the Penguins?

I'm hoping someone knows what this board is, or, even better, what the various switches and jumbers are used for.  Anyway, here's  description of the card:  It is a 16-bit card, although I noticed that none of the contacts in the 16-bit extension are connected to anything.  It has 4 NS16550AN chips in sockets, and 4 corresponding connecters labeled COM1 - COM4.  There is also an external female connector with 37 pins.

I believe that I have determined, by following traces, that SW5 and SW6 (12 switches in all) control the interrupt level for each of the COM ports.  SW5[1-4] are for IRQ3, SW5[5-8] are for IRQ4, and SW6[1-4] are for IRQ5.  The other switches are beyond my meager ability to follow.

OK, suppose the NY State Police want to tap a suspect's phone.  They need a warrant, just like the old days.  But unlike the old days, they now need to      (a) get two federal agencies to give them the two parts of        the key.  Now, what happens if there's a tiff between the two escrow houses? Posession/release of keys becomes a political bargaining chit.  State and lower-level police agencies have to watch the big boys play politics, while potentially good leads disappear, lives and property are lost, statutes of limitations run out, etc.  Not to mention: a moderately clever person who suspects the police are after her/him will be buying new phones faster than tap requests can be processed.  Or using stolen ones.  [Will the Turing Police come and arrest you for transmitting without a dialing license?]  There's also bureacracy and security problems -- within each escrow house,  how will requests for key disclosure be authenticated?  Put in enough safeguards of the kind bureaucrats and activists feel comfortable with, and  it might take a LONG time to get that key.  [Even when a request is approved,  how is the key going to be disclosed?  Will it be encrypted by a Clipper-type chip for transmission?  In a bureaucracy the size of the Federal Government, with a databank of the necessary size, and data traffic of the projected volume, there's going to be a lot of weak links.  How many of  these kinds of problems will be open for public or \\\"expert\\\" scrutiny?]    Furthermore, the Feds might be leery of handing completed keys around,  even to State Police agencies: a trust and security issue.  This would be  an especially acute issue if some other State's Police had mishandled a  key, resulting in lawsuits, financial settlements, and political  embarassment.  So, the Feds implement it this way:      (b) some federal agency gets the keys, performs the tap, and        turns the results over to the NY State Police.  But let's say Cuomo's been causing some problems over a Clinton Aid-To-Urban-Areas proposal.  Or there just happens to be a turf war going on between the State cops and the Justice department on a case. Now, not only do we have the keys as a political chit, we have an extra player in the game *and* we have the tap's tapes as another bargaining chit.  Again, the State Police lose.  I understand that (legal) wiretaps are quite expensive to maintain. In scenario (b), who pays the bill?\",\"  I think you are vastly oversimplifying things. We know that early Christians suffered totures because of their witness to Christ.  For example:  ACT 5:40    His speech persuaded them. They called the apostles in and had             them flogged. Then they ordered them not to speak in the name of             Jesus, and let them go.  ACT 5:41    The apostles left the Sanhedrin, rejoicing because they had been             counted worthy of suffering disgrace for the Name.  It appears that the Jewish rulers of that time had a particular aversion to even hearing Jesus's name. ACT 5:28    \\\"We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name,\\\" he said.             \\\"Yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and are             determined to make us guilty of this man's blood.\\\"  Finally, the first apostle's death, James of Zebedee was certainly not by Rome's hand any more than the first martyr Stephen.     The problem was that if one believed in the Resurrection, then one must believe in Jesus as truly being the Son of God and what He stood for and preached during His ministry on Earth.  That would have been extremely difficult for some people, especially those that had plotted to kill Him.   \",\"To:All  Hi,  Does anybody have the source code to the externel processes that comes with 3D  Studio, and mabe som kind of DOC for writing the processes your self.   /Lars  +++ Author: Lars_Jorgensen@p7.syntax.bbs.bad.se, Syntax BBS, Denmark\",\"can anyone give me more information regarding endometriosis?   i heard it's a very common disease among women and if anyone can provide names of a specialist/surgeon in  the north carolina research triangle  park area (raleigh/durham/chapel  hill) who is familiar with the condition, i would really appreciate it.  thanks.   --Naomi\",\"My friend brought a subaru SVX recently.  I had drove it for couples times and I think its a great car, esp on snow.  However when she took it to a local Subaru dealer for a oil change, the bill came out to be about 80 dollars.

Bye.\",\"Note: I am cross-posting (actually, emailing) this to  bit.listserv.catholic while main posting goes to  soc.religion.christian.  [Quotations omitted.  This is in response to a question about the Immaculate Conception.  I explained it, but left justification up to our Catholic readers.  --clh]  There is no direct reference in the Holy Scripture except for the mention of Mary's _blessedness_/full of grace in the \\\"Annunciation\\\" by Angel Gabriel in Luke 1:26-28   And in the 6th month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto  a city of Galilee, named Nazareth.  To a virgin espoused to a  man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's  name was Mary.  And the angel came unto her and said, _\\\"Hail,  thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed  art thou among women.\\\"_  Now, now, hold that line of thought - \\\"the Lord is with Mary & blessed art thou among women\\\" - while you read on....  In the book, \\\"First Lady of the World, A Popular History of Devotion to Mary\\\" by Peter Lappin:  The _Immaculate Conception_ matter is really far more complicated than the _Assumption_.  This arose in 430 AD.  It is quite possible that the feast of _Mary's Conception_ under the title \\\"The Conception of Saint Anne\\\", originally commemorated the _physical miracle_ of a woman _beyond the age_ of child bearing, conceiving a daughter, just as Elizabeth had conceived John the Baptist.  A transfer in emphasis from the physical miracle wrought in Anne to the miracle of grace wrought by God in the soul of Mary was _logical_.  Mary is the incorruptible timber \\\"out of which was hewn the _tabernacle_ of Christ's sinless body\\\"; she is \\\"God's Eden, in whom there is no tree of knowledge, and no serpent that harms.\\\"  Her perfect beauty and spotlessness find their exemplar in Christ, her purity in that of the Father.  At the time of the Council of Ephesus, she was hailed as \\\"innocent, without blemish, immaculate, inviolate, spotless, holy in soul and body, who was blessed as a lily from among thorns, unlearned in the evil ways of Eve\\\". ... At the end of the thirteenth century, an Irish Franciscan, John Duns Scotus (1266-1308),...God maintained that it was a  greater thing for Him to preserve His (the Son) mother from all sin _than to use His power to clease her from it later_. ...  Now let's go to the discussion of baptism and original sin. From \\\"Pocket Catholic Cathechism\\\" by John A. Hardon:  Baptism - Concupiscence Remains after Baptism. Concupiscence or the tendency to sin remains in the baptized but since it is left to provide trial, it has no power to injure those who do not consent and who by the grace of Christ Jesus, manfully resist (Canon 5).  Original gifts of Adam and Eve before their fall: In the light of the foregoing, we see that our first parents were originally gifted three times over: -They had the natural gifts of human beings especially the  power to think and to choose freely. -The had the _preternatural_ gifts of bodily immortality  and of integrity, or the internal power to control desires. -They had the _supernatural_ gifts of sanctifying grace,  the virtues of faith, hope, and charity and the corresponding  title to enter heaven. By their disobedience, they lost the _supernatural and preternatural_ gifts entirely, and were weakened (without losing) their natural capacity to reason and to choose freely.  Baptism restores the _supernatural_ life lost by Adam's sin.  It _does not_ restore the _preternatural_ gifts but gifts as a title to a glorified restoration of our bodies on the last day...  Going back to _Immaculate Conception_ (I am not sure if this interpretation is in any other books but it may be another contribution to the 'puzzle'):  Given the miracle of St. Anne bearing a child at a non-childbearing age, AND Christ was not yet born  AND _there was no baptism yet_ on Mary's birth but STILL, the Angel Gabriel's greetings was: \\\"Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you. Blessed art thou amongst women\\\".  Even Mary was confused about this greeting.  Mary could very well have possessed all of the _treefold original gifts above_ given to our first parents (Adam and Eve before their sin):     Hail Mary (Example of praise given by the Angel Gabriel)     Full of grace (natural, preternatural, supernatural)     The Lord is with you (At those times, God would                 definitely want to be with those He                 has made _blessed_)     Blessed art thou amongst women (that says it all)  At the conception, God made Mary _full of grace and blessed_ as the 'tabernacle' for the coming body of Christ and so,  Immaculate Conception of Mary is true and Mary still has maintained her Immaculate Heart. \",\"hey...

Researchers have found that eating a cup of yogurt a day drastically     reduces a woman's chances of getting vaginal candida, a yeast infection.   For the year-long study, researchers at Long Island Jewish Medical     Center in New Hyde Park, New York, recruited 13 women who suffered from  chronic yeast infections. For the first 6 months, the women each day ate 8 ounces of yogurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus. For the second  6 months, the women did not eat yogurt. The researchers examined the     women each month and found that incidents of colonization and infection  were significantly lower during the period when the women ate yogurt.      The fungus Candida albicans can live in the body without doing harm.   It is an overproliferation of the fungus that leads to infection. The    researchers concluded that the L. acidophilus bacteria found in some     brands of yogurt retard overgrowth of the fungus. Streptococcus          thermophilus and L. bulgaricus are the two bacteria most commonly used   in commercial yogurt production. Neither one appears to exert a          protective effect against Candida albicans, however. Women who want to   try yogurt as a preventive measure should choose a brand that lists      acidophilus in its contents.                                             --- end ---                                                ===================================  InfoTrac - Health Reference Center ~ Oct '89 - Oct '92   THE MATERIAL CONTAINED IN Health Reference Center ~ Oct '89 - Oct '92 IS PROVIDED   ONLY FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS   MEDICAL ADVICE OR INSTRUCTION.

In some circumstances, though, the     organisms proliferate, producing symptomatic infection of the mouth,     intestines, vagina, or skin.

There is no evidence that Candida in the intestine of normal individuals leads to disease. All people at one time or another have Candida in      their intestines.

If there were a problem with the Quad 900's and PB 170's, I am wondering why the system beeps still play in stereo?  If there isn't a problem with our machines, I wonder why the 4 games above are apparantly written to support only one channel of stereo when they could just use mono sounds so the mono sound would at least come out of both speakers  (like Spectre, etc. do)?  Quadra 900's and PowerBook 170's have the same ROMS (to my knowledge), so maybe this is a ROM problem?  (if so, though, why wouldn't System 7.1 patch over this problem?)

The point is that any eugenic solution to the Jewish Problem as Elias has proposed smacks of pure Nazism.  The fact that Elias' proposal cast the entire \\\"problem\\\" as one of the abnormal presence of Israeli society in the Middle East, and that he buried a slam against U.S. aid to Israel in the midst of his \\\"even-handed\\\" solution of the Jewish Question, made it obvious what  he had in mind: disolving the Jewish polity.  That *is* a Nazi doctrine: rectification of the \\\"abnormal presence\\\" of the Jewish people within a  larger body politic.  Whether your \\\"solution\\\" involves gas, monetary  incentives to the poor Jews to marry out, or as Feisal Husseini has  said, \\\"disolve the Zionist entity by forcing it to engage the normal  surrounding Arab culture,\\\" you are engaged in a Nazi project.  Just as obvious is your statement: \\\"I will not comment on the value or lack of value of Elias's proposal.\\\"  Still striking the glancing blow, right Brendan?

Being a PhD-student at David Chaum's cryptography-group, our group has a long history in research in the field of privacy-protecting cash systems.  The report is called CS-R9323.ps.Z, contains 77 pages, and can be retrieved from  ftp.cwi.nl   (192.16.184.180)  from the directory pub/CWIreports/AA. The postscript-file is suitable for 300dpi laserprinters.  ==================================================================== ABSTRACT (from coverpage): We present a new off-line electronic cash system based on a problem, called the representation problem, of which little use has been made in literature thus far. Our system is the first to be based entirely on discrete logarithms.  Using the representation problem as a basic concept, some techniques are introduced that enable us to construct protocols for withdrawal and payment that do not use the cut and choose methodology of earlier systems. As a consequence, our cash system is much more efficient in both computation and communication complexity than any such system proposed previously.    Another important aspect of our system concerns its provability. Contrary to previously proposed systems, its correctness can be mathematically proven to a very great extent. Specifically, if we make one plausible assumption concerning a single hash-function, the ability to break the system seems to imply that one can break the Diffie-Hellman problem.     Our system offers a number of extensions that are hard to achieve in previously known systems. In our opinion the most interesting of these is that the entire cash system (including all the extensions) can be incorporated in a setting based on wallets with observers, which has the important advantage that double-spending can be prevented in the first place, rather than detecting the identity of a double-spender after the fact. In particular, it can be incorporated even under the most stringent requirements conceivable about the privacy of the user, which seems to be impossible to do with previously proposed systems. Another benefit of our system is that framing attempts by a bank have negligible probability of success (independent of computing power) by a simple mechanism from within the system, which is something that previous solutions lack entirely. Furthermore, the basic cash system can be extended to checks, multi-show cash and divisibility, while retaining its computational efficiency. ====================================================================  Cryptographers are challenged to try to break this system!    I made a particular effort to keep the report as self-contained as possible.  Nevertheless, if you have any questions, please e-mail to me and I will try to reply as good as I can.

The key issue that I bought my BJ-200 on was ink drying speed.  You really  have to try awful hard to get the BJ-200 ink to smear.  The HP DeskJets need  10-15 seconds to completely dry.  In both cases, however, do not get your  pages wet.  Unlike laser printers, the material on your pages is INK, not  toner.  But that should go without saying.  My PC has very little memory (only 2Meg RAM), so the BJ-200 takes a little  while to print ----- but every application I use takes a while to run.  Once  the computer is solely printing, it purs like a kitten and puts pages out  every 15-30 seconds, depending on how detailed your graphics are.    The BJ-200 can do Windows soft fonts.  I'm assuming that the DeskJet can, or  HP wouldn't sell many......  Size is another factor.  The BJ-200 is much smaller, but the HP is built  like a tank.  I bet the BJ-200 would get damaged first.  Finally, the print quality.  I LOVE the BJ-200's resolution.  It looks like  a good laser quality print.  The HP's I've used.....they look like ink.  Not  as impressive.  \",\"you consider those I got from you to be such.  Yes, You state the reference, and then YOU claim it's a good or fair treatment.

It may not use the exact words as quoted above but I'm sure many will agree that the same message is being issued.  Later on when I get back home I will try to find the precise section(s) but you can do the research for now (I hope).  I also realize that Yasser Arafat renounced the _Covenant_ *to the Western media only* but he has yet to inform the PNC officially and enequivocally of his exact intentions on this issue.  Therefore, as far as we are concerned the _Covenant_ still stands as the \\\"Bible\\\" (so to speak) of the mainstream Palestinian National movement!    As a staunch pro-Israel activist I can confidently say that Bnai Brith has NOT influenced my opinions on the Arab-Israeli conflict.  As I mentioned above, just a little research on the subject will lead anyone to reach a similar conclusion on the Palestinian National movement (the PLO in most cases).  BB does not properly speak for me nor many of the people around me who share my views.   What 1948 situation?  A negative situation I presume?  Is this the same \\\"situation\\\" when the Jordanian occupiers of East Jerusalem would not allow the Jews to go worship at the HOLIEST SITE IN JUDIASM?  Was this an example of Qu'ranic law being exercised?  If not, I have another suggested reading for you... get into the \\\"soc.culture.arabic\\\" newsgroup where the posters have been debating the topic \\\"Jews in the Qu'ran\\\" (and may I remind you the people doing the debating appear to be devout Muslims with some knowledge of the Qu'ran). You will find that Jews aren't really viewed positively by the Qu'ran (to put it lightly).  So how do you think Jews (or any other non-Islamic religion) will be treated by an Islamic state governed by the words of the Qu'ran?  I think the 1948-1967 \\\"situation\\\" in Jerusalem will return *at best*!  What do you think?   All I have to say to that is, once again, see s.c.a - \\\"Jews in the Qu'ran\\\" and think again.  \\\"Freedom of choice\\\" is *definitely* not an option in Qu'ranic law especially for non-Muslims and ALL women!  Remember the Gulf War?  I'm sure you saw the reports about how women had few rights in Saudi Arabia (an Islamic state).   Probably nothing!  Aside from how to break the news to his Palestinian brethren that the _Covenant_ is \\\"null and void\\\" without getting assassinated himself!   In conclusion, Ahmed, you should go to the library and find the _Palestinian National Covenant (1964)_ and read it VERY CAREFULLY.

I'm the Virtual Reality market manager for Silicon Graphics, so perhaps I can help a little.    Unfortunately, while SGI systems were used to create the special effects for both Terminator 2 and Lawnmower Man, those are film-quality computer graphics, rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time.  Each frame of computer animation for those films took hours to render on high-end parallel processing computer systems. Thus, that level of graphics would be difficult, if not impossible, to acheive in real time (30 frames per second).     It depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is. True immersive visualization (VR), requires the rendering of complex visual databases at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frames per second.  This is a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot training. If the frame rate is too low, the user notices the stepping of the frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene, so the motion of the graphics is not smooth and contiguous.  Thus the graphics system must be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex data representations.  Additionally, the frame rate must be constant.  If the system renders 15 frames per second at one point, then 60 frames per second the next (perhaps due to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was visible before), the user can get heavily distracted by the medium (the graphics computer) rather than focusing on the data. To maintain a constant frame rate, the system must be able to run in real-time.  UNIX in general does not support real-time operation, but Silicon Graphics has modified the UNIX kernel for its multi-processor systems to be able to support real-time operation, bypassing the usual UNIX process priority-management schemes.  Uniprocessor systems running UNIX cannot fundamentally support real-time operation (not Sun SPARC10, not HP 700 Series systems, not IBM RS-6000, not even SGI's uniprocessor systems like Indigo or Crimson). Only our multiprocessor Onyx and Challenge systems support real-time operation due to their Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) shared-memory architecture.  From a graphics perspective, rendering complex virtual environments requires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real-time multi-sample anti-aliasing.  Of all of the general purpose graphics systems on the market today, only Crimson RealityEngine and Onyx RealityEngine2 systems fully support these capabilities. The anti-aliasing is particularly important, as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an unfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment.    You can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to develop VR applications, but that is starting at a pretty low level.

A:  In the US, currently Virgina and the District of Columbia prohibit     all usage of radar detectors.  New York prohibits their use in     large trucks.  In Canada, they are illegal in Manitoba, Ontario,     Quebec, Newfoundland and PEI (Prince Edward Island).  They     are apparently are illegal through most, if not all, of Europe.     Legislation which would make them illegal is pending in many other     jurisdictions; chances of such legislation passing varies a great deal.  Q:  Where are Radar Detector Detectors used?  Do they really work?  A:  Usage is spreading rapidly; initially they were used only in Canada,     but now they are appearing in New York and Virginia.  It is unsafe     to assume that they are not in use in Connecticut and D.C.     They work by detecting a certain frequency radiated by many currently     available super Het radar detectors; some brands of detector radiate     more strongly than others, and are thus more likely to be spotted.     New radar detectors are becoming available which may not be detected     by the current generation of detector detectors.  Note that a     detector may only be spotted by one of these devices if it is turned     on.  Q:  What is VASCAR?  Is it some kind of Radar?  A:  VASCAR is nothing more than a fancy stopwatch and time-speed-distance     computer.  It depends on the operator pressing buttons as the target     vehicle passes landmarks.  No radar signals are emitted by a VASCAR     system.  Q:  What is Ka band radar?  Where is it used?  Should a radar detector be     able to handle it?   A:  Ka band has recently been made available by the FCC for use in the US     in so-called photo-radar installations.  In these installations, a     low-powered beam is aimed across the road at a 45 degree angle to the     direction of traffic, and a picture is taken of vehicles which the     radar unit determines to have been in violation of the speed limit.     Tickets are mailed to the owner of the vehicle.  Because of the low     power and the 45 degree angle, many people believe that a radar     detector cannot give reasonable warning of a Ka band radar unit,     although some manufacturers of radar detectors have added such     capability anyway.  The number of locales where photo-radar is in use     is limited, and some question the legality of such units.  Best advice:     learn what photo radar units look like, and keep track of where they     are used (or else, don't speed.)  Q:  Do radar jammers work?  Are they legal?  A:  Quick answer:  No, and Not in the USA.     Detailed answer:  Cheap radar jammers do not work well at all.     Jammers that work are expensive and usually the property of the     military.  Jammers are a major violation of the regulations of the     Federal Communications Commission of the USA.  Driving technique and Vehicle Dynamics Questions:  Q:  What are understeer and oversteer?  A:  Understeer and oversteer are terms describing the behaviour of a     car while cornering near the `limit' (limit of adhesion, that is.)     Most drivers do not normally drive hard enough for these terms to     be descriptive of the situations they encounter.  Simply put, they     tell whether the car wants to go straight in a corner (steer `less',     or `understeer') or it wants to turn more in a corner (`oversteer'.)     Understeer is commonly designed into most production cars so that     untrained drivers, inadvertantly traveling too fast, won't get into     trouble.  Understeer may also be induced by using too much throttle     in a corner.  Oversteer is designed into some more performance     oriented cars; it may be induced by lifting on the throttle (Trailing     throttle oversteer, or TTO).  In extreme cases, lifting on the throttle     may induce so much oversteer that the car reacts by fishtailing or     spinning.      Some technical details:  in a corner at speed, the tires on the car     will develop what are called `slip angles'; the slip angle is the     angular difference between the direction that the car is traveling     and the direction that the steering wheel is directing the car to     travel.  In understeer, the front wheels have a greater slip angle     than the rear wheels.  In oversteer, the rear wheels have a greater     slip angle than the front wheels.  Q: What is a rev-matched downshift?  A: When downshifting, the engine must be rotating faster in the lower gear    than it was in the higher gear.  However, during a downshift, normally    you declutch and lift your foot from the throttle, so the revs drop    rather than increase.  In rev-matched downshift, you blip the throttle    before re-engaging the clutch so that the engine will already be up to    the new speed.  This results in a much smoother and faster downshift.  Q: What does heel-and-toe mean?  A: Heel-and-toe is a technique used to do a rev-matched downshift while    braking.  This is normally challenging, because you need the right foot    for both the brake and throttle.  It is called heel-and-toe because you    use one end of the foot on the brake, and the other on the throttle to    match revs for the downshift.  In many modern cars this is a misnomer;    often you must use the ball of the foot on the brake and the right side    on the throttle.     Note that some race car drivers will skip the clutch, and just use the    left foot on the brake and the right foot on the throttle, accomplishing    the same thing.  Q: What is double-clutch downshifting?  A: While your right foot is doing the above, your left foot can do one of    three things:  nothing, declutch once, or declutch twice.  The reason for    declutching twice is to match the speeds of the two shafts in the    transmission to the speed of the engine.  This is usually coupled with    rev-matching, so that while the engine is in neutral and the clutch    engaged, the throttle is blipped and both shafts of the transmission    speed up.     The procedure is as follows:    (0) declutch    (1) move gearshift lever to neutral    (2) engage clutch    (3) match revs    (4) declutch    (5) move gearshift lever to next lower gear    (6) engage clutch     This sounds like a lot of work, but with practice it becomes natural.    The problem that double-clutching solves is normally the function of the    synchronizers within the gearbox.  In transmissions without synchros or    with very worn synchros, double-clutching makes it much easier to shift.    Basically, if you double-clutch well, you are not using the synchros at    all.  This is generally unnecessary on street cars with synchros in good    condition.  Q: What do the numbers for acceleration from 0-60, 1/4 mile, skidpad, and    slalom times in the Auto Magazines really mean?  May they be compared?  A: In short, 1) not as much as the magazines want you to believe, and    2) almost never.     In more detail:  the acceleration numbers (0-60mph and 1/4 mile times    in the US) may be vaguely compared as long as they all come from the    same source.  Testing procedures vary so much from magazine to magazine    that comparing a Road & Track number to a Car & Driver number is quite    pointless.  Keep in mind, too, that the same variation applies from    driver to driver on the street; the driver is a major (often *the*    major) part of the equation.     Skidpads vary, and even if they didn't, skidpad figures are really    only tests of the stickiness of the stock tires; they change radically    when tire compounds change.  DO NOT make any assumptions about the    comparative handling of, say, two sports sedans based on skidpad numbers.    This is not to suggest that skidpads are without value, however. Skidpads    are an excellent educational tool at driving schools.  They are simply    of limited value in the comparison of anything except tires.     Slalom times are slightly more useful; they test some small parts of the    automobile's transient response.  However, they are also heavily influenced    by the stock rubber on the car, and they do not test many corners of the    car's envelope.  They DO NOT tell you all you need to know before making    a buying decision.  For example, they don't tell you what the rear end    of the car will do on a road which suddenly goes off-camber.  When a car    has an adjustable suspension, these tests are usually done in the `sport'    setting, which may be quite unsuitable for daily driving.  The list of    caveats could go on for page after page.  Q: My buddy claims that wide tires don't make any difference, according    to his freshman physics textbook, and that you can't ever accelerate    or corner at more than 1.0G.  Does he know what he's talking about?  A: 1) in short:  he hasn't got a clue.     2) in more detail: the equations for friction used in freshman physics    textbooks presume that the surfaces are smooth,  dry and non-deformable,    none of which properly apply to tire traction except in the case of a    stone cold tire on dry pavement which is far below its proper operating    temperature.     Pavement is _never_ smooth; it is always irregular to a greater or lesser    extent.  Tires, which are not really dry and solid (as rubber is a    substance which in its natural form is liquid, and which has only been    coerced into a semblance of solidity by chemical magic), deform to match    the surface of the pavement which a vehicle is traveling over.  In a tire    at operating temperature, grip is actually generated by shear stresses    inside the deformed rubber, and not by anything even remotely resembling    friction in the freshman physics sense of the term.  The colder a tire    is relative to its operating temperature, the closer its behaviour will    be to the traditional concept of friction; if much hotter than the its    proper operating temperature, the more likely the possibility of some    part of the tire actually ``reverting'' to liquid, which is mostly like    to happen deep in the tread, causing characteristic blisters and chunking.    (This latter, though, is almost completely unlikely to happen in normal    street driving, so unless you're a competition driver or do a lot of    high speed track driving, don't worry about it.)     Because tire traction is completely out of the domain of simple friction,    it does not obey the freshman physics equation at all; thus dragsters    accelerate at more than 1.0G and race cars corner and brake at more than    1.0G.  Because simple friction does not apply, it is actually possible    for different sized contact patches to generate differing amounts of    grip.  An actual analysis of tire behavior would require techniques    such as Finite Element Analysis, due to the complexity of the mechanism.  Misc. Questions:  Q:  What does <name or acronym> stand for?

A:  No.  Porsche is a publicly held company, controlled by the Porsche and     Piech families.  Porsche has extensive business dealings with VW/Audi,     which causes some confusion.  Since currently Porsche is in some     financial difficulty, there is a possibility that Mercedes or VW may     be interested in purchasing the company in the near future, but this     is only speculation at this time.\",\"  Computer: 286-25 mhz Bus: ISA (12.5 mhz) Drive: Maxtor 7213A (213 mb)                                      config.sys / autoexec.bat                       MS DOS 5             no           WIN 3.1                      smartdrv.sys        cache         smartdrv.exe  CORE (V 2.7)         6950 k/sec          1390 k/sec     1395 k/sec Norton SI (V 5.0)     730 k/sec           980 k/sec      982 k/sec  I'd still like to here from people with VLB-IDE.

Look at glxlink, glxunlink, glxgetconfig, and glxwinset in the man pages.   The GlxMDraw widget works pretty well.  OpenGL will be an improvement.   I think GL is a little easier to use and a little more powerful, but that's just an opinion.  Mileage may vary.  \",\"The Blackhawks shall triumph.\",\"Just found a great deal on a Clifford Delta car alarm, $450 installed.   Comes with glass break sensor, motion detector, and shock detector.  Does  anyone have one of these alarms?  Are they any good?  From the looks of it, its about the best on the market for the price.  It's also on sale, so that's  another reason to get it.  I think I'll be saving almost $200.  Any opinions?\",\"  In the South Lebanon area, only Israeli (and SLA) and Lebanese troops  are present. Syrian troops are deployed north of the Awali river.  Between the  Awali river and the \\\"Security Zone\\\" only Lebanese troops are stationed.   That is your opinion and the opinion of the Israeli government. I agree peace guarantees would be better for all, but I am addressing the problem as it stands now.  Hopefully a comprehensive peace settlement will be concluded soon, and will include security guarantees for both sides.  My proposal was aimed at decreasing the casualties in the interim period.  In my opinion, if Israel withdraws unilaterally it would still be better off than staying. The Israeli gov't obviously agrees with you and is not willing to do such a move.  I hope to be be able to change your opinion and theirs, that's why I post to tpm.   As I explained, I contend that if Israel does withdraw unilaterally I believe no attacks would ensue against northern Israel.  I also explained why I believe that to be the case.  My suggestion is aimed at reducing the level of tension and casualties on all sides. It is unfortunate that Israel does not agree with my opinion.     That is too bad.    Because Israel is not occupying the \\\"Security Zone\\\" free of charge. It is paying the price for that.  Once Israel withdraws it may have lost a bargaining chip at the negociating table but it would save some soldiers' lives, that is my contention.    If Lebanon were willing to agree to  That is completely untrue.  Hizbollah is now a minor force in Lebanese politics.  The real heavy weights are Syria's allies.  The gov't is  supported by Syria.  The Lebanese Army is over 30,000 troops and unified like never before.  Hizbollah can have no moral justification in attacking Israel proper, especially after Israeli withdrawal. That would draw the ire of the Lebanese the Syrian and the Israeli gov'ts.  If Israel does withdraw and such an act  (Hizbolllah attacking Israel) would be akin to political and moral  suicide.  Basil\",\" how can >this possibly be fair to the infants?  What do you mean fair?  God is just, giving to everyone what they deserve. As all infants are in sin from the time of conception (cf Romans 5.12, Psalm 1.7), they cannot possibly merit heaven, and as purgatory is for the purging of temporal punishment and venial sins, it is impossible that origianl sin can be forgiven.  Hence, the unbaptized infants are cut off from the God against whom they, with the whole of the human race except Mary, have sinned.  Which is why Jesus said, \\\"Truly, truly I say to you, no one can enter the Kingdom of God unless he is born of water and Spirit\\\" which is the true meaning of born again (John 3.5).  Thus, as infants are in sin, it is very fair for them to be cut off from God and exlcuded from heaven.  As St. Augustine said, \\\"I did not invent original sin, which the Catholic faith holds from ancient time; but you, who deny it, without a doubt are a follower of a new heresy.\\\"  (De nuptiis, lib. 11.c.12)\",\"     Agressive actions are taken by both sides. Tough talk is done by both sides. When an arab leader is menacing to throw all jews in the water is also tough talk, I think. And killing people is mildly agressive (justified, in your opinion  if they are israeli soldiers, justified, in others' opinion if they are jews, not justified at all in others opinion).  When Brad wrote the article about 3 Israelis killed, ther was a lot of pride  and satisfaction in his lines. That's what I feel disgusting. We may agree  or not when a killing is 'technically' murder, but being enthousiastic about it?   And again, I may appreciate some of your points, but you are not objective. That is not a blame, just a remark. \",\"Had a deal with Jay Hayes from Deleware and was ripped off do not deal with this guy and if you know him go to his door with a bat!

About hard drive companies: the original 160 meg drive that was bad (bad sector or something) was an IBM.  The new one is a Quantum.  Is the LCIII supposed to be shipped with IBMs?  Is there a quality difference?  Apparently! :)  Second, about hard drive position.  I've put the LCIII on its side and the new 160 HD has had no problems at all.  I've even switched back and forth between horizontal and vertical and there are no problems.  As far as I'm concerned I don't believe HD position is important for drives up to 160 meg, in any computer.  Don't know about CD-ROM, though.    \\\"Just like everything else in life, the right lane ends in half a mile.\\\"\",\" Tom Prince is a 28 year old no-hit catcher.  Think of him as a young Dann Bilardello.  I can't begin to fathom why the Pirates have been so afraid of losing this guy, who's been in AAA most of the last 5 seasons.  The Pirates released Kirk Gibson last year because Prince was out of options, then eventually sent Prince down anyway, and he cleared waivers without a peep. He's another year older, and still can't hit; why do they think he wouldn't clear waivers now?  Why would they care?\",\" How was this trade bad? I seem to recall Ratelle and Middleton making a pretty good centre - right wing combination, and the Bruins also got Brad Park in the deal (and they also lost Vadnais and somebody else). After the trade, the  Bruins were in two finals and one semi-final, all of which, of course, they  lost to Montreal (which should please you to no end). I doubt, however, keeping Esposito would have made a difference in those series, as he did not for the Rangers in '79 (or any of his years in Boston, for that matter).

Stefan \",\"Any more news on Steve's status since he lost the starting job would be appreciated\",\"I recently purchased the then current Pkg.# 486dx-33 for $2395 (but changed to NEC 3FGx monitor upgrade). Buy this Pkg. #3 now - for $100 more, you now get a bigger HD - 340mb with @256 HD cache. 30 days ago, when I bought this pkg., it was 245mb with @132K HD cache. This is a great deal although it is generally recommended you at least upgrade to the 15' Zeos (CTX) monitor for $99 more I believe.  Whether you also upgrade to the Diamond Viper video card is your choice. I stayed with the Diamond Speedstar Pro. Zeos Tech Support is really good - call after normal business hours to get the  fastest access. The hardest part about buying a Zeos is the wait till it is delivered - once you order you can hardly wait to get it! There are quite a few good mail order houses around - lots of bang for buck with Zeos. \",\"........  It looks like the Edmonton Oilers just decided to take a European vacation this spring...

Podein is an interesting case...because he was eligible to play in Cape Breton in the AHL playoffs like Kovalev, Zubov, and Andersson...obviously Sather and Pocklington are not the total scrooges

This device when used with a VCR tuner will allow you to have a second channel popped up on any corner of the screen. The you can press SWAP on the remote and the small picture will be swapped with the main picture.  The only limitation to this box is that it is has 36 channel tuner. This means that the box itself cannot tune higher than cable channel 36. However, if your VCR tuner is capable of tuning higher than this, then you simply tune the VCR to the channel desired and then swap pictures (assuming the alternate picture is channel 36 or lower) and it will work fine.

From your post, you apparently find the idea that something is wrong with African Americans, value-wise, culture wise or something, very appealing. I never cease to be amazed at how eager non african americans are to embrace theories about our problems which basically assert that something is wrong with us. The socio-economic factors which we know help  to produce high crime levels, like poverty, which exists among us in large  proportion, I mean when it comes to discussion of african american problems, we somehow become exempt from all these types of factors, and the problem is  laid at the doorstep of some neboulous dysfunction we supposedly have. But  nobody attributes crime amongst white americans to dysfunction. No, that has  socioeconomic factors to it, but for africa americans, its gotta be a  dysfunction.  Basically, I think this tendency for non african americans to believe that something is wrong with us exists because non african americans don't want to deal with the possiblility that the society is deeply biased against african americans, and that this is about 80% of the problem. It could not possible be that the society is so deeply racist and structured against us, that this has a very effective negative effect on us. No, something is wrong with us. Non african americans are quick to disregard what we have to say, because they  are so busy trying to find something wrong with us, instead of taking a good  hard look at the thing we say are doing us damage.

I must congratulate your analytical and excellent reportage about  Diana. From  the writings  of tye biographers  you  quoted,  I can  perceive,  maybe chauvinistically,  the  remnants of  her  Armenian genes. Even  though she  is only  1/64th Armenian, she   seems   to   have   many   of   the   strong characteristics  of Armenian  women. Her  Armenian ancestry is  traced to Eliza Kewark  (an Armenian from  India), who  married  the Scottish  merchant Thedore Forbes.  From the union was  born Kathleen Scott  Forbes,  who  married  James  Crombie  from Aberdeen. They  had a  daughter Jane,  who married David  Littlejohn.  Their  daughter  Ruth  married William Gill. Ruth Silvia Gill, the grandmother of Lady  Diana,   married  Lord  Fermoy,   and  their daughter, Frances  Ruth Burke Roache,  married the eight Earl of Spencer, who  was the father of Lady Diana. It is noteworthy  that Eliza Kewark was also referred  to as  Mrs. Forbesian  (a characteristic Armenian  surname  ending).  An  Armenian-Scottish gene mix is dynamite.  Levon K. Topuzian Assistant Professor Northwestern University Skoie, Illinois.  TIME, December 21, 1992 'Letters'   You have set up straw horses and knocked them down. I'm not impressed. Anyway, the Armenians tore apart the Ottoman Empire's eastern provinces, massacred 2.5 million defenseless Turkish women, children and elderly  people, burned thousands of Turkish and Kurdish villages and exterminated  the entire Turkish population of the Armenian dictatorship between  1914-1920. Such outrageous sleight of hand that is still employed today  in Armenia brings a depth and verification to the Turkish genocide  that is hard to match. A hundred years ago Armenians again thought  they could get whatever they wanted through sheer terror like the  Russian anarchists that they accepted as role models. Several Armenian  terror groups like ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle  resorted to the same tactics in the 1980s, butchering scores of innocent Turks and their families in the United States and Europe. It seems that  they are doing it again, at a different scale, in fascist x-Soviet Armenia  today.   Source: Stanford J. Shaw, on Armenian collaboration with invading Russian armies in 1914, \\\"History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey (Volume II: Reform, Revolution & Republic: The Rise of Modern Turkey, 1808-1975).\\\" (London, Cambridge University Press 1977). pp. 315-316.  \\\"In April 1915 Dashnaks from Russian Armenia organized a revolt in the city   of Van, whose 33,789 Armenians comprised 42.3 percent of the population,   closest to an Armenian majority of any city in the Empire...Leaving Erivan   on April 28, 1915, Armenian volunteers reached Van on May 14 and organized   and carried out a general slaughter of the local Muslim population during   the next two days while the small Ottoman garrison had to retreat to the  southern side of the lake.\\\"  \\\"Knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions,  Armenians looked to Russia and Europe for the fulfillment of their aims.  Armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the First  World War with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse  to serve their state, the Ottoman Empire, and to assist instead other  invading Russian armies. Their hope was their participation in the Russian  success would be rewarded with an independent Armenian state carved out of  Ottoman territories. Armenian political leaders, army officers, and common  soldiers began deserting in droves.\\\"  \\\"With the Russian invasion of eastern Anatolia in 1914 at the beginning of  World War I, the degree of Armenian collaboration with the Ottoman's enemy  increased drastically.

Here is my $0.02 on this and related subjects.  One is curious to know the real reasons behind this and related public relations campaign about Iran in recent months. These include:  1) Attempts to implicate Iran in the bombing of the New York Trade    Center. Despite great efforts in this direction they have not    succeeded in this. They, however, have indirectly created    the impression that Iran is behind the rise of fundamentalist    Islamic movements and thus are indirectly implicated in this matter.  2) Public statements by the Secretary of State Christoffer and    other official sources regarding Iran being a terrorist and    outlaw state.  3) And finally the recent broadcast of the Frontline program. I     suspect that this PR campaign against Iran will continue and    perhaps intensify.  Why this increased pressure on Iran? A number of factors may have been behind this. These include:  1) The rise of Islamic movements in North-Africa and radical    Hamas movement in the Israeli occupied territories. This    movement is basically anti-western and is not necessarily    fueled by Iran. The cause for accelerated pace of this     movement is probably the Gulf War which sought to return    colonial Shieks and Amirs to their throne in the name of    democracy and freedom. Also, the obvious support of Algerian    military coup against the democratically elected Algerian    Islamic Front which clearly exposed the democracy myth.    A further cause of this may be the daily broadcast of the news    on the slaughter of Bosnian Moslems.  2) Possible future implications of this movement in Saudi Arabia    and other US client states and endangerment of the cheap oil    sources from this region.  3) A need to create an enemy as an excuse for huge defense    expenditures. This has become necessary after the demise of    Soveit Union.  The recent PR campaign against Iran, however, seems to be directed from Israel rather than Washington. There is no fundamental conflict of interest between Iran and the US and in my opinion, it is in the interest of both countries to affect reestablishment of normal and friendly relations. This may have a moderating effect on the rise of radical movements within the Islamic world and Iran .\",\"Tigers' manager Sparky Anderson gets his 2,000th career win as moments ago, the Tigers completed a two game sweep over the Oakland A's at Tiger Stadium by beating the A's 3-2. Here are the highlights:       R    H   E                  Oakland  2    9   0       Detroit            3    7   1  Chad Krueter scored Skeeter Barnes from 1st with an RBI double in the  bottom of the ninth against none other than Dennis Eckersley to give the Tigers the victory.  Barnes also had an RBI single to score Thurmond to tie the score in the ninth, also off Eckersley (sp?).  The A's got their runs on an RBI single by McGwire in the 1st and a solo homer by Reuben Sierra in the 6th.  Deer doubled home Kirk Gibson in the 7th for the other Tiger run.  John Doherty pitched another strong game for the Tigers, once again lasting through the seventh inning.  He was relieved by Bolton and then David Haas in the 8th, and Haas got the win.  Bobby Witt started for the A's, and was replaced by Honeycutt in the 6th, followed by Goose Gossage in the 8th, and finally Eckersly in the 9th.  Doherty gave up both of the A's runs, while Witt gave up the first Tiger run and Eckerseley gave up the last two.  In the post game interview (on WJR radio in Detroit), Sparky Anderson said its one of the few times he's gotten emotional in his managing career.  It was a big moment for him, and I'm sure all of us Tiger fans are unanimously very happy for him.  And what a way to get number 2,000!.

As much as fans want to catch a ball, they really should be aware that winning the game is more important.  As a Dodger fan, he has to be aware that this is the home stadium, and that entails helping the home team win in any way possible.  As soon as the ball was hit that far, his first instinct should be to root for Darryl to catch it, not to try to catch it himself, particularly when he is sitting that close.  I enjoy the attitude of the Wrigley fans, where they are against  visiting team home runs so much, they actually throw them back on the field.  Now, this has nothing to do with whether Darryl could have caught it or not.  Sure, he probably screwed up, but the fan should realize his first responsibility is to get out of the way and help the team win. \",\"North heavy Duty hi hat stand $45    older stand... but definately in working shape.. could  use a little clean up.  comes with clutch and felts, etc..

Both protests would be denied, of course.  The umpire's judgement determines the garbage thing, although I think the game should be called (but that's my personal opinion...doesn't matter).  There is time only when the ump says, so the second argument is baseless. \",\"Apparently, Part 2 (defensemen numbered 2 through 19) was lost when I posted it; to make things worse, I lost my own copy.

If someone responds, I will repost it when I get it; otherwise, I will re-write it in a day or two and post it.  Sorry about that.  #8 LARRY DEPALMA  Season: 3rd Acquired: '91-92, free agent from Minnesota Grade:  I (C-/D+)  No netter/fan watching the Sharks, including me, knows where DePalma was at the end of the season; the Sharks appeared to still have his rights, but he wasn't in San Jose, he wasn't in Kansas City, and his name hasn't appeared on the waiver wire.  And that kind of invisibility was prevalent for the most part for DePalma.  After being called up October 30 against the Tampa Bay Lightning, DePalma had an excellent week, scoring 5 points in 3 games while playing good defense.  Unfortunately, the 27-year-old DePalma then disappeared the rest of the way, getting just 3 more points in 15 more games, and generally looked lethargic and uninterested on both ends of the ice.  He then was sent down to Kansas City, walked out from there, and was suspended and later reinstated when it was revealed that he was injured; he then promptly disappeared from the watching eyes of Shark Bytes (as the mailing list is now known to Sharks officials) faithful, and neither the Sharks nor we miss him.  #10 JOHAN GARPENLOV  Season: 3rd Acquired: '91-92, trade with Detroit for D Bob McGill and 8th round   pick in '92 entry draft from Vancouver Grade:  A/A-  After an early slump, Garpenlov was nothing short of inspirational the rest of the way, finishing with 66 points in 79 games, second highest total on the team, as he clicked well with team MVP Kelly Kisio and right wing Rob Gaudreau.  Kisio got most of the credit, but Garpenlov, finishing second in the MVP voting, clearly demonstrated his playmaking and scoring skills, as he was seen making excellent centering passes as well as finishing passes to him by putting the puck past opposing goaltenders, getting a club-high 14 power- play goals.  Contrary to his previous rep, Garpenlov also showed that despite his small size (5' 11\\\", 183 lbs.), he was willing to throw himself around when necessary, albeit not very successful yet.  He also still needs to work on his defense, although he improved tremendously throughout the season, and was actually quite a good penalty killer by the end of the season.  He will be a major key to the offense next year.  #15 DAVID BRUCE  Season: 5th Acquired: '91-92, from St. Louis in expansion draft Grade:  I (?)  After a banner '91-92, when he led the team in power-play goals (10) and was third in total scoring (38 points in 60 games), Bruce was bothered virtually all of this season with a groin injury, which kept him out of the lineup for all by 17 games this season.  Of course, it is difficult to speculate how well he would have done this season had he not been affected by the injury, but the 28-year-old Bruce was effective with a man up or a man short in the Sharks' first season, and was expected to be a strong offensive leader this season as well.  The injury appears serious, which is a shame, because otherwise he may have a much brighter future for now; instead, his future with the Sharks next season appears clouded.  #18 MARK PEDERSON  Season: 3rd Acquired: '92-93, trade with Philadelphia for C/LW Dave Snuggerud Grade:  I (B)  It is difficult for me to understand the Flyers' decision to unload Pederson, after a very good offensive season last season (40 points in 58 games), but after riding the pine early in the season, Pederson was summarily sent to the Sharks in exchange of the defensive-minded Snuggerud, and he finished with 41 games combined with the Flyers and the Sharks.  He was also limited by injuries this season, and this limited his production (17 points).  But when healthy, Pederson appears impressive, with a good scoring touch, good size (and the willingness to throw it around, although he's not considered a physical forward), and good speed.  He also does not appear to be a liability on defense, but the Sharks probably have to wait until next season to see how much, exactly, Pederson can do.  #20 JOHN CARTER  Season: 4th Acquired: '91-92, free agent from Boston Grade:  I (B+/B)  Carter was definitely one of the hardest workers on the team, and the hard work worked wonders, as at times he looked great on ice.  However, although he did look great at times, the fact that he received just 16 points (in 55 games) for his efforts is a sign that there is only so much his hard work can do, and the Sharks confirmed that by sending him to Kansas City with about 20 games left in the season.  Carter, who will turn 30 on May 6, always hussled, but as a result, was sometimes trapped too deep within the offensive zone while forechecking, but he was generally a credit on the defensive end, but he is probably of limited utility in that capacity, and he did not impress offensively, although he was one of the best Sharks at drawing penalties.  He is very unlikely to be back next season.  #28 JEAN-FRANCOIS QUINTIN Season: 1st Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  I (B+/B)  I don't understand why the Sharks didn't let Quintin play any more than the 14 games he played this season.  He was generally hard-working and creating opportunities offensively, and appeared, at age 23, ready for regular NHL duty, at least for a team like the Sharks, finishing with 7 points in those 14 games while not being a defensive liability.  Shoulder injury in training camp before the '91-92 season limited Quintin, the team's leading scorer in exhibition games despite sitting out the final two, to just 29 games with the Sharks and the Blades that season, but he looked impressive.  He should be a solid contender for regular duty next season.  #41 MARK BEAUFAIT  Season: 1st Acquired: 2nd round pick in 1991 supplemental draft Grade:  I (?)  After a all-star season at Kansas City, Beaufait got a cup of coffey with the Sharks late in the season when the Blades knocked down a playoff spot and the Sharks decimated with injuries, playing 5 games and scoring a goal for his only NHL point thus far.  Despite small size (5' 9\\\", 165 lbs.), Beaufait was not shy to throw himself around when necessary, and looked pretty good at times, although it's too early to judge him based on 5 NHL games, in which he played mostly left wing, away from his center position at Northern Michigan and Kansas City.  #42 JAROSLAV OTEVREL Season: 1st Acquired: 8th round pick in 1991 entry draft Grade:  I (?)  Like Beaufait, Otevrel also played away from his normal position when he was up for his cup of tea (7 games) midway through the season.  He was generally very much of a defensive liability, and did not show much offensively either, although that may be more indicative of the lack of ice time he got in those 7 games.  He may need another season to work on his defense, but once his defense is acceptable, he should be ready.  #44 MICHEL PICARD  Season: 1st Acquired: '92-93, trade with Hartford for LW Yvon Corriveau Grade:  I (B-/C+)  The 23-year-old Picard, although he perennially tore up the minors, seems to be close to being out of chances, for some reason, after being acquired by the Sharks but failing to impress the management in 25 games, scoring 4 goals for his only points, and he spent most of the rest of the way in Kansas City. He was not particularly strong defensively, and despite his offensive brilliance in the minors, he has failed thus far to score in the NHL, although he has been given limited opportunities.  He may be the Sharks' bait in the expansion draft.  #45 DODY WOOD  Season: 1st Acquired: 3rd round pick in 1991 entry draft Grade:  I (D+/D, although perhaps I shouldn't give a grade at all)  I have been accused of knocking on Wood too much. :-)  Then, it is probably no surprise to you that I am thoroughly unimpressed by Wood thus far, although 13 games is a small example.  He was generally a nonfactor on offense, was not particularly good defensively, and took too many silly penalties, losing many fights in the process and gathering 69 penalty minutes in those 13 games, projecting to to 446(!) in an 84-game season.  He's not ready, and needs at least another season at KC, where he can work on his fighting skills, if nothing else.  His relatively small size (5' 11\\\", 181 lbs.) does not give much possibility that he can survive, at this stage, as an enforcer.\",\"Anyone who knows this answer off-hand, please answer me by e-mail  quickly ;).

If you have corrections or answers to other frequently asked questions that you would like included in this posting, send email to leech@cs.unc.edu (Jon Leech).      If you don't want to see the FAQ, add 'Frequently Asked Questions' to your KILL file for this group (if you're not reading this with a newsreader that can kill articles by subject, you're out of luck).      The FAQ volume is excessive right now and will hopefully be trimmed down by rewriting and condensing over time. The FAQ postings are available in the Ames SPACE archive in FAQ/faq<#>.      Good summaries will be accepted in place of the answers given here. The point of this is to circulate existing information, and avoid rehashing old answers. Better to build on top than start again. Nothing more depressing than rehashing old topics for the 100th time. References are provided because they give more complete information than any short generalization.      Questions fall into three basic types:      1) Where do I find some information about space?      Try your local public library first. The net is not a good place to ask     for general information.

SUGGESTIONS FOR BETTER NETIQUETTE      Read news.announce.newusers if you're on Usenet.     Minimize cross references, [Do you REALLY NEED to?]     Edit \\\"Subject:\\\" lines, especially if you're taking a tangent.     Send mail instead, avoid posting follow ups. (1 mail message worth  100 posts).     Internet mail readers: send requests to add/drop to SPACE-REQUEST  not SPACE.     Read all available articles before posting a follow-up. (Check all  references.)     Cut down attributed articles (leave only the points you're  responding to; remove signatures and headers). Summarize!     Put a return address in the body (signature) of your message (mail  or article), state your institution, etc. Don't assume the  'reply' function of mailers will work.     Use absolute dates. Post in a timely way. Don't post what everyone  will get on TV anyway.     Some editors and window systems do character count line wrapping:  keep lines under 80 characters for those using ASCII terminals  (use carriage returns).

Every week or so it is dead and I have to recharge it. I ride the bike  every day, the battery is new and the charging system was checked  thoroughly and it seems fine. My suspicion is that it is draining somewhere.   Do you have any idea about what is causing this problem? Please help since my mechanic and me are clueless!...\",\" Gee!  Maybe I've misjudged you, Russell.  Anyone who agrees with something  I say can't be all bad.  ;-)  Seriously, I'm not sure whether I misjudged you or not, in one respect.   I still have a major problem, though, with your insistence that science  is mainly about avoiding mistakes.  And I still disagree with your  contention that nobody who doesn't use methods deemed \\\"scientific\\\"  can possibly know what's true and what's not.     Okay, so let's see if we agree on this: FIRST of all, there are degrees  of certainty.  It might be appropriate, for instance, to demand carefully  controlled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth (to the  extent that there is any such thing) the effectiveness of a certain  treatment. On the other hand, highly favorable clinical experience, even  if uncontrolled, can be adequate to justify a *preliminary* judgement that a treatment is useful.  This is often the best evidence we can hope for from investigators who do not have institutional or corporate support. In this case, it makes sense to tentatively treat claims as credible but to reserve final judgement until establishment scientists who are qualified and have the necessary resources can do more careful testing.  SECONDLY, it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of  evidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal.     I come to this dispute about what science is  not only as a mathematician but as a veteran of many arguments in sci.psychology (and occasionally in sci.med) about NLP (Neurolinguistic Programming).  Much of the work done to date by NLPers can be better categorized as informal exploration than as careful scientific research.  For years now I have been trying to get scientific and clinical psychologists to just take a look at it, to read a few of the books and watch some of the videotapes (courtesy of your local university library).  Not for the purpose of making a definitive judgement, but simply to look at the NLP methodology (especially the approach to eliciting information from subjects) and look for ideas and hypotheses which might be of scientific interest.  And most especially to be aware of the *questions* NLP suggests which might be worthy of scientific investigation.  Over and over again the response I get in sci.pychology is  \\\"If this hasn't been thoroughly validated by the accepted form of empirical research then it can't be of any interest to us.\\\"    To me, the ultimate reducio ad absurdum of the extreme \\\"There've got to be controlled studies\\\" position is an NLP technique called the Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure.  Simple phobias (as opposed to agoraphobia) may not be the world's most  important psychological disorder, but the nice thing about them is that  it doesn't take a sophisticated instrument to diagnose them or tell  when someone is cured of one.  The NLP phobia cure is a simple  visualization which requires less than 15 minutes.  (NLPers claim that it can also be used to neutralize a traumatic memory, and hence is useful in treating Post-traumatic Stress Syndrome.)  It is essentially a variation on the classic desensitization process used by behavioral therapists.  A subject only needs to be taken through the technique once (or, in the case of PTSD, once for each traumatic incident).  The process doesn't need to be repeated and the subject doesn't need to practice it over again at home.  Now to me, it seems pretty easy to test the effectiveness of this cure.  (Especially if, as NLPers claim, the success rate is extremely high.)   Take someone with a fear of heights (as I used to have).  Take them up  to a balcony on the 20th floor and observe their response.  Spend 15  minutes to have them do the simple visualization.  Send them back up to  the balcony and see if things have changed.  Check back with them in a  few weeks to see if the cure seems to be lasting.  (More long term  follow-up is certainly desirable, but from a scientific point of view  even a cure that lasts several weeks has significance.  In any case,  there are many known cases where the cure has lasted years.  To the best  of my knowledge, there is no known case where the cure has been reversed  after holding for a few weeks.)  (My own cure, incidentally, was done with a slightly different NLP technique, before I learned of the Fast  Phobia/Trauma Cure.  Ten years later now, I enjoy living on the 17th floor of my building and having a large balcony.)    The folks over in sci.psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to make this simple test.  They claim that only an elaborate outcome study will be satisfactory --- a study of the sort that NLP practitioners,  many of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice, can ill  afford to do.  (Most of them are also just plain not interested, because  the whole idea seems frivolous.  And since they're not part of the scientific establishment, they have no tangible rewards to gain  from scientific acceptance.)   The Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure is over ten years old now and the clinical  psychology establishment is still saying \\\"We don't have any way of  knowing that it's effective.\\\"    These academics themselves have the resources to do a study as elaborate  as anyone could want, of course, but they say  \\\"Why should I prove your  theory?\\\"  and  \\\"The burden of proof is on the one making the claim.\\\"   One academic in sci.psychology said that it would be completely  unscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn't  been described in a scientific journal.  (It's described in a number of  books and I've posted articles in sci.psychology describing it in as much  detail as I'm capable of.)    Actually, at least one fairly careful academic study has been done (with  favorable results), but it's apparently not acceptable because it's a doctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal.  To me, this sort of attitude does not advance science but hinders it.   This is the kind of thing I have in mind when I talk about \\\"doctrinnaire\\\"  attitudes about science.    Now maybe I have been unfair in imputing such attitudes to you, Russell.   If so, I apologize.    -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems  less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \",\"Misc.

Canada is in no imminent danger of being overtaken as the primary  supplier of players...Sweden, Finland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia are all relatively small countries, and cannot really produce players at a greater rate than they are already producing them, and the potential influx from the former Soviet Union is severely blunted because the system has been raided and is starved for finances and will take a decade or two, to recover and become a real threat, and the US will just maintain its slow increase.  Canada should continue to supply 60% plus of the top hockey players in the world for the forseeable future.  Besides we need the European hockey market if hockey is to take its rightful place besides soccer as the two predominant world sports...and since soccer is essentially boring, unlike hockey.   Canadians are under no threat...the European numbers will soon saturate, if they haven't already...and by the time Russia comes online again, the NHL should be a world league, and there will be many more teams to stock and many more jobs for Canadian hockey players.  In the near team, the percentage of Canadians will mostly decline because of  Americans, not because of Europeans.

If you have an obvious hernia sac coming down  into your scrotum, or a bulge in your groin that is brought about by increasing intra-abdominal pressure.... Sometimes is not that obvious. The hernia is small and you can only  detect it by putting your finger into the inguinal canal.  Whether you have a recurrent hernia, or this is related to the previous operation, I can't tell you. The person that examined you is in  the best position to make that determination.  Are there non-invasive ways of diagnosing a hernia? Every now and then  folks write about CT scans and ultrasounds for this. But these are far too expensive, and unlikely to be better than a trained examining finger.   ====================================\",\" [ description of experiment deleted ]   [ more deleted ]   A few years ago a friend and I took some 256 grey-level photos from a 1 bit Mac Plus screen using this method. Displaying all 256 levels synchronized to the 60Hz display took about 10 seconds. After experimenting with different aperture settings and screen brightnesses we found a range that worked well, giving respectable contrast. The quality of the images was pretty good. There were no visible contrast bands.  To minimize the exposure time the display program built 255 different 1 bit frames. The first contained a dot only for pixels that had value 255, the second only for pixels that had value 254, etc. These frames were stored using a sparse data structure that was very fast to 'or' onto the screen in sequence. Creating these frames sometimes took 5-10 minutes on that old Mac, but the camera shutter was closed during that time anyway. And yes, we wrote directly to the screen memory. Mea culpa.  Our biggest problem was that small images were displayed in the top left corner of the screen instead of the center. It took an extra week to have the film developed and printed, because the processors took the trouble to manually move the all images into the center of the print.

The primary reason, and the essence of the details that you are seeking, is that the Grahm-Rudman budget controls were working.  In fact, they were working so well that unless the feds did something, they were going to have to start cutting pork. So Bush and the Democrats got together in a Budget Summit and replaced Grahm-Rudman with the now historic Grand Compromise in which Bush \\\"consented\\\" to raise taxes in exchange for certain caps on spending increases.  As it turned out, the taxes killed the Reagan expansion and the caps on spending increases were dispelled by Clinton in his first act as President (so that he could create his own new plan with more tax increases).  The result is that Clinton now HOPES to reduce the deficit to a level  ABOVE where it was when Reagan left office.\",\"I don't know if this is an obvious question, but can any of the current  batch of windows accelerator cards (diamond etc) be used to drive a monitor  which has RGB and horizontal and vertical sync ( 5 BNC jacks altogether)  connectors out the back??

Researchers try to limit this kind of effect by  performing studies that are \\\"blind\\\" in various ways.  Some of these are:    o  The subjects of the study do not know whether they receive a       placebo or the test treatment, i.e., whether they are in the      control group or the test group.    o  Those administering the treatment do not know which subjects       receive a placebo or the test treatment.    o  Those evaluating individual results do not know which subjects      receive a placebo or the test treatment.  Obviously, at the point at which the data is analyzed, one has to  differentiate the test group from the control group.  But the analysis is quasi-public: the researcher describes it and presents the data on which it is based so that others can verify it.    It is worth noting that in biological studies where the subjects are animals, such as mice, there were many cases of skewed results because those who performed the study did not \\\"blind\\\" themselves.  It is not considered so important to make mice more ignorant than they already are, though it is important that in all respects except the one tested, the control and test groups are treated alike.\",\"My insurance company encourages annual physicals, and at my age [42] i'm thinking that BIannual physicals, at least, might be a good idea.

Hence big cooling towers.           Oil and gas fired steam plants also have condensers, but they usually are sized to get the steam back into hot water, not most of the way down to ambient.

I owned a 1985 Toyota Celica GT.  I decided to buy myself a gift - a more exotic car.  Front runners included the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Porsche 924 (1987 model years). I narrowed it down to those two.  I liked the simplicity and handling (and snob appeal, too) of driving a Porsche.  The Supra Turbo was less money and had more features and performance - almost a personal luxury car.  It had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 924. I was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924, but i decided to stop by my insurance agent's office on the way.  I asked about what would happen to my rate with either car.   \\\"If you buy the Supra, your rate classification will be the same as the Celica (the '85 Celica was considered a subcompact and for that year was rated as one of the safest cars), with a slight increase because the car will be 2 years newer.  Our lower-risk division will continue to handle your account.   \\\"If you buy the Porsche 924, we'll have to change you to the standard [higher] rate company and your rate will double.  And if you go with a 944, it's another story again - we'll cover the rest of this year, but cancel you after that.\\\"   \\\"But the Supra is much faster than the 924, and the 924 is actually faster than the [standard] 944.  That doens't make sense.\\\"    That's what the book says.  We don't insure Corvettes, either.  For some reason, the underwriters consider Supras - and their drivers - as very traditional and conservative.\\\"   I eventually went with the Supra for a number of reasons.  The Porsche dealer had a nice salesman to get me interested, but a tough high-pressure guy in the back room.  At equal monthly payments, it would have taken a year longer to pay for the Porsche, plus its higher insurance.

Xavier(eXtension AV class for IntERviews) is a C++ class library that adds multimedia capability to InterViews. It allows composite multimedia objects to be built from media objects.  Specifically, it adds audio and video objects to the classes available in InterViews 3.0.1/3.1, and it does so without changing the source code for the original classes (though several configuration files for InterViews need to be changed via a patch file).    Currently, the Xavier audio classes are only supported on SUN workstations with an audio interface, such as the SPARCstation2.  Xavier has been tested in the following environments:  SUN:   Machine : SPARCserver470 SPARCstation-IPC   OS      : SUN-OS4.1.1 or later   C++     : SUN C++ ver2.1  NEC(EWS):   Machine : EWS4800/210,230   OS      : EWS-UX/V(Rel4.0) WSOS41 Release5.1,Release5.2   C++     : C++ Release3.1  It can be obtained via anonymous ftp from            interviews.stanford.edu in /pub/contrib/           (Xavier.large-demo.tar, and Xavier.tar)  We are preparing a mailing-list for information regarding Xavier.

Note the early use of PostScript technology, predating many of this year's papers listed in the April 1st SIGGRAPH Program Announcement posted here a few days ago.  -- Eric   Intersection Between a Line and a Polygon (UNDECIDABLE??),  by Dave Baraff, Tom Duff   From: deb@charisma.graphics.cornell.edu  Newsgroups: comp.graphics  Keywords: P, NP, Jordan curve separation, Ursyhon Metrization Theorem  Organization: Program of Computer Graphics   I think that this is a very difficult problem.  To start with, lines and polygons are semi-algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of points.  Here are a few off-the-cuff ideas.  First, we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated.  Now, the Jordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into exactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions.  Thus, the line lies completely inside the polygon, the line lies completely outside the polygon, or possibly (but this will rarely happen) the line intersects the polyon.  Now, the phrasing of this question says \\\"if a line intersects a polygon\\\", so this is a decision problem.  One possibility (the decision model approach) is to reduce the question to some other (well known) problem Q, and then try to solve Q.  An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem.  In recent years, many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a new language called PostScript.  (See \\\"PostScript Language\\\", by Adobe Systems Incorporated, ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).  So, given a line L and a polygon P, we can write a PostScript program that draws the line L and the polygon P, and then \\\"outputs\\\" the answer.  By \\\"output\\\", we mean the program executes a command called \\\"showpage\\\", which actually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon.  A quick examination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q, and thus the original problem.  There are two small problems with this approach.    (1) There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into the  reduced problem Q.  So, we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of  Choice (or equivalently, Zorn's Lemma).  But the use of the Axiom of  Choice is not regarded in a very serious light these days.   (2) More importantly, the question arises as to whether or not the  PostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper; or in  other words, will it halt?   Now, PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a  Turing Machine might do; thus the halting problem (for PostScript) is  undecidable.  It is quite possible that the original problem will turn  out to be undecidable.   I won't even begin to go into other difficulties, such as aliasing, finite precision and running out of ink, paper or both.  A couple of references might be:  1. Principia Mathematica.  Newton, I.

Organization: AT&T Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill NJ  The situation is not nearly as bleak as Baraff suggests (he should know better, he's hung around The Labs for long enough).  By the well known Dobbin-Dullman reduction (see J. Dullman & D. Dobbin, J. Comp. Obfusc. 37,ii:  pp. 33-947, lemma 17(a)) line-polygon intersection can be reduced to Hamiltonian Circuit, without(!) the use of Grobner bases, so LPI (to coin an acronym) is probably only NP-complete.  Besides, Turing-completeness will no longer be a problem once our Cray-3 is delivered, since it will be able to complete an infinite loop in 4 milliseconds (with scatter-gather.)  --------  From: deb@svax.cs.cornell.edu (David Baraff)  Well, sure its no worse than NP-complete, but that's ONLY if you restrict yourself to the case where the line satisfies a Lipschitz condition on its second derivative.  (I think there's an '89 SIGGRAPH paper from Caltech that deals with this).  --\",\"  First of all, I resent your assumption that you know why I am threatened by science, or even that I am threatened at all, although I admit the latter.  The reason I am threatened by Science has nothing to do with my need for proof of my Lord's existence-- God reveals Himself in many ways, including, to some degree, Science.   My problem with Science is that often it allows us to assume we know what is best for ourselves.  God endowed us with the ability to produce life through sexual relations, for example, but He did not make that availible to everyone. Does that mean that if Science can over-ride God's decision through alterations, that God wills for us to have the power to decide who should and should not be able to have  children?  Should men be allowed to have babies, if that is made possible.   People have always had the ability to end lives unnaturally, and soon may have the ability to bring lives into the world unnaturally.  The closest thing to artificially created life is artificially created death, and as God has reserved judgement about when people should die to Himself, I believe we should rely on God's wisdom about how people should be brought in to the world.   This is not to say that I reject all forms of medical treatment, however.  Treatment that alleviates pain, or prevents pain from occuring, is perfectly acceptable, I believe, as it was acceptable for Jesus to cure the sick.  However, treatment that merely  prolongs life for no reason, or makes unnecessary  alterations to the body for mere aesthetic purposes,   go too far.  Are we not happy with the beauty God gave us?   I cannot draw a solid line regarding where I would approve of Scientific study, and where I would not, but I will say this:  Before one experiments with the universe to find out all its secrets, one should ask why they want this knowledge.  Before one alters the body they have been given, they should ask themseles why their body is not satisfactory too them as it is.  I cannot make any general rules that will cover all the cases, but I will say that each person should pray for guidance when trying to unravel the mysteries of the universe, and should cease their unravelling if they have reason to  believe their search is displeasing to God.\",\" Where were you brought up?

I was wonderin'..... I got screenpeace (the screensaver, which I think is *very* good), and I got a problem with it... There is an option there, \\\"realize colour table\\\", and if it's switched on, some wallpapers' colours will get *ucked up with some screensavers (e.g. the \\\"flashlight\\\" one).  If I turn it off, however, it works well, and it's faster, so I have it off.  All's nice and well.  However, If I turn it off, then it will be on again next time I start windows.  All the setting are set in the win.ini file, and I *do* have \\\"save settings on exit\\\" selected.  also, I tried manually changing the setting in the win.ini file to \\\"n\\\" (for no-->realize colour table), and started windows.  It will be fine for that session, but the next session will *again* turn the option on.  I tried adding a +R (read-only) attribute to my win.ini file, and it worked, but my bitmap (wallpaper) saver didn't work then. Actually, it's the same application.  Anywya, it didn't work, since it must change the setting at the win.ini file.  so anyone out there got any answers/suggesions/comments for me?  thanks, i.a.

I own a turbocharged one, and I would never buy a turbocharged vehicle unless I knew the owner and his/her driving/maintenance habits.   I have been wondering about that myself.  The '90 AWD models and the '91s were identical (except for the ABS option).     Yes.  Some owners had problems with the transaxles.  Using synthetic lubricants in the transaxles solved the problem in most cases.  The problem was not unique to the AWDs, however.  It was common to all models.  The Galant VR4 and GSX had the same transaxle, but I didn't see those listed in CR.   I don't know of any major complaints in this area, except that the battery that was installed at the factory had a low current rating.    The first FWD models (those built before May 1989) were recalled for brake upgrades.  Some FWD and AWD owners had problems with warped rotors.  Those of us who insist on using manual torque wrenches every time the lug nuts are tightened have never had a problem.   I can refer you to someone who has gone through a set of pads in one day!  It all depends on how you drive.  It seems that most owners have been getting between 40-70k on a set of pads.   First time I hear about a problem with the valve train on these cars, other than timing belt failures.   If your friend \\\"beats\\\" on the car, then his unit is not a representative sample of the car's reliability.  My suggestion is instead of listening to the useless Consumer Reports, talk to several owners (the mailing list may be the best way to reach a few of them).   #if (humor_impaired) skip_to TheEnd No matter how much you pay, you won't get all three.

This is very typical of the elitist Liberal attitude that The People  are incapable of thinking for themselves.  This elitist attitude will be the eventual undoing of the arrogant liberal tide sweeping America, as The People begin to realize more and more that they are being treated like errant children and robbed of their freedoms by a bunch of Utopian arrogent socialist jerks.         Although I find myself often disagreeing with the populist rationale of Mr. Limbaugh, I find him entertaining and I often agree with his  conclusions.  The fact that he sends liberal reactionaries like these idiots through the roof makes him all the more entertaining.     Actually, I find Limbaugh's oratory less than sizzling and his debating skills sometimes lacking, even though his conclusions are often correct.  I would suggest that a bankrupt leftist ideology that hopes to use concentrated  political power and a loaded gun to force everyone to do the \\\"right\\\" things (where \\\"right\\\" is defined by the elitist academics who lead the movement) is showing an acute case of \\\"myopic social perspective\\\", not to mention arrogance and utter stupidity.  Limbaugh is certainly far from perfect, but his opponents in the established body politic and the media are the ones arguing for Federal control of virtually all aspects of the lives of the Citizenry, and for the elimination of local control over Affairs Public.    Perhaps Limbaugh has a following because The People are tired of being treated  like errant children by a self-important group of arrogant controlling myopic  people who have no understanding of how life operates outside of the \\\"oughta-be's\\\" inside their own hopelessly closed minds.     OK, let us take your word for that and work with it.  A nice specific incident.     Hmmm, \\\"Congress shall pass no law regarding an establishment of religion, nor prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\\\"  Liberal translation: \\\"the federal government (as long as it is run by Liberals) may force local school districts to include certain iconic content in Christmas displays, while prohibiting others.\\\"  I think Limbaugh has you on this one.  It seems to me that he is arguing for LESS imposition of the federal government into religion.  Nice job on the specificity of that one, too.    [Analysis of historical/modern communication media deleted]    Ah yes, it is a conspiracy of profound proportions.  Methinks that you may be a bit resentful of Mr. Limbaugh's success because you attribute it primarily to luck (how, after all, could anyone with profound differences of opinion from yourself have become successful without the operation of conspiracy or blind luck!)  Do you feel this same level of knee-jerk resentment against lottery winners, or do you congratulate them on their good fortune?     This should be great fun, since it is the Liberal movement in America that is pushing the hardest for centralized fascist control of The People and business (government/business 'partnership' indeed), and Mr. Limbaugh  is the populist nemesis of that movement.  I have read Mr. Limbaugh's book, and although it was not the most literary piece I have read in recent memory it certainly did not contain \\\"venom\\\" at all, let alone \\\"venom\\\" comparable to an individual who callously murdered millions out of racism.     A very serious tone in that oratory.     You neglect to mention that Mr. Limbaugh (have you ever listened to his show,  BTW?) continuously encourages his audience to think for themselves rather than blindly following any media icon, himself included.  You yourself mention  that he makes no bones about his show being strictly about his own opinions. He also adopts a rather satirical approach, and presumes his audience to be intelligent enough to distinguish satire from seriousness (and he says as much). This is in contrast to the average mass-media show, in which the audience is treated as society's intellectual lowest common denominator.  I am sure that Adolf Hitler was a master of satire; I am sure he was just kidding when he said that the Jews were the cause of Germany's problems and needed to be exterminated.     This is not religion, it is clearly a perverse worship of race.  Since Christ was a Jew, it seems quite unlikely that Hitler's characterization of the Aryan as \\\"the highest image of the Lord\\\" fits with Christian doctrine.     Private religious schools have a vastly better record of success than publicly funded schools.  American history is indeed primarily Judeo- Christian.  I suppose that Mr. Limbaugh pointing out facts is equivalent to Adolf Hitler worshiping the Aryan race.  I think you might be reaching just a wee bit here.     Definite suggestion that the government should control the entertainment industry here.    Just a guess here, but I don't think that Mr. Limbaugh would advocate government control of Hollywood.  You should perhaps call his radio show to confirm this.  I believe this is more a criticism of Hollywood and the depraved moral values it espouses, not an advocation of government control  of Hollywood.  90's Liberals, on the other hand, want to have complete government control  of our school systems, so that the government can teach The People at an early age the \\\"right\\\" way to view religion and morality.  I believe Mr.  Limbaugh is against this, as his satirical use of the \\\"young heads full of mush\\\" hyperbole indicates.     Pretty strong conspiracy theory insinuated here, with an implicit plea for government power to be used to break up the conspiracy.     Indication here that \\\"Elements of the Media\\\" (since career is a self-selected categorization, perhaps an inferred 'larger percentage than represented in the populace at large') has a leftist bias.  Doesn't sound too unreasonable. No insinuation that CNN should not report in an objective fashion, only that for reporters to say that they do not have any personal bias in the situation is disingenuous to megalomaniacal.  You may disagree, and it may well be exagerrated, but it is not an unreasonable  opinion; and Mr. Limbaugh goes well out of his way to make sure that his  audience knows that these are his opinions, unlike most other reporting that  purports to achieve perfect objectivity but in actuality will in some degree  or other, in a statistical sense, reflect the biases of the reporters.  Who  is being disingenuous here, Mr. Shaw or Mr. Limbaugh?  Again, you should ask Mr. Limbaugh himself, but I expect that he would oppose government control of the media.              It is indeed depressing to see such myopia and tiresome Liberal arrogance. Liberals love to play games with paradigms as a way of discrediting people who disagree with them.  Why don't you challenge conservative ideology on an intellectual level rather than engaging in ludicrous comparisons? Perhaps the underpinnings of your ideology are intellectual only in that they exist in your mind, not the real world.     Perhaps there are a few among the intellectually challenged who percieve Rush Limbaugh as a hate-monger, but in my experience he has been spreading laughter at the ludicrous self-importance of the Left, not hatred.  As to Mr. Bush, you may be correct about his fascist economic leanings. Mr. Reagan, on the other hand, did his best to reverse the fascist trend of government involvement in business.  Mr. Clinton is increasing fascism in America through \\\"business/government partnership\\\" and increased levels of taxation.  Perhaps you should not have skipped your vocabulary classes in grade school.     Hmmm.  Seems to me that Limbaugh is not in any way comparable to Hitler because he has not murdered six million Jews and many, many others out of racism.  I come from a mixed-race family, so I am quite well attuned to racism; I don't hear any coming from Rush Limbaugh.  The only place I hear  racism coming from these days and being taken seriously is from the Liberal  Left.  The Liberal Left is the movement I see trying to get America hooked on the opiates of Socialized Medicine, Socialized Transportation, Socialized Education, etc.  The Left already has America hopelessly addicted to  that Liberal drug, the Social Security Chain Letter.  It is quite clear to me that while the Hitler analogy does not really apply to either Rush  Limbaugh or William Jefferson Clinton, if one of the two is closer than  the other it is clearly the Fascist Clinton.

For example, incorrect English constructs such as \\\"its raining\\\" or \\\"it's window id\\\" annoy me. However, there comes a time when popular usage starts to dictate the way things really are in the world. Indeed, the fact that X won out over NeWS was really down to popular opinion (I know, we all think it's(!) technically superior as well!).  On a related topic, who is to say that \\\"color\\\" is more or less correct than \\\"colour\\\" - being Irish, and hence using English English as opposed to American English, I always use the latter except, of course, for API terms such as \\\"XAllocColor\\\" and \\\"colormap\\\".  In a world that uses the term \\\"Windows\\\" to refer to Microsoft Windows, perhaps the time has come to accept \\\"X Windows\\\" as a valid term for X. I think that this is a more concise and uncluttered term than, say, \\\"the X Window System\\\" and, let's face it, almost everyone uses it. Ultimately, we all need product sales to more than just X-literate people. In this respect, product recognition is important and a short, snappy, descriptive title (\\\"X\\\" is positively obscure) will help when dealing with the average punter (it's sad - I thought I was a software engineer!). Indeed it is unfortunate that X did not become popularly known as Windows and let MS worry about whether it should be called \\\"Microsoft Windows\\\" or \\\"the Microsoft Window System\\\" or how about just plain \\\"Microsoft\\\"!  To summarise (or should that be \\\"summarize\\\") the point of this message: I think there are far more pressing issues facing the X community than worrying about subtle distinctions in the naming of the window system (or should that be \\\"windowing system\\\"). Whatever gets recognised is fine by me. I agree that one should be careful in interpreting what trade papers say. However, I would be reluctant to come to this conclusion purely on the basis of how they name the X Window System. \",\"+ +I know of no law, either on the books or proposed, that bans motorcycles +from any place that i want to go to.  Many private places ban bikes.  For example, the famous 17 mile drive at the Monterrey Peninsula.  And I have stayed at resorts that sported a \\\"No motorcycles allowed\\\" sign at the entrance.  And there have been public places.  Call the AMA and ask for Jim Bensberg (sp?) or any one else in their Legislative Office. They will recound the many public places that they had to bring to court to reverse their ban on bikes.  That includes everything from public parks to full cities.

Therefore there would be no way of detecting a radar detector any more than there would be of detecting whether some one had a radio in their car.  \",\"  As you point out, the experiments would be difficult. But we know enough about the physics of the situation to do some calculations. There are in fact three effects contributing to leaning the bike over to begin a turn.   1. Gyro effect causing a torque which twists the bike over.   2. Contact patch having shifted to one side, causing bike to fall over.   3. Contact patch being accelerated to the side, causing a  torque which twists the bike over.  Take an average bike/rider, average bike wheel, and at speeds of 5, 15, and 50 mph (say) calculate how much twist of the bars would be needed to produce (say) 20 degrees of lean in (say) 2 seconds by each effect alone. My guess is that at slow speeds 2 is dominant, and at high speeds 3 is dominant, and at all speeds 1 contributes not far off bugger all, relatively speaking.  By the way, a similar problem is this: how does a runner who wants to run round a corner get leaned into the corner fast? Is there a running group where we could start \\\"counter-footing\\\" arguments and have them all falling over as they tried to work out how they go round corners?\",\"  Perhaps it was Trottier.  It happened behind the Habs goal if I recall. Gainey simply didn't have his head up as he was picking up the puck.   If Gilmour was taken completely by surprise, as Gainey was, then yeah, I would have to say that Doug wasn't playing \\\"technically\\\" smart  hockey.  In any case, to claim as Greg did, that Gainey *never* made  a technical mistake is absolutely ludicrous.   Good for you.  You'd only be displaying your ignorance of course, but to  each his own...   I think Gainey should feel honoured to know that he is remembered at  all.   Certainly pluggers are an integral part of any team.  And that is simply because there are not enough solid two-way players to go  around.  Who would you rather have as your \\\"checking\\\" centre?  Doug Gilmour or Doug Jarvis?  For that matter I would take either Gretzky or Mario as my \\\"checking\\\" centres.  Do you think Gretzky could cover Bob Gainey?    You're wrong again.  The Selke is awarded to the forward that does the best job defensively and this may or may not be the best plugger.  If  Gilmour does the best defensive job in the league I don't see why he  should be out of the running simply because he also contributes offen- sively.  Settle down?

I don't know how much the teaching of countersteering in the beginner course really helps the tuchus steerers. I was one, I guess that I always steered a bicycle that way, and I only got the hang of countersteering in normal riding *after* the course. I could do the countersteering swerves in the course no problem, but I only started using it in my normal riding when I decided that my turning at speed (off-ramps and the like) was a lot more difficult that it should have been. I knew how it works (although that's currently up for debate) definitely knew *that* it works, as I could do it in swerves, but only figured it out later in my normal riding. Just a data point. I think that it's not a bad idea to bring the idea up, but it's best to let everyone tuchus-steer for the first lesson or two, so they can learn to shift gears before they have to worry about proper handlebar technique.   I have. In our beginner course we had passenger training. Sometime during the lesson the instructor would hop on the back of the bike, and the student would take him for a ride. If the student did not give the instructor the \\\"you are a sack of potatoes\\\" passenger speech, the instructor would steer the bike and make a general nuisance of himself.

Rob bell@plains.nodak.edu \",\" I bought a Viewsonic 17 for use at home but after a week I took it back.  I  felt for the money my NEC 5FG that I use at work was a much better monitor. The NEC is sharper, flatter, less distorted, and more stable.  I have heard  complaints from people about the NEC FG series having some quality control  problems but mine has been in use for about a year with no problems at all.  There was nothing really broken with the Viewsonic but overall it did not  match up.  I used my ATI Graphics Ultra in setup mode to push the  frequencies to their limits and the Viewsonic exhibited some problems that  the NEC did not.  I personally like the non-etched NEC with the OCLI filter  and the tube on the 17 was not as nice.  The 17 had some uncorrectable  pincusion and edge distortion problems.  Also, it would change brightness  when I switched modes and I was constantly having to fiddle with the  controls.  And the yoke was crooked and I had no way to compensate for the  raster that tilted downhill.  On the postive side, although not as handsome  as the NEC, the 17 had a smaller footprint and was not as heavy.  I have heard that Panasonic owns Viewsonic and the model 17 is being sold  through OEM channels with a Panasonic label on it.  If it's available that  way at a lower cost I could get more serious about it.  For now the NEC has  my vote but I'm searching for one of the new, cheaper, NEC 5FGe's to see if  it's just as good as its older brother the 5FG before I decide which one to  buy.  I have no experience with the Nanao.  I can never keep the Nanao models  straight and don't have any place I can walk in to get a good comparison of  all models.  --   Standard employer disclaimers apply   \",\"Perhaps one way of getting away from this cripple chip that the U.S. government seems to be pushing would be to come up with a good alternative. For example, how about a scheme using RSA, and some hybrid of DES-CFB and another strong stream cipher (Maybe IDEA-CFB)?  This could be substantially the same as the cripple chip, except that instead of key-registration, the police could demand that you give up your secret key to them (with a court- issued warrant).  Then, they could read the last few months of wiretapped messages you've sent, and assuming you've committed no crimes, you could generate a new key pair and go about your business.  I find that I'd be willing to pay RSA for the right to use such a system, especially given the alternative.  If you were unwilling to give up your secret key, then you'd probably stay in jail (has anyone got a real legal precedent for this?).    This would allow court-issued warrants to be used to gather information on suspected criminals, but it couldn't be done in secrecy, and there would be enormously less likelihood of corruption or theft of escrowed keys.

Astacio pitched ok, but had control trouble all night. In the first, he walked a batter, balked him to second, then a single scored the run, with the batter taking second on the throw home.  Another single made the score 2-0 Cards.   Lasorda tried a new line up featuring Butler, Reed, And Piazza batting third!  Darryl and Eric were benched in favor of Snyder and Webster.   Piazza homered in the first to make the score 2-1 Cards. The Dodgers tied the game in the second on a two out single by Offerman.   By the fourth inning, Astacio had already made about 80 pitches, but the score was still 2-2.  The Dodger defense made SEVERAL impressive plays.  Piazza looked GREAT behind the plate, gunning down a runner trying to steal second, throwing a runner out at first who had strayed a bit from first base, etc.   Karros also made a spectacular play, keeping a ball from going into the outfield.  The runner on first was so sure that ball was going through, he just kept running past second.  Karros got up and threw to third and EASILY got the runner at third.   My heart sank in the 7th when Gross got up to warm up in the bullpen.   Astacio was lifted for a pinch hitter, and when Gross entered the game with the score still 2-2, Dodger fans just KNEW it was over.   Gross was relieving because he stunk on Tuesday, pitching just 2 1/3 innings, forcing Lasorda to use much of his bullpen.  The 15 inning game had the same effect the next night...so only Gross was fresh given his light work out Tuesday.   Gross lived up to his name.  He walked the first batter, gave up a hit to the second, and walked the bases loaded.  After a grounder resulted in a force at home, Zeile lifted a scoring fly ball to make it 3-2 Cards.  Gross paid little attention to the runners, and the next thing you knew, the Cards had stolen a fourth run.  The runner on first was eventually tagged out in the run down, but the 4th run had scored long before that.   Meanwhile, the Dodgers mounted little offense after the second inning. Lee Smith pitched the ninth.  He had little trouble getting Karros and Wallach (does anyone have trouble with Wallach these days?). Cory Snyder collected his first hit as a Dodger, a single, but that was all the offense the Dodgers could mount.  Smith got his third straight save against the Dodgers and all I got was my free Dodger cap and a good look at Piazza.  If Piazza keeps this up all year, he will be a strong candidate for rookie of the year honors.  Though its really early, Karros is already showing signs of a sophomore jinx year.   The final score...Cardinals 4 runs on 7 hits. Dodgers 2 runs on 7 hits.\",\"Hi I am a Sociology student and I am currently researching into  young offenders.

It would be a third-party product to be installed by authorized repair centers (like Newer Technology's PaletteBook screen).  The idea is that the screen would fold in such a way that you would get twice the screen height of a normal screen (remember, technical issues aside!).  In fact, by adjusting the fold of the screen and the monitor configuration, you could have regular OR \\\"full\\\" height.  The screen would probably be monochrome. The motivation behind this is that laptop computers seem to be very popular among business people.  Business people also commonly use word processing and spreadsheet applications for which it is very convenient to see a large portion of the document.  Because of the target users and applications, color screens aren't really a neccessity.  We could hopefully keep the cost between $2000 and $3000.

Thanks in advance!!!\",\" I apologize to the moderator, but the first quote was deleted and I would like to respond to both.  As for the \\\"goal we can never achieve\\\", the reward comes from the trying.  Paul makes a clear claim that we are to continue straining for the prize over in Philippians 3:10-16.  Only by not living out the commands do we stagnate and become lukewarm, to be spit out by Jesus. As it says in 1 John 5:3:  \\\"This is love for God:  to obey his comands.\\\" That obedience is our straining to achieve for God.  Of course, this requires work on our part.  As for the quote in James, Satan doesn't care what we believe.  What matters is the results of our belief (works).  If one truly has faith in what one believes, one will either act on that faith or be lying to oneself about believing in the first place.    Stan, as for your first line, you have a very good point.  Obedience by obligation (grudgery) is not what God desires.  Instead, look at how many times the Bible talks about being joyous in all situations and when doing God's work.  Being begrudged by the work has no value.  Also, we should do the work necessary whenever we can, not just when we feel Jesus' presence.  Feelings can deceive us.  However, as Paul states to Timothy in 2 Timothy 4:2:  \\\"Preach the Word; be prepared in season and out of season; correct, rebuke and encourage--with great patience and careful instruction.\\\"  Also, remember that Paul tells Timothy in 1 Timothy 4:16:  \\\"Watch your life and doctrine closely.  Persevere in them, because if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers.\\\" So, in order to do the work necessary, we need to be sure that we are correct first.  Remember Jesus' warning in Matthew 7:3-5 not to be hypocritical about what we do.  The best way to accomplish this is to be a disciple completely in both thought and deed.  \",\"Thanks to whoever posted this wonderful parody of people who post without  reading the FAQ!

Now I think I've seen ads in popular Mac magazines for products (I'm not sure if it's just a monitor, just a video card, or a package of both) that allow you to change resolutions on the fly (w/o restarting the Mac).  If you were to buy a 1304, would it be possible to switch back and forth between Apple 640x480 and Apple 832x624 without restarting the Mac?  Is this strictly a hardware startup function, or can software intervene, or does the Mac hardware occasionally probe the cable setting and switch automatically?  Thanks,\",\"THE HAMAS WAY of DEATH        (Following is a transcript of a recruitment and training videotape made last summer by the Qassam Battalions, the military arm of Hamas, an Islamic Palestinian group. Hamas figures significantly in the Middle East equation. In December, Israel deported more than 400 Palestinians to Lebanon in response to Hamas's kidnapping and execution of an Israeli soldier. A longer version appears in the May issue of Harper's Magazine, which obtained and translated the tape.)        My name is Yasir Hammad al-Hassan Ali. I live in Nuseirat [a refugee camp in the Gaza Strip]. I was born in 1964. I finished high school, then attended Gaza Polytechnic. Later, I went to work for Islamic University in Gaza as a clerk. I'm married and I have two daughters.      The Qassam Battalions are the only group in Palestine explicitly dedicated to jihad [holy war]. Our primary concern is Palestinians who collaborate with the enemy. Many young men and women have fallen prey to the cunning traps laid by the [Israeli] Security Services.      Since our enemies are trying to obliterate our nation, cooperation with them is clearly a terrible crime. Our most important objective must be to put an end to the plague of collaboration. To do so, we abduct collaborators, intimidate and interrogate them in order to uncover other collaborators and expose the methods that the enemy uses to lure Palestinians into collaboration in the first place. In addition to that, naturally, we confront the problem of collaborators by executing them.      We don't execute every collaborator. After all, about 70 percent of them are innocent victims, tricked or black-mailed into their misdeeds. The decision whether to execute a collaborator is based on the seriousness of his crimes. If, like many collaborators, he has been recruited as an agent of the Israeli Border Guard then it is imperative that he be executed at once. He's as dangerous as an Israeli soldier, so we treat him like an Israeli soldier.      There's another group of collaborators who perform an even more loathsome role -- the ones who help the enemy trap young men and women in blackmail schemes that force them to become collaborators. I regard the \\\"isqat\\\" [the process by which a Palestinians is blackmailed into collaboration] of single person as greater crime than the killing of a demonstrator. If someone is guilty of causing repeated cases of isqat, than it is our religious duty to execute him.      A third group of collaborators is responsible for the distribution of narcotics. They work on direct orders from the Security Services to distribute drugs as widely as possible. Their victims become addicted and soon find it unbearable to quit and impossible to afford more. They collaborate in order to get the drugs they crave. The dealers must also be executed.      In the battalions, we have developed a very careful method of uncovering collaborators, We can't afford to abduct an innocent person, because once we seize a person his reputation is tarnished forever. We will abduct and interrogate a collaborator only after evidence of his guilt has been established -- never before. If after interrogation the collaborator is found guilty beyond any doubt, then he is executed.      In many cases, we don't have to make our evidence against collaborators public, because everyone knows that they're guilty. But when the public isn't aware that a certain individual is a collaborator, and we accuse him, people are bound to ask for evidence. Many people will proclaim his innocence, so there must be irrefutable proof before he is executed. This proof is usually obtained in the form of a confession.      At first, every collaborator denies his crimes. So we start off by showing the collaborator the testimony against him. We tell him that he still has a chance to serve his people, even in the last moment of his life, by confessing and giving us the information we need.      We say that we know his repentance in sincere and that he has been a victim. That kind of talk is convincing. Most of them confess after that. Others hold out; in those cases, we apply pressure, both psychological and physical. Then the holdouts confess as well.      Only one collaborator has ever been executed without an interrogation. In that case, the collaborator had been seen working for the Border Guard since before the intifada, and he himself confessed his involvement to a friend, who disclosed the information to us. In addition, three members of his network of collaborators told us that he had caused their isqat. With this much evidence, there was no need to interrogate him. But we are very careful to avoid wrongful executions. In every case, our principal is the same: the accused should be interrogated until he himself confesses his crimes.       A few weeks ago, we sat down and complied a list of collaborators to decide whether there were any who could be executed without interrogation. An although we had hundreds of names, still, because of our fear of God and of hell, we could not mark any of these men, except for the one I just mentioned, for execution.      When we execute a collaborator in public, we use a gun. But after we abduct and interrogate a collaborator, we can't shoot him -- to do so might give away our locations. That's why collaborators are strangled. Sometimes we ask the collaborator, \\\"What do you think? How should we execute you?\\\" One collaborator told us, \\\"Strangle me.\\\" He hated the sight of blood. \",\" I remember one he hit circa 1976 at Wrigley Field that went across the street (in dead center field) and hit a house on the roof.

BACKGROUND  ----------   The racing listserver (boogie.EBay.sun.com) contains discussions   devoted to racing and racing-related topics. This is a pretty broad   interest group. Individuals have a variety of backgrounds: motojournalism,   roadracing from the perspective of pit crew and racers, engineering,  motosports enthusiasts.   The size of the list grows weekly. We are currently at a little  over one hundred and eighty-five members, with contributors from  New Zealand, Australia, Germany, France, England, Canada  Finland, Switzerland, and the United States.   The list was formed (October 1991) in response to a perceived need   to both provide technical discussion of riding at the edge of   performance (roadracing) and to improve on the very low signal-to-noise   ratio found in rec.motorcycles. Anyone is free to join.   Discussion is necessarily limited by the rules of the list to   issues related to racing motorcycles and is to be \\\"flame-free\\\".     HOW TO GET THE DAILY DISTRIBUTION  ---------------------------------   You are welcome to subscribe. To subscribe send your request to:           race-request@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM    Traffic currently runs between five and twenty-five messages per day  (depending on the topic).      NB: Please do _not_ send your subscription request to the        list directly.    After you have contacted the list administrator, you will receive  an RSVP request. Please respond to this request in a timely manner  so that you can be added to the list. The request is generated in  order to insure that there is a valid mail pathway to your site.    Upon receipt of your RSVP, you will be added to either the daily  or digest distribution (as per your initial request).   HOW TO GET THE DIGEST DISTRIBUTION  ----------------------------------   It is possible to receive the list in 'digest'ed form (ie. a  single email message). The RoadRacing Digest is mailed out   whenever it contains enough interesting content. Given the  frequency of postings this appears to be about every other  day.   Should you wish to receive the list via digest (once every   30-40K or so), please send a subscription request to:           digest-request@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM    HOW TO POST TO THE LIST  -----------------------   This is an open forum. To post an article to the list, send to:           race@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM    Depending on how mail is set up at your site you may or may  not see the mail that you have posted. If you want to see it  (though this isn't necessarily a guarantee that it went out)  you can include a \\\"metoo\\\" line in your .mailrc file (on UNIX  based mail systems).    BOUNCES  -------   Because I haven't had the time (or the inclination to replace  the list distribution mechanism) we still have a problem with  bounces returning to the poster of a message. Occasionally,  sites or users go off-line (either leaving their place of  employment prematurely or hardware problems) and you will receive  bounces from the race list. Check the headers carefully, and  if you find that the bounce originated at Sun (from whence I  administer this list) contact me through my administration  hat (race-request@boogie.EBay.sun.com). If not, ignore the bounce.

In fact, it is often chosen (besides its other merits) because it shoots like a revolver does basically.  It can limit the training time (read budget $$$) due to the fact there are no 'external' safties other than the trigger, hence less training time required.    Smith & Wesson (among other types) are chosen due to the fact taht they do have the external safties (hammer drop,as well as mag drop) which if properly used have saved many lives when 'Mr. Bad' snatched the gun from the officer and tried to shoot said officer the gun was on safe and would not fire.  This point had been made in many articles in various  gun magazines.  If fact, one author (can't remember who) staged a little test where he had a revolver and a S&W on safe laying on a table and asked people with little firearms experience to on his signal, grab the gun and shoot a target.  He timed the people using each gun.  The revolver times were pretty close, but some of the times with the S&W were in minutes, or the person just gave up because they could not figure out the saftey.   You don't often see Colt 45 autos issued due to the light trigger which can be accidentally fired in a stress situation, opening the issuing city,county, etc.. to lawsuits, bad press, etc..   Of course any problem can be overcome with enough training, but such training is not always available to budget crunched departments.  I know if I were a Cop I would want something like a S&W just for the off chance of the gun getting taken away.  The safety doesn't guarantee that 'Mr. Bad' won't figure it out and shoot me, but it could buy enough time to draw a second gun and shoot 'Mr. Bad' before it's too late.   Don't think I am too biassed here just because I have had 3 Glocks in my possession at one time, because I have had a .45 as well.  In fact, it was my first handgun.  Remember, the ultimate 'safety' is YOU the operator, and no safety is going to stop an negligent discharge (note I don't say accidental) if you break the rules of gun handling.   As per the part of being light weight and looking cool, I agree 100%.  I wouldn't rule it out as a first purchase.  \",\"Hi All  Hope you all had a Blessed Easter.

Twenty minutes later, when Jeff's color had paled to a flush, Matty presented him with an estimate of $580 for a busted right mirror and a hairline crack in the fairing.  That was for fixing the crack and masking the damaged area, not a new fairing.  Or he could buy the bike.

In fact, for the Bible to be of any use to mankind as a moral code, it must be interpreted by mankind and a workable moral system created for everyday use.  The Jewish Talmud is the result of centuries of Biblical scholars analysing every word of the Torah to understand the morality behind it. The Children of Israel were given a very strict set of Moral, Civil, Judicial and Ceremonial Laws to follow and yet this was clearly not enough to cover every instance of moral dilemma in their Society. For a Christian, the situation is no better.  It seems to me that the only code of morality that we have from the Judeo- Christian God is that which is contained in the Bible (which we can see from the diverse opinions in the Christian newsgroups is not clear). There may well be an absolute morality defined by the Judeo-Christian God for mankind to follow but it seems that we only have a subset simply because the concept was written down by man.  This leads to the problem of defining morality for our society. If we take the divine Morality then we have a code of practice which may be interpreted in many different ways (as an example, consider the immolation of heretics in the fifteenth century and the interpretation of the Bible which allows a man to do that to another man under the precept to administer Justice). If we take an agnostic Morality then we have a code of practice that can be modified to suit society (with all the danger that this implies). Alternatively, we could take the basis of the Judeo-Christian morality and interpret/extend this to create and justify a code of morality which suits the society we live in and enables the people to live Righteously (as many Christian and Non-Christian philosophers have done).

Compression was a little low, but very even across the four cylinders (+/- 5 psi).  They said that it was tested a little cold, so that would explain the low  numbers (around 90).  Does this sound right?  Otherwise, the bike looked great.  No signs of road rash, and no rust.  This bike looks great!  It is now in the shop getting tuned and new tires.   I am opting for the Metzler ME55 and ME33 tires (thanks to those  who posted this other thread).  This bike is _BIG_ compared to my other bikes.   ( Sure is alot harder to load on a trailer than the KDX200 was. )  I should be road legal tomorrow.  I am ignoring the afforementioned concerns about  the transmission and taking my chances.  Being a reletively new reader, I am quite impressed with all the usefull info available on this newsgroup.

If it is run more than once on a display, the tones are buffered in the X server and the tone contunues after all occurrences of the program have exited. Is there a convenient way of preventing this, e.g., by emptying the X server bell buffer when each program exits? - Disclaimer: Please note that the above is a personal view and should not    be construed as an official comment from the JET project. \",\"  I agree, although I would have no idea how to go about doing it.

The only problem is these Indiana winters--my heater controls don't work.  The car has vacuum operated control switches for the vents.  Right now it is stuck in the \\\"vent\\\" mode.  It will blow warm air, but I can't switch the air flow to either the floor (I can live without this) or the defrost (I can't  live without this).  I probably could just jam the air deflector to the  defrost position, but this blows a lot of air in my face and is, well, kind of like putting a vacuum cleaner in reverse.  I have taken parts of the dash off and looked at the vacuum system and I think the problem (or part of it) is with the two diaphragms which control up/down and outside/inside air flow.  THe diaphragm which controls outside(vent)/in- side(no vent) air is cracked most of the way around, and the other one is probably damaged too, considering the advanced age of the car.  Two questions:   1)  Is there anything I should be aware of about this (other than  the fact that I should move from Indiana) ?   2)  In the event that replacement diaphragms aren't available, is there  a way to \\\"fix\\\" this?  THanks for any advice/info  selah,\",\" Look how long the Maple Leafs and Nordiques used similar logic....  Not that they fielded bad teams solely to field bad teams, but the Maple Leafs (and a certain dead man who was in charge) were one of the cheapest teams in the history of the sport.  Guess what-- they were immensely popular at the gate.  The Nordiques have also done well for a team that had missed the playoffs so many years in a row.   Ha!  Such humor!  They have MAJOR fan problems, namely that on occasion some of them don't make it home from the match!  The soccer fans tend to be fanatical, much like the Montreal fans who firebomb the players and coaches houses when they play pathetically.   -JPC  -- \",\"  Even worse, the city of Atlanta has a proposal before it to rent space on this orbiting billboard.

If this is true, it will most likely depend on whether or not Ottawa gets to choose 1st overall.  Can Ottawa afford Lindros' salary?   Personally, I can't see Philli giving up Lindros -- for anything.   They didn't give away that much to Quebec just to trade him away  again.  Not to mention that Lindros seems to be a *huge* draw in Phillie -- and that he represents a successful future for the  franchise.

Of course the measure of response time should be based on the applications you are planning to run. \",\" The third-party media adapters are usually cheaper (at least in Toronto) than Apple's. I bought the adapters from Asante instead of Apple.   That's not true. Only the DECstation 5000/200 comes with a Thinwire (BNC, coaxial) Ethernet connector. The 5000/25, 5000/133 and 5000/240 all have a single 15-pin AUI Ethernet connector only. I distinctly remembered this because when got the 5000/200 first and I thought all of them are going to be Thinwire. I eventually had to go back and ordered DESTAs (DEC's oversized version of an AUI-to-BNC adapter that MUST be used with a transciever cable) for the rest of the stations.  My advise to the very original poster (Beverly?) is:  (1) If all you want is to create a LAN with two workstations and won't add     machines to it EVER, go for Thinwire regardless of the media type. Going     for UTP (unshielded twisted pair) wiring requires a concentrator which     means extra money and I believe these units come with at least 6 ports.     As for Thicknet, it's a nightmare and cabling is expensive. Avoid it     unless you have no choice (e.g. the two machines are two floors parts).  (2) On the Mac side, you will need:     - one Thinwire media adapter (from Apple or third-party).     - MacX (make sure you get version 1.2; 1.1.7 won't run on System 7.1).     - MacTCP (which comes with MacX; if you get MacX v1.2, you should be       getting MacTCP v1.1.1 with it. Don't use earlier versions on a Centris).     - you may or may not need a 25ohm terminator depending on the       Thinwire media adapter. So just ask the sales if the adapter is       self-terminated or not.     - configure MacTCP to use \\\"Ethernet\\\".  (3) On the DECstation side, you will need:     - for a Model 200, you will only need a T-connector.     - for Models 25, 125, 133, 240, you will need an AUI-to-BNC adapter.       Get one that can be plugged in directly to the AUI port of the       DECstation. This way you save the cost of a transciever cable       (a 15-pin AUI male to a 15-pin AUI female cable).     - get a 25ohm terminator.  Your two-machine network will look like this:          ##T----------------------------------------------[]       +-----+                                           |       |     |                                           |       +-----+                                         +-----+                                                       |     |                                                       +-----+     DECstation                                        Centris      5000/200                                           650                               OR         ##T----------------------------------------------[]         {=}                                             |       +-----+                                           |       |     |                                         +-----+       +-----+                                         |     |                                                       +-----+     DECstation                                        Centris 5000/25,125,133,240                                     650              ##    -> 25ohm terminator    T     -> T connector    ---   -> Thinwire (RG58 coaxial cable)    {=}   -> AUI-to-BNC (i.e. Thick-to-Thin) adapter    []    -> Thickwire media adapter (assuming self-terminated)    |    |  Andy\",\"[For those attending the AAAI conf this summer, note that this conference is immediately preceding it.]            PRELIMINARY PROGRAM AND REGISTRATION MATERIALS                First International Conference on           Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology                         Washington, D.C.

Material covered will include structural and informational  molecules, the basic organization of the cell and of genetic  material, the \\\"central dogma\\\" of gene expression, and selected  other topics in the area of structure, function, and regulation as  relates to current computational approaches.  Dr. Noordewier has  appointments in both Computer Science and Biology at Rutgers, and  has extensive experience in basic biological research in addition  to his current work in computational biology.  12:00-2:45pm \\\"Introduction to Artificial Intelligence for   Biologists\\\"  Dr. Richard Lathrop (MIT & Arris Corp.)  An overview of the field of artificial intelligence will be  presented, as it relates to actual and potential biological  applications.  Fundamental techniques, symbolic programming  languages, and notions of search will be discussed, as well as  selected topics in somewhat greater detail, such as knowledge  representation, inference, and machine learning.  The intended  audience includes biologists with some computational background,  but no extensive exposure to artificial intelligence.  Dr.  Lathrop, co-developer of ARIADNE and related technologies, has  worked in the area of artificial intelligence applied to  biological problems in both academia and industry.  3:00-5:45pm \\\"Neural Networks, Statistics, and Information Theory   in Biological Sequence Analysis\\\" Dr. Alan Lapedes (Los Alamos   National Laboratory)   This tutorial will cover the most rapidly-expanding facet of  intelligent systems for molecular biology, that of machine  learning techniques applied to sequence analysis.  Closely  interrelated topics to be addressed include the use of artifical  neural networks to elicit both specific signals and general  characteristics of sequences, and the relationship of such  approaches to statistical techniques and information-theoretic  views of sequence data.  Dr. Lapedes, of the Theoretical  Division at Los Alamos, has long been a leader in the use of such  techniques in this domain.  3:00-5:45pm \\\"Genetic Algorithms and Genetic Programming\\\"   Prof. John Koza (Stanford University)  The genetic algorithm, an increasingly popular approach to highly  non-linear multi-dimensional optimization problems, was originally  inspired by a biological metaphor.  This tutorial will cover both  the biological motivations, and the actual implementation and  characteristics of the algorithm.  Genetic Programming, an  extension well-suited to problems where the discovery of the size  and shape of the solution is a major part of the problem, will  also be addressed.  Particular attention will be paid to  biological applications, and to identifying resources and software  that will permit attendees to begin using the methods.  Dr. Koza,  a Consulting Professor of Computer Science at Stanford, has taught  this subject since 1988 and is the author of a standard text in  the field.  3:00-5:45pm \\\"Linguistic Methods in Sequence Analysis\\\"   Prof. David Searls (University of Pennsylvania)   & Shmuel Pietrokovski (Weizmann Institute)  Approaches to sequence analysis based on linguistic methodologies  are increasingly in evidence.  These involve the adaptation of  tools and techniques from computational linguistics for syntactic  pattern recognition and gene prediction, the classification of  genetic structures and phenomena using formal language theory, the  identification of significant vocabularies and overlapping codes  in sequence data, and sequence comparison reflecting taxonomic and  functional relatedness.  Dr. Searls, who holds research faculty  appointments in both Genetics and Computer Science at Penn,  represents the branch of this field that considers higher-order  syntactic approaches to sequence data, while Shmuel Pietrokovski  has studied and published with Prof. Edward Trifinov in the area  of word-based analyses.

Yes, he does have a second alternator.  Yes, he calls the rig an \\\"electronic brake\\\" since the engine noticeably slows when the key is down.  My car, unfortunately, has so much computer junk under the hood that it's astonishingly sensitive to RFI.

Unfortunately, the specification for XGrabKey doesn't allow AnyModifier to be combined with other modifiers, which is exactly what would be desired in this case: \\\"Ctrl Any<Key>q\\\".   This is true for accelerators and mnemonics, which are implemented using event handlers instead of grabs; it's not true for menu accelerators.  If you're a Motif implementor, I'd suggest lobbying to get the Xlib semantics changed to support the feature I described above.  Otherwise, change the documentation for menu accelerators to properly set the user's expectations, because menu accelerators are NOT the same thing as translations.   If you mean \\\"menu accelerator\\\", no it's not possible.  That's according to the definition of the XmNaccelerator resource in the XmLabel manual page.   I can't think of a reason why not.   There is a workaround for Motif users.  In addition to the normal menu accelerator you install on the XmPushButton[Gadget], set an XtNaccelerators resource on the shell (TopLevel or Application).  Install the shell's accelerators on itself and all of its descendants with XtInstallAllAccelerators (shell, shell).  For example,    applicationShell - mainWindow - menuBar - fileCascade        -- filePulldown - openPushbutton          - exitPushbutton    *openPushbutton.accelerator = Ctrl<Key>O   *openPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+O   *exitPushbutton.accelerator = Ctrl<Key>Q   *exitPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+Q    *applicationShell.accelerators = #override\\\\n\\\\     Ctrl<Key>O: PerformAction(*openPushbutton, ArmAndActivate)\\\\n\\\\     Ctrl<Key>Q: PerformAction(*exitPushbutton, ArmAndActivate)  You have to write and add the application action PerformAction, which you can implement by using XtNameToWidget on the first argument and then XtCallActionProc with the rest of the arguments.  I tested out something similar to this.  To shorten development time, I used TeleUSE's TuNinstallAccelerators resource to install the accelerators on the shell, and I directly invoked the Open and Quit D actions instead of asking the pushbuttons to do it for me, but the more general approach I described above should work.\",\"I have a 512k VRAM chip for sale.

A family sedan designed to be operable at 85mph doesn't suddenly become operable at 130mph because you added some plastic aero effects, slightly wider tires, and a much larger engine.  That's what the SHO is -- a slightly modified family sedan with a powerful engine.  They didn't even bother improving the *brakes.*  The Mustang is essentially the same deal as the SHO -- a big power plant stuck in a mid-size sedan, with almost no other modifications. I have real-life experience with the Mustang -- it handles like a brick (except when you're invoking oversteer, of course, something I personally avoid doing on the highway) and stopping power is inadequate even from 80mph.  Lots of accelleration -- but the rest of the car is not up to par.  I picked the Porsche example because they are designed with speed in mind.  It didn't have to be the 911 -- it could have been the much cheaper 944 or one of several Mercedes or Audi models.  All of these cars are fairly expensive -- but so are the parts that make them drivable at high speed.  This should be elementary.  There are a few things to keep in mind about Europe, since you brought it up.  My Autobahn knowledge is admittedly second-hand, but I believe the following to be true:  1. Drivers are much better disciplined in Europe than they are here. 2. The roads comprising the Autobahn are much better designed than    they are here, and usually include animal fences.  This makes them    far more predictable than most US highways. 3. Not all of Europe is the Autobahn.  Most places in Europe have    speed limits that aren't out-of-line with what we used to have in    the US -- if my friends weren't lying to me they're typically not    much higher than 120km/h.  I strongly suspect you won't find a lot of Rabbit owners doing 120mph (nearly 200km/h) on the Autobahn, but I could be wrong.  Some people have no respect for their own lives.

The scribe Matthew is perhaps the most eager to draw out what he thinks are prophetic answers in the career of Jesus of Nazareth.  As you will see, Matthew's main strategy is to take various Old Testament passages, often not even about the promised Messiah, and apply them to the circumstances in the New Testament.  We must also bear in mind the question of the authenticity of the accounts.  Since the gospels were written at least 35 years after Jesus was executed, we do not know how much happened exactly as stated.  But, for purposes of analysis, we will take particular claims at face value.  Immanuel:         We begin, of course, at the beginning.         (Mt 1.21-22):  \\\"[Mary] will bear a son, and you,        Joseph, will name him 'Jesus' (which means G'd is        salvation), for he will save his people from their        sins.\\\"  All this happened to fulfil what the lord had        spoken by a prophet:         [Isaiah 7.1-16]:  In the days of Ahaz (c. 750 BCE),        king of Judah, Rezin of Syria and Pekah of Israel made        war on Jerusalem (capitol of Judah), but could not        quite conquer it.  When the house of David (i.e. Ahaz        and his court in Judah) were told of this, ...its        heart and the heart of its people shook...   And, the        lord G'd said to Isaiah, \\\"go to meet with Ahaz...\\\"         ...And the lord spoke to Ahaz (through prophet Isaiah,        naturally) saying, \\\"Ask a sign of G'd your lord.  It        can be as deep as Sheol or as high as heaven.\\\"  But,        Ahaz said, \\\"I won't ask; I will not put the lord to a        test.\\\"  Then (Isaiah) said, \\\"Hear then, O house of        David.  Is it not enough for you to weary men, that        you must weary my god too?  Therefore, the lord        himself will give you a sign:  Behold, a young woman        is with child and will bear a son, and name him        \\\"Immanuel,\\\" which means, \\\"G'd is with us.\\\"   He will        eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse evil        and choose good.  For, before the child knows how to        refuse evil and choose good, the land of the two kings        you dread will have been deserted...  Matthew homes in on just the sentence that is in italics.  Further, he the Hebrew word \\\"almah,\\\" (young woman), as specifically, \\\"virgin.\\\"  But, this is not a prophecy about the Messiah.  It is not a prophecy about an event to happen 750 years later.  It is not a prophecy about a virgin (bethulah) mother.  In short, it not about Jesus.  Matthew has made use of a verse out of context, and tries to make it fit the specific case of Mary.  It should be noted that if we want to read the prophecy in a general manner, a very general one, it can be made to fit Mary.  Mary, virgin or not, was indeed a young woman with child.  Of course, the fit is shady and has problems.  Jesus, while thought of by later Christians to be G'd walking among men, was never called by the name, Immanuel.  If Christianity wished to claim this prophecy for Jesus, it becomes at best a cut-and-paste prophecy... a second class prophecy.   Not too convincing.  Egypt:         After Jesus's birth in Bethlehem, Matthew tells about a quick (and elsewhere unmentioned) excursion to Egypt, as if he wishes to liken Jesus to Moses.  This was done to escape an alleged infanticidal rampage of the king, Herod.         [Mt 2.15]  ...and remained there until the death of        Herod.  This was to fulfil what the lord had spoken:        \\\"Out of Egypt I have cal-led my son.\\\"   What the lord really said was this.         [Hosea 11.1]  When Israel was a child, I loved him.         And, out of Egypt I called my son.  The more I called        them (my people), the more they went from me; they        kept sacrificing to the Ba'als, and kept burning        incense to idols.  Matthew conveniently omits the rest of Hosea's oracle.  But, it was indeed Israel that, once called out of Egypt, wanted to return.  This is history.  Jesus is certainly not being spoken of here.  And, if we are to draw some kind of parallel here, we wind up with a Jesus that flees and resists G'd.   Again, this prophecy is just not as convincing as Matthew probably had hoped.  Rachel Weeps:          While Jesus is off vacationing in Egypt, Matthew says that King Herod sought to kill him, and thus ordered the executions of all young male children.  Matthew then writes,         [Mt 2.17-18]   By this, that which was spoken by the        prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:         \\\"A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and loud        lamentation-- Rachel weeping for her children;        she refused to be consoled, because they were        no more.\\\"     The reference is to a passage in Jeremiah 31.15, referring to the carrying off of Israel into exile by Sargon (of Assyria) in 722 BCE.  Rachel, the ancestor of the major tribes of Israel, Ephraim, and Manasseh, is said to weep for her descendants who are \\\"no more.\\\"  It is metaphorical, of course, since Rachel lived and dies before the Hebrews were even in the Egyptian exile.        It is interesting to note that it was Leah, not Rachel, who was the ancestor of the Judeans (the land where Jesus and Bethlehem were).  If anyone should do weeping for her \\\"children,\\\" it is Leah.  The only connexion that Rachel has with Bethlehem is that the legends have it that she was buried north of the city, \\\"on the way to Ephrath, (Bethlehem).\\\"        As for Herod and his infanticide, it is rather unlikely that such an event actually occurred.  One never knows, but the event is not mentioned or alluded to anywhere else in the Bible, nor is it mentioned in any of the secular records of the time.  Herod was particularly unliked in his reign, and many far less evil deeds of Herod were carefully recorded.  This might be a prime example of how events were added to Jesus's life to enhance the message of the church's gospel.        Because of the whole story's similarity to the tale of the infant Moses in Egypt, it is highly likely that it is a device set up by Matthew to add prophetic, yet artificial, approval of Jesus. It is not surprising that Matthew conveniently neglects to mention the rest of the Jeremiah quote.   The \\\"children\\\" the prophet speaks of are not dead, but exiled in the Assyrian Empire.  G'd comforts the weeping Rachel, saying that the children will be returned-- he will gather them back together.  Of course, this would not suit Matthew's purpose, as the children he speaks of are dead for good.  Again, the \\\"prophecy\\\" Matthew sets up is not even that, and to anyone who bothers to check it out, is not too convincing.  The Nazarene:         We do not even have to go to the next chapter to find another Matthean prophecy.  After leaving Egypt, Joseph & wife take the infant Jesus to live in the city of Nazareth,          [Mt 2.23]  ...that what was spoken of by the prophets        might be fulfilled, \\\"He shall be called a Nazarene.\\\"  First thing we notice is that Matthew does not mention the name of the prophet(s) this time.  Second, we have to ask who \\\"He\\\" is.  There are no Messianic prophecies speaking of a Nazarene.  Worse, there are no prophecies, period, mentioning a Nazarene.  Still worse, there are no Nazarenes mentioned in the Old Testament at all.  In the book of Judges, an angel tells Samson's mother that she will,         [Judges 13.5]  \\\"...conceive and bear a son.  No razor        shall tough his head, for he will be a Nazirite to his        god from the day of his birth.  He will deliver Israel        from the hands of the Philistines.\\\"  This is of course not a prophecy of Jesus, or the messiah of G'd.  But, it is the best that can be found.  Obviously, Matthew has begun to go overboard in cut-and-paste prophecies, in that he is simple making them up now.  Bearing our Diseases:         Jesus next goes around healing people of physical illnesses and disabilities.         [Mt 8.17]   This was to fulfil what was spoken by the        prophet Isaiah, \\\"He took our infirmities and bore our        diseases.\\\"  As expected, the verse quoted in Isaiah is quoted out of context, and a few words are skewed to fit the Christian scheme.  We have,         [Is 53.4]  Surely he, [the suffering servant], has        borne our sickness, and carried our pains.  From a reading of the surrounding passages in Isaiah, we know that the prophet is speaking in present tense of the collective nation of Israel, Jehovah's chosen servant and people.  He speaks to the Israelites suffering in exile, in the voice of the gentile nations that look upon it.  This image is deeply ingrained in Jewish identity --an image of a chastised, yet cherished, Israel as the instrument of the nations' salvation by G'd.       The verses speak of Israel taking on the sicknesses which are the literal and metaphorical manifestations of guilt and discipline.  They do not speak of a \\\"servant\\\" going around and healing people.  Notice that the servant in Isaiah takes on the sicknesses and pains of the nations (and individual Jews).  Jesus, as we all know, did not take the diseases onto himself.  The verses here in Isaiah are not a prophecy of something to come, but rather something that had already happened.  While it is believed that Jesus took on the eternal punishment of hell, he did not bear the illnesses he healed.  So, while someone might want to say that, figuratively, Jesus reenacted the deeds of Israel in his spiritual atonement, he has to admit that Matthew's parallel misses where he intended it to have its effect.   Silent Messiah:        Upon healing multitudes of commoners, it is said that Jesus ordered them to keep quiet, presumable so that he wouldn't arouse the attention of the local rulers.         [Mt 12.15-21]  This was to fulfill what was spoken by        the prophet Isaiah.            \\\"Behold my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved,        with whom my soul is pleased.  I will put my spirit on        him, and he will announce justice to the Gentiles.  He        will not wrangle or cry aloud, nor will anyone hear        his voice in the streets.  He will not break a bruised        reed or quench a smoldering wick until he brings        justice to victory, and the gentiles will hope in his        name.\\\"  The Isaiah passage quoted reads,         [Is 42.1-4]  Behold my servant whom I uphold, my        chosen, in whom my soul delights.  I have put my        spirit on him, and he will bring forth justice to the        nations.  We will not cry or lift up his voice, or        make it heard in the street.  He will not break a        bruised reed, or quench a smoldering wick.  He will        faithfully bring forth justice.  He will not fail        (burn dimly) or be discouraged (bruised) until he has        established justice in the earth.  And the coastlands        await his law.  You see, Matthew has conveniently left out part of the passage, because it does not suit the dealings of Jesus.  Christians could never think of Jesus failing, never would the \\\"light\\\" of mankind burn dimly.  But, the servant nation of Israel will indeed come to an end when its job is done.  When the gentiles come to embrace G'd there will no longer be a chosen people, but rather all will be the children of G'd.  Also, the ending phrase has been changed from the Judaic \\\"...the coastlands await his law.\\\" to the Christologic, \\\"the Gentiles will hope in his name.\\\"   While the original proclaims the Torah law of Jehovah, the other rewrites it to fit its strange doctrine of \\\"believing in the name.\\\"  If one has any doubt the servant referred to is not Jesus, one has only to read the whole chapter, Isaiah 42, and hear about the beloved but blind and imperfect servant, \\\"a people robbed and plundered...\\\"   So, we see that when Matthew's attempt at \\\"prophecy\\\" is examined, it crumbles.  Three Days and Three Nights:        Now we come upon a prophecy supposedly uttered by the very mouth of the god Jesus himself.  He speaks of his crucifixion and resurrection.         [Mt 12.40]   For as Jonah was in the belly of the        whale for three days and three nights, so will the Son        of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and        three nights.  Before any further discussion can occur, it is necessary to know how the Jews understood days.  As far as day names went, each was 24 hours long, lasting from sunset 6pm to the following sunset 6pm.  What was referred to as a \\\"day\\\" was the period of light from 6am to the ending sunset at 6pm.  Thus, according to our time scale, a sabbath day began at 6pm Friday evening, and lasted until 6pm saturday evening.  This is why the Jews celebrate their sabbath on the daylight portion of Saturdays, instead of Sundays.  (It seems like a real miracle that Christians didn't forget that Saturday was indeed the seventh and last day of the week!)  Thus, when days and nights are referred to together, 12 hour daylight portions and 12 hour night periods are being spoken of.  Thus, Jesus says that he will be in the grave, or in hell, or otherwise unresurrected for three days and three nights.        As the good book tells us, Jesus was crucified on the \\\"ninth hour,\\\" which is 3pm, Friday afternoon.  He then was put into the grave sometime after that.  Then, Jesus left the grave, \\\"rose,\\\" before dawn of what we call Sunday (The dawn after the sabbath was over).  What this means is that Jesus was, using our time for clarity, in the grave from 6pm Friday night to some time before 6am Sunday morning.  We could also add a little time before 6pm Friday, since the bible is not specific here.  What this means using Jewish time is that he was in the grave for one day, two nights, and possibly a couple of hours of one day.  Certainly this is a problem for Jesus prediction.  There is absolutely no way we are even able to have his death involve three days and three nights --even using modern time measurements.   We then are led to suspect that this error is another one of Matthew's little mistakes, and that the gospel writer put false words into his god's mouth.   And no matter who made the prediction, it is more than unconvincing... it is counter-convincing.  Hearing & Understanding:       Jesus tool on a habit of speaking to his vast audiences in parables-- stories in which a deeper meaning could be found, if you were already one of the elect, those chosen to understand the message of Jesus.  He reasons that those who can understand the parables are the ones he wants.  If the people cannot understand them, there is no need to bother with them, since they will not accept the \\\"plain\\\" message any better.  Matthew says,         [Mt 13.14-16]  With them [the audience] indeed in        fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says,          \\\"You will indeed hear but never understand; and you        will indeed see, but never perceive.  Because this        people's heart has grown dull, their ears are heavy of        hearing, and they have shut their eyes so the they        would not perceive with them, her with their ears, and        understand with their heart, and turn for me to heal        them.\\\"  The original Isaiah passages are part of his earlier works, his call to the ministry.  This is in 740 BCE, when Israel is flourishing, right before it falls under the authority of Assyria.  Isaiah sees the good times ending, and also a vision from G'd, calling him to bring reform to Israel and Judah.         [Is 6.9-13]  And G'd said, \\\"Go, and say to this        people, `Hear and hear, but do not understand; see and        see, but do not perceive.'   Make the heart of this        people fat, make their ears heavy, and shut their        eyes, so they will not see with their eyes, or hear        with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and        turn and be healed.\\\"  Then Isaiah said, \\\"How long,        lord?\\\"  And he said, \\\"Until the cities lie waste        without inhabitant, and houses without men, and the        land is utterly desolate, and the G'ds take men far        away, and forsaken places are many in the land.  And        though a tenth will remain in it, it will be burned        again, like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still        stands when the tree is felled.\\\" The holy seed is its        stump.  Here we see that it is really G'd who causes the people of Israel to stop listening to the prophet's warnings, but reaffirms the promise made to Solomon's (and David's) seed/lineage.  If you read the rest of Isaiah, you find that this is done to fulfil the plan of G'd to use Israel as a servant, a light to the nations.  (Look at Isaiah 42.18-25, 48.20, 49.3)      We see that Matthew has cut-and-pasted just a little portion of Isaiah's verse, to suit his own gospel needs.  More than that, he has altered the words, to make it fit the people who didn't understand Jesus's stories.  And, as we see, Isaiah's verses are not prophecies, but rather commands from G'd to him, in the present.   Once again, Matthew's prophecy falls flat on its face.        Matthew tries again to make Jesus's parables look like they have the prophetic approval.         [Mt 13.35]  ...he said nothing to them without a        parable.  This was to fulfil what was spoken of by the        prophet, \\\"I will open my mouth to them in parables.  I        will utter that which has been hidden since the        foundation of the world.\\\"  Matthew really botches up here.  He attempts to quote not from a prophet, but from the Psalms.         [Ps 78.2-4]  I will open my mouth in parable.  I will        utter dark sayings of old, things that we all have        heard and known, things that our fathers have told us.         We will not hide them from their children, but tell to        the coming generation the glorious deeds of the        lord...  As was pointed out, the verses in the Psalms do not really come from a prophet.  You might also want to know that earlier copies of Matthew's gospel even inserted Isaiah's name as this prophet.  Apparently, later scribes caught the error and tried to cover some of it up.      Perhaps the most significant part of this is that, once again, Matthew has altered the Old Testament Scriptures.  As Jesus has said earlier, he speaks in parables so that some will not understand them.  The parables in the Psalms are not to be hidden.  Further, they speak of things \\\"known, that our fathers have told us.\\\"  Jesus deals with things \\\"hidden since the foundation of the world.\\\"  Indeed Jesus dealt in a lot of secrecy and confusion.  This is in direct opposition to the parables in the Psalms.  No wonder Matthew had to rewrite them!   And still once again, Matthew's artificial prophecies fall flat on their face.  But, Christians rarely look at this.  Matthew's prophecies aren't the only things about Christianity that are beginning to look bad.   Excuses of Little Faith:         In Mt. 17.14-21, we see that the disciples are able to go around casting out demons, except in one case.  Not knowing what epilepsy was, the people thought those with the disease were possesed with demons.  It is no wonder that the disciples were unable to \\\"dispossess\\\" the epileptic.  But, Jesus, perhaps no more enlightened than they, is reported to have rebuked them, saying they didn't have enough faith.   This seems strange.  Why was this demon special?  It seems that either a true believer has faith or he does not.  Apparently, enough faith will allow someone to move mountains.  Of course, you will find no one, these days that can move real mountains.  No one parts seas.  The only miracles the Charismatics can speak of are those rumoured to happen on trips to Mexico or some faraway place.  Major miracles are making some old woman's arthritis feel better on Sunday morning T.V.         And the gods, including Jesus, are always shrouded in ancient lore and writings, protected from the skeptics in their sacred pasts.  They are either dead, sleeping, or hiding in heaven, with people rumouring about their imminent return and their great miracles of days long gone.  Yet, life goes on.         Tales of mystics, stories of miracles-- all in a distant time or a distant place.  Gods used to reveal themselves to men in the old days, Jehovah too.  But, now they are silent.  All the theologians give are various excuses as to why we don't get to see God anymore.         We're too lazy; we're not zealous enough; we're        sinful; it's just his \\\"plan\\\"; we put too many of our        own demands on G'd's appearance; if we had the right        faith, if we  were willing to meet G'd on his terms...       Yet, even the most pious of men have not seen G'd.  You, dear reader, have not seen G'd.  Not literally, you know that to be true. (I know that's presumptuous and bold.  But, searching your heart, you know what I mean.)  All that we've seen religions do is make people feel good and content about not seeing G'd.  They say our little faith does not merit us to see G'd.  Sometimes, they say, \\\"See the love in these people you worship with... see the lives of people change... that is seeing G'd.\\\"   Thus people get lulled to sleep, satisfied with turning G'd into the everyday sights.   But, that is not seeing G'd as I am speaking of... it is not seeing G'd the way people used to see.         What we see in the world that is good, is the compassion of human hearts, the love given and taken by men and women, the forgiveness practised by Christian & Atheist alike, beauty created by the mind of man.  These are the things that are done; these are what we see.  But, it is said this is so only because everybody has little faith.   Jesus Rides on an Ass:         Shortly after accepting the role of the Jewish messiah king, Jesus requests a donkey be brought in for him to ride into Jerusalem.           [Mt 21.5]  This took place to fulfil what was spoken        by the prophet, saying,         Tell the daughter of Zion, \\\"Behold, your king is        coming to you, humble, mounted on an ass, and on a        ass-colt.\\\"  Of course, the passage quoted from Zechariah 9.9 reads a little differently.         Lo, your king comes to you; he is triumphant and        victorious, humble, and riding on an ass, on an ass-        colt... he will command peace to the nations.  There isn't all that much difference here, except that Zechariah only involves one animal  --an ass-colt--  while Matthew reads the poetic wording slightly differently.  Thus, he has Jesus call for both a colt and an adult ass.  From Matthew's version, we get a comical picture of the divine Christ sweating it to straddle two donkeys.  This could inevitably lead to a theological, proctological dilemma!   We find that in the account written earlier by St. Mark, only the colt was called for and brought to Jesus.  This indeed fits the verses of Zechariah properly, and shows us that in Matthew attempt to use prophetic verses, he has bungled.  Now, excluding many respectable Christians I have met, I have noticed that while Christ is thought to have ridden on asses, the situation is often reversed nowadays...         Then, entering the Jerusalem temple, the priests were angered at people and youngsters calling Jesus the messiah.  But, Jesus replied as we might expect Matthew to have done,         [Mt 21.16]  Haven't you read?  `Out of the mouth of        babes and sucklings thou has brought perfect praise.'  It is more likely that Matthew made this response up since Jesus was never one to point out such little \\\"prophetic\\\" things AND since, as we might expect, the quote is in error, which seems to fit Matthew's track record quite well.  We might ask Jesus or Matthew, \\\"Haven't you read?\\\" for the source reads,         [Psalms 8.1-2]  O YaHWeH our lord, how majestic is        your name in the whole world!   You, whose glory is        chanted above the heavens by babes and infants, you        have founded a bulwark against your foes to still the        enemy and the avenger.  The passages hardly need comment.  There is no \\\"perfect praise\\\" spoken of in the psalm, and what praise is there is given to G'd, not his messiah king, and not Jesus.  As mentioned, it seems to be just one more case of Matthew's pen making up convenient prophetic scripture.  YHVH said to  my lord...:        Jesus is said to have asked from whom the promised Jewish messiah-king is to be descended.  The Jews agree-- it is king David.  But, then Jesus counters by quoting Psalms 110,         \\\"The LORD said to my Lord, sit at my right hand, until        I put your enemies under your feet.\\\"  Taken at face value, Jesus is denying the necessity of Davidic descent.  One assumes he is in opposition to their answer.  Of course, the Christian answer is that he agrees, but is trying to make some hidden point, to reveal some mystery about the divine nature of the messiah-king.  It's tempting to believe this, if one is a Christian and not interested in matters of investigation.  But, there are problems.        In Jesus's time, the psalm was thought to be about the messiah.  And, it is easy to see why David might refer to the messiah as his superior.  We need only look at the scriptures about the messiah to see that he is expected to be a great king, bringing the Jews to times even better than those under David's rule.  Of course, the Jews listening had no good answer, and the passage could indeed refer to a divine messiah, such as the Christians worship.  The problem lies in the meaning of this psalm, an error that apparently several Jews of Jesus's time had also made.  One must remember that there were various factions among the Jews, often as a result of different expectations of the messiah-king.  Jesus was apparently one of these adventists, like his audience, who thought the messiah's advent was imminent, and who interpreted Psalms 110, among others, as being messianic. What is the problem, then?  Psalm 110 literally reads,         YHVH's utterance to my lord:  \\\"Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your        footstool.\\\"         YHVH sends forth your mighty scepter from Zion.  Rule        in the midst of your foes!  Your people will offer        themselves freely on the day you lead your host on the        holy mountains.           \\\"You are a priest of the order of Melchizedek        forever.\\\"  The word \\\"lord\\\" is often mistakenly capitalised by Christian bibles to denote divinity in this lord.  But, in the Hebrew, the word is \\\"adoni,\\\" and no capitalisation exists.  Adoni simply means \\\"lord,\\\" a generic term as we would use it.  It is used often in the scriptures to refer to kings and to G'd.  It is merely an address of respect.         There is nothing in the text itself to imply that the word refers either to divinity or to the messiah-king.  That this is supposed to be written by David is not certain.  The title of the psalm translates to either \\\"a psalm of David,\\\" or \\\"a psalm about David.\\\"  It seems fitting to assume it to be written by a court poet, about David's covenant and endorsement from G'd.  If the psalm had been written by David, it is unlikely that he would be talking about the messiah.  The idea of a perfect king, descended from David, was not present in David's age.  We have extensive tales of David's doings and sayings-- none of which include any praises of a messiah.      Many of the psalms show evidence of being written long after David was dead, in times of the exile when G'd had put his show of favour for David's kingdom on hold.        The description in the psalm fit David very well.  David was promised by G'd a rise to power, victory over his enemies, successful judgement among the nations he conquered.  He achieved the priesthood common to Melchizedek in being a righteous king, enabled to bless the people.   It all fits.       We do not have to blame this problem on Matthew alone, though.  Here, there is not artificial prophecy alluded to, though his use of the scripture is rather questionable.  Still, this event is common to the other gospels too.  So, we let Matthew off a little more easily this time.  It is interesting to note, though, how Matthew dresses up the event.  The earlier gospel of Mark tells the tale with Jesus simply speaking to a crowd.  Matthew has the Pharisees, who became the religious competition of an infant Christianity, be the target of Jesus's question.  As we might expect, Matthew writes that the event ends up by embarrassing the Pharisees.  Such power is the pen.  Moses & Jesus, Had it Together All Along...:         We leave the gospel story of Matthew momentarily to see a pseudo-prophecy in John's gospel.  The gospel story of John deserves special treatment, because it seems to be so far removed from the real events of Jesus's career as told by even Matthew.  But, for the moment, we will just look at one verse.  The early church leaders founded a religion on the Jewish hopes of a messiah king, and on an artificial extension of the original promises made by G'd.  When constructing the history of Abraham, Moses wrote of a promise of land and nationhood to the Jewish people.  While this was accomplished eventually, under the rule of king David, the Christians who came along later decided that they would claim the fulfillment of the promise.  But, to do so, they expanded on the promise, preaching about a heavenly kingdom.         [John 8.56] (J.C. speaking) Your father, Abraham,        rejoiced to see My day.  He say it and was glad.  It would be nice to tie in approval for Jesus from Abraham, but, Abraham knew nothing of Jesus or a messiah, or anything Christian.  I have tried, and failed to find any event in the Old Testament which corresponds to John's little prophecy.  It is par for the course to see St. John making up Old Testament backings, just like his forerunner Matthew.  Many Christians know that their faith has many of its foundations in such fraud, and it is surprising they still cling to it.  The Potter's Field:        We are told that Jesus was betrayed while in Jerusalem by one of his followers, Judas Iscariot.   Matthew writes,         [Mt 27.5-10]  And throwing down the pieces of silver        in the temple, [Judas] departed... But, the chief        priests, taking the silver, said, \\\"It isn't lawful for        us to put it in the treasury, since it is blood        money.\\\"  So they... bought a potter's field with it to        bury strangers in... Then was fulfilled what was        spoken by the prophet Jeremiah,         \\\"And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price        of him on whom a price had been set by some of the        sons of Israel, and they gave them for the potter's        field, as the lord directed me.\\\"  This prophecy is an utterly gross bastardisation of Old Testament Scripture.  First, Matthew has made a mistake regarding the name of the prophet.  It is Zechariah who utters the verses which Matthew makes use of.         [Zech. 11.12-13]  ...And they weighed out my wages,        thirty shekels of silver.  Then YHVH said to me, \\\"Cast        them to the treasury,\\\" --the lordly price at which I        was paid off by them.  So I took the thirty shekels of        silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of        YHVH.  First of all, the verses of Zechariah do not deal with a betrayer of the messiah, or of G'd.  The deal with a shepherd, most likely a priest, chosen to serve a function of presiding over the people shortly before G'd would send Judah and Israel into conflict with one another.  The word, \\\"treasury,\\\" had been replaced by the King James Scholars with \\\"to the potter,\\\" precisely because this made Matthew's quote fit better.  But, this is a blatant error.  The correct translation of the Hebrew is indeed \\\"treasury,\\\" which also makes perfect sense in Zechariah's context, whereas \\\"potter's field\\\" is totally unrelated.  Whether the mistranslation was intentional or not seems to be beyond speculation.  However, given Matthew's track record, one finds it hard to resist the notion of intentional dishonesty.       Of course, Matthew would have ample reason for altering the text.  The thirty pieces of silver match Judas's situation, and if as most Christians seem to be, the reader is willing to disregard the contextual incongruity, Matthew might have another prophecy to toss around.  However, the correct translation of Zechariah directly contradicts the situation with Judas and the high priests.  The high priests would not put the money in the treasury.  The worthless shepherd of Zechariah does exactly the opposite!  Of course, to the average Thursday-Night Bible student, the \\\"prophecy\\\" as presented by Matthew would be taken at New Testament face value.  To those, Matthew's work is convincing enough.  Wine, Vinegar, & Casting Lots:        Then, Jesus is led away to be crucified.         [Mt 27.34-35]  ...they gave him vinegar to drink,        mingled with gall; but when he tasted it, he would not        drink it.  And, when they had crucified him, they        divided his garments among them by casting lots: that        it might be fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet,         \\\"They parted my garments among them, and upon my        vesture did they cast lots.\\\"  First of all, the vinegar offered to Jesus is actually common sour wine, of the type that Roman soldiers drank regularly.  We find that right before Jesus dies, the soldiers themselves give him some to drink --not polluted with gall.         [Jn 19.28-30]  Jesus... said, \\\"I thirst.\\\"  A bowl of        vinegar stood there, so they put a sponge full of the        vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth.  When he        had received the vinegar, he said, \\\"It is finished;\\\"  But, Matthew seems to be drawing on, not a passage from the prophets, but one from the Psalms.         [Ps 69.20-28]  I looked for pity, but there was none;        and for comforters, but I found none.  They gave me        poison for food (lit. they put gall in my meat), and        for my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink...  Add        to them punishment upon punishment, may they have no        acquittal from thee.  Let them be blotted out of the        Book of the Living.  Of course, the sour wine offered to Jesus is done at his request of drink.  This does indeed seem to be a show of pity.  The psalm quoted is about David and his political and military enemies.  It is not about the messiah or Jesus.  It is then not surprising that we run into further problem when we see that the \\\"Jesus\\\" in the psalm asks G'd for the damnation of the \\\"crucifiers,\\\" whereas the Jesus of the gospels says,         [Lk 23.34]  Jesus said, \\\"Father, forgive them, the        don't know what they do!\\\"  Further, Matthew misses with his attempt to create prophecy by having gall (a bitter substance) put into Jesus's drink, not his meat, as the psalm stipulates.         With the \\\"prophecy\\\" of the vinegar faulty, we naturally ask, \\\"What of the casting of lots?\\\"  This brings up the 22nd Psalm, which deserves discussion all by itself.  Suffice it now to say that the fact that Jesus's clothes were divided as told is no great thing.  It turns out that this happened often to any felon in those days.  As we will soon see, it is perhaps the least erroneous passage of the psalm when applied to Jesus.  It does indeed bring up the interesting question as to the quality of Jesus's clothes.  For a man so removed from worldly possessions, his ownership of clothes worthy of casting lots raises some suspicions.  The 22nd Psalm:        This psalm is attributed to David, as a lament of his condition under the attack of his enemies.  It becomes a song of praise to YHVH and of hope.  Taken out of context, parts of it seem to fit the plight of Jesus at the crucifixion quite well.  We will examine the primary passages.         Verse 1-2:  My god, my god! why have you forsaken me?!         Why are you so far from helping me, far from the words        of my groaning?  Oh, my god, I cry by day, but you        don't answer, and by night, but find no rest.  Jesus is said to have cried the first sentence while on the cross.  This suggests that the whole psalm is really about Jesus, rather than king David.  Of course, the rest of the first stanza does not fit as nicely to Jesus or his execution.  Jesus is not pictured as complaining about the whole ordeal, he is supposed to be like \\\"the lamb led mute before its shearers.\\\"  Indeed, Jesus doesn't do much groaning, even when on the cross.  He certainly does not cry by both day and night on the cross.         6-8:  But, I am a worm, and no man-- scorned by men...         All who see me mock at me.  They make faces and wag        their heads;  \\\"He committed his cause to YHVH.  So let        him deliver him... for he delights in him.\\\"  This seems to fit Jesus's execution pretty well, with the exception of the Holy messiah being called a worm.         12-13:  Many bulls encompass me... they open their        mouths widely at me like a ravening and roaring lion.         16-18:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of        evildoers encir-cle me, they have pierced my hands and        feet.  I can see all my bones... They divide my        garments among them, and cast lost for my raiment.         19-21:  But you, YHVH, be not far away!  ...Deliver my        soul from the sword, my life from the power of the        dog!  Save me from the mouth of the lion, and my        afflicted soul from the horns of the wild bull!  It would seem quite convincing, and I'm sure the early Christian fathers who wrote of this prophecy thought so too.  Unfortunately, this prophecy has a fatal flaw.  The words \\\"have pierced\\\" really do not exist in the psalm.  The correct Hebrew translation is,         16:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of        evildoers encircles me, like the lion, they are at my        hands and feet...  In Hebrew the phrase \\\"like the lion\\\" and a very rare verb form which can mean \\\"pierced\\\" differ by one phonetic character.  The word in the Hebrew text is literally, \\\"like the lion\\\" (ka'ari), which makes sense in the context, and even further fits the animal imagery employed by the psalm writer.  It is convenience that would urge a Christian to change the word to \\\"ka'aru.\\\"   But, to add the needed (yet artificial) weight to the \\\"prophecy\\\" this is just what the Christian translators have chosen to do.  While the correct translation does not eliminate the psalm from referring to Jesus, its absence does not say much for the honesty of the translators.         Apart from the erroneous verse 16, the psalm does not lend itself to Jesus so easily.  Verse 20 speaks of the sufferer being saved from a sword rather than a cross.  This naturally fits the psalm's true subject, king David.  As a side note, we now know that crucifixions did not pierce the hands, the palms, but rather the forearms.  This doesn't say much in favour of the traditional thought of a resurrected Jesus showing his disciples the scars on his palms.  But then, facts aren't bound by our religious beliefs.        Matthew escapes culpability this time, as he does not attempt to draw many direct links between this psalm and his lord Jesus.  But the psalm, like many others, was on the minds of all the gospel writers when they compiled the stories and interpretations of Jesus's life and death.  How much these scriptures may have contributed to what actually got written down is a question that has serious repercussions for Christian theology.  It is easy to see, for those who are not faithful fundamentalists, how some of the events in the New Testament might have been \\\"enhanced\\\" by scribes such as the eager Matthew.  But, it does less to speculate than to simply investigate scriptural matters and prophetic claims.  So far, this has not said good things for St. Matthew.  The reference to the piercing looks a lot like Jesus's crucifixion.  John's gospel recount, written about 70 years after the fact, tells us at Jesus's execution,         [Jn 19.34,37]  But one of the soldiers pierced his        side with a spear, and out came blood and water...        these things took place that Scripture be fulfilled...        \\\"The will look on him whom they've pierced.\\\"  Of course, this is built on a passage taken blatantly out of context.   Prophet Zechariah tells us how much of the nation of Israel will split off from Jerusalem and Judah and go to war with them.         [Zc 12.7-10]  And YHVH will give victory to Judah...        And on that day, I will seek to destroy the nations        that come against Jerusalem (in Judah).  And I will        pour a spirit of compassion and supplication... on        Jerusalem so that when they look on him who they have        pierced, they will mourn, and weep bitterly over him        like you weep over a firstborn child.  John's attempt to make up prophecy is perhaps weaker that Matthew's attempts.  Matthew, at least, usually excontexts more than just one passage.  John's errors are grossly obvious and blatant here.  It does not speak well for any of the gospel writers, as it helps to show how the prophetic aspects of their religion were founded.    Reckoned with Transgressors:         After his arrest, Jesus is quickly executed for claiming the Jewish kingship, messiahship.   According to one version of the gospel tale, Jesus gets executed along with two thieves.         [Mk 15.27]  And with him they crucified two robbers,        one on his right, one on his left.  And so the        scripture was fulfilled which says,         \\\"He was reckoned with the transgressors.\\\"  Here, Mark is trying to link Jesus to a passage in Isaiah 53, about the servant nation of Israel.  The passage is not about the messiah, for if one reads the whole chapter of Isaiah 53, and its surrounding chapters, one sees that the servant is a nation.  The verses are also about what this servant has gone through in the past, not a prediction of what is to come, in any event.  The servant is thought of as a criminal.  This also happens to fit the description of Jesus.  Had the passage really been about the messiah, it still is not at all clear why executing Jesus between two thieves would fulfill the \\\"prophecy\\\" in Isaiah.  Jesus would more fittingly fulfill it with his whole ministry.  He was considered a blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout his career.   Locking onto a single event is a rather poor way to steal prophecy, at least in this case, as we see that Mark could have had made a better analogy with general comparisons.         Mark goes on to tell us how \\\"those who were crucified with [Jesus] also reviled him.\\\" [15.32]  This is to be expected from a couple of robbers.  Of course in his later recount, St. Luke decides to change some things.  Luke tells us,         [Lk 23.39-43]  And one of the criminals who was hanged        with him railed, \\\"Aren't you the messiah?! Save        yourself, and us!\\\"  This certainly fits with Mark's recount, which tells how the people who crucified Jesus said, \\\"Save yourself!\\\" and that the robbers did the same.  But then Luke goes on,         But the other [criminal] rebuked [the first] saying,        \\\"Don't you fear G'd, since you are under the same        sentence of condemnation?  And we, indeed justly so,        for we are receiving the due reward for our deeds.         But, this man has done nothing wrong. And he said,        \\\"Jesus, remember me when you come in your kingdom.\\\"         And Jesus answered, \\\"Verily I say to you, today you        will be with me in paradise.\\\"  Now, this little dialogue seems highly contrived.  It stretches the imagination a bit to see this picture of one ruffian rebuking his fellow criminal with such eloquent speech.  We have a rather strange picture of a criminal lamenting over the goodness of his punishment and the justness of his suffering.   Such a man, apparently noble and of principle, doesn't seem likely to have been a robber.  We wonder at the amount of theatrics created by Luke.  Of course, Luke's recount also disagrees with Mark's.   Luke has only one criminal revile Jesus, not both.  It is easy enough to discount the discrepancy because the account was made up, but those who wish to believe it is all part of the error free words of G'd do not have this avenue open.  This is yet another example of a writer trying to take an Old Testament passage and expand it and reinterpret it to suit his theology.  In this case, the embroidery creates some embarrassing problems, as we have seen.  The End of the World--        Mt. 24:         Now comes perhaps one of the most extraordinary and embarrassing passages in the New Testament.  It is found in all three of the synoptic gospel stories, and casts some of the most unfavourable doubt on the whole theory of Christianity.  Jesus mentions the destruction of the Jewish temples and buildings, and his disciples ask him about this, and about the end of the world which he has been warning about.         The disciples: Tell us, when will this [the temple's        destruction] be, and what will be the sign of your        coming, and of the close of the age?         Jesus: Take care that no one leads you astray, for        many will come in my name, saying, \\\"I am the christ.\\\"          ...you will hear of wars and rumours of wars... for        this must take place, but the end is not yet.   For,        nation will rise against nation... all this is but the        beginning of the birthpangs.              They will deliver you up... put you to death,        and false prophets will arise and lead many astray.        ...But he who endures to the end will be saved.  This        gospel will be preached throughout the whole world, a        testimony to the nations, and then the end will come.              So, when you see the desolation spoken of by the        prophet Daniel, ...let those who are in Judea flee to        the mountains.               Immediately after the tribulation of those days,        the sun will be darkened... the stars will fall from        heaven... then will appear the sign of the Son of Man        in heaven, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn,        and see the Son of Man coming... and he will send out        his angels... and gather his elect...              Learn the lesson of the fig tree: as soon as its        branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves, you know        that summer is near.  So also, when you see all these        things, you will know that He is near, at the very        gate.  Truly I say to you, this generation will not        pass away until all these things take place...              But, of the day and hour, no one knows; not the        angels, not the Son, but only the Father... Therefore,        you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming        at an hour you do not expect.  From this, it is clear that Jesus thought the world would in within the lifetimes of at least some of his disciples.  He tells them that although he doesn't know the exact day or hour, that it will come, and thus they must be ready.  Theologians have wet their pants in panic to find some way out of this Holy Error.  But, unfortunately, Jesus made himself to explicit.  He told his disciples that their generation would still be around at the End, and that they in particular should prepare for it, prepare to be swept away.       There have been some who resorted to removing the inerrant nature of the Bible, and said that the phrase, \\\"this generation shall not pass away...\\\" really means \\\"this race of people will not pass away...\\\"  Of course, the word for generation is used many times to refer to exactly that, the generation of the disciples.  It is an interesting notion that when God decided to learn Greek, he didn't learn it well enough to make himself clear.  But. it is quite obvious from the rest of the dialogue that the disciples (at least some of them) are supposed to live to the End of the World.  The charge of mistranslation is completely blown away by looking at the Apostles' responses.  It becomes abundantly clear from Rev. 22.7, 1 Peter 4.7, 1 John 2.18, and Rev. 22.20, that Jesus meant exactly what he said.  The End was very near.         For 2,000 years, Christians have rationalised this 24th chapter of Matthew, or ignored its meaning altogether.  For 2,000 years, they have waited for their executed leader to come back, hearing of wars, and rumours of wars, sure that He is coming soon.  Surely He must be.  All we must do is wait.  Can you imagine how tired He must be, sitting around up there, being holy, waiting for just the right moment to spring?          So, shortly after his crucifixion, Jesus of Nazareth, (Joshua-ben-Joseph), died.   It is said that after three days, or three days and three nights, or three periods of time, or three eternal seconds --or three of whatever they can decide makes for less trouble-- he was seen again, resurrected, glowing with divine radiance.  Then the Saviour decided it wasn't in the best interests of his new religion to stick around, and therefore disappeared from sight into heaven.  So the story goes, anyway.  As has been seen, there were many things attributed to Jesus when people got around to writing the gospel stories down.  To them, Jesus was the fulfiller of all prophecy and scripture.  We have seen, though, that this matter is quite shaky.  But, throughout Church history, Christians have held fast to faith, in simple belief.  What doctrinal objections could not be solved with argumentation or brute force, faith and forgetfulness kept away from question.  To question and investigate has never been the easiest way to treat matters.  Thus for 2,000 years, the prophecies cited in the New Testament have gone on largely accepted.  Things may well continue that way for some time.  Pausing a moment to consider the way the doctrines of Christianity have been accepted and used (properly or improperly) to support wars and persecution, I suppose there is one prophecy of which Christianity can securely keep hold.\",\"Does anyone out there have or know of,  line drawing USA map?

I have several friends at the Moscow Aviation Institute who have asked me to post this announcement.  (I have done some editing, but the contents is unchanged from the original announcement.)   For those of you not familiar with the Moscow Aviation Institute, it is the leading Russian school of higher education dedicated to the training of aircraft and spacecraft designers.  It specializes in airframe design, powerplant design, control systems, and power systems. Virtually all of the major former Soviet airframe designers (Tupolev, Su, Iluchine, Migoyan, etc.) were schooled at MAI.  I had the opportunity to tour the two museums that are maintained at MAI.  The aircraft include Mig23, Su 27, Yak 38, the cockpit of an F-111(!), among others.  It was a fascinating and eye opening experience, expecially given the fact that the museum was, until a year or so ago, closed to virtually everyone.  I also had the opportunity to see some of the experiments being conducted with plasma drive engines for future space craft use.  If you have any questions about the Institute, or the program, I would be glad to try and answer them.  The institute, and most of it's faculty have e-mail addresses.  However, it takes about a day or so for the receiver to get the message.  They are still a bit antiquated - but they are rapidly changing!

Almost a half million new users joined the Internet last year,     many of them are commercial businesses. The ban on commercial     use of Internet is no more.  Jack, there is a difference between using the network for commercial purposes and advertising in newsgroups.  Business communication is okay.  Advertising to hundreds of thousands of users around the planet who have no desire to receive advertising is not okay.      Those of us who pay for Internet access are constrained only     by our innate good taste and no have no \\\"administrator\\\" to      guide(?) us.  I suspect that a site which generated a large volume of material not in anybody's good taste would find itself getting a lot of attention it didn't want.  You may belong to the public library, but that doesn't mean you can deface the books, disorder the stacks, or disturb the other patrons.  You're constrained by the same rules that the rest of the users (many academic and military, who get irritable about a network for which they pay with tax and grant money carrying private business advertising) follow.  There are Secret Masters here, just like everywhere else.  They're not as obvious as the ones on Prodigy, but they're here.  No doubt at some point the Internet, like everything else, will become grotty enough to carry advertising.  At that time I hope it is confined to its own newsgroups and not on discussion groups---like misc.writing. \",\"In responding to the post below I have considered issues far outside the scope of revisionism and principally have considered the political implications of a racist ideology and its inevitable outcome. Thus it is tangentially relevant to soc.history and alt.revisionism but I have directed followups to t.p.m since it is principally consideration of the political lessons to be drawn from the history of the NAZI party that I deal with.     Let us assume for the sake of argument that this was indeed the case? Does this mean that Hilter would have been in any way less guilty of mass murder because he aquiesced rather than participated as an active and ardent supporter?  One of the important things to realise about the NAZIs is that the system was far more evil than any single member. Once created the NAZI party itself was a murder machine that would inevitably commit genocide, there was noone within it strong enough to prevent it. Remember that Hitler did not originaly lead the NAZI party nor was he particularly powerful within it until his oratory allowed the party to come to power. Had Hitler reneged upon the emotiaonal expectations which he had created within the ranks of  his supporters he would have been replaced as he had himself replaced the old guard who he beleived were unable to grasp the intellectual implications of their rhetoric.   This is why all parties that espouse NAZI style race supremacy ideologies must be considered as dangerous and as evil as the NAZIs. The idea that one \\\"race\\\" of people is inherently superior to another and that the greatest goal of humanity is to achieve racial perfection has only one logical outcome, the gas chambers of Auschwitz.  The NAZI party is not simply the tale of a supremely evil single man who lead an entire country astray, beyond the evil of individuals there was the evil of the system itself which was self generating and self perpetuating. Hitler was an extreemly evil person who built his party arround an ego cult centered on the demonstration of his own power, this does not however mean that he was as entirely free from political constraints as he and his propagandists worked so hard to assert. The myth that racism can produce a strong government that can cure a nations ills must be  emphatically rejected. In the same way we must accept a distinction between a govenrment that demonstrates its strength and one that is able to  govern decisively in the manner it beleives is best. I would accept only the latter as a \\\"strong\\\" government since most displays of strength are made necessary by an essential weakness.  It is important to understand that the NAZIs were not stupid nor were they amoral in the sense that they lacked moral scruples. They acted in the same manner as the Spanish Inquisition - murder and torture in the cause of morality. The fault of the NAZIs lies in their axioms, not in their logic nor in their implementation of those axioms. Thus all such parties such as the National Front or David Dukes Klu Klux Klan front who assert the truth of those axioms must be considered for what they are, advocates of a system that would commit genocide.   The conclusion that Hitler was not only responsible but imensely evil is inescapable from the historical record. It is important though to not let the conclusion be reached that the NAZIs espoused a set of ideas that were basically correct but had an unfortunate proponent. The evils of the concept of race supremacy are primary. Although this most emphaticaly does not excuse individual culpability this is nevertheless secondary.  No matter what the promises made by a racist, supremacist party upon  election those promises will be broken as soon as circumstances permit. If this requires the replacement of the leaders that originally made the pledges, that will occur. Hatred is a supreme justifier. It also creates a dynamic of its own when those in government allow it reign. For many in government politics is a method of providing a justification for their own existence through a demonstration of their importance. A  rhetoric of hatred inevitably develops the question of action since the continued existence of an object of hatred is inevitably a reminder of the essential impotence of the politician. Thus we have the US raid on Tripoli which has little purpose beyond a demonstration of power. It is important to realise that there is no quantum jump between the politics of the right and those of the extreeme right but a progression from the reinforcement of popular predjudice to action being taken on the basis of that predjudice. In the same way the extreeme left trace their route to despotism through their assertion of the subjugation of the individual to ideology.  It is important though that in attempting to understand the dynamics of political systems that this is not used to excuse the participants. The leaders of a nation take on a supreme moral burden but not only do so voluntarily are required to stive to do so. Thus to take on such a  task without a fundamental examination of the logical progression of ones set of axioms to its conclusion in itself is a moral crime. Furthermore in taking on such a duty one is obliged to put the interest of the whole before personal concerns, even of personal security.  Although it was inevitable that a party such as the NAZIs, based upon hatred and an idolisation of the symbols of power should have saught to commit genocide it was not inevitable that they should succeeded. Each member of the system had an ability to create a change within it that had a possibility of changing the dynamic. Realising that the individual cannot hope to  control a system does not mean accepting that the individual cannot  affect the system. \",\"I have several people sharing my machine and would like to set up separate environments under Windows for each of them.

Proposed Charters:   (a)  create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting (unmoderated)    It will provide a forum for developers of ported software so   as to coordinate efforts, avoid duplication of effort, and   spur additional development.  The group will also cover   topics such as porting from other platforms (such as DOS,   Windows, UNIX, etc), toolkits which aid in program   portability (including porting tools such as Mirrors), and   so forth.   (b)  rename: comp.os.os2.programmer.misc (unmoderated)    To keep the structure of the OS/2 newsgroup heirarchy   orthogonal, comp.os.os2.programmer should be renamed to   comp.os.os2.programmer.misc.    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc will still be the newsgroup   for OS/2 programmers to discuss programming issues and   technical aspects of OS/2 in an unmoderated setting.   (c)  create comp.os.os2.setup (unmoderated)    It will be devoted to OS/2 system setup topics, including the   availability of device drivers, compatibility information,   installation procedures, system requirements, and overall   performance optimization.   (d)  create comp.os.os2.multimedia (unmoderated)    It will provide a forum for discussion of multi-media issues.   (e)  create comp.os.os2.bugs (unmoderated)    It will provide a forum for OS/2 system bug reports, bug   diagnosis and work arounds, the availability of system   patches and corrective service disks, and so forth.    [Note that discussion of bugs in applications belong in other   newsgroups, and discussion of bugs in OS/2 betas belong in   comp.os.os2.beta]   How to Vote:   To cast your vote, fill out the ballot below and e-mail it to me.  Many newsreaders will allow e-mail to be sent by replying to this  post.  Be sure to send only the ballot, and edit out the rest of  this post.   1)  Type in your vote for each proposal:       If you favor the charter as proposed, put a \\\"yes\\\" after its name.      If you oppose the charter as proposed, put a \\\"no\\\" after its name.      To abstain, leave a blank after its name.   2)  Type in your last name (i.e. your family name), a comma, and      your first name (i.e. your personal name).   3)  Cut out the ballot,  Please do not delete any lines of the      ballot.   4)  E-mail your ballot to mlevis@lonestar.utsa.edu before 11:59:59 pm      (Central Time), April 24, 1993.   Ballot:  ----------------cut here----------------cut here----------------cut here----          (a) comp.os.os2.programmer.porting:         (b)    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc:         (c)              comp.os.os2.setup:         (d)         comp.os.os2.multimedia:         (e)               comp.os.os2.bugs:          (f)       voter's last, first name:          e-mail ballot to mlevis@lonestar.utsa.edu by April 24  ----cut here----------------cut here----------------cut here----------------   Example Ballot #1:   (a) comp.os.os2.programmer.porting: yes  (b)    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc: yes  (c)              comp.os.os2.setup: no  (d)         comp.os.os2.multimedia:  (e)               comp.os.os2.bugs: no   (f)       voter's last, first name: Smith, John   In this example, John Smith favors comp.os.os2.programmer.porting  to be created, and comp.os.os2.programmer to be renamed to  comp.os.os2.programmer.misc.  He also opposes the creation of  comp.os.os2.setup and comp.os.os2.bugs.  He does not have a view  on the creation of comp.os.os2.multimedia.    Example Ballot #2:   (a) comp.os.os2.programmer.porting: yes  (b)    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc: yes  (c)              comp.os.os2.setup: yes  (d)         comp.os.os2.multimedia: yes  (e)               comp.os.os2.bugs: yes   (f)       voter's last, first name: Doe, Jane   In this example, Jane Doe favors the creation or rename of all  the proposals.   Voting Rules:   * One vote per person.  If you vote more than once, only the most    recent vote will be counted.   * Votes must be mailed to me by the person voting.  Proxy voting,    forwarding, posting votes to a newsgroup, etc. will not be counted.   * Do not ask how the votes are going.  The status of the votings    will be revealed only after the poll closes.   * I will acknowledge votes by Mass Acknowledgement (ACK).  I will    post the ACK twice (see Schedule below).   * If you need help for using your editor, using e-mail, how    voting works in general, etc. then ask an expert at your site.    Also see the ``How To Create a New Newsgroup'' article which is    posted to news.answers on a regular basis.   * If you need any clarifications on voting procedures for this    CFV, send me e-mail at mlevis@ringer.cs.utsa.edu.   * When the voting period is over (see Schedule below), a proposal    passes if both of the following formulas are true:    1)  the number of YES votes exceeds the number of NO votes        by at least 100 (i.e. YES >= NO + 100, or YES - NO >= 100).    2)  the number of YES votes exceeds at least twice the        number of NO votes (i.e. YES >= 2 * NO, or YES - NO >= NO).    In other words, a proposal passes if:        YES - NO >= max (100, NO)    where max() returns the highest number given to it.   Schedule:   The voting period started on March 29 when the first CFV was posted  by David Lawrence (the news.announce.newgroups moderator).   This third CFV is a repeat of the first CFV, but it also has the  Mass Acknowledgement (ACK) of names and e-mail addresses of those who  have already voted -- re-send your vote if it is not there.  If you  have not voted yet, vote now!   The voting period will end at 11:59:59 pm (Central Time), on  April 24, 1993.  Votes received after that time will not count.  The voting results and tally will be posted shortly after that  date.   Mass Acknowledgement:   Here is the list of people who have already sent in their ballots  as of 12:01 am (Central Time) on April 15, 1993:                            bdubbs@cs.tamu.edu Aiyagari,

The Giants as a team are doing a lot of surprising things this year in addition to Bonds.  There has been some good pitching and some hitters seem to be swinging much better.

There are two very long entry ramps which all the hurry-up yahoos dive into cause they want to get ahead. When we get to the point where these ramps merge, all hell breaks lose. The result is that traffic which was moving at 55 on the VA side of the bridge, stalls on t'other side. If these dingbats had stayed in lane, allowed the folks coming up the two ramps to merge, we would still be doing 55. Instead we do start- stop for 4 miles.

A button widget, when pressed, will cause a new item to be drawn in the Window.  This action clearly should not call XCopyArea()  (or equiv) directly; instead, it should register the existence of the new item in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler that handles \\\"regular\\\" expose events (e.g. window manager-driven exposures) take care of rendering the new image.  Using an expose event handler is a \\\"proper\\\" way to do this because at the time the handler is called, the Xlib Window is guaranteed to be mapped.  The problem, of course, is that no expose event is generated if the window is already visible and mapped.  What we need to do is somehow \\\"tickle\\\" the Window so that the expose handler is hit with arguments that will enable it to render *just* the part of the window that contains the new item.\",\"Well my last two motorcycles have been shaft driven and they will wheelie.

Without a *genuine* commitment to peace from the Arab states, and concrete (not intellectual or political exercises in jargon) \\\"guarantees\\\" by other parties, the UN is worthless to Israel (but, perhaps useful as a \\\"ruse\\\"?).   Perhaps you are aware that, to most communities of people, there is the feeling that it is better that \\\"many of us die fighting against those who attack us than for few to die while we silently  accept our fate.\\\" If,however, you call on Israel to see the sense of  suffering fewer casualties, I suggest you apply the same to Palestinian, Arab and Islamic groups.   From Israel's perspective, \\\"concessions\\\" gets it NOTHING...except the  realization that it has given \\\"something\\\" up and now *can only  hope* that the other side decides to do likewise. Words *can be taken back* by merely doing so; to \\\"take back\\\" tangible items (land, control of land) requires the sort of action you say Israel should stay away from.   Israel put up with attacks from Arab state territories for decades  before essentially putting a stop to it through its invasion of Lebanon. The entire basis of that reality was exactly as you state above: 1) Israel  would express outrage at these attacks and protest to the Arab state  involved, 2) that state promptly ignored the entire matter, secure  in the knowledge that IT could not be held responsible for the acts  committed by \\\"private groups\\\", 3) Israel would prepare for the next  round of attacks. What would Israel want to return to those days (and don't be so idiotic as to suggest \\\"trust\\\" for the motivations of present-day Arab states)?  Ah, ok...what is \\\"different\\\" about the present situation that tells us that the Arab states will *not* pursue their past antagonistic  policies towards Israel? Now, don't talk about vague \\\"political factors\\\" but about those \\\"tangible\\\" (just like that which Israel gave up) factors that \\\"guarantee\\\" the responsibility of those states. Your assessment of \\\"difference\\\" here is based on a whole lot of assumptions, and most states don't feel confortable basing their existence on that sort of thing.   It has not. Without the support, and active involvement, of Syria, Lebanon would not have been able to accomplish all that has occurred. Once Syria leaves who is to say that Lebanon will be able to retain  control? If Syria stays thay may be even more dangerous for Israel.

But to suggest that a *disease* is a *punishment* for certain types of sin I think is  taking things much too far.  If we got some kind of mouth disease for lying, would any of us have mouths left?  What if we developed blindness every time we lusted after someone or something?  I dare say all of us would be walking into walls.  Yes, sin can have terrible consequences, but we need to be *real* careful when saying that the consequences are a *punishment* for  sin.  The Jews of Jesus's time believed that all sickness was the result of a sin.  Then Jesus healed a blind man and said that man was blind to show the glory of God, not because of sin.  If AIDS, or any other STD is a *punishment\\\" for sexual sin, what do we do with  diseases like cancer, or multiple sclerosis, which are just as debilitating and terrible as AIDS, yet are not usually linked to a specific behavior or lifestyle?  Atonement is *extremely* important, but I think you've missed the mark about as far as you can by suggesting that AIDS is an atonement for sin. The atonement for sin is JESUS CHRIST - period.  This is the central message of the Gospel.  A perfect sacrifice was required for our sins, and was made in the Lamb of God.  His sacrifice atoned for *all* of our sins, past present and future.  God does not require pennance for our sins, nor does he require us to come up with our own atonement.  He has graciously already done that for us.  To suggest that AIDS or  some other consequence is an atonement for sins is literally spitting on the sacrifice that Jesus made.  In case you couldn't tell, I get *extremely* angry and upset when I see things like this.  Instead of rationalizing our own fears and phobias, we need to be reaching out to people with AIDS and other socially unacceptable diseases.  Whether they got the disease through their own actions or not is irrelevant.  They still need Jesus Christ, no more and no less than we do.  I've said this before, but I think it's a good analogy.  People with AIDS are modern-day lepers.  Jesus healed many lepers.  He can also heal people with AIDS, maybe not on this earth, but in an ultimate sense.  My next-door neighbor has AIDS. She has recently come to have a much deeper and more committed  relationship with God.  Her theology isn't what I would want it to be, but God's grace covers her.  The amazing thing is that she is gaining weight (she's had the disease for over 2 years) and her health is excellent apart from occassional skin rashes and such.  She attributes her improvement in her health to God's intervention in her life.  Who are we to suggest that her disease is some kind of punishment?  It seems to me that God is being glorified through her disease.  Paul Overstreet, the country singer, has a good song title that I  think applies to all of us - But for the Grace of God, There Go I (or something like that).  May we all experience and accept God's grace.   =============================================================================== Paul Conditt  Internet: conditt@titan.tsd.arlut.utexas.edu Applied Research Phone:   (512) 835-3422   FAX: (512) 835-3416/3259   Laboratories  Fedex:   10000 Burnet Road, Austin, Texas 78758-4423 University of Texas Postal:   P.O.

Their faults were in intelligence (military and civilian definitions apply), tactics (attacking during DAYLIGHT??), methodology (the FBI stated that it is against government policy to assault a position where there are non-combatants/potential hostages without attempting negotiations first), and legality.  The BATF's jurisdiction is TAXES on firearms and tobacco.  They are a branch of the department of the treasury.  They have very curiously backed away from their claims of illegal weaponry to push the child-abuse charges... The BATF has no jurisdiction over non-firearms/tobacco issues! And the charges of child-abuse had been investigated in the past with no violence and no validation.  This was a clear case of first the BATF, then the FBI, having watched too many Rambo movies...  My opinion is that the agent in charge should be charged with executing an illegal raid, criminal negligence, murder, civil rights violations, and breaking his/her oath to uphold and defend the Constitution of the US.  The warrant should be unsealed to reveal to the  public what justification the BATF thought it had in committing an armed assault on American citizens.

I've used 3D Concepts a  little and it seems that the points are stored in the order they are drawn.  Does the DXF format have a way of indicating which order the  points are stored in, CW or CCW?  Its easy enough to convert, but if I don't know which way they are stored, I dont know  which direction the polygon should be visible from.  If DXF doesn't handle this, can anyone recommend a workaround? The best I can think of is to create two polygons for each one in the DXF file, one stored CW and the other CCW.

We were invited in by the government of S. Vietnam.  (I guess  we \\\"invaded\\\" Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War, eh?)  Mexico?  We have  invaded Mexico 2 or 3 times, once this century, but there were no missiles  for anyone to shoot over here at that time.  Hawaii?  We liberated it from  Spain.  So if you mean by the word \\\"invaded\\\" some sort of military action where we cross someone's border, you are right 5 out of 6.  But normally \\\"invaded\\\" carries a connotation of attacking an autonomous nation. (If some nation \\\"invades\\\" the U.S. Virgin Islands, would they be invading the Virgin Islands or the U.S.?)

However the paragraphs above seem to repeat uncritically the standard Kuhn/Lakatos/Feyerabend view of \\\"progress\\\" and \\\"rationality\\\" in science.  Since I've addressed these issues in this newsgroup in the not too distant past, I won't go into them again now.  What is wrong with the above observation is that it explicitly gives the impression (and you may not in fact hold this view) that the common (perhaps even the \\\"correct\\\") approach for a scientist to follow is to sit around having flights of fancy and scheming on the basis of his jealousies and petty hatreds.  It further at least implicitly advances the position that sciences goes \\\"forward\\\" (and it is not clear what this means given the context in which it occurs) by generating in a completely non-rational and even random way a plethora of hypotheses and theories that are then weeded out via the \\\"critical function\\\" of science.  (Though why this critical function should be less subject to the non-rational forces is a mystery. If experimental design, hypotheses creation, and theory construction are subject to jealousies and petty hatreds, then this must be equally true of the application of any \\\"critical function\\\" concerning replication. This is what leads one (ala Feyerabend) to an \\\"anything goes\\\" view.)  True, the generation part *can* be totally irrational.  But typically it is *not*.  Anecdotes concerning instances where a hypothesis seems to have resulted in some way from a dream or from one's political views simply do not generalize well to the actual history of science.\",\"I am developing an X (Xt,Xm) application that will include a graphics window of some sort with moving symbols among other things.

Our   three year old daughter suffers from this disease.  Below is a press release   that appeared in local newspapers.  Hope you can join us.   On Saturday, April 24 as part of Communiversity in Princeton, a local family   will be having a bake and craft sale to raise money for and create public   awareness about a rare disease called Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis.  Bill and Marlene Stern's daughter Lindsay is afflicted with this disease   characterized by tumors attacking the inside of the larynx, vocal cords and   trachea.  Caused by a virus, the tumors grow, block the air passages and would   lead to death from suffocation without continual surgery to remove the growths.    Three year old Lindsay has undergone 11 operations thus far since her diagnosis   last year and faces the prospect of over a hundred operations throughout her   lifetime.    Even though the disease is hardly a household word, it has affected the lives   of enough people to inspire the formation of the Recurrent Respiratory   Papillomatosis Foundation,  a non-profit foundation whose goals are to provide   support for patients and families by networking patients and publishing a   newsletter, enhance  awareness of RRP at the local and national level, and aid   in the prevention, cure, and treatment.  Since medical researchers know that the virus causing the disease is similar to   those viruses causing warts, they feel a cure would be within reach if money   were available for research.  Because RRP is rare, it not only gets scant   attention but also paltry funds to search for a cure.  Part of the RRP   Foundation's mission is to change that.   Anyone interested in contributing items to the bake and craft sale, please call   Marlene or Bill at 609-890-0502.  Monetary donations can be made at the   Foundation's booth during Communiversity, April 24th, 12 to 4 p.m., in downtown   Princeton, or sent directly to:\",\"   I think you will find that the active Linux and 386BSD communities are   populated by enthusiasts who would object to paying *any* money for software.   Otherwise, they would probably have gone for a commercial Unix.   An important factor in the Linux community is that source code is always   available (this is probably similar in the 386BSD community, however, I'm not   really involved there). Many people using Linux like to stay at the cutting   (bleeding) edge: ie. when kernel patches, C library or compiler patches come   out, people like to rebuild their entire systems.

By Baruch Me'iri  All those involved in this matter politely refused my request, one way or another: \\\"Look, the subject is too delicate.  If I comment on it, I will be implicitly admitting that it is true; If I mention a specific case, even hint at it, I might be guilty of making public something which may legally not be published\\\".  The State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many years there have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever being made public. More precisely: A court ordered publication ban was placed on the fact of their arrest, and later on their imprisonment.  In Israel of 1993, citizens are imprisoned without us, the citizens of this country, knowing anything about it.  Not knowing anything about the fact that one person or another were tried and thrown in prison, for security offenses, in complete secrecy.  In the distant past -- for example during the days of the [Lavon - YA] affair -- we heard about \\\"the third man\\\" being in prison.  But many years have passed since then, and what existed then can today no longer be found even in South American countries, or in the former Communist countries.  But it appears that this is still possible in Israel of 1993.  The Chair of the Knesset Committee on Law, the Constitution and Justice, MK David Zucker, sent a letter on this subject early this week to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice, and the Cabinet Legal Advisor.  Ma'ariv has obtained the content of the letter:  \\\"During the past several years a number of Israeli citizens have been imprisoned for various periods for security offenses.  In some of these cases a legal publication ban was imposed not only on the specifics of the crimes for which the prisoners were convicted, but even on the mere fact of their imprisonment.  In those cases, after being legally convicted, the prisoners spend their term in prison without public awareness either of the imprisonment or of the prisoner\\\", asserts MK Zucker.  On the other hand Zucker agrees in his letter that, \\\"There is absolutely no question that it is possible, and in some cases it is imperative, that a publication ban be imposed on the specifics of security offenses and the course of trials.  But even in such cases the Court must weigh carefully and deliberately the circumstances under which a trial will not be held in public.  \\\"However, one must ask whether the imposition of a publication ban on the mere fact of a person's arrest, and on the name of a person sentenced to prison, is justified and appropriate in the State of Israel.  The principle of public trial and the right of the public to know are not consistent with the disappearance of a person from public sight and his descent into the abyss of prison.\\\"  Zucker thus decided to turn to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice and the Cabinet Legal Advisor and request that they consider the question.  \\\"The State of Israel is strong enough to withstand the cost incurred by abiding by the principle of public punishment.  The State of Israel cannot be allowed to have prisoners whose detention and its cause is kept secret\\\", wrote Zucker.  The legal counsel of the Civil Rights Union, Attorney Mordechai Shiffman said that, \\\"We, as the Civil Rights Union, do not know of any cases of security prisoners, Citizens of Israel, who are imprisoned, and whose imprisonment cannot be made public.  This is a situation which, if it actually exists, is definitely unhealthy.  Just like censorship is an unhealthy matter\\\".  \\\"The Union is aware\\\", says Shiffman, \\\"of cases where notification of a suspect's arrest to family members and lawyers is withheld.  I am speaking only of several days.  I know also of cases where a detainee was not allowed to meet with an attorney -- sometimes for the whole first month of arrest.  That is done because of the great secrecy.  \\\"The suspect himself, his family, his lawyer -- or even a journalist -- can challenge the publication ban in court.  But there are cases where the family members themselves are not interested in publicity.  The journalist knows nothing of the arrest, and so almost everyone is happy...\\\"  Attorney Yossi Arnon, an official of the Bar, claims that given the laws as they exist in Israel today, a situation where the arrest of a person for security offenses is kept secret is definitely possible.  \\\"Nothing is easier.  The court orders a publication ban, and that's that.  Someone who has committed security offenses can spend long years in prison without us knowing anything about it.\\\"  -- Do you find this situation acceptable?  Attorney Arnon: \\\"Definitely not.  We live in a democratic country, and such a state of affairs is impermissible.  I am well aware that publication can be damaging -- from the standpoint of security -- but total non-publication, silence, is unacceptable. Consider the trial of Mordechai Vanunu: at least in his case we know that he was charged with aggravated espionage and sentenced to 18 years in prison.  The trial was held behind closed doors, nobody knew the details except for those who were authorized to.  It is somehow possible to understand, though not to accept, the reasons, but, as I have noted, we at least are aware of his imprisonment.\\\"  -- Why is the matter actually that serious?  Can't we trust the discretion of the court?  Attorney Arnon: \\\"The judges have no choice but to trust the presentations made to them. The judges do not have the tools to investigate.  This gives the government enormous power, power which they can misuse.\\\"  -- And what if there really is a security issue?  Attorney Arnon: \\\"I am a man of the legal system, not a security expert.  Democracy stands in opposition to security.  I believe it is possible to publicize the matter of the arrest and the charges -- without entering into detail.  We have already seen how the laws concerning publication bans can be misused, in the case of the Rachel Heller murder.  A suspect in the murder was held for many months without the matter being made public.\\\"  Attorney Shiffman, on the other hand, believes that state security can be a legitimate reason for prohibiting publication of a suspect's arrest, or of a convicted criminal's imprisonment.  \\\"A healthy situation?  Definitely not.  But I am aware of the fact that mere publication may be harmful to state security\\\".  A different opinion is expressed by attorney Uri Shtendal, former advisor for Arab affairs to Prime Ministers Levi Eshkol and Golda Meir.  \\\"Clearly, we are speaking of isolated special cases.  Such situations contrast with the principle that a judicial proceeding must be held in public. No doubt this contradicts the principle of freedom of expression.  Definitely also to the principle of individual freedom which is also harmed by the prohibition of publication.  \\\"Nevertheless\\\", adds Shtendal, \\\"the legislator allowed for the possibility of such a ban, to accommodate special cases where the damage possible as a consequence of publication is greater than that which may follow from an abridgment of the principles I've mentioned. The authority to decide such matters of publication does not rest with the Prime Minister or the security services, but with the court, which we may rest assured will authorize a publication ban only if it has been convinced of its need beyond a shadow of a doubt.\\\"  Nevertheless, attorney Shtendal agrees: \\\"As a rule, clearly such a phenomenon is undesirable. Such an extreme step must be taken only in the most extreme circumstances.\\\"\",\" All your friend really has to do is find a Registered Dietician(RD).

But this is *irrelevant*.  You're talking about averages, when we have lots of information about THIS PLAYER IN PARTICULAR to base our decisions on.  I might as well say \\\"We know that very, very few people are more than 7 feet tall, so chances are that Manute Bol is really only 6 foot 4.\\\"   Why isn't Lopez likely to hit that well?  He hit that well last year (after adjusting his stats for park and league and such); he hit better (on an absolute scale) than Olson or Berryhill did.  By a lot.  As for rushing...  If there really is a qualitative difference between the minors and the majors that requires a period of adjustment (and I don't believe there is), then wouldn't you rather waste Lopez's 22-year old good season than his 23-year old very good season or his 24-year-old excellent season?  The sooner you get him acclimated, the more of his prime you get to use.   The point was not that 17 AB is a significant sample, but rather that he hadn't done anything in spring training to cause even a blockhead manager to question whether his minor league numbers were for real, or to send him down \\\"until he gets warmed up\\\".   Most players are *never* ready for the bigs.  What does this have to do with Javy Lopez?   See above.     But I could apply the same reasoning to Frank Thomas or Barry Bonds.  Most players aren't that good, so they probably won't be that good this year either.   And demonstrated inabilities to hit their way out of a soap bubble.   Not superstars, not stars, not even good players.  Maybe average, if we're being charitable.   Ummm.  Justice is a very fine hitter.  Pendleton might have another big year in his bat, but he might also spend the season in Hamstring Hell.  Gant is a big question mark.  The Bream/Hunter platoon is decent (not excellent) and has rotten OBP or SLG (depending on who's in).  Blauser is a very valuable bat... for a shortstop.    Wanna bet?  The difference between Lopez's bat and Olson/Berryhill could be 20 or 30 runs over the course of the season.  Given a choice between a player with experience and a player who can play, I'll take the latter every time.   Just like Keith Mitchell did?   That was me, and you so far your only counter-proposal is that they really don't understand how good Lopez is, or overvalue experience, or some combination of the two.  I think my interpretation was more flattering to the organization.

Reproduced under open license granted by Audio Books, Inc.  -----------------------------------------------------------------  This is the Dr. Beter AUDIO LETTER(R), 1629 K St. NW, Washington, DC  20006.     Hello, my friends, this is Dr. Beter.  Today is April 30, 1982, and this is my AUDIO LETTER(R) No. 74.    It's now been almost one month since war broke out in the South Atlantic.  On the surface it seems that it's only a dispute between Argentina and Great Britain over the barren, wind-swept Falkland Islands and South Georgia Island.  In reality, it's far more than that.     The so-called Falklands crisis is just the visible tip of a giant military operation.  During this month of April 1982, fierce naval battles have taken place--not only in the South Atlantic but also in the South Pacific.  Up to now most of the hostilities have been kept under wraps by wartime censorship on all sides.  But as I say these words, the naval war in the Southern Hemisphere is about to come to the surface.     Beginning today, April 30, a total naval and air blockade of the Falklands by the Royal Navy has begun.  At the same time a counterblockade has been declared by Argentina in the same area.     To be effective, a blockade must be imposed over a period of time, but the Royal Navy does not have that much time.  Winter is coming on in the South Atlantic, and the British supply lines are overextended.  Having come this far, Her Majesty's navy cannot simply drop the blockade and sail away in a few weeks time without drawing blood from Argentina.  As a result the British will be forced to undertake military operations very soon no matter how risky they may be.     There is also another reason why the Royal Navy now has no choice but to engage the Argentine forces in combat.  That reason, my friends, is that the Royal Navy has already suffered losses in secret combat this month.  Up to this moment there will be no way to explain away the damage which has been sustained by the British fleet.  Only when publicly admitted fighting erupts will the British dare to admit that they have suffered battle losses.  To obtain that cover story, the British have no choice but to sail into combat; but in doing so, they will be risking even heavier losses on top of those already sustained.  In short, my friends, Her Majesty's navy has sailed into a trap.     The events now unfolding in the South Atlantic carry strange, ironic echoes of the past.  For weeks now we've been hearing countless commentators referring to the British task force as an \\\"armada\\\" (quote).  The British of all people ought to be very uneasy with that description.  The original Spanish Armada 400 years ago was renowned as a seemingly invincible fighting force, but it came to grief in a naval disaster so complete that it changed the course of history--and it was none other than the English navy that destroyed the Spanish Armada.     The original Spanish Armada put to sea in 1588 during the reign of England's Queen Elizabeth I.  The Armada was an invasion fleet carrying thousands of crack fighting men to invade England.  They were met by the daring sea dogs of Sir Francis Drake.  Drake and his small, fast ships turned the tables on the Spanish Armada by changing the rules of battle.  The English fleet was equipped with new longer-range guns, and it stayed upwind and out of reach.  From there the English pounded, smashed, and shattered the big ships of the mighty Armada.  When it was all over, barely half the Spanish fleet was left to limp back to port.  Drake's defeat of the Spanish Armada was a shock to the world.  It opened the door for England under Queen Elizabeth I to start its expansion into a truly global empire.     Today, 400 years later, history seems to have come full circle.  Queen Elizabeth II is witnessing the dismantling of the world empire whose heyday began under Queen Elizabeth I, and now the cultures of England and of Spain are once again in confrontation.  Once again a so-called armada is preparing for invasion, but this time the armada is British, not Spanish.  Four hundred years ago Sir Francis Drake was the hero of the day; today, the ghost of Francis Drake is once again on the scene.     The South Atlantic war zone is at the eastern end of the Drake Passage around the southern tip of South America.  The defeat of the Spanish Armada four centuries ago broke the back of Spain's naval supremacy, and now the defeat of the new British armada may well break the back of what remains of the once glorious Royal Navy.     My three special topics for this AUDIO LETTER are:  Topic #1--THE MILITARY SECRET OF SOUTH GEORGIA ISLAND Topic #2--THE SECRET NAVAL WAR OF THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE Topic #3--THE ROCKEFELLER FEAR CAMPAIGN AGAINST NUCLEAR WAR.  Topic #1--When the Falkland Islands crisis began early this month it looked at first like a tempest in a teapot.  For a century and a half since 1833, the Islands have been controlled by Great Britain.  During that entire time, British sovereignty over the Falklands has been disputed by Argentina.  There have been countless threats by Argentina to seize the Islands, which it calls the Malvinas, but the threats have always come to nothing in the past and Britain has never even gotten very worried about them.     The Islands are four times as distant from Argentina as Cuba is from the United States, and they are not much of a prize.  After 150 years of occupancy, the Falklands are home to fewer than 2,000 British settlers and a lot of sheep.  In short, the remote Falkland Islands hardly look like something to fight over, and yet here we are watching another crisis take place.  We are watching as war erupts between Great Britain and Argentina.     The Thatcher government is acting as if it has forgotten all about its usual preoccupation with the Soviet threat at NATO's doorstep.  Instead, Britain is throwing almost everything it's got at Argentina---aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, submarines, assault ships--you name it.  Luxury cruise ships have even been commissioned and turned into troop carriers overnight.  Wave after wave of additional assault troops have been activated and sent to join the fleet even after it sailed.  Ships and submarines have been pulled off station from normal NATO duty and sent to reinforce the task force.  The initial 40-ship force has grown steadily over the past several weeks into an armada numbering over 70.  Over two-thirds of the entire Royal Navy has already been deployed to the South Atlantic off Argentina.     Watching all this, a lot of people are asking: What's this fight really all about?  The most popular answer suggested in the major media is \\\"oil.\\\"  Vast deposits of oil are known to exist under the continental shelf between Argentina and the Falklands, but that has been known for nearly 10 years.  In no way does it explain the timing of the sudden military offensive by Argentina this month, and oil explains even less about the Argentine seizure of South Georgia Island.     South Georgia Island is 800 miles east of the Falklands with no known oil deposits anywhere near it; and compared to South Georgia, the Falklands are an island paradise.  South Georgia Island is covered with rugged mountains, treacherous valleys, glaciers, and semi-permanent snow.  Most of it is uninhabitable.  On top of all that, Argentina has absolutely no legal or historical claim to South Georgia Island.  In that respect it stands in sharp contrast to the Falklands.     In the early 1830s the Falklands were occupied for a while by Argentine colonists.  In 1833 the British expelled them and took over the Island.  For that and other historical reasons, Argentina argues that the Falklands really belong to Argentina, not Britain.     But no such argument is possible for South Georgia Island.  It has always been controlled by Britain, never by Argentina or Spain.  The Argentine seizure of South Georgia Island looks even more unreasonable from a military point of view.  Argentina's leaders are military men and they think in military terms.  They were well aware ahead of time that far-off South Georgia Island could not possibly be held for long.  By seizing it they were setting themselves up to absorb a military defeat, as the Island was retaken by Britain.  So the question is: Why did Argentina's military junta bother with the seemingly worthless South Georgia Island at all?     My friends, the answers to all these questions are military, not political or economic.  South Georgia Island possesses an enormous military secret.  It's a giant underground installation buried under the mountains at the northwest end of the Island.  The real reason for the so-called Falkland crisis is this secret installation, together with two other similar installations which I will describe shortly.     The secret military complexes have been in existence for many years; they are not new.  What is new is the accelerated nuclear war timetable of the American Bolshevik war planners here in Washington.  For the past two months I've been reporting the details of this new war plan to you as quickly as I can obtain and verify them.     The plan calls for NUCLEAR WAR ONE to erupt by September of this year 1982!!  It is this fast-approaching nuclear war threat that caused the so-called Falklands crisis to erupt now.     What is going on now is a coordinated effort to spoil part of the Bolshevik grand strategy for the coming nuclear war.  The mutual enemies of the American Bolsheviks here--namely, the Rockefeller cartel--and Russia's new rulers in the Kremlin are behind the present crisis.  They are trying to ruin Phase #3 of the \\\"PROJECT Z\\\" war plan which I revealed last month.  That phase is to be world domination by the American Bolsheviks after both Russia and the United States have been destroyed in NUCLEAR WAR ONE.  As I mentioned last month, the key to this plan is the existence of secret weapons stockpiles in various places around the world.     The American Bolshevik military planners here in America are working with other Bolshevik agents in key military positions of other countries to set off war.  Having done that, they intend to ride out the nuclear holocaust they have caused, safe and cozy in Government war bunkers!  When the warring nations finally lie smoldering and exhausted, the Bolsheviks will leave the shattered remains of their host countries.  They will rendezvous at the secret weapons installations and bring their weapons into the open.  They will confront the world with the only remaining fresh, up-to-date, powerful military force on earth; and using that military power, they will become the undisputed rulers of the world--that is, they plan to do all this, and they plan to pave the way for world domination very soon by setting off NUCLEAR WAR ONE in a matter of months.  The Rockefeller cartel and Russia's new anti-Bolshevik rulers are working together in a race against time to try to head off the Bolshevik war plan.     Last month I mentioned that the Bolsheviks here are benefitting from war preparations which were started by the Rockefellers long ago.  It has only been about three years since the Rockefellers were dislodged as the prime movers of the United States Government by the Bolsheviks.  Since that time the United States Government has been a house divided, torn by internal power struggles between rival Bolshevik and Rockefeller factions.  But before that, the United States had been dominated for decades both economically and politically by the Four Rockefeller Brothers.     In 1961 the Brothers launched a new long-range plan for world domination.  It was a two-prong strategy, half visible and half secret, which I first described long ago in AUDIO LETTER No. 28.  It was a plan for the United States to arm to the teeth in secret while appearing to disarm gradually.  Without repeating all the details, the basic idea was grandiose yet simple.  By deliberately appearing weak, the Rockefeller-controlled United States would maneuver itself into a nuclear war with Russia.  Then the secret weapons, including superweapons, would be unleashed to smash Russia and take over the world.     When they set the grand plan in motion in 1961, the Rockefeller Brothers were looking ahead to a nuclear war by the late 1970s.  Their military analysts concluded very early that the war being planned would have very different effects on the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.  Both superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, are located well up in the Northern Hemisphere; so are the other full-fledged nuclear powers--Great Britain, France, Red China, and India.  By contrast, the strategic targets for nuclear war in the Southern Hemisphere are relatively few and far between.  In other words, it was expected that the coming nuclear war would be essentially a Northern Hemisphere war.     In an all-out nuclear holocaust it is known that serious radioactive fallout will gradually spread to affect even areas not initially hit by war.  But there are limits to how far the war clouds can spread.  It was discovered long ago that there is very little mixing between the air of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.  In the northern half of our planet, cold air from the North Pole works its way southward towards the equator, then it works its way back to the north as warm air.  A mirror image of this process takes up the southern half of the planet.  Northern and Southern Hemisphere air meet in the equatorial zone, but very little of the air changes places.     The military conclusion, my friends, is this: the coming nuclear war could ruin large areas of the Northern Hemisphere for generations to come; but if the calculations are right, the Southern Hemisphere could escape virtually unaffected by the war.  This was music to the ears of the Four Rockefeller Brothers.  A quick look at the globe of the world shows why.  The Rockefeller cartel has dominated Latin America ever since World War II.  As I discussed in my very first monthly AUDIO LETTER, Nelson Rockefeller solidified the cartel grip on Latin America during the war.  He accomplished this as so-called \\\"Coordinator of Hemispheric Defense\\\" for then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt.  So that takes care of the South American continent and its natural resources.     Then there is the African continent.  There, too, Rockefeller control was already in effect over wide areas of Black Africa, especially south of the equator.  All this was thanks to the efforts of John D. Rockefeller III, as I detailed in AUDIO LETTER No. 36.     Looking around the globe, the most important remaining land masses from the standpoint of world domination are Australia and New Zealand.  Thanks to World War II, both were wide open to the Rockefellers.     The Rockefeller Brothers decided to establish secret military installations in the Southern Hemisphere for use after the coming war.  By this means they expected to become the masters of the surviving southern half of planet Earth after the Northern Hemisphere war.  Then, as the Northern Hemisphere gradually recovered from the nuclear holocaust, the Rockefeller empire would be able to pick up the pieces.  In this way the third generation Rockefeller Brothers expected their family dynasty to inherit the Earth.     In order to control the Southern Hemisphere militarily after the war, some means would have to be available to project military power onto any land mass.  For example, revolts against Rockefeller domination would require troops--not a blast from the beam weapons on the Moon.  The most critical factor for postwar military domination of the world was found to be a navy.  A minimum of two secret naval fleets would be required--one based in the South Atlantic, the other in the South Pacific.  Since the reserve naval fleets were to be kept secret until after the Northern Hemisphere nuclear war, they could not be built in existing shipyards.  New construction facilities had to be built and they had to be hidden.  To hide an entire shipyard is no small task; they take up a lot of space.  On top of that, it was essential that the ships remain hidden after they were built.  The best way to achieve that was to combine the shipyard and naval base into one over-all secret installation.  Finally, the secret naval installation had to be invulnerable to nuclear attack; otherwise if its existence were ever discovered prematurely, the secret navy might be wiped out.     The combined requirements for secrecy, space, and protection against attack were formidable; but one day in 1959, while all these plans were still in the early stages of development, the answer presented itself.  During a so-called banking trip to Sweden, David Rockefeller was given a tour of a unique hidden naval port.  The port is hollowed out from solid granite cliffs which come right down to the water.  The entrance to the port is a gigantic hole in the side of the cliff which can be sealed off with enormous steel doors.  Inside this big doorway on the water a huge cavity has been hollowed out to accommodate ships.     The Rockefeller Brothers and their military adviser decided that a bigger, more secret, better protected version of the Swedish hidden port was just what they wanted.  A survey of candidate sites was then initiated.  The site survey covered coastal areas throughout the Southern Hemisphere.  Many areas were rejected very quickly because the topography was wrong.  Other areas were rejected because they were too close to the equator.  Still others had to be ruled out because there were too many people living nearby, making the desired level of secrecy impossible.  Finally, it was essential that the sites chosen for the secret naval installations be totally secure politically.     At last the sites for the secret naval installations were selected.  In the South Pacific, extreme southern New Zealand was selected.  This is what I was alluding to in AUDIO LETTER No. 71 three months ago when I called attention to New Zealand's extreme importance in the coming war.     In order to obtain the necessary space, the secret New Zealand naval installation had to be divided up into two sites located close together.  One is at the extreme southwest tip of South Island where the mountain range known as the Southern Alps comes down virtually to the water's edge.  The other part of the installation is built into the northwest tip of Stewart Island, which is off the tip of South Island.  The Stewart Island facility is hollowed out within a rise known as Mt. Anglem.     The New Zealand location met all the requirements.  Ever since World War II the government of New Zealand has been tied even closer to the United States than to Great Britain.  The location is far from the equator, and the installations are buried deep under mountains, protected from nuclear attack.  They are also too deep to be reached by particle-beam attacks, and the New Zealand site is well situated to command the entire South Pacific.     In the South Atlantic an even more perfect site was found.  That site, my friends, is South Georgia Island.  It is located perfectly for naval domination of the entire South Atlantic.  The tall, rugged mountains provided a perfect location for the secret installation at the northwest tip of the 100-mile long island.  It is controlled by Great Britain whose government, like that of New Zealand, was willing to cooperate; and South Georgia Island was virtually uninhabited except for a whaling station on the northeast coast.  The whaling station was some 50 miles away from the secret new installation which was being built, but Britain took no chances.  In 1965 the whaling station was closed down.  Since that time there have been no inhabitants on South Georgia Island except for a few dozen alleged Antarctic scientists.     Construction of the secret naval facilities--two in New Zealand, one on South Georgia Island--began in the early 1960's.  The techniques were adapted from those used previously to build other large underground facilities, such as the NORAD installation inside Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado; however these techniques were adapted in radically new ways to achieve construction access directly from the sea instead of overland.  In this way, the sheltering mountain was left undisturbed in appearance both during and after construction.     The cuts in the mountain side which were necessary to let ships in and out were kept as small as possible and were well camouflaged.  Like the Swedish hidden naval port arrangement, the entrances to the secret installations can be sealed up.  When sealed, the entrance is virtually impossible to detect unless you know exactly where it is; and unlike most large construction projects, there are no tailings or piles of leftover rock lying around to attract attention.  The man-made caverns which house the secret naval installations are enormous, but all the rock and debris was disposed of at sea.     Once the secret naval facilities were built, they had to be outfitted for ship construction and docksite storage.  The fake disarmament of the United States during the 1960s contributed greatly to this task.  From 1961 to 1968 one man played a pivotal role in this elaborate Rockefeller scheme.  He was then-Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara.  All through the 60's McNamara presided over the public paring back of America's visible military power.  This included the closing down and dismantling of entire shipyards.  What we were not told was where all that shipyard equipment went afterwards.  Where it went, my friends, was to the new secret installations which were being outfitted in New Zealand and South Georgia Island!     The secret naval installations have been used as duplication facilities to reproduce certain ships and submarines designed and built here in the United States.  As Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger told Congress recently, it is cheaper to build two ships at a time.  That is especially true if the second ship is an exact duplicate of the first.  This has become even more true in recent years through the use of computerized manufacturing techniques.     The secret naval fleets which have been built at the secret installations are made up of duplicates--exact duplicates of certain other ships and submarines.  They are all nuclear powered--nuclear \\\"subs\\\"; nuclear cruisers; nuclear destroyers; and yes, nuclear aircraft carriers, three of them.  A secret twin was built for the U.S.S. Nimitz, for the U.S.S. Eisenhower, and for the newly-launched U.S.S. Carl Vincent.  All have been financed through the gigantic cost overruns, so called, that we constantly hear about in the Defense Department; and all three carriers have been provided with a full complement of aircraft whose manufacture was financed the same way!     The ships of the secret American Bolshevik naval fleets are all duplicates of other nuclear-powered vessels.  Even so, the secret naval ships possess one key difference.     Last month I revealed that the so-called \\\"Stealth Program\\\" has succeeded in developing a kind of electromagnetic invisibility shield.  This technique makes an object invisible from a distance by distorting light waves in its vicinity.     A whole new fleet of Phantom war-planes are now going into crash production that use this principle; and, my friends, all of the secret American Bolshevik navy ships have already been outfitted with similar Stealth-field equipment!  The Stealth principle is actually easier to apply to ships than to airplanes because there is more room for the powerful equipment that generates the field.     After NUCLEAR WAR ONE, the secret Stealth navy of the American Bolsheviks would be light years ahead of any other navy left on earth.  It would be perfect for the intended role of world domination.  The Rockefellers set it all in motion long ago, my friends, but three years ago they lost control of the United States Military.  Now it's the American Bolsheviks who are in control, and they are bent on war.     These secret naval installations have precipitated what is being called the \\\"Falklands crisis.\\\"  Topic #2--In AUDIO LETTER(R) No. 73 last month I described \\\"PROJECT Z\\\", the new Bolshevik three-phase strategy for NUCLEAR WAR ONE.     An elite group of American Bolshevik military planners here are flushing out the plan right now at a secret war-room here in Washington.  It's a plan by which the United States will strike the first nuclear blow, followed by all-out thermonuclear war with Russia.     Having set off the holocaust, the Bolsheviks here and in certain other countries plan to rise it out safe in comfortable war bunkers.  Finally after NUCLEAR WAR ONE fizzles out in stalemate, they plan to leave behind the ashes of the United States and her allies.  Activating Phase #3 of their grand strategy, they plan to unveil their secret weapons, especially their secret naval fleets.  With these they plan to conquer and rule what is left of the world.  The United States as we know it will be dead and gone; but in the eyes of the Bolsheviks themselves, this outcome will constitute victory.     Up to now the nuclear war timetable which I first revealed two months ago is still on track.  They are still shooting for nuclear war to begin by September of this year 1982!  Time is fast running out.     The Bolsheviks here are sprinting as fast as they can toward war; but, my friends, the Bolsheviks are not the only runners in this race.  They have two deadly enemies, both of whom are equally determined to trip up the Bolsheviks.  One enemy of the Bolsheviks here is the Rockefeller cartel; the other enemy is the new anti-Bolshevik ruling clique in Russia; and now these two mutual enemies of the Bolsheviks are pooling their efforts in certain ways.     In AUDIO LETTER No. 71 three months ago I reported that a limited, new anti-Bolshevik coalition was in the works between the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians.  The January 26 meeting between Haig and Gromyko in Geneva, Switzerland, was a turning point in the formation of this coalition.  It is now a reality, and is responsible for the so-called \\\"Falkland crisis\\\" now dominating the headlines.  It should be emphasized that this new relationship between the Rockefeller cartel and Russia falls far short of a true alliance.  They have very major disputes to be settled between them, but for the time being they have called a truce between themselves to deal with their mutual deadly enemy--the Bolsheviks here in America.     The first priority of the Russians and the Rockefellers is to slow down the Bolshevik preparations for imminent nuclear war.  If they can do that, time is on the side of the Rockefeller cartel in certain political movements which I discussed last summer in AUDIO LETTER No. 67.  A slow-down in the nuclear war timetable will also give more breathing space for additional anti-Bolshevik actions to be implemented.     The joint Rockefeller-Russian planners decided by mid-February that military action against the Bolsheviks was essential very quickly.  No other type of action had any hope of taking effect fast enough to prevent nuclear war by the end of this summer.     The exact details of the \\\"PROJECT Z\\\" war plan are not known to either the Rockefellers or the Russians, but the general outlines are known to be as I described last month.     It was decided that military action should be devised that would undermine Phase #3 of the Bolshevik war plan--that is, the Bolshevik-controlled secret naval installations and fleets in the Southern Hemisphere should be attacked and crippled.  By working together, the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians were able to devise an attack plan which neither could have carried out alone.  The Rockefeller group, who built and originally controlled these bases, provided detailed Intelligence about the best way to attack them.  The Russians with their enormous military machine provided the muscle to actually carry out the attack.     It was essential to devise a scheme that would enable both secret fleets in the South Atlantic and South Pacific to be attacked.  Survival intact of either fleet would leave the Bolshevik war plan still workable.     Military analysts concluded very quickly that a direct assault on the New Zealand facilities was out of the question.  There was no combination of commandos, frogmen, or other military force which could possibly keep an attack secret from the outside world.  Any attack on the New Zealand bases would set off the very war which the Rockefellers and Russians want to prevent.     But the situation in the South Atlantic was a different matter.  In a way, the greatest asset of South Georgia Island was also its Achilles' heel.  The extreme isolation which protected the secrecy of the South Georgia base also made a covert military assault feasible.  The key lay with Argentina and her long-standing claims to the Falkland Islands.     As I mentioned in Topic #1, the Rockefeller cartel has dominated all of Latin America for decades.  Cartel operatives were sent to Argentina to work out a deal with the government military junta there.  The historic dispute over the Falkland Islands was to be used to provide a ruse, a military cover, to enable the South Georgia base to be attacked.  The Argentine generals were not told everything about the situation by any means, but they were told enough to make clear what they were to do.     As an inducement to cooperate, the Argentine leaders were promised handsome rewards.  They were guaranteed that after the shooting was over, the Falkland Islands would remain in Argentine hands.  This guarantee included the promise of covert military assistance as needed against the Royal Navy.  And to bolster the troubled Argentine economy, it was promised that the Rockefeller cartel will help develop the immense offshore oil reserves.  With these combined promises of military glory and financial rewards, the Argentine military junta agreed to the plan.     On March 19 Argentina carried out Act #1 in the joint attack plan.  A group of Argentine scrap-metal merchants, of all things, landed at the abandoned old whaling station on South Georgia Island.  Supposedly they were there to dismantle the old buildings and cart them off to sell.  While they were at it they also raised the Argentine flag over the work-site.  The British, always nervous about South Georgia Island, promptly reacted as expected.  The British Antarctic survey ship \\\"Endurance\\\" put 22 Marines ashore.  They drove off the scrap merchants and tore down the Argentine flag.     The incident provided the desired excuse for the Argentine Junta to bring the simmering 150-year-old Falklands dispute to a boil.  From time to time in the past, Argentina has claimed that South Georgia is part of the Falklands because it is administered that way by Britain.  That argument is very flimsy but it now came in very handy.  It was nothing new to hear this from Argentine leaders, so there was no hint of what was really afoot.     During late March, Argentine military forces started assembling for an assault on the Falklands.  \\\"Nothing new\\\", thought the British high command.  Argentina has carried out threatening maneuvers in the past many times.  It was believed that they were about to do it again; but on April 2 Argentine forces did the unexpected.  After many past false alarms, this time they actually invaded and seized the Islands.  All Argentine public statements emphasized the long-standing historical claims to the Falklands themselves; but just for good measure, the next day a small Argentine force also seized far-off South Georgia Island.  The force was so small that it gave the appearance initially that it was just a side show from Argentina's point of view; however, the small contingent of 22 Royal Marines were overpowered and bundled off the Island along with a group of 13 alleged scientists.  That was the moment of payoff in the joint Rockefeller-Russian attack plan.     Thanks to the elaborate distraction staged by the Argentine forces, a special commando team got onto the Island undetected.  Based on the detailed Rockefeller information about the base, the team moved to a location on the mountain directly above the cavernous secret base.  Special high-speed drilling equipment was set up by the Rockefeller members of the team while the Russian members concentrated on military defense.  By late that evening, April 3, the military high command in London finally learned what was really taking place.  The secret South Georgia base was under attack by virtually the only means possible.  The joint Rockefeller-Russian team were drilling a shaft down through the mountain toward the hollowed out cavern inside.  It was only a matter of time until their drill would break through the ceiling of the giant hidden naval base.  Once the hole was made, the next step was obvious.  The Rockefeller-Russian team would put a weapon of some kind through the hole.  The best guess was that it would be a nerve gas.     The shock waves that went through the highest levels of the British government on the evening of April 3 can hardly be described, my friends.  The Thatcher government, like the so-called Reagan Administration here in America, is Bolshevik controlled.  That's why Margaret Thatcher always says, \\\"Me, too\\\" any time the Reagan Administration says or does anything against Russia.  Both governments are party to the secret nuclear war plan in complete betrayal of the people of their respective countries, and on the evening of April 3 they suddenly discovered that their precious war plan was in deep, deep trouble.     Immediately the Thatcher government started assembling a naval armada to sail for the South Atlantic.  Haste was the order of the day.  The drilling on South Georgia Island was proceeding around the clock.  The best estimates were that the drilling would break through into the roof of the naval base in about three weeks, on or about April 24.  If help did not reach South Georgia by then, the secret installation might be doomed.  The forces stationed at the installation itself were unable to defend themselves under the circumstances.  Their mighty naval ships were ships in a bottle.  They did not dare open the bottle to sail out to fight because the Russian commandos were armed with tactical and nuclear weapons.  To open the blast-proof entrance doors would be suicide.     On April 5, just two days after South Georgia Island was seized, some 40 naval ships began moving out of British ports.  The same day Lord Carrington was sacked as Foreign Minister.  He was forced to resign, my friends, because he had assisted the Rockefeller attack plan by downplaying the Argentine attack preparations.     That same day, April 5, New Zealand, the home of the other secret naval fleet, broke diplomatic relations with Argentina.  The two hidden New Zealand facilities had been placed on \\\"Red Alert.\\\"  As a precautionary measure, all submarines at the twin base were ordered to sea.  Several surface ships were already at sea undergoing \\\"sea trials\\\", but that still left seven (7) major ships inside the hidden twin naval base including one of the nuclear aircraft carriers I mentioned earlier.     On that busy day of April 5, Argentina's Foreign Minister, Costa Mendez, was at the United Nations in New York.  He was alarmed by the deployment of such a large part of the Royal Navy.  Costa Mendez hurried here to Washington to seek reassurances from certain officials.  He got them!     For the next two weeks or so the news was filled with stories about the allegedly slow movement of the British fleet while negotiations went on.  That, my friends, was only a cover story.  The Royal Navy was actually joining up and moving as rapidly as possible toward South Georgia Island.  If the task force arrived in time to save the secret base, a major battle was likely.  The official stories about \\\"slow movement\\\" of the British armada were intended to give a cushion of time for that battle.  If need be, the fleet would have several days to retake South Georgia Island, then it could move on to arrive near the Falklands on the announced schedule.  In this way the crucial importance of South Georgia Island would be hidden and the big secret preserved.     It was initially expected that advance elements of the British fleet would reach the vicinity of South Georgia Island within two weeks.  That would have been soon enough to attack the joint Rockefeller-Russian commando team and stop the drilling before it was completed.  But Russian Cosmospheres and submarines made a shambles of the plan.     Key advance elements of the South Georgia attack contingent left Ascension Island early April 14, two days before it was announced officially.  Shortly after they did so, they ran into trouble.  Russian Cosmospheres and attack submarines closed in on a single ship which was critical to the planned counterassault on South Georgia Island.  The Cosmospheres bombarded the bridge and combat information center of the ship with neutron radiation.  In moments the ship was without any command, its communications and radar silenced.  Then a Russian \\\"sub\\\" closed in and quickly finished off this key British ship with torpedoes.  It broke apart with secondary explosions and sank rapidly.  So far as is known, there were no survivors.     This unexpected shock in the mid-Atlantic produced two results, both important:  First, it caused a slowdown in the race toward the South Atlantic by the British armada.  The task force had to be regrouped into a configuration better suited for an enroute defense, but that cost valuable time.  Public announcements from London about the progress of the fleet reflected this slowdown.  The timetable for arrival on battle stations near the Falklands started stretching out longer and longer.  All this bought extra time for the joint commando team on South Georgia Island.  The drilling continued.  The other result of the sinking was equally important.  Word was flashed to the South Pacific Stealth navy to prepare for possible action.  It was obvious that the Russian Navy was getting involved in the Atlantic, which meant that the Royal Navy could be in big trouble.  During the dead of night, early April 15, the seven Stealth ships put to sea from their twin secret bases in southern New Zealand.  They deployed to a secret operational headquarters area in the Antipodes Islands, 450 miles southeast of New Zealand.  Their electromagnetic shields were operating to provide protection from attack.  These shields make it impossible to communicate with the outside world or even to see it, as I explained last month; but once they arrived at the Antipodes, the Stealth ships hooked up to buoys equipped with shielded communication cables to the Island headquarters.  The Antipodes headquarters, in turn, was in constant touch with the South Georgia base by way of a transoceanic cable around the tip of South America.  The deployment of the available ships of the South Pacific Stealth fleet was exactly what the joint Rockefeller-Russian planners had hoped for.  The ships had been flushed out from their essentially invulnerable hiding place in New Zealand!     The British ship's sinking of April 14 was also followed by other events.  On April 15 the Argentine Navy started moving out of port.  The same day, Alexander Haig arrived again in Buenos Aires.  Supposedly he was there as a diplomat, but in reality he was there as a General, dealing with Generals.  Haig is the top Governmental operative of the Rockefeller cartel, as I have revealed in the past.  He was making sure that the Argentines did not get cold feet and back down at that critical moment.  Four days later, April 19, Haig left for Washington.  As he boarded his plane, Haig somberly told reporters, \\\"Time is running out.\\\"  And so it was, my friends, for the secret South Georgia base.     The very next day, April 20, the drill broke through into the hollowed-out cavern of the naval base.  Bolshevik military analysts in London had not expected that it could be completed until at least the following weekend.  The British fleet was still out of range.     The weapon which the commando team inserted down through the long hole was a small, compact Russian neutron bomb.  When it was detonated inside the confines of the huge artificial cave, the effects were devastating.  The intense radiation instantly killed everyone inside the base.  Also the heat and blast effects of the bomb are believed to have damaged all the ships inside sufficiently to badly disable them.     Meanwhile, Russian Cosmospheres and submarines were converging on the Stealth ships which were near the Antipodes Islands awaiting orders.  From a distance, the ships were invisible to the eye due to their protective shields, which also protect against beam-weapon attack; but they were sitting ducks for the tactics which the Russians employed.     Floating overhead, the Cosmospheres located the seven ships using their Psychoenergetic Range-Finding equipment known as PRF.  As I have reported in the past, there is no method known by which PRF can be jammed.  The Cosmospheres radioed the exact locations of the ships to the attack submarines.  The \\\"subs\\\" were armed with special non-homing, non-nuclear torpedoes designed to explode on impact.  More sophisticated torpedoes would have been thrown off course or detonated prematurely by the protective shield of each ship; but these simple torpedoes just cruise right through each invisibility field to strike the ship and explode.  Within 15 minutes after the attack began, all seven Bolshevik Stealth ships were on their way to the bottom, and with them went their Bolshevik Commanders and mercenary crews collected from around the world.     The South Pacific action took place just after sunset local time.  The time here in Washington was around 2:00 P.M. April 23.  That evening Secretary of State Haig was seen briefly in public with the new British Foreign Minister, Francis Pym.  Pym was wearing the artificial pseudo-smile which diplomats are taught always to display in public.  But not Haig.  Haig was grinning from ear to ear, and no wonder.  The joint Rockefeller-Russian military operation had been a brilliant success.  The secret Bolshevik South Atlantic fleet had been virtually wiped out, bottled up inside South Georgia Island; and the South Pacific fleet, while not totally wiped out, had been badly crippled.  By working together, the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians had won the secret naval war of the Southern Hemisphere.  Topic #3--As I say these words, news reports give the impression that war is about to erupt in the South Atlantic, but the real war in the Southern Hemisphere is already over.  What we are watching now is the beginning of its bloody aftermath.  That aftermath is the battle for the Falkland Islands.  They have been promised to Argentina as a reward for her role in the secret war.     At this moment the Bolsheviks here in Washington are pressing for a public announcement that the United States will side with Britain.  As soon as that takes place, military action will heat up fast around the Falklands.  Britain has no choice but to fight.  She has already suffered casualties which cannot be explained without a public battle; but by fighting, the Bolsheviks in Britain are running the risk of a humiliating and tragic defeat for the Royal Navy.     Meanwhile, the Rockefeller strategists here are now concentrating on a fast-building, anti-nuclear-war campaign.  On all sides now we are hearing about the so-called \\\"nuclear freeze movement.\\\"  There are documentaries, articles, publicity of all kinds to sensitize us to the terrors of nuclear war.  In recent months, there have even been referenda popping up on election ballots dealing with the nuclear war issue.  Medical doctors are banding together to warn the public about what would happen if there were a nuclear war.     We are being told that all this is just popping up spontaneously.  We are now 37 years into the nuclear age and nothing like this has ever gained so much momentum before, yet now we are supposed to believe that millions of Americans have spontaneously gotten the same ideas at the same time.  If you believe that, my friends, I give up.  Movements like this never, and I mean never, develop without leadership, organization, and money--and plenty of it.     What we are watching is the Rockefeller public relations machine at work.  As I've explained in the past, the Rockefeller cartel cannot afford to let a nuclear war take place.  If it does, they will lose everything because they are not in a position to control it.  Instead, the deadly enemies of the Rockefeller cartel, the Bolsheviks here, will win out if there is a war; and so the Rockefeller faction is now doing everything in its power to prevent a nuclear war.     The present anti-nuclear-war orientation of the Rockefeller cartel creates certain temporary common interests between them and Russia; but as Russia's new rulers know very well, this does not spring from any great moral perspective on the part of the Rockefeller group.  It's purely a matter of practical necessity right now for the Rockefellers.     The Russians regard the United States as a house divided, and they are exploiting that division by working in careful ways with the Rockefellers.  Their first priority is to rid the world of the deadly Bolshevik menace of all-out, even suicidal, nuclear war; but once that is done, they know that there will be a day of reckoning with the Rockefeller cartel some day.     The Rockefeller group is working toward a definite objective with their new anti-nuclear-war propaganda.  That objective is renewed power--and power that moves them closer to their old dream of WORLD GOVERNMENT.  The Bolsheviks here have unwittingly provided fertile ground for the powerful new Rockefeller antiwar campaign.  Under Bolshevik control, the so-called Reagan Administration has become so hawkish that it's scaring people.  The Rockefeller antiwar campaign is designed to capitalize on that latent fear as a tool of power.     These days the smell of war is in the air.  The Falklands crisis is helping to make that more intense.  The Rockefeller propaganda machine is now paving the way for the argument that surrender of sovereignty is the only way to avoid war.  A new super-United Nations of sorts is now in the works to fill the bill.  It will have teeth!  As presently envisioned, the new organization will be based in Geneva, Switzerland.  The working name, though this may be changed, is the \\\"World Nonproliferation Council.\\\"  The plan is to bring it into being as the outgrowth of nuclear nonproliferation treaties, but its true purpose will be to use fear--the fear of war--to control us all.                         LAST MINUTE SUMMARY     Now it's time for my Last Minute Summary.  In this AUDIO LETTER I have reported on the reasons behind the so-called Falkland Islands crisis.  The crisis erupted because of secret Bolshevik-controlled naval installations in the Southern Hemisphere.  These have been attacked by joint action of the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians in an attempt to slow down the nuclear-war timetable.  The attacks were successful, but the results remain to be seen.  One result, though, is that the Royal Navy has now been drawn into a trap.  Britain's Waterloo at sea may well be at hand.     My friends, two factions are struggling for control over our United States--the Rockefeller cartel and the Bolsheviks.  They differ in style but both seek to control us through fear.  If we are ever to rise above their trickery, it must be through the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, our only hope.  As the Scripture tells us, our Lord \\\"...has not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, of love, and of a sound mind.\\\"  We must learn to wage peace.  As our Lord declared long ago, \\\"Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called sons of God.\\\"\",\" That's nothing.  They wouldn't let the British buy Inmos Transputer systems because of security concerns.  And we designed the damn things! \",\"  Or, _documentation_ for the program ;-).  A lot of shareware out there is  very similar in the approach - send in your money, and you get  documentation, and a free upgrade to the latest version.  Perhaps even  support of some small degree.  Whatever you want to offer that is \\\"better\\\"  than the circulating version.   Figure about 50%, as I have seen.   It doesn't really hurt legit users.

The company hopes this single-stage rocket technology demonstrator will be the first step towards a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) rocket ship.          The white conical vehicle was scheduled to go to the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico this week.  Flight tests will start in mid-June.          Although there wasn't a cloud in the noonday sky, the forecast for SSTO research remains cloudy.  The SDI Organization -- which paid $60 million for the DC-X -- can't itself afford to fund full development of a follow-on vehicle.  To get the necessary hundreds of millions required for a sub-orbital DC-XA, SDIO is passing a tin cup among its sister government agencies.          SDIO originally funded SSTO research as a way to cut the costs for orbital deployments of space-based sensors and weapns.  However, recent changes in SDI's political marching orders and budget cuts have made SSTO less of a priority.  Today, the agency is more interested in using DC-X as a step towards a low-cost, reusable sounding rocket.          SDIO has already done 50 briefings to other government agencies, said Col.  Simon \\\"Pete\\\" Worden, SDIO's deputy for technology.  But Worden declined to say how much the agencies would have to pony up for the program. \\\"I didn't make colonel by telling my contractors how much money I have available to spend,\\\" he quipped at a press conference at McDonnell Douglas Astronautics headquarters.          While SDIO has lowered its sights on the program's orbital objective, agency officials hail the DC-X as an example of the \\\"better, faster, cheaper\\\" approach to hardware development.  The agency believes this philosophy can produce breakthroughs that \\\"leapfrog\\\" ahead of evolutionary technology developments.          Worden said the DC-X illustrates how a \\\"build a little, test a little\\\" approach can produce results on time and within budget.  He said the program -- which went from concept to hardware in around 18 months -- showed how today's engineers could move beyond the \\\"miracles of our parents' time.\\\"          \\\"The key is management,\\\" Worden said. \\\"SDIO had a very light hand on this project.  We had only one overworked major, Jess Sponable.\\\"          Although the next phase may involve more agencies, Worden said lean management and a sense of government-industry partnership will be crucial. \\\"It's essential we do not end up with a large management structure where the price goes up exponentially.\\\"          SDIO's approach also won praise from two California members of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee. \\\"This is the direction we're going to have to go,\\\" said Rep.  George Brown, the committee's Democratic chairman. \\\"Programs that stretch aout 10 to 15 years aren't sustainable....NASA hasn't learned it yet.  SDIO has.\\\"          Rep.  Dana Rohrbacher, Brown's Republican colleague, went further. Joking that \\\"a shrimp is a fish designed by a NASA design team,\\\" Rohrbacher doubted that the program ever would have been completed if it were left to the civil space agency.          Rohrbacher, whose Orange County district includes McDonnell Douglas, also criticized NASA-Air Force work on conventional, multi-staged rockets as placing new casings around old missile technology. \\\"Let's not build fancy ammunition with capsules on top.  Let's build a spaceship!\\\"           Although Rohrbacher praised SDIO's sponsorship, he said the private sector needs to take the lead in developing SSTO technology.          McDonnell Douglas, which faces very uncertain prospects with its C-17 transport and Space Station Freedom programs, were more cautious about a large private secotro commitment. \\\"On very large ventures, companies put in seed money,\\\" said Charles Ordahl, McDonnell Douglas' senior vice president for space systems. \\\"You need strong government investments.\\\"          While the government and industry continue to differ on funding for the DC-XA, they agree on continuing an incremental approach to development.  Citing corporate history, they liken the process to Douglas Aircraft's DC aircraft.  Just as two earlier aircraft paved the way for the DC-3 transport, a gradual evolution in single-stage rocketry could eventually lead to an orbital Delta Clipper (DC-1).          Flight tests this summer at White Sands will \\\"expand the envelope\\\" of performance, with successive tests increasing speed and altitude.  The first tests will reach 600 feet and demonstrate hovering, verticle take-off and landing.  The second series will send the unmanned DC-X up to 5,000 feet.  The third and final series will take the craft up to 20,000 feet.          Maneuvers will become more complex on third phase.  The final tests will include a \\\"pitch-over\\\" manever that rotates the vehicle back into a bottom-down configuration for a soft, four-legged landing.          The flight test series will be supervised by Charles \\\"Pete\\\" Conrad, who performed similar maneuvers on the Apollo 12 moon landing. Now a McDonnell Douglas vice president, Conrad paised the vehicles aircraft-like approach to operations.  Features include automated check-out and access panels for easy maintainance.          If the program moves to the next stage, engine technology will become a key consideration.  This engine would have more thrust than the Pratt & Whitney RL10A-5 engines used on the DC-X.  Each motor uses liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants to generate up to 14,760 pounds of thrust          Based on the engine used in Centaur upper stages, the A-5 model has a thrust champer designed for sea level operation and three-to-on throttling capability.  It also is designed for repeat firings and rapid turnaround.          Worden said future single-stage rockets could employ tri-propellant engine technology developed in the former Soviet Union. The resulting engines could burn a dense hydrocarbon fuel at takeoff and then switch to liquid hydrogen at higher altitudes.\",\"I was wondering if it's possible to change the window icons OLWM uses for things like xterm.

Genesis 15:6, \\\"And he (Abram) believed the LORD; and He reckoned    it to him as righteousness\\\".     I don't find anywhere that God restricts heaven to particular    ethnic groups or religious denominations or any other category    that we humans like to drop people into. But He does REQUIRE    that we believe and trust Him. In Hebrews it says that God spoke    of old by the prophets (the old testament), but in these last days    he has spoken to us by His son Jesus Christ. And we learn of    Him through the pages of the New Testament. The Bible tells us    what we need to believe. For those who have never heard, I leave    them in God's capable care, He will make himself known as he    desires. It behooves each one of us to act upon the knowledge    we have.

After a nice, long rant about how people need to take personal responsibility for their economic and social lives, all of a sudden 1960's radicals (such as me, I guess) are responsible for poor people's lifestyles?  Tell me how that works--or do you think that poor people are just too dumb to think for themselves?

PDT                  Q   I had two questions for both Presidents, so you  could probably answer for Boris, too.  (Laughter.)              THE PRESIDENT:  I'll give you my answer, then I'll  give you Yeltsin's answer.  (Laughter.)              Q   The first is that this is the meeting of the  Presidents, so the money that's being promised is government  money, and naturally it's going to be distributed through the  government.  But you've indicated that three-quarters are going  to be going to businesses.  So the question is how the Russian  businesses themselves are going to be consulted, if ever?  What  are the priorities, because there are several association of  Russian businessmen existing already, so will they be invited to  participate in setting up priorities for investment?                This is the first.  And second, to you.  We know  that polls, public polls in America do not show that Americans  are very enthusiastic about giving this aid.  Like Newsweek polls  say that about 75 percent don't approve it, and New York Times  published that 52 percent support if it just prevents civil war;  42 percent if it fosters democratic reform; and only 29 percent  if it just personally supports Yeltsin.  How are you going to  sort of handle this problem that Americans themselves are not  very enthusiastic?  Thank you.              Q   I have a question, I'm sorry -- is there going  to be a translation of everything into Russian?  No, just the  answers.  Just the answers.  Okay.              THE PRESIDENT:  The answer to the first question is,  it depends on what kind of aid we're discussing.  For example,  the funds that will be set up for financing new businesses will  obviously go to those businesses who apply and who seem to be  good risks and make the application.  The privatization fund will  be used to support the privatization of existing public  enterprises.  Then there are some other general funds in the  Democracy Corps and other things which people in Russia will have  some influence over the distribution of.                With regard to your second question, let me say that  I would think that there would be people in both countries who  would not feel too warmly toward simply the American government  giving money to the Russian government.  There's opposition to  that in Russia.  And in our country, throughout our whole history  there has been an opposition to foreign aid of all kinds.  That  is, this has nothing to do with Russia.  If you look at the whole  history of America, any kind of aid program has always been  unpopular.                What I have tried to tell the American people is, is  this is not an aid program, this is an investment program; that  this is an investment in our future.  We spent $4 trillion -- trillion -- on armaments on soldiers and other investments  because of the Cold War.  Now, with a democratic government in  Russia, with the newly independent states, the remainder of them  working on a democracy and struggling to get their economies  going, it seems to me very much in our interest to make it  possible to do whatever we can for democracy to survive, for the  economy of Russia to grow because of the potential for trade and  investment there, and for us to continue the effort to reduce  nuclear weapons and other elements of hostility on both sides, on  our side and on the Russian side.                So I don't see this as an aid program; this is an  investment for the United States.  This is very much in the  interest of the United States.  The things I announced today, the  second stage of the program, which I hope to put together next  week, in my view are things that are good for my country and for  the taxpayers and workers of my country.                Russia is a very great nation that needs some  partnership now, some common endeavor with other people who share  her goals.  But it would be a great mistake for anyone to view  this as some sort of just a charity or an aid issue.  That's not  what it is, it's an investment for America and it's a wonderful  investment.                Like all investments, there is some risk.  But  there's far less risk with a far greater potential of return than  the $4 trillion we spent looking at each other across the barrier  of the Cold War.              Q   Mr. President, first of all thank you very  much, indeed, for coming here and talking to us.  In the memory  of the living correspondents, this is the first time an American  President is doing this to the Russian press corps, so it's kind  of a very measured breakthrough.                I have two questions.  One, in your introductory  remarks of the other press conference, you mentioned in brief  that you discussed the START II and START I issues.  Could you  tell us:  Did you reach an agreement with President Yeltsin as to  what might be done in order to have Ukraine join the ratification  of START I and the NPT regime?  And my second question is, how  confident you are that the United States Congress would be eager  to support you in lifting Jackson-Vanik and other restrictions  inherited from the Cold War?                PRESIDENT CLINTON:  First, we discussed the issue of  Ukraine with regard to START I and NPT, and generally, with  regard to the need to proceed to have the other independent  states all be non-nuclear; but also to have the United States  develop strong relationships with them.  We know that one thing  that we could do that would increase, I think, the willingness of  the Ukraine to support this direction is to successfully conclude  our own negotiations on highly enriched uranium, because that  would provide not only an important economic opportunity for  Russia, but also for Ukraine, and it would show some reaching out  on our part.  But we agreed that basically the people who signed  off on the Lisbon Protocol have got to honor what they did, and  we agreed to continue to press that.              I, myself, have spent a good deal of time trying to  reassure Ukraine's leaders, specifically the President and the  Foreign Minister, that I want strong ties with Ukraine, that the  United States very much wants a good relationship with Ukraine,  but that, in order to do what we need to do together to  strengthen the economy of Ukraine and to have the United States  be fully supportive, the commitment to ratify START I and to join  the NPT regime is critical.              What was the second question?                THE PRESIDENT:  With regard to Jackson-Vanik and  COCOM, I would make two points:  First, I have agreed with the  Republican and Democratic leaders in the Congress that we will,  as soon as I return, have a list of all the legislative and other  restrictions, some of them are regulatory in nature, imposed on  relations between the United States and Russia, that are legacies  of the Cold War.  And we will see whether they're -- how many of  them we could agree to do away with right now, at least among the  leadership of the Congress.              With regard to Jackson-Vanik, I think there will be  an openness to change the law if the Congress is convinced there  are, in fact, no more refusniks, no more people who wish to  emigrate who are not being allowed to.  If the fact is that there  is no one there who would have been -- who the law was designed  to affect, then I think that the desire to keep the law will be  much less.              With regard to COCOM, my guess is, and it's nothing  more than a guess, that the leadership of Congress and indeed my  own advisers, might prefer to see some sort of phased movement  out of the COCOM regime.  But I think they would be willing to  begin it in the fairly near future.              Q   Mr. Clinton, when I read your speech in  Annapolis, I got the impression that you have a completely  different personal -- and I stress that -- personal, not  political approach towards Russia, compared to the approach of  Mr. Bush.  Could you formulate in a few words, what is the  difference between you as a personality and your approach -- the  difference between your approach to Russia and the approach of  Mr. Bush?  And who made you -- why did you cite Akhmatova in the  last part of your speech?              THE PRESIDENT:  Let me say, first, I do not wish to  compare myself with President Bush or anyone else.  I can't say  what was in his heart about Russia.  I can say that since I was a  boy, I have been personally fascinated with the history, the  music and the culture, and the literature of Russia.  I have been  thrilled by Russian music since I was a serious student of music  for more than 30 years now.  I have read major Russian novelists  and many of your poets and followed your ballet and tried to know  as much as I could about your history.                And I went to the Soviet Union -- but it was then  the Soviet Union -- you may know it was a big issue in the last  presidential campaign that I spent the first week of 1970 alone  in Moscow and did not return again until three days before Mr.  Yeltsin was elected President.  But all that time I was away, I  was following events there very closely and hoping for the day  when we could be genuine partners.  So I have always had a  personal feeling about Russia.                I remember, for example -- a lot of you know I like  music very much.  One of the most moving experiences for me as a  musician was when Leonard Bernstein took the New York  Philharmonic to Moscow and played Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony  to the Russians.  And he played the last movement more rapidly  than anyone had ever played it before because it was technically  so difficult.  That is something I followed very closely when it  occurred.                These are things that have always had a big impact  on my life.  And I had just always hoped that someday, if I ever  had the chance to, I could play a role in seeing our two  countries become closer partners.  (Applause.)

Days ago people doubted that ms-windows is not a real OS. I can see why they have such question. Ms-windows confuses many people. Microsoft simulated Mac, but it did a lousy job.  For example:  (1) You can not create hierarchy groups. There is no way to create a group     in a group. (If you know how, please tell me.) (2) Too many system parameters to take care of.  (3) uncomplete documentation. It's not easy to find the reason why causes     an unpredictable error. (4) Group deleting/file deleting     After deleting a group, users have to use file manager to delete files.     But if users forget to delete some related files, the disk will be full     of nonsense files. (5) share problem     Once you create two windows doing compilation and editing in some     language (w/o good editor), there will be a sharing problem. You just     can not open or save the program if it is loaded. It makes sense to     prevent from saving, but not opening.  Microsoft try to compromise between DOS and windows, but they just make  ms-windows a graphical DOS with capacity doing mutiple DOS jobs;  the worst thing is they complicate the environment. The orginal purpose of ms-windows should be to simplify the environment, and make PC easier  to use.      It's by no means easy to satisfy everybody, but if Microsoft want to keep their reputations, they should evaluate the user interface more carefully before products distribute.

If a player does well at AA and then does not improve at AAA, isn't that a sign that maybe he doesn't belong in the bigs?  Now, Keith Mitchell.  As I recall (no stat books handy - surprise!) he jumped from AA to Atlanta in 1991.  He did so well that he was returned to the minors, where he didn't do very well at all.  Now his career is in jeopardy.  So how does he fit in with your  point.  Good MLE's in AA.  Moved him right to the big club.  Now he's one step away from being traded or moved out of baseball.

But not all of them did, which prompted an official renaming of the disease to Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (this renaming took place in the Annals of Internal Medicine, Jan. 1988, I believe). Now it's also called Chronic Fatigue and Immune Dysfunction Syndrome (CFIDS), since it seems clear that some sort of immune disregulation is causing the probs.  Astonishly, there are still docs who tell people with massively swollen glands, recurrent fevers and nightsweats, etc., that there's nothing wrong with them. This is not the same thing as saying that the syndrome may have a (at least partly) psychological cause. The disagreement among people whose thoughts are worth considering centers on just what the cause is. No one knows, but theories include: psychological stress, some sort of virus (a retrovirus, say most -- maybe one of the newly discovered herpes viruses), environmental toxins, bacteria (and, yes, candida), genes, (and/)or some combo of these.  There's no outright cure at the moment, but different docs try different things, some of which seem to help.  Massive amounts of info on the condition are available these days.

President Clinton's Remarks On Waco With Q/A  To: National Desk  Contact: White House Office of the Press Secretary, 202-456-2100     WASHINGTON, April 20 /U.S. Newswire/ -- Following are remarks by President Clinton in a question and answer session with the press (Part 2 of 2):       Go ahead, Sarah.       Q  There are two questions I want to ask you.  The first is, I think that they knew very well that the children did not have gas masks while the adults did, so the children had no chance because this gas was very -- she said it was not lethal, but it was very dangerous to the children and they could not have survived without gas masks.  And on February 28th -- let's go back -- didn't those people have a right to practice their religion?       THE PRESIDENT:  They were not just practicing their religion, they were -- the Treasury Department believed that they had violated federal laws, any number of them.       Q  What federal laws --       THE PRESIDENT:  Let me go back and answer -- I can't answer the question about the gas masks, except to tell you that the whole purpose of using the tear gas was that it had been tested; they were convinced that it wouldn't kill either a child or an adult but it would force anybody that breathed it to run outside.  And one of the things that I've heard -- I don't want to get into the details of this because I don't know -- but one of the things that they were speculating about today was that the wind was blowing so fast that the windows might have been opened and some of the gas might have escaped and that may be why it didn't have the desired effect.       They also knew, Sarah, that there was an underground compound -- a bus buried underground where the children could be sent.  And they were -- I think they were hoping very much that if the children were not released immediately outside that the humane thing would be done and that the children would be sent someplace where they could be protected.       In terms of the gas masks themselves, I learned yesterday -- I did not ask this fact question before -- that the gas was supposed to stay active in the compound longer than the gas masks themselves were to work.  So that it was thought that even if they all had gas masks, that eventually the gas would force them out in a nonviolent, nonshooting circumstance.       MS. MYERS:  Last question.       Q  Mr. President, why are you still saying that --       Q  Could you tell us whether or not you ever asked Janet Reno about the possibility of a mass suicide?  And when you learned about the actual fire and explosion what went through your mind during those horrendous moments?       THE PRESIDENT:  What I asked Janet Reno is if they had considered all the worse things that could happen.  And she said -- and, of course, the whole issue of suicide had been raised in the public -- he had -- that had been debated anyway.  And she said that the people who were most knowledgeable  about these kinds of issues concluded that there was no greater risk of that now than there would be tomorrow or the next day or the day after that or at anytime in the future.  That was the judgment they made.  Whether they were right or wrong, of course, we will never know.       What happened when I saw the fire, when I saw the building burning?  I was sick.  I felt terrible.  And my immediate concern was whether the children had gotten out and whether they were escaping or whether they were inside, trying to burn themselves up. That's the first thing I wanted to know.       Thank you.       Q  Mr. President, why are you still saying it was a Janet Reno decision?  Isn't it, in the end, your decision?       THE PRESIDENT:  Well, what I'm saying is that I didn't have a four- or five-hour, detailed briefing from the FBI.  I didn't go over every strategic part of it.  It is a decision for which I take responsibility.  I'm the President of the United States and I signed off on the general decision and giving her the authority to make the last call.  When I talked to her on Sunday, some time had elapsed.  She might have made a decision to change her mind.  I said, if you decide to go forward with this tomorrow, I will support you. And I do support her.       She is not ultimately responsible to the American people; I am.  But I think she has conducted her duties in an appropriate fashion and she has dealt with this situation I think as well as she could have.       Thank you.

For example, is this a public key system or a private key system? If the latter, then I don't see how the system could work (given that the keys are tied to the device and not the person).  Further, the escrowed 80-bit keys are split into two 40-bit chunks. I would guess that the availability of one of these 40-bit chunks and a reasonable key-search machine, would allow you to read the traffic. I'm not suggesting that this is a deliberate weakness of the system, but it does make you think. Of course, this is easily fixable by  giving out two 80-bit chunks which could be x-ored to generate the  real 80-bit key.\",\"Hello,  I am not sure if this is the right conference to ask this question, however, Here I go..

Every phone comes with a built in chip and the government has the key to every phone call.  I go and buy a phone and dutifully register the key.   What's to prevent me from swapping phones with a friend or  buying a used phone at a garage sale? Whooa. The secret registered keys just became unsynchronized. When the government comes  to listen in, they only receive gobbledly-gook because the  secret key registered under my name isn't the right one.   That leads me to conjecture that:  1) The system isn't that secure. There are just two master keys that work for all the phones in the country. The part about registering your keys is just bogus.   or   2) The system is vulnerable to simple phone swapping attacks like this.

The training course will discuss the applications of satellite data concerning natural resources, renewable energy and the environment.  The training course, organised for the benefit of francophone African experts, will be hosted by ESRIN, the European Space Agency's establishment in Frascati, which is responsible for coordination with the users of data from ESA's remote sensing satellite. Twenty-four experts in the field of remote sensing, selected from 19 francophone countries from northern, western and central Africa, and three regional African centres, will attend the two-week session. The course will focus on remote sensing techniques and data applications, particularly ERS-1 data.  The ERS-1 satellite, developed by ESA and launched in 1991 with the European Ariane launcher, carries an advanced radar instrument and is the first in a series of radar remote sensing missions that will ensure availability of data beyond the year 2000. The aim of the training course is to increase the potential of experts using the practical applications of radar remote sensing systems to natural resources, renewable energy and the environment, with particular emphasis on applications to geology and mineral prospecting, oceanography and near- coastal areas, agriculture, forestry and meteorology.  The education and practical training programme was developed jointly by the United Nations and ESA. The facilities and the technical support, as well as lecturers and information documents for the training course, will be provided by the Agency. Lecturers at the training course will include high-level experts from other European and African organisations active in remote sensing applications. Funds for the training course are being provided by the United Nations    Trust Fund for New and Renewable Sources of Energy; the primary contributor to that Fund is the Government of Italy.\",\"  Very sensible.     Must you rave so? Fascist x-Soviet Armenian Government engaged in  disgusting cowardly massacres of Azeri women and children. I am really sorry if that fact bothers you.    More ridicule, I take it? Still not addressing the original points made.   Then what seems to be the problem? Did you ever read newspaper at all?   \\\"PAINFUL SEARCH ..\\\"  THE GRUESOME extent of February's killings of Azeris by Armenians in the town  of Hojali is at last emerging  in Azerbaijan - about 600 men,  women and  children dead  in the  worst outrage  of the four-year war over Nagorny Karabakh.  The figure  is drawn  from Azeri investigators,  Hojali officials and casualty lists published in the Baku press. Diplomats and aid workers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates.  The 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one of the last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full control of Nagorny Karabakh,  the subject of a new  round of negotiations in Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fighting retreat and  a massacre, but  investigators say that most  of the dead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was first suppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku. Later  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-stricken Azerbaijan's wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2,000 dead.  The State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov,  the cheif investigator of a 15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  \\\"Hojali Disaster\\\", said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum on preliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman Memmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed in the Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and more than 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700 dead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswoman of the Azeri Ministry of Defence.  FranCois Zen  Ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the International Red Cross  in Baku, said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of Agdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosque from  Hojali, most  of  them  civilians. \\\"We  did  not count  the bodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy,\\\" Mr Zen Ruffinen said. \\\"We have some idea since we gave the body bags and products to wash the dead.\\\"  Mr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the number of  dead in the  massacre. \\\"Don't  get worked up.  It will take  several months  to  get a  final  figure,\\\" the  43-year-old lawyer said at his small office.  Mr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years to reach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714 wounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist uprising in Baku in January 1990.  Those  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  power three weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly what  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70 miles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians.  Officially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, being the  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the republic's forensic department. \\\"This  is just a small percentage of the dead,\\\" said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic's chief forensic scientist. \\\"They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the chaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury our dead within 24 hours.\\\"  Of these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14 years old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 and axes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highland snows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs of deliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penises cut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov's report. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those believed to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said.  Files  from  Mr  Rasulov's  investigative  commission  are  still disorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, six policemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, the names of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. The most heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so far comes  from Towfiq  Manafov,  an Azeri  investigator  who took  a helicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  27 February.  \\\"There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to count properly: 470-500  in Hojali, 650-700 people  by the stream and the road and 85-100  visible around Nakhchivanik village,\\\" Mr Manafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter pilot.  \\\"People waved up  to us for help. We saw  three dead children and one  two-year-old alive  by  one  dead woman.  The  live one  was pulling at her arm for the mother to get up. We tried to land but Armenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had to return.\\\"  There  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  in circulation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last few months and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in Hojali at the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages taken over by Armenian forces.  THE INDEPENDENT, London, 12/6/'92   HEROES WHO FOUGHT ON AMID THE BODIES  AREF  SADIKOV sat  quietly  in the  shade of  a  cafe-bar on  the Caspian Sea  esplanade of Baku and  showed a line of  stitches in his trousers, torn  by an Armenian bullet as he  fled the town of Hojali just over three months ago, writes Hugh Pope.  \\\"I'm still  wearing the same  clothes, I don't have  any others,\\\" the  51-year-old carpenter  said,  beginning his  account of  the Hojali disaster. \\\"I was wounded in five places, but I am lucky to be alive.\\\"  Mr Sadikov and  his wife were short of  food, without electricity for more than a month, and cut off from helicopter flights for 12 days. They  sensed the  Armenian noose was tightening  around the 2,000 to  3,000 people left in  the straggling Azeri town  on the edge of Karabakh.  \\\"At about 11pm  a bombardment started such as we  had never heard before,  eight  or  nine   kinds  of  weapons,  artillery,  heavy machine-guns, the lot,\\\" Mr Sadikov said.  Soon neighbours were  pouring down the street  from the direction of  the  attack. Some  huddled  in  shelters but  others  started fleeing the town,  down a hill, through a stream  and through the snow into a forest on the other side.  To escape, the  townspeople had to reach the Azeri  town of Agdam about 15  miles away. They  thought they  were going to  make it, until at  about dawn  they reached a  bottleneck between  the two Armenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak.  \\\"None of my group was hurt up to then ... Then we were spotted by a  car on  the road,  and the  Armenian outposts  started opening fire,\\\" Mr Sadikov said.  Azeri militiamen fighting their way  out of Hojali rushed forward to force  open a  corridor for the  civilians, but  their efforts were mostly  in vain.  Mr Sadikov  said only  10 people  from his group of  80 made it  through, including his wife  and militiaman son.  Seven  of  his  immediate  relations  died,  including  his 67-year-old elder brother.  \\\"I only had time to reach down  and cover his face with his hat,\\\" he said, pulling his own big  flat Turkish cap over his eyes. \\\"We have never got any of the bodies back.\\\"  The first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire. One hero  of the  evacuation, Alif  Hajief, was  shot dead  as he struggled to change  a magazine while covering  the third group's crossing, Mr Sadikov said.  Another hero,  Elman Memmedov, the  mayor of Hojali, said  he and several others  spent the whole day  of 26 February in  the bushy hillside, surrounded by  dead bodies as they tried  to keep three Armenian armoured personnel carriers at bay.  As the  survivors staggered the  last mile into Agdam,  there was little comfort  in a town from  which most of the  population was soon to flee.  \\\"The night  after we reached  the town  there was a  big Armenian rocket attack. Some people just  kept going,\\\" Mr Sadikov said. \\\"I had to  get to the  hospital for treatment. I  was in a  bad way. They even found a bullet in my sock.\\\"  Victims of  war: An  Azeri woman  mourns her  son, killed  in the Hojali massacre in February  (left).

Thanks a lot \",\" A question for you - can you give me the name of an organization or a philosophy or a political movement, etc., which has never had anything evil done in its name?  You're missing a central teaching of Christianity - man is inherently sinful.  We are saved through faith by grace.  Knowing that, believing that, does not make us without sin.  Furthermore, not all who consider themselves \\\"christians\\\" are (even those who manage to head their own \\\"churches\\\").  \\\"Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.\\\" - Matt. 7:21.   Again, what historical documents do you trust?  Do you think Hannibal crossed the Alps?  How do you know?  How do you know for sure?  What historical documents have stood the scrutiny and the attempts to dis- credit it as well as the Bible has?   Well, it's really a shame you feel this way.  No one can browbeat you into believing, and those who try will probably only succeed in driving you further away.  You need to ask yourself some difficult questions: 1) is there an afterlife, and if so, does man require salvation to attain it.  If the answer is yes, the next question is 2) how does man attain this salvation - can he do it on his own as the eastern religions and certain modern offshoots like the \\\"new age movement\\\" teach or does he require God's help?  3) If the latter, in what form does - indeed, in what form can such help come?  Needless to say, this discussion could take a lifetime, and for some people it did comprise their life's writings, so I am hardly in a position to offer the answers here - merely pointers to what to ask.  Few, of us manage to have an unshaken faith our entire lives (certainly not me). The spritual life is a difficult journey (if you've never read \\\"A Pilgrim's Progress,\\\" I highly recommend this greatest allegory of the english language).   Now I see by your close that one possible source of trouble for you may be a conflict between your politcal beliefs and your religious upbringing.  You wrote that \\\"I (in my own faith) accept and live my life by many if not most of the teachings of christ\\\".  Well, Christ referred to God as \\\"My Father\\\", not \\\"My Mother\\\", and while the \\\"maleness\\\" of God is not the same as the maleness of those of us humans who possess a Y chromosome, it does not honor God to refer to Him as female purely to be trendy, non-discriminatory, or politically correct.  This in no way disparages women (nor is it my intent to do so by my use of the male pronoun to refer to both men and women -  english just does not have a decent neuter set of pronouns).  After all, God chose a woman as his only human partner in bringing Christ into the human population.  Well, I'm not about to launch into a detailed discussion of the role of women in Christianity at 1am with only 6 hours of sleep in the last 63, and for that reason I also apologize for any shortcomings in this article.  I just happened across yours and felt moved to reply.

AT&T obviously knew and participated in the development of the Clipper chip.  This amounts to unfair business practice and gives AT&T an early monopoly on the market [hopefully a non-existant market]. Other companies that compete with AT&T in the cellular market (Motorola, NEC, etc) have grounds to file a complaint over this.   It would seem that the one fact that the government has overlooked in this whole fiasco is the economic standpoint.  As others have mentioned, the most difficulty the Clipper chip faces is an economic one.  Let's face it, the average consumer doesn't care or know that the Clipper is a bad idea.  If there is a perceived need for cellular encryption, then the companies will provide one.  Most likely, a standard will emerge.  But if the Clipper is too expensive (and $25 a chip is way too much) then they will develope their own or buy a cheaper one.

Supposedly only the isopropyl based cleaners actually remove moisture from your fuel tank as they clean your injectors.

Assuming (warning...warning...warning) that you have an otherwise acceptable surface - you can pick an edge, any edge, and traverse the surface enforcing consistency with that edge.        0) pick an edge (p,q), and mark it as \\\"OK\\\"     1) for each face, F, containing this edge (if more than 2, oops)        make sure that all edges in F are consistent (i.e., the Face        should be [(p,q),(q,r),(r,s),(s,t),(t,p)]).  Flip those which        are wrong. Mark all of the edges in F as \\\"OK\\\",        and add them to a queue (check for duplicates, and especially        inconsistencies - don't let the queue have both (p,q) and (q,p)).      2) remove an edge from the queue, and go to 1).  If a *marked* edge is discovered to be inconsistent, then you lose.  If step 1) finds more than one face sharing a particular edge, then you lose.       Otherwise, when done, all of the edges will be consistent.  Which means that all of the surface normals will either point IN or OUT.  Deciding which way is OUT is left as an exercise...   \",\"boards injuring his shoulder and they blotted out the injury report.

Ah, ending discrimination is now fascism.  \",\"From article <1993Apr16.162950.25849@newsgate.sps.mot.com>, by markm@bigfoot.sps.mot.com (Mark Monninger):   A couple of months ago I went to a dealership to test drive a car.  Afterwards, we sat down to discuss prices.  I explained that I wanted a car just like the one I drove, but in a different color.  He said he could get one exactly like I wanted from the dealer network within a day.  We then negotiated a price and signed the deal.  Next day, I get a call.  He explains that they goofed, and they had neglected to take into account a price increase. (The last price increase had occurred over 4 months prior to my visit.)  If I still wanted the car, I would have to fork over another $700.  As an alternative, they would honor the price if I bought the car I test drove (which had been sitting around for  6 months and had a few miles on it). I said goodbye.  This was a good example of how they can lowball you and still cover their butts.  It's too bad more people don't demand honesty or these types of dealers would no longer be in business.    The next dealership I went to was straightforward and honest.  First thing the salesman said was, \\\"Lets's see what you have for dealer cost and work out how much profit I should make.\\\"  The deal went through with no problems.\",\"OK...

This disease is  universally and usually rapidly fatal.  After diagnosis in June 1992, the  tumor was growing rapidly despite radiation and chemotherapy.  The forum  member checked extensively on Dr. Burzynki's track record for this disease.   He spoke to a few patients in complete remission for a few years from  glioblastoma following this treatment and to an NCI oncologist who had  audited other such case histories and found them valid and impressive.   After the forum member's father began Dr. Burzynski's treatment in  September, all subsequent scans performed under the auspices of his  oncologist in Chicago have shown no tumor growth with possible signs of  shrinkage or necrosis.  The patient's oncologist, although telling him he would probably not live  past December 1992, was vehemently opposed to his trying Dr. Burzynski's  treatment.  Since the tumor stopped its rapid growth under Dr. Burzynski's  treatment, she's since changed her attitude toward continuing these  treatments, saying \\\"if it ain't broke, don't fix it.\\\"  Dr. Burzynski is an M.D., Ph.D. with a research background who found a  protein that is at very low serum levels in cancer patients, synthesized it,  and administers it to patients with certain cancer types.

Unfortunately I don't have direct quotes handy...  1) Atheists believe that when they die, they die forever.  2) A god who would condemn those who fail to believe in him to eternal death    is unfair.    I don't see what the problem is!  To Christians, Hell is, by definition,  eternal death--exactly what atheists are expecting when they die.  There's no reason Hell has to be especially awful--to most people, eternal death is bad enough.   Literal interpreters of the Bible will have a problem with this view, since the Bible talks about the fires of Hell and such.  Personally, I don't think that people in Hell will be thrust into flame any more than I expect to Jesus with a double-edged sword issuing from his mouth--I treat both these statements as metaphorical.\",\"  Ermenistan kasiniyor...

I would beg to differ with you here.  The properly-formed conscience can be trusted virtually ALL the time.  I am not so sure, though, about something so materialistic as the human brain.  Does that mass of tissue possess anything trustworthy?  Your observation would probably be valid if we were discussing the \\\"mind\\\" of an animal, but the human being is only half animal, as it were; and half spiritual.   ?At the moment he stops speaking, and people start interpreting, the ?possibility of error appears.  Did he mean that literally or not?  We do ?not have any record that he elaborated on the words.  Was he thinking of ?Tran- or Con- substatiation?   He didn't say.  We interpret this passage ?using our brains; we think and reason and draw conclusions.  But we know ?that our brains are not perfect: our thinking often leads us wrong.  (This ?is something that most of us have direct experience of.  8-)  Now you have hit on the purpose of the Church.  It is by necessity the infallible interpreter of divine revelation.  Without the Church,           Christianity would be nothing more than a bunch of little divisive sects.   ?Unless you are infallible, there are very few things you can be certain ?of.  To the extent that doctrines rely on fallible human thinking, they ?cannot be certain.  This argument of yours regarding the certainty of an observation or a conclusion is not necessarily substantiated by experience.  It reminds me of the theoretical physicist who said that you can never be certain of a measurment because the sensor interferes with the field you are trying to measure.  Now, the experimental physicist will reply that although the measurement can never be made with absolute certainty, he is able to determine the certainty with which the measurement can be made, and this knowledge is often sufficient to render the measurement useful enough to allow evidence of the true condition of the field under observation. Therefore, although our minds are finite and susceptible to error, our competence in arriving at inductive insights gives confidence in our ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true, even in areas not subject to the experimental method.   ?Darren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu ?\\\"If any substantial number of  [ talk.religion.misc ]  readers read some ?

The greatest danger of the escrow database, if it were kept on disk, would be the chance that a complete copy could somehow leak out.  You can design lots of protection, but with enough corruption a complete copy is always possible.   Storing it on paper or something very hard to copy at once may actually make sense.  Or a medium that can't be copied -- for example, something with very slow access times or which leaves a destructive trail if it is even read.  Of course then it's hard to backup.  However, I think the consequences of no backup -- the data is not there when a warrant comes -- are worse than the consequences of a secret backup.
