In one of Jesus' revelation in this century, \\\"...same thing as in the old days.  People refuse to believe my messengers.  Even when I was alive here on earth, they refuse Me.  What more when I am just talking through somebody else?\\\" (paraphrased).  With all the knowledge believers accumulated, He would think that we would be 'enlightened' enough to detect which ones are  'authentic and divine' as opposed to 'evil or man-made'.  These signs, these miracles, are you afraid that they are not from God? That these are the signs we should not open our hearts and mind to for thinking   they are evil? Well, is faith in God evil? Is true peace evil?  Is true love that is divine and pure evil?  Why can't someone accept that God can do what He wants in fulfillment of His   generous love and Jesus' never ending forgiveness to those who turn back to   Him for salvation? Why are we refusing God's messenger of this truth?  The mother to all who are   in Christ? What brings us these:     fears of being shamed by what others will think or say about us?         which, in contrary, could be pleasing to God?     fears of being humbled?     fears of being judged as wrong (wrt mainstream standard of what is right)? Why can't we tolerate non-believers' mockery or ridicule of us for the   sake of peace, love and obedience to God?  The humbling lessons left to us   by martyrs and saints? We'd rather engage in never-ending bickering and disproof of each other's   opinion - looking at each other's mistakes - for the sake of arguments,   instead of having communion in one body with Christ. What makes us go blind to the truth that God is All Powerful and that He can   not be binded by what people wrote and have written about Him in all ages? Why is our faith in God limited?  By all the words and literature we muster? What prevents us from going *beyond* being saved and extend God's rich love   to others who are not?  Why are our eyes not wide open to see that He continuously sees our faith, hope   and love which glorify Him and so He gives us indications of His    acknowledgements with signs/miracles (ordinary/common or divinely inspired)    everywhere?  Isn't that like an atheist/agnostic's view that all these   are just ordinary here on earth and not caused by anything supernatural?  Why then does the Holy Mother comes back to remind us:   \\\"We must really __accept that prayer__ changes the course of things and that   with prayers __even wars can be prevented__.\\\" but then she continues:   \\\"You often have an egotistic attitude.  Dear children, in these days you   have prayed very much, __but your hands have remained empty__.\\\" Why hesitate in proclaiming what needs to be done:   \\\"prayer, conversion, peace, penance, fasting, the Holy Mass, living life   as what the Gospel brings.\\\"? Why not do so?  How?  To the world?   \\\"Start in your family.  Be a good example.  Live the Word.\\\" Why worry if it is going to be of good use to many?   \\\"The fruits, __leave them to the Lord__, do not worry about anything or    anyone but entrust yourself to the Lord.\\\"  Although the Holy Mother does not insist because:   \\\"You are free; I bow before the freedom which God gives you.\\\" but she follows this with:   \\\"You are surprised because I say to you: Decide for God and yet, see how   you have lived this day.\\\" Why does she constantly conveys:   \\\"Take this life toward God in the way as to __experience__ the Lord Himself   in your __behavior__ and __not only__ when you pray\\\" or one time when we    decide that we are saved, or talk/write about God, etc. The Holy Mother warns:   \\\"Satan (the serpent) is always trying to dissuade you to turn you away from   my peace plan and prayer.\\\"  (Rev 12:17, the dragon became angry with the woman   and went off to wage war against the rest of her offsprings, those who keep   God's commandments, and bear witness to Jesus.)  Do you have fear or hate for God's current messenger of true peace, love and   our motherly protector from the anti-Christ? The one who is being apprehensive of communism, wars, famine and other evils   that the serpent brings upon us?  This obedient and blessed new Eve? The mother who warns us so we can be prepared and be strong against Satan? Haven't there been renewed faith, hope, love, peace and obedience wherever   this messenger has shared her blessings and graces that God has given her   in good purpose? Why do we choose to be blind? Why fear the truth that God has been giving us a chance and sharing Christ's   ever-forgetting forgiveness to us through the obedient mother? The mother who has been consecrated the task __to reverse__ the disobedient   harm and example done by the ancient Eve. She has been preparing the new Eden with her Immaculate Heart. The new Eden as sanctuary (the womb) for the next coming and judgement of the    righteous by our Lord, Jesus Christ; when The Lamb marries His bride. Shouldn't we give her a hand in her exhaustive job of preparing us for the   second coming of her Son as she has been conceived without sin to bear   the Son of God in her womb? Why fear true peace, love and renewed faith and obedience to God that Mary   faithfully brings to God's children?  She has been protecting the flock   (the rest of the offsprings) from the greedy dragon so as to present more    righteous members for her Son's coming. Not all apparitions and miracles that resulted from them are worthy   of belief.  With prayer and guidance from the Holy Spirit and, of course,   approval of our Church authorities, we should be aware of the true and   divinely inspired ones; specifically, the ones which aligns with the   Scripture.     Also, our Lady reminds us of recommendation of __silence__ in our prayers:   \\\"If you speak unceasingly in your prayers, how will you be able to hear   God?  Allow Him room to answer you, to speak to you.\\\"   She encourages us (with motherly nurturing) to continue in exuberant  faith, hope and love to Jesus, constantly.  NOT with mere emotions,  but with deep, constant obedience to Jesus, her Beloved Son and acknowledgement of our need to have Him as part of our lives.  Let's not wait to the last minute to renew our faith and the life that God wants us to live; when there won't be enough time or when it will be late.                                                        Nowadays, Mary says,  \\\"Pray, pray, pray for peace...reconciliation, my children.\\\" Have peace within yourself first before you can promote peace to others.  For without peace, you can not fully accept my Son.\\\"                                                                          And you think she's just an ordinary lady.  Not to me.  She's our good Mother/messenger from God and she is so nice enough to share God's kingdom to us through her Son and experience it.  With Mary, we are assured that The Lamb always succeeds.  ----- Note:  All enclosed in quotes are from \\\"Latest News of Medjugorje\\\"        Number 10, June, 1991 by Fr.

All production would have to be    local.  There are not all that many people who have both the skill    AND motivation to assemble worthwhile firearms from scratch.    High-ranking crime figures could obtain imported Uzis and such, but    the average person, and average thug, would be lucky to get a zip-gun    - and would pay through the nose for it.  Good point you make.  However, a zip gun, by definition, is a crude, homemade gun--certainly not something capable of sustained, accurate fire, but it would be useful as a means of getting a normal gun.  Recall the tiny, single-shot pistols made by the Allies during World War II for use by partisans.  They were essentially well-made zipguns, incapable of effective fire beyond a few feet.  But they were useful as a means of killing German soldiers for their guns.  Also note that the crowd-pleasin' favorite, the Sten gun, was specifically designed to require as little machine work as possible. The point's been made here that one could make a Sten clone with steel tubing, hand tools and a welder.  I still think that while the point is good, I think there's a difference between marijuana and firearms, in that quality marijuana can be grown locally; there's no need to import the stuff.  If guns are banned, I think the demand for \\\"real\\\" guns will be sufficient to make smuggling economically feasible, thus rendering a ban moot.  In any case, the result would be the same--people who aren't criminals won't have firearms, and \\\"bad guys\\\" will continue to have access to them, one way or another.  And I don't see that as a necessary situation.\",\"I booked a hotel (Red Roof Inn) last week in Cincinnati (Blue Ash, which is at the northern tip of the metro. Cincy area).

Can we perhaps as the question of whether the Constitution might have been written to appeal to the principles, rather than, as you appear to believe, it was written with something else in mind and \\\"propoganda\\\" put out by its supporters.         But let's be honest about something, here.  When was the last time you brought up all the valid points against your own arguments?         Or are they simply propogranda?  We can't know what Phill *really* means because he's obviously using arguments designed to convince.          If they're true or false, regardles of why they were said, why on earth did you make a point of calling them \\\"propogranda?\\\"  That would seem to be irrelevent.          Oh, I have no argument with questioning them.  I don't believe they no longer apply, but that's because I think most of them were good arguments.  I'm not entirely happy about the situation, because they were obviously only applied to a minority of the time, but I don't think that alone is sufficient to invalidate them.          Since the U.S. constitution is the basis for the U.S. political system, most changes in it would require Constitutional change.  In this particular case, however the fillibuster is a matter of procedure and tradition.  It only *should* have been made part of the Constitution. :-)           In principle no?  That they had less power of that they should have had less power?           Phill, we're discusing the power of legislative houses.  While the Prime Minister *is* member of Parliament, he is more analgous (although badly) to the U.S. President.          Now, please explain to me how the U.S. House of Representatives is \\\"in principle\\\" more powerful than the House of Lords (or the Senate) but in practice is less.  Are you suggesting that the writers of the Constitution *really* intended for them to be more powerful, but gosh darn the thing was ratified before they realized they'd forgotten to put those extra restrictions on the Senate in?         Not at all.  As any entry level political science course will tell you, people who want laws implemented will always choose the level of government to \\\"attack\\\" which presents them with the best chance of getting what they want.  With national \\\"interest groups\\\" it is simply a very rational thing to do to want the Federal government to enact a law rather than the states.  Less people to persuade, and less  \\\"contributions\\\" to make.          Why do those concerned about abortion primarily concentrate at the Federal level?  Simply because if they win that battle all the little state battlefields are won by extension.  The same extends to insurance, medicine, and most other questions.        Local government has not \\\"failed\\\" in that it hasn't done what it should, but that it is dominated by local interests.  Thus non-local interests who want localities to abide by their rules can't get their rules past the local government.  Thus, since they've got more clout, only in the wrong place, they appeal to the next higher level because it can impose its will on the lower.        I mean, let's get real here.  Do we *really* need the Congres of the United States deciding that x traffice light should be on thus- and such pattern?  Or that *carjacking* needs to be a federal as opposed to a local crime?        The more people want the more Congress will take power to \\\"sell\\\" it to them for their votes.  I don't think the rise of \\\"special interests\\\" is coincidence with the increased power of Congress.          Bingo.  The higher up the governmental ladder the less actual need matters, because political power can be concentrated at higher levels, while people with less cloud only find themselves reduced to in effectiveness.          Then why not simply leave New York's education to New York?  I remain unconcinved that there is any state in the Union which is not capable of educating its own children if that's what they want to do.  And if you leave it to them, you only have to worry about the \\\"pork\\\" in that state.  And since industries can't concentrate their political power and wealth, rather they must divide it among the states to try and get what they want, individual voices have more relative impact.         The problem with the fillibuster is not that you must \\\"buy off\\\" states, but that the Congress has acquired too much power to sell pork.          But why on earth should we want to redirect it?  You said yourself  that you have to sell pork to get things through Congress.  If Congres has less authority to sell pork and retains its authority to enact national legislation within its granted jurisdiction, the pork problem is significantly reduced.          The current blocks essentially state that inaction is preferable to action, thus it the system is weighted against action.  Considering the government the usually the institution with the sole power to enforce its decisions by force, I consider bias against making those decisions a good thing.          The difference with the lower pyramid is that a) they have more legal, legitimate authority in most matters under our Constitution than the federal government, and b) at those lower levels power is harder to concentrate.  And c) you get the benefit of not imposing new deicisons on everybody at once.  You get to see them tried out without a national decision.  Congressional action usually treats the entire country as a whole, yet even with similar problems in different areas, different solutions may be called for.         And while I often don't agree with the decisions my local and state reps make, at least I have a better option of going to the city council and shooting my mouth off.  I'd much rather the majority of laws be made by accessible people who hang around and end up having to put up with them rather than somebody far off in Washington with half a million or more constituents.         I'm curious what you base your assumption that lower levels are more corrupt.            Phill, *you* brought up the Federalist papers.  We were arguing the fillibuster and whether or not a minority of Senators should be allowed to hold up a bill.  You claimed the Senate was suppose to be a far less powerful House, and I contended there was nothing in the Constitution or other writings which indicated this. Which was when you brought up that we can't decide what the founders wanted based on the Federalist papers.  You argued against them, I never argued from them.  I have primarily referred to the Constitution, which places only very small restrictions on the Senate than for the House.          The U.S. Constitution is a nuts-and-bolts document.  The Delcaration of Independence was the high-brow reasoning.  (There are a couple of other examples, though, such as the reasoning for the power to tax, and the reasoning for the power to grant permits, both in Article I, Section 8.)          To a certain extend I do believe the veto has become something it wasn't intended.  However, I also believe it is inevitable considering the Congress' own abuse of their power to make bills say whatever they want them to say.  Unlike most people I think we shouldn't be worrying about the veto, which is fine, but of the problem in Congress which almost necessitates its abuse.          *BUSH?*  Phill, that's absurd.  Bush had *37* vetos, one of which was over-ridden.  Go read up on FDR if you think that's anything resembling a record.          Why not?  What is inherently wrong with biasing the system against action?  Historically governemnt action in the U.S. when dealing with issues with a bare minority and a large minority have not been successful.  When you're in a position of imposing federal power on diverse people, why should the federal government not have to got through something more than a bare majority          Now we're switching from a general question of a fillibuster to a specific bill.  I don't see how it make a difference.          Sure it's arguable.  Theyr'e *arguing* it.  However, requiring 60% to bring it to a vote ensures that they'll have to have a *good* argument.  Something that isn't based solely on party lines.          No, I am completely happy with a system which requires a minority for *action*.  Since U.S. history is a history of carving up population groups and implementing piece-meal on minorities, I feel minorities should have sufficent clout to prevent action they feel strongly enough about.  And 41% is hardly a tiny minority.  I don't advocate the minority being capable of initiating actionm but I see no problem with biasing the *federal* system against action. \",\"DH>>Does anyone out their have a mountain tape backup that I could compare DH>>notes with, (jumper settings, software, ect...)

What happens to a Russian, to a Czech, does not interest me in the slightest. What the nations can offer in good blood of our type, we will take, if necessary by kidnapping their children and raising them with us. Whether nations live in prosperity or starve to death interests me only in so far as we need them as slaves for our culture; otherwise, it is of no interest to me. Whether 10,000 Russian females fall down from exhaustion while digging an anti-tank ditch interest me only in so far as the anti-tank ditch for Germany is finished. We shall never be rough and heartless when it is not necessary, that is clear. We Germans, who are the only people in the world who have a decent attitude towards animals, will also assume a decent attitude towards these human animals. But it is a crime against our own blood to worry about them and give them ideals, thus causing our sons and grandsons to have a more difficult time with them. When someone comes to me and says, \\\"I cannot dig the anti-tank ditch with women and children, it is inhuman, for it will kill them\\\", then I would have to say, \\\"you are a murderer of your own blood because if the anti-tank ditch is not dug, German soldiers will die, and they are the sons of German mothers. They are our own blood\\\".    Extract from Himmler's address to party comrades, September 7 1940 [\\\"Trials of Wa Criminals\\\", Vol. IV, p. 1140] ------------------------------------------------------------------ If any Pole has any sexual dealing with a German woman, and by this I mean sexual intercourse, then the man will be hanged right in front of his camp. Then the others will not do it. Besides, provisions will be made that a sufficient number of Polish women and girls will come along as well so that a necessity of this kind is out of the question.  The women will be brought before the courts without mercy, and where the facts are not sufficiently proved - such borderline cases always happen - they will be sent to a concentration camp. This we must do, unless these one million Poles and those hundreds of thousands of workers of alien blood are to inflict untold damage on the German blood. Philosophizing is of no avail in this case.

Edition 01 Apr 93  This article applies only to Windows 3.0 and 3.1, and not to NT, OS/2 or DOS apps not running under Windows.  One of the unadvertised limitations of most current Windows PCs is that their RS-232C (serial, COM) performance is seriously deficient.  Almost everyone who purchases a high-speed modem (V.32bis, V.32, PEP or HST) discovers the problem the first time they try to download a file or accept an incoming FAX (at 9600+) after upgrading the modem.  Overrun and retry errors abound, even when the only active application is the datacomm or FAX program.  If the transfer completes at all, it may take even longer than with the old 2400bps modem.   There are three reasons for the problem:  1. The Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitters (UARTs) used in most    PCs are primitive Ns8250 devices with single-byte FIFO buffers.  If the    operating system/driver cannot read and flush each character at high    interrupt rates, the next incoming character overwrites the FIFO and    the previous one is lost.  DOS, being a fairly single-minded    environment during datacomm, can usually keep up. Windows can't.  2. Windows has more operating system overhead than plain DOS, and    interrupts often take longer to service.  Overruns are much more likely    than under DOS.  As soon as you report to your PC/modem vendor that you    are losing data, you may be advised that \\\"you need to upgrade to a    16550\\\". More likely, since there seems to be a conspiracy of ignorance    about this issue,  you'll get no useful advice at all.  Most of the    store-front and mail-order sources I spoke with in attempting to solve    my own problem had never heard the term \\\"16550\\\" and many didn't even    know what a UART was.  3. Even your PC has Ns16550A UARTs (and PS/2's do), or if you can upgrade    your mother/COM board or add a new COM board, you may STILL experience    errors and overruns because the standard MicroSoft Windows COM drivers    don't take full advantage of the 16550.  Windows 3.1 is improved in this    regard over 3.0, but I still recommend a driver upgrade.  Applications    like ProComm+/Win (which is what I use) cannot get around this problem    by themselves.  If you have a modem CARD, you may not have a problem, as the modem part of the card can be designed to be aware of the state of the UART, and avoid overrunning it; however, I wouldn't want to bet that the card designers were that clever, and will insist on a 16550 UART if I ever buy a modem card.  Some modem cards don't even have conventional UARTs, but if they are to work with standard Windows drivers, they need to simulate one. Use MSD.EXE (below) to see what the modem card is, or is pretending to be.   The Hardware Situation.  The UARTs on most PC COM ports are based on National Semiconductor Ns8250 or Ns16450 chips (or megacells inside VLSI chips where you can't replace them).  You can ID the UART type on your system by running the MicroSoft diagnostic program \\\\WINDOWS\\\\MSD.EXE.  Be sure to run it in DOS *before* bringing up Windows.   The Windows serial API may prevent MSD from accurately identifying a 16550 if you run it from a Windows DOS prompt.  The Ns16550 UART has separate 16-byte transmit and receive FIFOs with configurable trigger levels, and can run reliably at clock rates up to 460,800 bps, although with current modem technology, there's no point in pushing your luck by going over 115,200 bps. The 16550 has shorted access cycle times than the 16450 or 8250.  The 16550 also has DMA capability, but it is not clear that any PC drivers ever use this.  For more technical info, see National Semiconductor Application Note AN-491.  So, what UART component do you have?  Try to locate the UART on your mother board, multi-function I/O card, COM board or ISA/MCA modem card.  If you can't find a socketed component with the numbers \\\"8250\\\" or \\\"16450\\\", your COM ports are probably buried in VLSI, and you won't be able to perform a chip replacement.  If you can DISABLE your VLSI COM ports (as I chose to do), you can at least add an aftermarket COM board.  If you have one or more socketed 8250 or 16450 chips, you can buy plug-in Ns16550AFN or PC16C550CN (low power CMOS version) ICs from several suppliers typically for $9 to $15 each.  The \\\"N\\\" chip is the normal 40-pin dual-in-line package.  Other styles are available, but avoid any Ns16550 chips without the \\\"A\\\" (the 16C550C are presumably all OK).  Early Ns chips have bugs, although National will reportedly exchange those of their own manufacture for free.  Clone chips are available from various IC makers other than National.  The manual for the TurboCom drivers states support for the following (apparently equivalent) chips: National Semiconductor: 16550A, 16551, 16552 Chips&Technology:       82C607 Texas Instruments:      t16c550a Silicon Systems:        73M550 VLSI                    16C550 TurboCom warns about the pre-\\\"A\\\" Ns16550 and Western Digital 16C550, says that problems have been reported with early IBM PS/2 55SX and 70 systems (IBM reportedly will upgrade them).  If you DON'T have socketed 8250/16450 chips, you'll need to buy an after- market COM or multi-function board. If this is a modem card situation, you may be hosed. To add a new COM or multi-function card, you'll need to either disable the COM1/2 port(s) you are replacing, or re-assign them to COM3/4 (although watch out for IRQ conflicts without TurboCom).  Although cheaper cards are available, in the interest of getting the problem solved quickly I elected buy the Modular Circuit Technology MCT-AIO+ card from:  JDR Microdevices 2233 Samaritan Drive San Jose  CA  95124 (800) 538-5000 voice US (408) 559-1200 voice other (800) 538-5005 FAX US  The MCT-AIO+ (and the \\\"+\\\" is important) sells for $89.95.

Meanwhile, back at the MCT card from JDR... I only needed two serial ports, and am running out of IRQs on my PC, so I disabled my built-in VLSI-based 8250 ports. However, with the TurboCom driver (below), I could have set the internals as COM3 and 4, using IRQ sharing.   The Software Situation  Simply upgrading to 16550 UARTs will not completely solve common overrun problems.  The standard MS serial drivers don't take full advantage of the 16550. The Windows 3.0 drivers are even less capable, and the Windows 3.1 drivers have the following limitations:  - They enable only the receive FIFO, and only at rates above 2400 bps.  - They never enable the transmit FIFO, which  results in an interrupt    rate of 10x during uploads.  - They set the trigger level at 14 bytes (too high - it's easy for 2    more bytes to arrive before the driver can read the FIFO).  - The Ports menu of the Control Panel only allows speeds up to 19200.    With a V.32bis modem,  sparse data and text can easily compress 3:1    or more, suggesting that a host DTE connect rate of 57,600 bps would    be effective.  - The API won't accept rates above \\\"CBR_128000\\\".  - The API won't let DOS programs know there is a 16550 there, and even    if it did, DOS programs that aren't 16550-aware get little benefit    from a 16550 port with the standard drivers.  - They don't allow IRQ sharing for COM3,4.  - The BIOS doesn't initialize COM3,4 properly in many systems.  - Windows provides no workaround for apps that don't provide port    speed options above 19200 bps.  These problems are reportedly NOT solved in Windows NT or DOS 6.0, and may or may not be addressed in any Windows releases after 3.1 (but before 4.0). Rumors suggest they \\\"may\\\" be solved in Windows \\\"4.0\\\".  You can get replacement drivers that solve all of those problems by buying a copy of \\\"TurboCom\\\", current version 1.2, from:  Bio-Engineering Research Pacific CommWare Division 180 Beacon Hill Lane Ashland  OR   97520-9701 (503) 482-2744 voice (503) 482-2627 FAX (503) 482-2633 BBS MCImail:    344-5374 CompuServe: 71521,760  Price was around $50 as I recall.  Bio-Eng is not set up to accept credit cards, so I had to send a check.  Egghead and 1-800-Software list TurboCom but as far as I know, they don't stock it.  Bio is not a software company per se.  They apparently needed reliable hi-speed serial connections for an in-house instrument application, wrote their own driver, discovered a market for it, revised it to be a general purpose COM driver suite. They recently upgraded it for Windows 3.1.  It is run-time licensed.  I now have my host (DTE) connect rate set to 57,600 bps most of  my datacomm apps, and I am having ZERO problems with downloads. I routinely see transfer rates that exceed 2,000 bps. I am also using 115,200 bps when linking an HP95LX to my PC, with lossless bi-directional I/O. Uploads to various remote systems are another matter, because many hosts are still using antique UARTs and drivers.  Note that 19200 is still the highest rate that the Windows 3.1 Port menu in Control Panel will allow in configuring a COM port.  TurboCom gets around this by allowing you to specify, on each port, a factor that will set the real UART rate to a multiple of the rate passed through the Windows APIs and dialog boxes.  I also have CTS/RTS hardware flow control enabled, and I suggest that you do the same.  Even if you only ever transfer 7-bit ASCII data, Xon/XOff is not a sufficiently reliable method of flow control.  The informal (DEC) standard for Xon/Xoff hysteresis is that the sender may transmit another 16 (yes, sixteen) bytes after receipt of the Xoff from the receiving system or device.  The 16 byte FIFO in the 16550 is clearly not big enough to let us rely exclusively on Xon/Xoff.  A well-respected datacomm engineer has informed me that the 16550's can't really do CTS/RTS all by itself in the DOS/Windows environment, so using data rates above 115,200 may still be risky.  Even with hardware flow control, a 16550 with TurboCom can still experience overruns in very busy systems, with lots of apps running and serious swapping in progress. If this is your situation, you may need to buy a co-processed COM board, but this will cost you more than a 16550/TurboCom upgrade.  A review of two such boards, and a review of TurboCom, can be found in the Feb'93 issue of \\\"Windows Sources\\\" magazine. I suggest trying a 16550/TurboCom upgrade first, and experiment with process priorities and time slices if you are a \\\"power user\\\" whose thrashing system still runs into comm problems.   Closing Soapbox Comments  The state of RS-232C serial datacomm support is an embarrassment across the computer industry.  Because it is the oldest standard I/O interface, the job of designing hardware and writing software often seems to be assigned to the least senior or lowest ranked engineers at computer companies.  The design of the average serial port is at least ten years behind the state of the art. In my last job, with a major workstation vendor, I lobbied for improved serial ports when they were doing the initial designs of a new system.  That family of machines was subsequently introduced with 16550 ports.  However, this is the exception.  Few computer companies seem to have any champions for decent I/O.  You may as well learn what you can about serial I/O, because this situation shows no sign of improving soon.  When V.FAST arrives, I expect cries of outrage from Windows users world-wide whose 8250 PCs \\\"sort of\\\" work today with V.32, but will fail miserably with V.FAST.  Without a hardware-buffered UART (like the 16550) and without software drivers that use that UART to best advantage, a V.FAST modem will be a waste of money.

ESPN has shown tremendous commitment to the NHL by squeezing in extra telecasts when it could (like the last Minnesota game) and putting Stanley Cup games as backup to their baseball telecasts (which by favorable circumstances they could pull off last night).

Patrick L. Mahan  --- TGV Window Washer ------------------------------- Mahan@TGV.COM ---------\",\"In the April edition of \\\"One Small Step for a Space Activist\\\", Allen Sherzer & Tim Kyger write:   \\\"Another problem is what are called 'wraps' (or sometimes    the 'center tax'). When work for a large program like    Freedom or Shuttle is performed at a NASA center, the    center skims off a portion which goes into what amounts    to a slush fund. This money is used to fund work the    center manager wants to fund. This sum is estimated to    be over a third of the funds allocated. Think about    that: Of the $30 billion cost of Freedom, fully $10    billion won't be spent on anything having anything    to do with Space Stations! Now, maybe that $10 billion    was wisely spent (and maybe it wasn't), but the work done    with it should stand on its own merits, not distorting    the cost of other projects. Congress has no idea of the    existense of these wraps; Congress has never heard the    term 'center tax'. They look at the Station they are    getting and the price they are paying and note that    it doesn't add up. They wonder this blissfully unaware    that a third of the money is going for something else.\\\"  My dear friends, your mixing fact and fiction here. A couple of weeks ago, when I first read this in your posting, I talked with one of the cost experts here in Space Station at Headquarters [if you wondering why I didn't post a response immediately, I do have a real job I'm supposed to be doing here at Headquarters, & digging up old 20 kHz data & looking into Sherzer/Kyger claims rates pretty low on the totem pole of priority. Also, I spent last weekend in Kansas City, at the National Science Teachers  Association conference, extolling the virtues of SSF to 15,000 science teachers.]  First off, yes, the concept of 'center tax', or 'wrap' does exist. If I recall the numbers correctly, the total 'tax' for the SSF program for this fiscal year is around $40 Million. This was computed by adding up the WP-1, WP-2, and WP-4 center 'taxes'. With the SSF budget for this fiscal year at $2.2 Billion, my calculater says the tax percentage is 04/2.2 = 1.8%  Over the life of the SSF program, using your figure of $30 billion for the cost of SSF, a tax at a 1.8% rate comes to $540 million. This is alot less than $10 billion, but I will concede it's still an appreciable amount of pocket change.  I should note that your estimate of the tax rate at 1/3 could be close to the actual rate. The tax is only charged on funds that are spent at the center (kind of like McDonalds at some states, where you do have to pay sales tax if you eat the food at the restaurant, but you don't if you get it take-out). For example, at WP-4, the vast bulk of the funds we receive go to the Rocketdyne Contract, and are *NOT* subject to the center tax (I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I'd guess at least 95% of the WP-4 funds go to Rocketdyne). So, you could be right about a tax rate of 1/3, but it's only applied to funds spent at the center, and not to the prime contracts.  This leads to the obvious question \\\"What is the government doing with SSF funds that don't go to the prime contractors? (i.e. ok, WP-4 gets a slice of the $30 billion pie. A big portion of this slice goes to Rocketdyne. What happens to the balance of the funds, which aren't eaten up by the center tax?)\\\"  At WP-4, we call these funds we spend in-house supporting development funds (as they are supporting the development work done by Rocketdyne). We have used these funds to setup our own testbed, to checkout the electrical power system architecture. Our testbed has a real life solar array field (left over from solar cell research research a few years back), with lead-acid car batteries (to simulate the Nickel-Hydrogen batteries on SSF), DC switchgear, DC-DC converter units, and simulated loads. Data from the testbed was used in a recent change evaluation involving concerns about the stability of the power system.  We have also used the supporting development money to purchase Nickel Hydrogen batteries, which are on life testing at both Lewis and the Crane Naval facility in Indiana. As a side point, 6 of the battery cells on test recently hit the four year life test milestone. 38 cells have completed 18,552 to 23,405 cycles (the on-orbit batteries go through 5,840 cycles per year).  As a final example, my 'home' division at Lewis used the supporting development funds to purchase personal computers and work stations, for performing system analyses (like modeling of the performance of the electrical power system, availability calculations using a Monte-Carlo simulation, setting up a  database with information on weight of the power system elements).  Finally, the money raised by the 'tax' does not all go into a 'slush fund.' At Lewis, the director does control a small discretionary fund. Each year, any individual at Lewis can submit a proposal to the director to get money from this fund to look at pretty much anything within the Lewis Charter.  Most of the tax, however, goes to fund the 'general' services at the Center, like the library, the  central computer services division, the Contractor  who removes the snow, etc. Thus, it is rather difficult to determine what percentage of the SSF budget doesn't go for SSF activities. To get an accurate figure, you would have to take the annual expenditure for the library (for example), and then divide by the amount of the library funds used to support SSF (which would be hard to compute by itself - how would you figure out what percentage of the bill for Aviation Week for 1 year is 'billable' to SSF, would you base it on the person-hours SSF employees spend reading AV-week versus the rest of the center personnel). You would then have to compare this estimate of the SSF portion of the library expense with the portion of the tax that goes to support the library. Who knows, maybe SSF overpays on the tax to run the library, but we underpay for snow removal?

Since there are two possible processor configurations and one of the them doesn't have an FPU it does seem to be an option, even though it really isn't.       Well, then allow me to end your confusion. The C650 ONLY come with an LC040 in the base 4/80 configuration. If you are not getting this configuration then you are getting an FPU.       Good question. I have been wondering that since Feb. 10th.        This is possible, but an option is something that you are supposed to be able to request when you want it.

In fact Apple has included in the ROMs of those machines with LC040s code to recognize the presence of the full 040's FPU and use it. Thereby making the upgrade as easy as switching chips.

I must congratulate your analytical and excellent reportage about  Diana. From  the writings  of tye biographers  you  quoted,  I can  perceive,  maybe chauvinistically,  the  remnants of  her  Armenian genes. Even  though she  is only  1/64th Armenian, she   seems   to   have   many   of   the   strong characteristics  of Armenian  women. Her  Armenian ancestry is  traced to Eliza Kewark  (an Armenian from  India), who  married  the Scottish  merchant Thedore Forbes.  From the union was  born Kathleen Scott  Forbes,  who  married  James  Crombie  from Aberdeen. They  had a  daughter Jane,  who married David  Littlejohn.  Their  daughter  Ruth  married William Gill. Ruth Silvia Gill, the grandmother of Lady  Diana,   married  Lord  Fermoy,   and  their daughter, Frances  Ruth Burke Roache,  married the eight Earl of Spencer, who  was the father of Lady Diana.

Anyway, the Armenians tore apart the Ottoman Empire's eastern provinces, massacred 2.5 million defenseless Turkish women, children and elderly  people, burned thousands of Turkish and Kurdish villages and exterminated  the entire Turkish population of the Armenian dictatorship between  1914-1920. Such outrageous sleight of hand that is still employed today  in Armenia brings a depth and verification to the Turkish genocide  that is hard to match. A hundred years ago Armenians again thought  they could get whatever they wanted through sheer terror like the  Russian anarchists that they accepted as role models. Several Armenian  terror groups like ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle  resorted to the same tactics in the 1980s, butchering scores of innocent Turks and their families in the United States and Europe.

Larson's comprehensive            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he            calls the \\\"Reciprocal System\\\", is built on two fundamental            postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of            space and time:                      (1) \\\"The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE            component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE            UNITS, and in two RECIPROCAL forms, SPACE and TIME.\\\"                      (2) \\\"The physical universe conforms to the relations of            ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its magnitudes are            ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN.\\\"                      From these two postulates, Larson developed a COMPLETE            Theoretical Universe, using various combinations of            translational, vibrational, rotational, and vibrational-           rotational MOTIONS, the concepts of IN-ward and OUT-ward            SCALAR MOTIONS, and speeds in relation to the Speed of Light            (which Larson called \\\"UNIT VELOCITY\\\" and \\\"THE NATURAL            DATUM\\\").                        At each step in the development, Larson was able to            MATCH objects in his Theoretical Universe with objects in the            REAL physical universe, (photons, sub-atomic particles            [INCOMPLETE ATOMS], charges, atoms, molecules, globular star            clusters, galaxies, binary star systems, solar systems, white            dwarf stars, pulsars, quasars, ETC.), even objects NOT YET            DISCOVERED THEN (such as EXPLODING GALAXIES, and GAMMA-RAY            BURSTS).                            And applying his Theory to his NEW model of the atom,            Larson was able to precisely and accurately CALCULATE inter-           atomic distances in crystals and molecules, compressibility            and thermal expansion of solids, and other properties of            matter.                  All of this is described in good detail, with-OUT fancy            complex mathematics, in his books.                   BOOKS of Dewey B.

Larson's Background                     Physicist Dewey B. Larson was a retired Engineer            (Chemical or Electrical).  He was about 91 years old when he            died in May 1989.  He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in            Engineering Science from Oregon State University.  He            developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE            chemical properties based only on the elements used.                      Larson's lack of a fancy \\\"PH.D.\\\" degree might be one            reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is            NOT A VALID REASON.  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider            to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES.  At the same            time, it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX            physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer,            well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC            ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, ETC..                       Larson did NOT have the funds, etc. to experimentally            test his Theory.  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so.             He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER            researchers' experimental and observational data.  And in            many cases, HIS explanation FIT BETTER.                      A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX            physicists and astronomers have!  They CLAIM to be looking            for a \\\"unified field theory\\\" that works, but have been            IGNORING one for over 30 years now!                      \\\"Modern physics\\\" does NOT explain the physical universe            so well.  Some parts of some of Larson's books are FULL of            quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who            agree.  And remember that \\\"epicycles\\\", \\\"crystal spheres\\\",            \\\"geocentricity\\\", \\\"flat earth theory\\\", etc., ALSO once SEEMED            to explain it well, but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG.                           Prof. Frank H. Meyer, Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior,            was/is a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson's Theory, and was (or            still is) President of Larson's organization, \\\"THE            INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE\\\", and Editor of            their quarterly Journal \\\"RECIPROCITY\\\".  He moved to            Minneapolis after retiring.                   \\\"Super Collider\\\" BOONDOGGLE!                           I am AGAINST contruction of the \\\"Superconducting Super            Collider\\\", in Texas or anywhere else.  It would be a GROSS            WASTE of money, and contribute almost NOTHING of \\\"scientific\\\"            value.                      Most physicists don't realize it, but, according to the            comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist            Dewey B. Larson, as described in his books, the strange GOOFY            particles (\\\"mesons\\\", \\\"hyperons\\\", ALLEGED \\\"quarks\\\", etc.)            which they are finding in EXISTING colliders (Fermi Lab,            Cern, etc.) are really just ATOMS of ANTI-MATTER, which are            CREATED by the high-energy colliding beams, and which quickly            disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible            with their environment.                      A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a            few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not            seen there before, and the physicists will be EVEN MORE            CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW!                      Are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $8.3            BILLION cost?!!  Don't we have much more important uses for            this WASTED money?!                            Another thing to consider is that the primary proposed            location in Texas has a serious and growing problem with some            kind of \\\"fire ants\\\" eating the insulation off underground            cables.  How much POISONING of the ground and ground water            with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of            the \\\"Supercollider\\\"?!                                 Naming the \\\"Super Collider\\\" after Ronald Reagon, as            proposed, is TOTALLY ABSURD!  If it is built, it should be            named after a leading particle PHYSICIST.                     LARSONIAN Anti-Matter                           In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe, anti-matter is NOT a simple case of            opposite charges of the same types of particles.  It has more            to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the            photons of which they are made, in relation to the            vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light,            which Larson calls \\\"Unit Velocity\\\" and the \\\"Natural Datum\\\".                       In Larson's Theory, a positron is actually a particle of            MATTER, NOT anti-matter.  When a positron and electron meet,            the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their            respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each            other.                        In Larson's Theory, the ANTI-MATTER half of the physical            universe has THREE dimensions of TIME, and ONLY ONE dimension            of space, and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our            MATERIAL half.                      LARSONIAN Relativity                           The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury            has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the            rate of 574 seconds of arc per century.  531 seconds of this            advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational            perturbations from the other planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter,            etc.).  The remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to            help \\\"prove\\\" Einstein's \\\"General Theory of Relativity\\\".                      But the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieved results            CLOSER to the 43 seconds than \\\"General Relativity\\\" can, by            INSTEAD using \\\"SPECIAL Relativity\\\".  In one or more of his            books, he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH            ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury.                      Larson TOTALLY REJECTED \\\"General Relativity\\\" as another            MATHEMATICAL FANTASY.  He also REJECTED most of \\\"Special            Relativity\\\", including the parts about \\\"mass increases\\\" near            the speed of light, and the use of the Lorentz Transform on            doppler shifts, (Those quasars with red-shifts greater than            1.000 REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT,            although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME.).                       In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe, there are THREE dimensions of time instead            of only one.  But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured            from our material half of the physical universe.  The one            dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time.  At low            relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are            NEGLIGIBLE; but at high speeds, they become significant, and            the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR.            [Larson often used the term \\\"COORDINATE TIME\\\" when writing            about this.]                            In regard to \\\"mass increases\\\", it has been PROVEN in            atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near            the speed of light.  But the formula for acceleration is            ACCELERATION = FORCE / MASS, (a = F/m).  Orthodox physicists            are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR: FORCE.  In Larson's Theory,            mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero.  FORCE is            actually a MOTION, or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS, or RELATIONS            BETWEEN MOTIONS, including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS.             The expansion of the universe, for example, is an OUTward            SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of            the so-called \\\"Big Bang\\\" (which is yet another MATHEMATICAL            FANTASY).                                                                 THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION                 I wish to recommend to EVERYONE the book \\\"THE UNIVERSE            OF MOTION\\\", by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North Pacific            Publishers, (P.O. Box 13255, Portland, Oregon  97213), 456            pages, indexed, hardcover.                      It contains the Astrophysical portions of a GENERAL            UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by that            author, an UNrecognized GENIUS, more than thirty years ago.                      It contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL Astrophysical            mysteries, including the FORMATION of galaxies, binary and            multiple star systems, and solar systems, the TRUE ORIGIN of            the \\\"3-degree\\\" background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma-           ray bursts, and the TRUE NATURE of quasars, pulsars, white            dwarfs, exploding galaxies, etc..                      It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL            looking for, if they are ready to seriously consider it with            OPEN MINDS!                      The following is an example of his Theory's success:            In his first book in 1959, \\\"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL            UNIVERSE\\\", Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING            GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding            them.  They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson's            comprehensive Theory.  And when QUASARS were discovered, he            had an immediate related explanation for them also.                    GAMMA-RAY BURSTS                 Astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching            their heads about the mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS.  They were            originally thought to originate from \\\"neutron stars\\\" in the            disc of our galaxy.  But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in            Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions            uniformly, and their source locations in space do NOT            correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of            directional coincidence).                      Gamma-ray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by            the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson.  According to page 386 of            his book \\\"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\\\", published in 1984, the            gamma-ray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the            ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls            the \\\"Cosmic Sector\\\".  Because of the relationship between the            anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and            the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can            pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at            random.  (This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do            not correspond with known objects, and come from all            directions uniformly.)                      I wonder how close to us in space a source location            would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most            life on Earth!  There would be NO WAY to predict one, NOR to            stop it!                      Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past, which            are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were            actually caused by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS!                   LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation                           About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the            vicinity of the sun are binary or double.  But orthodox            astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory            theory about how they form or why there are so many of them.                      But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY            CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of            the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey            B. Larson.                      I will try to summarize Larsons explanation, which is            detailed in Chapter 7 of his book \\\"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\\\"            and in some of his other books.                      First of all, according to Larson, stars do NOT generate            energy by \\\"fusion\\\".  A small fraction comes from slow            gravitational collapse.  The rest results from the COMPLETE            ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements (heavier than IRON).  Each            element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT.  The heavier the            element is, the lower is this limit.  A star's internal            temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and            absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually            reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and            lighter elements.                      When the internal temperature of the star reaches the            destructive temperature limit of IRON, there is a Type I            SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION!  This is because there is SO MUCH iron            present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms            and the atom building process, which Larson explains in some            of his books [better than I can].                      When the star explodes, the lighter material on the            outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less            than the speed of light.  The heavier material in the center            portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to            the speed of light, because of the high temperature.  The            explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light, and            it expands OUTWARD IN TIME, which is equivalent to INWARD IN            SPACE, and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while.                      Over long periods of time, both masses start to fall            back gravitationally.  The material that had been blown            outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star.  The            material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a            WHITE DWARF star.  BOTH stars then start moving back toward            the \\\"MAIN SEQUENCE\\\" from opposite directions on the H-R            Diagram.                      The chances of the two masses falling back into the            exact same location in space, making a single lone star            again, are near zero.  They will instead form a BINARY            system, orbiting each other.                       According to Larson, a white dwarf star has an INVERSE            DENSITY GRADIENT (is densest at its SURFACE), because the            material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown            outward) in time.   This ELIMINATES the need to resort to            MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about \\\"degenerate matter\\\", \\\"neutron            stars\\\", \\\"black holes\\\", etc..                   LARSONIAN Solar System Formation                 If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the            exploding star is relatively SMALL, then, instead of a single            white dwarf star, there will be SEVERAL \\\"mini\\\" white dwarf            stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably            still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affected            by its heat, etc.).  These will become PLANETS!                        In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, Larson used all            this information, and other principles of his comprehensive            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, to derive            his own version of Bode's Law.                         \\\"Black Hole\\\" FANTASY!                 I heard that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently            completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO \\\"black            holes\\\" merging together into a SINGLE \\\"black hole\\\", and            concluded that the new \\\"black hole\\\" would have MORE MASS than            the sum of the two original \\\"black holes\\\".                      Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED            FLAG, causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of \\\"black            holes\\\", etc.!                      After reading Physicist Dewey B. Larson's books about            his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe, especially his book \\\"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\\\", it is            clear to me that \\\"black holes\\\" are NOTHING more than            MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES!  The strange object at Cygnus X-1 is            just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR, NOT the \\\"black            hole\\\" that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want            to \\\"prove\\\" their theory.                           By the way, I do NOT understand why so much publicity is            being given to physicist Stephen Hawking.  The physicists and            astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawking's severe physical            problem somehow makes him \\\"wiser\\\".  It does NOT!                      I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist            Dewey B. Larson while he was still alive.  Widespread            publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson's            Theory, books, and organization (The International Society of            Unified Science).                                             ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION                 I heard of that concept many years ago, in connection            with UFO's and unorthodox inventors, but I never was able to            find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed.                      I found a possible clue about why they might work on            pages 112-113 of the book \\\"BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER\\\", by            the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson, which describes part of            Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe.  I quote one paragraph:                      \\\"As indicated in the preceding chapter, the development            of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally            different concept of the nature of electrical resistance.             The electrons, we find, are derived from the environment.  It            was brought out in Volume I [Larson's book \\\"NOTHING BUT            MOTION\\\"] that there are physical processes in operation which            produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that,            although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in            many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities            for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are            limited.  It follows that there is always a large excess of            free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the            universe, most of which are uncharged.  In this uncharged            state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension            space, because they are inherently rotating units of space,            and the relation of space to space is not motion.  In open            space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently            in the same location with respect to the natural reference            system, in the manner of a photon.  In the context of the            stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron,            like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by            the progression of the natural reference system.  All            material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons            similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation.             Meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later,            whereby electrons are returned to the environment.  The            electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth            therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level.\\\"                            Note that in Larson's Theory, UNcharged electrons are            also massLESS, and are basically photons of light of a            particular frequency (above the \\\"unit\\\" frequency) spinning            around one axis at a particular rate (below the \\\"unit\\\" rate).             (\\\"Unit velocity\\\" is the speed of light, and there are            vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light,            according to Larson's Theory.)  [I might have the \\\"above\\\" and            \\\"below\\\" labels mixed up.]                      Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass-           LESS UN-charged electrons flying around at the speed of            light!                      If this is true, then the ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION            fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these            electrons, or other particles in space, perhaps GIVING them a            charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to            achieve propulsion. (In Larson's Theory, an electrical charge            is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular            frequency (above the \\\"unit\\\" frequency) superimposed on the            rotation of the particle.)

SUPPRESSION of LARSONIAN Physics                 The comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson has            been available for more than 30 YEARS, published in 1959 in            his first book \\\"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE\\\".                      It is TOTALLY UN-SCIENTIFIC for Hawking, Wheeler, Sagan,            and the other SACRED PRIESTS of the RELIGION they call            \\\"science\\\" (or \\\"physics\\\", or \\\"astronomy\\\", etc.), as well as            the \\\"scientific\\\" literature and the \\\"education\\\" systems, to            TOTALLY IGNORE Larson's Theory has they have.                      Larson's Theory has excellent explanations for many            things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers, such            as gamma-ray bursts and the nature of quasars.                      Larson's Theory deserves to be HONESTLY and OPENLY            discussed in the physics, chemistry, and astronomy journals,            in the U.S. and elsewhere.  And at least the basic principles            of Larson's Theory should be included in all related courses            at UW-EC, UW-Madison, Cambridge, Cornell University, and            elsewhere, so that students are not kept in the dark about a            worthy alternative to the DOGMA they are being fed.                                  For more information, answers to your questions, etc.,            please consult my CITED SOURCES (especially Larson's BOOKS).

The Subject:  After-market cruise controls  The Background: I recently broke my ankle in a road-bicycling accident (4 places, five  screws, yuk! :-( ).  In two weeks I will be returning to Texas (my home) from my school (BYU) in Provo, Utah.  As you can imagine, trying to drive nearly 1300 miles with a broken right ankle isn't just the epitome of a good time.  My car does not have a cruise control, so I would have to do all the pedalling (ha ha) with my messed-up ankle.  My question: What is the general opinion of after-market cruise control units?  I realize that a cheap CC (cruise control) from, say, Pep Boys, isn't going to be as good as a factory or professionally installed unit (if there is such a thing).  And I uderstand that I probably can't expect much in the way of accuracy, looks and that sort of thing;  But anything's gotta be better than trying to drive with a hosed ankle.  I have a 1984 Jeep Cherokee, 4 speed, standard, 4*4, 2.5L engine with kettering(sp?) ignition (y'know, distributor cap, rotor, that set-up--not electronic.  Maybe you could've guessed it being an '84, but I'm just trying to give information as completly as I can).  I found a CC unit for 80 bucks.  It seems to use the vehicles vacuum system  instead of an electric servor/motor.  Is this good or bad?  If I did buy this CC, which vacuum hose should I tap?  It has two speed sensors:  One magnetic, and one that gets a signal from the  negative side of the distributor, kinda like a tach pick-up, or so I understand.  I can use either one.  Which is best?  The manual says (I read it in the store today) that the magnetic/axle set-up is more accurate, but harder to install.  Is there really a big difference?  It has a sensor for the brake pedal, just like other CCs, but does NOT have a sensor for the clutch pedal.  So if I wasn't paying real close attention I might push the clutch in while the cruise is trying to get the speed up.  Which would wind the engine up kinda high until I got my wits about me and turned  the thing off.  I'm pretty coordinated, so this doesn't bother me, if it were for my girlfriends car, *then* it would bother me, but I'm ok with it.  The installation also calls for an attachment to a steady-on brake signal and a switched-on brake signal.  I think I can get a switched brake signal from the correct side of the brake light blade fuse.  Am I right?  But I'm not sure where to get the steady-on brake signal, or, for that matter, what exactly it is?  Any ideas as to what the manufaturer wants and where to get it?  I think I can figure the other things out.  Like how to hook-up the negative side tach-type sensing gizmo and the cabin control unit, and the ground and all that miscellaneous business.  But I need a little help with:   1.  Is it worth the money and safety risk (if any) for such a      device?  2.  Is there any particularly good after-market CC?  3.  Are \\\"professionally\\\" installed CCs signifacantly better and      worth the cabbage?  4.  If the unit I saw (sorry, no manufacturer or model number, just      that it is at Pep Boy and its $80) is sufficient for my simple       needs, how do I get the thing installed properly (specifically,      the questions above)?  My father and I built a \\\"Veep\\\" (Volkswagen powered Jeep CJ-2A) when I was in high school, so I consider myself fairly good with tools, electronics, and cars.  So the installation doesn't scare me.  I just want to be certain that I get the thing installed correctly as my Cherokee is just a wee bit more complicated than my Veep. :-)  I appreciate your time in reading my post, and I would appreciate any expertise or opinion anybody has on the subject.

If anyone serves Me, him My Father will honor.\\\"  Why would I want an eternal life if I hate this one?  If we were created by a deity, why would that deity not wish us to enjoy what he has given us?  Why would I want to live forever?  The challenge in my life is that I will die, and that I must give my life the meaning I wish it to have before that happens.  My time is here and will someday pass; I will be content to live on in the memories of my friends, and once they too are dead, then I will no longer have any reason to exist.  In short: even if your deity *does* exist, that doesn't automatically mean that I would worship it.  I am content to live my own life, and fend for myself, so when I die, I can be proud of the fact that no matter where I end up, it will be because of *my* actions and *my* choices.  If your god decides to toss me into a flaming pit for this, then so be it.  I would much rather just cease to exist.  But if your god wants my respect and my obedience, then it had better earn these; and if it does, then they will be very strong and true.   Jesus wasn't the only one who rose from the dead -- I think it was Osiris who did the same, as well as a few characters from Greek or Norse legend, if memory serves.  But still: WHY would I want to rise from the dead?  Why do *you* want to?   If your god wants to win my devotion, then it knows what it can do -- provide some way for me to believe without having to resort to blind faith that could be applied equally well to any religion.   That's precisely it.  I neither see nor know Zeus either, nor Odin. Shall I offer them the same devotion I offer Jesus?   You've got to understand my point-of-view: I see Christians spouting Bible verse all the time as if it were some sort of magic spell that will level all opposition.  Truth is, it's not.  Robert has never demonstrated that he actually understands what the verses imply; he just rattles them off day by day.  Some brazenly fly in the face of common sense and reality, and I point these out where I can.  But even more than that, even when Christians *do* try to explain the verses in their own words, they do so from a Christian point of view, which is that every human being would want to be a Christian if only he or she understood the Christian message properly, and then all strife and suffering on the earth would end.  Here's the problem with that: substitute \\\"Moslem\\\" or \\\"Buddhist\\\" or \\\"Satanist\\\" instead of \\\"Christian\\\", and it means the same thing.  Christanity is a very nice belief set around a very nice book.  But if you want to make me believe that it has any bearing on the REAL WORLD, you've got some convincing to do.   And in my opinion, you're bumbling about blindly making up entities where there aren't any, and depriving yourself of a true understanding and enjoyment of your life.  As long as you keep your beliefs to yourself, I'll keep my beliefs to myself -- but as soon as you start waving them around, expect me to toss in my opinions, too.\",\" Yah.  So?

I also think Phil> the germans did some work on these in WWII.  The NACA came up with them before World War II.  NASA is directly descended from the NACA, with space added in.  You'll notice that I didn't mention sweep wings even though the X-5, tested at what's now Dryden, had them.  We did steal that one dirctly from the Germans.  The difference is that swept wings don't change their angle of sweep, sweep wings do.  Perhaps the similarity of names has caused some confusion?  747s have swept wings, F-111s have sweep wings.   Phil> A lot of this was also done by the military...  After NASA aerodynamicists proposed them and NASA test teams demonstrated them.  Richard Whitcomb and R.T. Jones, at Langley Research Center, were giants in the field.  Dryden was involved in the flight testing of winglets and area ruling (in the 70s and 50s, respectively).  It's true that we used military aircraft as the testbeds (KC-135 and YF-102) but that had more to do with availability and need than with military involvement.  The YF-102 was completely ours and the KC-135 was bailed to us.  The Air Force, of course, was interested in our results and supportive of our efforts.  Dryden flew the first digital fly by wire aircraft in the 70s. No mechnaical or analog backup, to show you how confident we were. General Dynamics decided to make the F-16 flyby-wire when they saw how successful we were.  (Mind you, the Avro Arrow and the X-15 were both fly-by-wire aircraft much earlier, but analog.)  Phil> Egad! I'm disagreeing with Mary Shafer!    The NASA habit of acquiring second-hand military aircraft and using them for testbeds can make things kind of confusing.  On the other hand, all those second-hand Navy planes give our test pilots a chance to fold the wings--something most pilots at Edwards Air Force Base can't do.  \",\" . . .

But I'd be surprised if there wasn't a Traders ad in it. It's probably worth it to write to the Chronicle (and other papers) anyway, because all their anti-gun editorials are disgusting.  By the way, let me put in a plug for Traders. I have shopped all over the SF Bay Area and I have never seen another store with lower prices.

The report on Western Thrace emphasized that the Greek government should grant  social and political  rights to all the  members of minorities that are equal to  those enjoyed by Greek citizens and in addition  they must  recognize the  existence of  the \\\"Turkish Minority\\\" in Western Thrace and  grant them the right to identify themselves as 'Turks'.

Because  we prevented Greece, the cradle of democracy, from losing face before European countries by forcing the Greek  government to recognize our legal rights.\\\"  On Turco-Greek relations, he pointed  out that both countries are predestined  to live  in  peace for  geographical and  historical reasons and said  that Turkey and Greece must  resist the foreign powers  who  are  trying  to   create  a  rift  between  them  by cooperating, adding  that in  Turkey he  observed that  there was will to improve relations with Greece.  NEWSPOT, January 1993   MACEDONIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS TO FACE TRIAL IN GREECE.  Two ethnic Macedonian  human rights activists will  face trial in Athens for alleged crimes against the Greek state, according to a Court Summons (No. 5445) obtained by MILS.    Hristos  Sideropoulos and  Tashko Bulev  (or Anastasios  Bulis) have been charged under Greek criminal law for making comments in an Athenian magazine.    Sideropoulos and  Bulev gave an  interview to the  Greek weekly magazine  \\\"ENA\\\"  on  March  11,  1992,  and  said  that  they  as Macedonians were  denied basic human  rights in Greece  and would field  an ethnic  Macedonian  candidate for  the up-coming  Greek general election.    Bulev said in the interview: \\\"I am not Greek, I am Macedonian.\\\" Sideropoulos said  in the  article that \\\"Greece  should recognise Macedonia.  The  allegations  regarding  territorial  aspirations against  Greece are  tales... We  are in  a panic  to secure  the border, at  a time when the  borders and barriers within  the EEC are falling.\\\"    The  main  charge  against  the two,  according  to  the  court summons,  was   that  \\\"they  have   spread...intentionally  false information  which  might  create   unrest  and  fear  among  the citizens,  and  might affect  the  public  security or  harm  the international interests of the country (Greece).\\\"    The  Greek  state  does  not   recognise  the  existence  of  a Macedonian ethnicity. There are believed to be between 350,000 to 1,000,000  ethnic  Macedonians   living  within  Greece,  largely concentrated in the north. It is  a crime against the Greek state if anyone declares themselves Macedonian.    In  1913  Greece,   Serbia-Yugoslavia  and  Bulgaria  partioned Macedonia into three  pieces. In 1919 Albania  took 50 Macedonian villages. The part under  Serbo-Yugoslav occupation broke away in 1991  as the  independent Republic  of Macedonia.  There are  1.5 million Macedonians in the Republic; 500,000 in Bulgaria; 150,000 in Albania; and 300,000 in Serbia proper.    Sideropoulos  has been  a long  time campaigner  for Macedonian human rights in  Greece, and lost his job as  a forestry worker a few years ago.  He was even exiled to an  obscure Greek island in the mediteranean. Only pressure from Amnesty International forced the Greek government  to allow him to return to  his home town of Florina (Lerin) in Northern  Greece (Aegean Macedonia), where the majority of ethnic Macedonians live.    Balkan watchers see the Sideropoulos  affair as a show trial in which  Greece is  desperate to  clamp down  on internal  dissent, especially  when it  comes to  the issue  of recognition  for its northern neighbour, the Republic of Macedonia.    Last year the  State Department of the  United States condemned Greece for its bad treatment of ethnic Macedonians and Turks (who largely live in Western Thrace). But it remains to be seen if the US government  will do anything until  the Presidential elections are over.

I was raised Roman Catholic before becoming an atheist, so I have stated this Creed you quote nearly every Sunday until I was about 18.  For some reason, I always took the 'resurrection' in this statement to mean the resurrection of the soul, but I guess resurrection does strictly mean the raising of the physical body.  I have some questions on this point:  1.  I always thought that Christians believe the descent into hell was  pretty much immediate, and that there are people burning in hell right now.  You seem to be implying that it will not occur until after the \\\"great judgement\\\" (which I read as meaning the proverbial Judgment Day). I was always a little confused on this point, even when I was with the church -- maybe someone can clear it up for me.  Where will my \\\"soul\\\" (which, by the way, I don't believe in) exist until that time?  2.  Will the new body I will have be created out of the same atoms  that my body now is made of, or will it be built from scratch?  My physical body now is susceptible to aging, etc. -- so I guess my new body will have to be radically different in order to be immortal so it can be tortured for all eternity?  3.  Since I will have a physical body, I assume it will need a physical place to exist in -- where is this hell?  In the center of the earth? Do you think we could find it if we dig?  Mark Schnitzius schnitzi@eola.cs.ucf.edu Univ. of Central Florida  [There is not complete agreement on the details of the afterlife.  I think the most common view is that final disposition does not occur until a final judgement, which is still in the future.  In the meantime, some believe that people \\\"sleep\\\" until the final resurrection (or because God is above time, pass directly from death to the future time when the resurrection occurs), while others believe that souls have a disembodied, pre-resurrection existence until then. There are probably other alternatives that I'm omitting.  The new body is generally conceived of being implemented in a different \\\"technology\\\" than the current one, one which is not mortal. (Paul talks about the mortal being raised to immortality, and Jesus' resurrected body -- which is the first example -- clearly was not subject to the same kind of limitations as ours.)  It is assumed that there are enough similarities that people will recognize each other, but I don't think most people claim to know the details.  I don't think I'd say it's the same atoms.  I'd assume there would be some analog of a physical place, but I wouldn't expect to find it under the earth or up in the sky.  I'd suspect that it's in another dimension, outside this physical world, or whatever.

Jordan Water to the Negev: A Strategic Asset XI.     The Negev Becomes a Dumping Ground XII.   The Dimona Nuclear Plant XIII.  The Negev as a Military Base XIV.  The Negev in the Year 2000  Just after the creation of the State of Israel, the phrase \\\"the Jewish pioneers will make the desert bloom\\\" was trumpeted throughout the Western world. After the Six Day War in 1967, David Ben-Gurion declared in a letter to Charles de Gaulle: \\\"It's by our pioneering creation that we have transformed a poor and arid land into a fertile land, created built-up areas, towns and villages in abandoned desert areas\\\".  Contrary to Ben-Gurion's assertion, it must be affirmed that during the 26 years of the British mandate over Palestine and for centuries previous, a productive human presence was to be found in all parts of the Negev desert - in the very arid hills and valleys of the southern Negev as well as in the more fertile north. These were the Bedouin Arabs.  The real desertification of the Negev, mainly in the southern part, occurred after Israel's dispossession of the Bedouin's cultivated lands and pastures. Nowadays, the majority of the 12,800 square-kilometer Negev, which represents 62 percent of the State of Israel (pre-1967 borders), has been desertified beyond recognition. The main new occupiers of the formerly Bedouin Negev are the Israeli army; the Nature Reserves Authority, whose chief role is to prevent Bedouin from roaming their former pasture lands; and vast industrial zones, including nuclear reactors and dumping grounds for chemical, nuclear and other wastes. Israeli Jews in the Negev today cultivate less than half the surface area cultivated by the Bedouin before 1948, and there is no Jewish pastoral activity.  I. Agricultural and pastoral activities of the Negev Bedouin before and after 1948 -------------------------------------------------- In 1942, according to British mandatory statistics, the Beersheba sub-district (which corresponds more or less to Israel's Negev, or Southern, district) had 52,000 inhabitants, almost all Bedouin Arabs, who held 11,500 camels, 6,000 cows and oxen, 42,000 sheep and 22,000 goats.  The majority of the Bedouin lived a more or less sedentary life in the north, where precipitation ranged between 200 and 350 mm per year. In 1944 they cultivated about 200,000 hectares of the Beersheba district - i.e. 16 percent of its total area and *more than double the area cultivated by the Negev's Jewish settlers after 40 years of \\\"making the desert bloom\\\"*  The Bedouin had a very low crop yield - 350 to 400 kilograms of barley per hectare during rainy years - and their farming techniques were primitive, but production was based solely on animal and human labor. It must also be underscored that animal production, although low, was based entirely on pasturing. Production increased considerably during the rainy years and diminished significantly during drought years. All Bedouin pasture animals - goats, camels and sheep - had the ability to gain weight quickly over the relatively rainy winters and to withstand many waterless days during the hot summers. These animals were the result of a centuries-old process of natural selection in harsh local conditions.  After the creation of the State of Israel, 80 percent of the Negev Bedouin were expelled to the Sinai or to Southern Jordan. The 10,000 who were allowed to remain were confined to a territory of 40,000 hectares in a region were annual mean precipiation was 150 mm - a quantity low enough to ensure a crop failure two years out of three. The rare water wells in the south and central Negev, spring of life in the desert, were cemented to prevent Bedouin shepherds from roaming.  A few Bedouin shepherds were allowed to stay in the central Negev. But after 1982, when the Sinai was returned to Egypt, these Bedouin were also eliminated. At the same time, strong pressure was applied on the Bedouin to abandon cultivation of their fields in order that the land could be transferred to the army.  No reliable statistics exist concerning the amount of land held today by Negev Bedouin. It is a known fact that a large part of the 40,000 hectares they cultivated in the 1950s has been seized by the Israeli authorities. Indeed, most of the Bedouin are now confined to seven \\\"development towns\\\", or *sowetos*, established for them.\",\"I'm working on an X11R5 application and have concerns regarding  standard colormaps.  these colormaps.\\\"  I wonder what window manager the writer had  in mind.  Neither twm or mwm seem to create standard colormaps.  Of course, one can use xstdcmap to create standard colormaps.   However, xstdcmap doesn't seem to try very hard to avoid  conflicts with the default colormap.  When I use standard  colormaps created by xstdcmap, the rest of my display goes black.   So it seems as if use of standard colormaps causes the very  problem standard colormaps are intended to avoid.  Perhaps  if every application used standard colormaps, things would  be wonderful.  But not many applications seem to use  standard colormaps.  Finally, the operation of the functions XmuGetColormapAllocation,  XmuStandardColormap, and XmuCreateColormap seem inconsistent  with the section 14.3 of the X11R5 XLIB documentation.      According to the section 14.3 of the X11R5 XLIB documentation (p. 436):      For GrayScale colormaps, only the colormap, red_max, red_mult, and      base_pixel members are defined.  The other members are ignored.       To compute a GrayScale pixel value, use the following expression:              (gray * red_mult + base_pixel) &0xFFFFFFFF      XmuGetColormapAllocation, defined in mit/lib/Xmu/CmapAlloc.c, is      used by XmuLookupStandardColormap, defined in mit/lib/Xmu/LookupCmap.c     to select red_max, green_max, and blue_max values for the      call to XmuStandardColormap.  When the RGB_GRAY_MAP property is      specified, XmuGetColormapAllocation sets red_max to 30% of the      total number of cells in the gray scale, sets green_max to 59%      of the total number, and sets blue_max ot 11% of the total number.     Referring to section 14.3, one would expect XmuGetColormapAllocation      to set red_max to the total number of cells in the gray scale.      When the RGB_GRAY_MAP property is specified, XmuStandardColormap,      defined in mit/lib/Xmu/StdCmap.c, sets red_mult, green_mult,      and blue_mult all equal to 1.  Referring to section 14.3,      one would expect green_mult and blue_mult to be ignored.\",\"For Sale 1988 Honda CBR600 (Hurricane).

I am working on a project for my marketing class and I'd like to ask your help.  The assignment is to come up with a product and create a marketing plan for it.  Technical issues are not terribly important at this point.  Well, my group's plan is to market a \\\"full page\\\" monitor for laptop computers.  It would be a third-party product to be installed by authorized repair centers (like Newer Technology's PaletteBook screen).  The idea is that the screen would fold in such a way that you would get twice the screen height of a normal screen (remember, technical issues aside!).  In fact, by adjusting the fold of the screen and the monitor configuration, you could have regular OR \\\"full\\\" height.  The screen would probably be monochrome. The motivation behind this is that laptop computers seem to be very popular among business people.  Business people also commonly use word processing and spreadsheet applications for which it is very convenient to see a large portion of the document.  Because of the target users and applications, color screens aren't really a neccessity.  We could hopefully keep the cost between $2000 and $3000.  Now, please don't write this off as completely ridiculous.  I really need some constructive feedback.  So, if you would, please reply to me via email and let me know: 1. If you would consider buying a \\\"full page\\\" laptop screen 2. How much you would be willing to pay for it 3.

Olson was still recovering from his late-season injury (knee, I believe), and there were questions as to whether he would be able to play before June.  And then Berryhill was dinged up.  I was looking forward to this, because I believe that Lopez can hit AND field the position.  Before last season, he was the Braves \\\"Defensive Catcher\\\" prospect, while Brian Deak was the Braves \\\"Offensive Catcher\\\" prospect.  Besides, Olson and Berryhill couldn't hit their way out of a wet cardboard box, and don't walk enough to be useful.  But Olson recovered quickly, Berryhill recovered, and the Braves went with the two vets.  I still say that if one of those two had been down at the start of the season, he wouldn't have gotten his job back.  2)  There is a certain logic to keeping Olson and Berryhill around. After all, ML catchers are in short supply and suffer from wear and tear.  There are teams out there without ONE average ML catcher (California and Seattle come to mind).  Certainly, trying to move Olson or Berryhill through waivers would be unlikely to work. Plus, you'd have to eat that salary, which isn't huge, but isn't tiddleywinks either (I think Olson's at about $800,000, Berryhill at $450,000, but that's only what I recall).  3)  Yes, I think arbitration-eligibility may have a role to play in this also.  What is it, that 5/6 of the 2+year players aren't eligible for arbitration?   Only the 1/6 that were on the roster the longest are eligible?  Of course, the system may change, but the extent of that change is not yet known.  From a business standpoint, it may make sense to keep Lopez down until June/the first time Olson/Berryhill go on the DL.  4)  I am still disappointed that Lopez isn't on the team. I still prefer to think of myself as a fan when it comes to the Braves, and the truth is that I'd rather see our best team on the field, which, IMO, includes Lopez.  Of course,today we play the Cubs.  Hopefully, we won't need him. ;)  As for the Schuerholz/Cox conversation, I imagine it went like this:  (Remember, they've BOTH been GM's) (the following is not meant to be read by the humor-impaired)  Cox:  OK, we've sent Jones down.  His fielding could be a little smoother.  Besides, Blauser can hit OK and his fielding is better than it used to be.  Schuerholz:  Well, we'll have to send Nieves down too.  Deion just won't sign that baseball only contract.  We can't count on him in October, so we have to keep Nixon around for the defense.  Besides, Gorman's not ready to give up on Billy Hatcher yet.  Once Hatcher's gone AND Deion signs, we can move Nixon for Frankie Rodriguez.  That ought to give us some pitching depth in 1995.  Cox:  Yep, that'll be nice.  Too bad Deion won't sign. OK, I'll look for Nieves when Justice starts having Berry-Berry...er, back problems again.  Now, what about Klesko?  Schuerholz:  Well, we've still got to fork out another 1.5 mil for Bream.  If we keep Klesko, we either lose the money or Cabrera.  I keep dangling Sid in front of Dal Maxwell, but somehow he doesn't seem to be the same GM.  First Jeffries for Jose, and now Whiten for Clark!  If he gets rid of Brian Jordan, then I'd HAVE to believe that he and Whitey Herzog switched bodies at the Winter Meetings!  Cox:  OK, keep trying on Bream, and I'll wait til the trading deadline for my Hunter/Klesko platoon.  Maybe I can get a few extra at-bats for Cabrera while we wait.  Try California... if Snow starts slowly, maybe WhiteyDal will bite on Sid. And if that doesn't work, then perhaps Sid's knees could be \\\"persuaded\\\" to act up.  There's always the 15-day DL!  Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha!  Schuerholz:  What about Caraballo?  Cox:  Well, he's not that much better than Lemke.  Maybe if he starts in Richmond, he'll start walking more.  Besides, if he's going to be arbitration-eligible, better to stretch him out so that we actually get some value from him before he makes the big bucks.  Schuerholz:  Now, let's see.  That leaves Lopez.  Cox:  NOOOOO!  I gotta keep Lopez!  Sure, I didn't think Olson would recover this quickly.  Maybe I can talk Caminiti into running into him again?  Schuerholz:  Nope, Lopez has gotta go.  You know that he'll get $3 million in arbitration.  May as well put it off that one extra year.  Besides, until Olson's shown his stuff a little bit, I can't trade him.  Besides, Berryhill's a left-handed hitter.  You know how rare that is?  Cox:  Don't you mean a left-handed whiffer?  Pretty common, if you ask me.  I mean, he made Pat Borders look good in the World Series.  PAT BORDERS!!!  Schuerholz:  Hey, you're the one who wouldn't write Lopez into the lineup.  Cox:  Well, you're the one who went out and got me Jeff Reardon!  Besides, I thought Lopez wouldn't be used to our pitching staff's stuff.  He got some time with them this spring...looked pretty good.  Come on, surely we only need to keep one stiff behind the plate?  Schuerholz:  Yeah, but which stiff?  Whichever one we keep will be hurt by May.  Cox:  OK, OK, you made your point.  Keep them both.  Surely one of them will be on the DL by June at the latest.  Then I can call up Lopez, and then we can win 110 games!  The Pennant! THE WORLD SERIES!  I'll be up there with John McGraw!  Casey Stengel!  Earl Weaver!  Oh, they laughed at me in Toronto, but have you ever had to deal with George Bell?  I'll finally get my just reward!  Mwa-ha-ha-ha!  Schuerholz:  Easy, Bobby.  Have you been taking those \\\"happy pills\\\" left around by Chuck Tanner?  Why'd you ever hire that guy anyhow?  Cox:  Don't ask me; ask Ted.  ------------------------------------------------------- Eric Roush  fierkelab@ bchm.biochem.duke.edu \\\"I am a Marxist, of the Groucho sort\\\" Grafitti, Paris, 1968  TANSTAAFL!

Did you ever read newspaper at all?   \\\"PAINFUL SEARCH ..\\\"  THE GRUESOME extent of February's killings of Azeris by Armenians in the town  of Hojali is at last emerging  in Azerbaijan - about 600 men,  women and  children dead  in the  worst outrage  of the four-year war over Nagorny Karabakh.  The figure  is drawn  from Azeri investigators,  Hojali officials and casualty lists published in the Baku press. Diplomats and aid workers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates.  The 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one of the last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full control of Nagorny Karabakh,  the subject of a new  round of negotiations in Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fighting retreat and  a massacre, but  investigators say that most  of the dead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was first suppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku. Later  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-stricken Azerbaijan's wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2,000 dead.  The State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov,  the cheif investigator of a 15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  \\\"Hojali Disaster\\\", said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum on preliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman Memmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed in the Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and more than 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700 dead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswoman of the Azeri Ministry of Defence.  FranCois Zen  Ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the International Red Cross  in Baku, said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of Agdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosque from  Hojali, most  of  them  civilians. \\\"We  did  not count  the bodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy,\\\" Mr Zen Ruffinen said. \\\"We have some idea since we gave the body bags and products to wash the dead.\\\"  Mr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the number of  dead in the  massacre. \\\"Don't  get worked up.  It will take  several months  to  get a  final  figure,\\\" the  43-year-old lawyer said at his small office.  Mr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years to reach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714 wounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist uprising in Baku in January 1990.  Those  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  power three weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly what  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70 miles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians.  Officially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, being the  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the republic's forensic department. \\\"This  is just a small percentage of the dead,\\\" said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic's chief forensic scientist. \\\"They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the chaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury our dead within 24 hours.\\\"  Of these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14 years old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 and axes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highland snows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs of deliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penises cut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov's report. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those believed to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said.  Files  from  Mr  Rasulov's  investigative  commission  are  still disorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, six policemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, the names of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. The most heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so far comes  from Towfiq  Manafov,  an Azeri  investigator  who took  a helicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  27 February.  \\\"There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to count properly: 470-500  in Hojali, 650-700 people  by the stream and the road and 85-100  visible around Nakhchivanik village,\\\" Mr Manafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter pilot.  \\\"People waved up  to us for help. We saw  three dead children and one  two-year-old alive  by  one  dead woman.  The  live one  was pulling at her arm for the mother to get up. We tried to land but Armenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had to return.\\\"  There  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  in circulation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last few months and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in Hojali at the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages taken over by Armenian forces.  THE INDEPENDENT, London, 12/6/'92   HEROES WHO FOUGHT ON AMID THE BODIES  AREF  SADIKOV sat  quietly  in the  shade of  a  cafe-bar on  the Caspian Sea  esplanade of Baku and  showed a line of  stitches in his trousers, torn  by an Armenian bullet as he  fled the town of Hojali just over three months ago, writes Hugh Pope.  \\\"I'm still  wearing the same  clothes, I don't have  any others,\\\" the  51-year-old carpenter  said,  beginning his  account of  the Hojali disaster. \\\"I was wounded in five places, but I am lucky to be alive.\\\"  Mr Sadikov and  his wife were short of  food, without electricity for more than a month, and cut off from helicopter flights for 12 days. They  sensed the  Armenian noose was tightening  around the 2,000 to  3,000 people left in  the straggling Azeri town  on the edge of Karabakh.  \\\"At about 11pm  a bombardment started such as we  had never heard before,  eight  or  nine   kinds  of  weapons,  artillery,  heavy machine-guns, the lot,\\\" Mr Sadikov said.  Soon neighbours were  pouring down the street  from the direction of  the  attack. Some  huddled  in  shelters but  others  started fleeing the town,  down a hill, through a stream  and through the snow into a forest on the other side.  To escape, the  townspeople had to reach the Azeri  town of Agdam about 15  miles away. They  thought they  were going to  make it, until at  about dawn  they reached a  bottleneck between  the two Armenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak.  \\\"None of my group was hurt up to then ... Then we were spotted by a  car on  the road,  and the  Armenian outposts  started opening fire,\\\" Mr Sadikov said.  Azeri militiamen fighting their way  out of Hojali rushed forward to force  open a  corridor for the  civilians, but  their efforts were mostly  in vain.  Mr Sadikov  said only  10 people  from his group of  80 made it  through, including his wife  and militiaman son.  Seven  of  his  immediate  relations  died,  including  his 67-year-old elder brother.  \\\"I only had time to reach down  and cover his face with his hat,\\\" he said, pulling his own big  flat Turkish cap over his eyes. \\\"We have never got any of the bodies back.\\\"  The first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire. One hero  of the  evacuation, Alif  Hajief, was  shot dead  as he struggled to change  a magazine while covering  the third group's crossing, Mr Sadikov said.  Another hero,  Elman Memmedov, the  mayor of Hojali, said  he and several others  spent the whole day  of 26 February in  the bushy hillside, surrounded by  dead bodies as they tried  to keep three Armenian armoured personnel carriers at bay.  As the  survivors staggered the  last mile into Agdam,  there was little comfort  in a town from  which most of the  population was soon to flee.  \\\"The night  after we reached  the town  there was a  big Armenian rocket attack. Some people just  kept going,\\\" Mr Sadikov said. \\\"I had to  get to the  hospital for treatment. I  was in a  bad way. They even found a bullet in my sock.\\\"  Victims of  war: An  Azeri woman  mourns her  son, killed  in the Hojali massacre in February  (left).

San Jose and Ottawa have instability at the GM position, something that Philly, NYI, Edmonton, and Calgary did not have when they won their first Cups.

Save your almost maniacal devotion to the almighty      plus/minus ... it is the most misleading hockey stat available.       Until the NHL publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice      time per game and some measure of its \\\"quality\\\" (i.e., is the player put out      in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game; is he matched up      against the other team's top one or two lines; short-handed, etc), I would      much rather see the +/- disappear altogether instead of having its dubious      merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications.  Thank you for posting this.  As the person who first brought up the fact that Jagr has a much higher +/- than Francis, I can assure you that I brought it up as an example of the absurdity of +/- comparisons, even on the same team.  I never, ever thought that anyone would argue that Jagr's higher +/- actually reflected better two-way play.  In my opinion, Francis's low +/- is purely a result of him being asked to play against opponents top scorers at all times; the fact that he can chip in 100 points while neutralizing the other team's top center is a testament to how valuable he is, even if his +/- suffers.  On the other hand, Jagr, for how big, fast and skilled he is, can't even get 90 points, no matter how inflated his +/- is.  (By the way, don't get me wrong -- I like Jagr.  He may be a lazy floater, but he turns it on at exactly the right times -- like overtime of playoff games). \",\"   The 5426 has its own set of drivers.

True, but that is exactly the \\\"problem\\\": the Mormon extermination order was issued not just by a Christian, it was ALLOWED under the Constitution of the United States, which was instituted precisely to prevent incidents like this \\\"order\\\" from occurring in the first place...

I would echo that question.  I'm not trying to be    contentious.  But assuming that the Pope has universal jurisdiction    and authority, what authority do you rely upon for your decisions?    What prevents me from choosing ANY doctrine I like and saying that    Papal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time?    This is especially true, since Councils of Bishops have basically    stood by the Pope.  The ultimate question is the traditional theology of the Church.  This is the *only* thing that it is possible to resist a Pope for: his departure from the traditional doctrine of the Church.  If commands from *any* authority conflict with Tradition, the commands must be disobeyed.  My own view on this is that this conflict could only happen in a major way.  God would never allow a hair-splitting situation to develop; it would be too complex for people to figure out.  I don't view the present situation in the Church as anything extremely complicated. Run through a list of what has happened in the last 30 years in the Catholic Church, and any impartial observer will be aghast.     It appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter is    disagreements over what is tradition and Tradition, and also over    authority and discipline.    The problems stem from a general widespread ignorance of the Catholic Faith, in my opinion.  Most Catholics know about zilch about the Catholic Faith; this leaves them wide open for destruction by erring bishops.  It's basically the Reformation part II.  There is not even a question in my mind that in some respects the shards of the Catholic Church are currently being trampled upon by the Catholic hierarchy.  I could go on listing shocking things for an hour, probably.  Take the situation in Campos, Brazil, for example.  I'm reading a book on what happened there after Vatican Council II.  The bishop, Antonio de Castro-Mayer, never introduced all the changes that followed in the wake of Vatican II.  He kept the traditional Mass, the same old catechisms, etc.  He made sure the people knew their faith, the Catholic theology of obedience, what Modernism was, etc.  He innoculated the people against what was coming.  Well, one day the order came from Rome for his retirement.  It came when the Pope was sick.  Bishop de Castro-Mayer waited until the Pope recovered, then inquired whether this command was what the Pope really wanted, or something that some Liberal had commanded in his absence. The Pope confirmed the decision.  So the good bishop retired.  The injustice that followed was completely incredible.  A new bishop was installed.  He proceeded to expel most of bishop de Castro-Mayer's clergy from their churches, because they refused to celebrate the New Mass.  The new bishop would visit a parish, and celebrate a New Mass. The people would promptly walk out of the church en masse.  The bishop was *enraged* by this.  He usually resorted to enlisting the help of the secular authorities to eject the priest from the church.  The priests would just start building new churches; the people were completely behind them.  The old parishes had the New Mass, as the bishop desired -- and virtually no parishioners.  The prime motivation for all this was completely illegal, according to canon law.  No priest can be penalized in any way for saying the traditional Mass, because of legislation enacted by Pope Saint Pius V. Nor is there any obligation to say the New Mass.  During all this process, the people of Campos, not just private individuals, but including civil authorities, were constantly sending petitions and letters to Rome to do something about the new Modernist bishop.  NOTHING was ever done; no help ever arrived from Rome. Eventually 37 priests were kicked out, and about 40,000 people.     My question to the supporters of SSPX is this:    Is there ANY way that your positions with respect to church reforms   could change and be conformed to those of the Pope? (assuming that   the Pope's position does not change and that the leaders of SSPX   don't jointly make such  choice.)     If not, this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority.    If I adopt the view that \\\"I'm NOT wrong, I CAN'T be wrong, and    there's NO WAY I'll change my mind, YOU must change yours\\\", that    I've either left the Catholic Church or it has left me.  If the Pope defines certain things ex cathedra, that would be the end of the controversy.  That process is all very well understood in Catholic theology, and anyone who doesn't go along with it is an instant non-Catholic.  The problem here is that people do not appreciate what is going on in the Catholic world.  If they knew the Faith, and what our bishops are doing, they would be shocked!     We sould argue from now until the Second Coming about what the \\\"real\\\"    traditional teaching of the Church is.  If this were a simple matter    East and West would not have been separated for over 900 years.  This isn't the case in the Catholic Church.  There is a massive body of traditional teaching.  The Popes of the last 150 years are especially relevant.  There is no question at all what the traditional doctrine is.     I thought that the teaching magisterieum of the church did not allow    error in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term.`    I may be wrong here, I'm not Roman Catholic. :-)  That's heresy, more or less.  Although they have done a great job since the Reformation, the last 30 years have seen so many errors spread that it's pitiful.  Infallibility rests in the Pope, and in the Church as a whole.  In the short term, a Pope, or large sections of the Church can go astray.  In fact, that's what usually happens during a major heresy: large sections of the Church go astray.  (The Pope historically has been much more reliable.)  Everything will always come back in the long run.     What would be the effect of a Pope making an ex cathedra statement    regarding the SSPX situation?  Would it be honored?  If not, how    do you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility?    Again, I'm not trying to be contentions, I'm trying to understand.    Since I'm Orthodox, I've got no real vested interest in the outcome,    one way or the other.  Yes, it would be honored.  Infallibility is infallibility.  But what is he going to define?  That the New Mass is a better expression of the Catholic Faith than the old?  That sex education in the Catholic schools is wonderful?  That all religions are wonderful except for that professed by the Popes prior to Vatican II?     It does if the command was legitimate.  SSPX does not view the    Pope's commands as legitimate.  Why?  This is a VERY slippery slope.\",\" It is interesting that you posted those lyrics, because just the other day I was thinking of doing the same.  I like those lyrics, since whenever I am approached by judgemental, pharisitical, evangelical fundamentalists who throw the Bible at me because I have long hair, wear a black leather jacket, and listen to Black Sabbath, I have something to throw back.  Usually their chins drop and they come up speechless over those not very satanic lyrics.

It (this FAQ, not RIPEM) was written and will be maintained by Marc VanHeyningen <mvanheyn@cs.indiana.edu>.  It will be posted to a variety of newsgroups on a monthly basis; follow-up discussion specific to RIPEM is redirected to the group alt.security.ripem.  WHAT'S NEW ---------- I am now running a World Wide Web archive of RIPEM information.  It does not contain much of anything that isn't available elsewhere, but it has convenient pointers to the most current version of this FAQ and some other stuff.  The URL is \\\"http://cs.indiana.edu/ripem/dir.html\\\".  This month's version has a fair amount of new pointers to information on patents and stuff like that.  I've also reordered a few things to have a more sensible ordering.  I hope I don't have to edit this again soon. :-)  DISCLAIMER ---------- Nothing in this FAQ should be considered legal advice, or anything other than one layperson's opinion.  If you want real legal advice, talk to a real lawyer, preferably one with experience in patent law, export regulations, or whatever area of law is in question.  LIST OF QUESTIONS ----------------- 1)  What is RIPEM? 2)  How can I get RIPEM? 3)  Will RIPEM run on my machine? 4)  Will RIPEM work with my mailer? 5)  What is RSA? 6)  What is DES? 7)  What is a fingerprint, like MD5? 8)  What is PEM? 9)  What's this about distributing and authenticating keys? 10)  Isn't it a bad idea to use patented algorithms in standards like PEM? 11)  What about RSADSI/PKP? 12)  Why do all RIPEM public keys look very similar? 13)  What is PGP? 14)  What about RPEM? 15)  What is MIME? 16)  What is TIS/PEM? 17)  I have this simple way to defeat the security of RIPEM...  QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ---------------------  1)  What is RIPEM?   RIPEM is a (not yet complete, but useful) implementation of Privacy  Enhanced Mail (PEM).  RIPEM allows your electronic mail to have the  four security facilities provided by PEM: disclosure protection  (optional), originator authenticity, message integrity measures, and  non-repudiation of origin (always).  (See: \\\"What is PEM?\\\")   RIPEM was written primarily by Mark Riordan <mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu>.  Most of the code is in the public domain, except for the RSA routines,  which are a library called RSAREF licensed from RSA Data Security Inc.   The current version of RIPEM is 1.0.5; the current version of the  Macintosh port of RIPEM is 0.7.  2)  How can I get RIPEM?   RIPEM uses the library of cryptographic routines RSAREF, which is  considered munitions and thus is export-restricted from distribution  to persons who are not citizens or permanent residents in the U.S or  Canada without an export license.  No such license has been obtained  (nor would one likely be granted unless the RSA key exchange were  shortened to 512 bits and the symmetric cipher changed to something  weaker than DES.  There are some suggestions that this situation may  change now that Clinton is in office.)  The author requests in the  README file that this law not be violated:   #Please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution  #outside of the USA or Canada.  This is a personal request from me,  #the author of RIPEM, and a condition of your use of RIPEM.   Note that RSAREF is not in the public domain, and a license for it is  included with the distribution.  You should read it before using  RIPEM.   RIPEM is available via anonymous FTP to citizens and permanent  residents in the U.S. from rsa.com; cd to rsaref/ and read the README  file for info.  Note that the non-RSAREF portion of RIPEM is not a  product of RSA Data Security, Incorporated; they merely are helping  distribute it.   RIPEM, as well as some other crypt stuff, has its \\\"home site\\\" on  ripem.msu.edu, which is open to non-anonymous FTP for users in the  U.S. and Canada who are citizens or permanent residents.  To find out  how to obtain access, FTP there, cd to pub/crypt/, and read the file  GETTING_ACCESS.  For convenience, binaries for many architectures are  available here in addition to the full source tree.  3)  Will RIPEM run on my machine?   Probably.  It has already been ported to MS-DOS and most flavors of  Unix (SunOS, NeXT, Linux, AIX, ULTRIX, Solaris, etc.)  Ports to  Macintosh include a standard UNIX-style port and a rather nice  Mac-like port written by Raymond Lau, author of StuffIt.  More ports  are expected, and help of users is invited.  4)  Will RIPEM work with my mailer?   Probably.  How easy and clean the effective interface is will depend  on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer, though.  The users  guide, included with the distribution, discusses ways to use RIPEM  with many popular mailers, including Berkeley, mush, Elm, and MH.  Code is also included in elisp to allow easy use of RIPEM inside GNU  Emacs.   If you make a new interface for RIPEM or create an improvement on one  in the distribution which you believe is convenient to use, secure,  and may be useful to others, feel free to post it to alt.security.ripem.  5)  What is RSA?   RSA is a crypto system which is asymmetric, or public-key.  This means  that there are two different, related keys: one to encrypt and one to  decrypt.  Because one cannot (reasonably) be derived from the other,  you may publish your encryption, or public, key widely and keep your  decryption, or private, key to yourself.  Anyone can use your public  key to encrypt a message, but only you hold the private key needed to  decrypt it.  Note that the \\\"message\\\" sent with RSA is normally just  the DES key to the real plaintext. (See \\\"What is DES?\\\")   Note that the above only provides for disclosure protection.  For  originator authenticity, message integrity, and non-repudiation of  origin services to be implemented, the fingerprint of the message  (See \\\"What is a fingerprint, like MD5?\\\") is encrypted with the  sender's private key.  The recipient, or a dispute-resolving  authority, can use the sender's public key to decrypt it and confirm  that the message must have come from the sender and was not altered.   RSA was named for the three men (Rivest, Shamir and Adleman) who  invented it.  To find out lots more about RSA and modern cryptography  in general, ftp to rsa.com and look in pub/faq/.  Some information  also may be in sci.crypt.  6)  What is DES?   DES is the Data Encryption Standard, a widely used symmetric, or  secret-key, crypto system.  Unlike RSA, DES uses the same key to  encrypt and decrypt messages.  However, DES is much faster than RSA.   RIPEM uses both DES and RSA; it generates a random key and encrypts  your mail with DES using that key.  It then encrypts that key with the  recipient's public RSA key and includes the result in the letter,  allowing the recipient to recover the DES key.   DES is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a  key length considered too short by modern standards.  However, it  should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large  corporation or government agency.  It is not likely that the PEM  standard will incorporate support for other symmetric ciphers in the  near future, because there is a strong feeling that PEM should be  stable so it can become utilized widely without early problems with  interoperability.  7)  What is a fingerprint, like MD5?   MD5 is a message digest algorithm produced by RSA Data Security Inc.  It provides a 128-bit fingerprint, or cryptographically secure hash,  of the plaintext.  It is cryptographically secure because it is not  possible (in a reasonable amount of computation) to produce a  different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint.  Thus,  instead of signing the entire message with the sender's private key,  only the MD5 of the message needs to be signed for authentication.   MD5s can also be exchanged directly for authentication; for example,  RIPEM public keys include an MD5 of the public key in the file, so  parties wishing to confirm their keys are authentic via a separate  channel merely need exchange MD5s of keys and verify their accuracy.   MD5 is sometimes used for other purposes; for example, it is often  used to map an input of arbitrary length to 128 bits of data, as a  passphrase interpreter or cookie generator.   MD5 is described in its entirety (including an implementation in C) in  RFC 1321.   There have been some recent suggestions that MD5 may not be as strong  a hash as was originally believed; presumably some other hash  function will be used if this is accepted as true.  8)  What is PEM?   PEM is Privacy Enhanced Mail, a standard for allowing transfer of  encrypted electronic mail generated over a long period of time by a  working group of experts.  It is described in RFCs 1421-1424; these  documents have been approved and obsolete the old RFCs 1113-1115.   RIPEM is not really a complete implementation of PEM, because PEM  specifies certificates for authenticating keys, which RIPEM does not  handle at this time.  Their addition is planned.  9)  What's this about distributing and authenticating keys?   For a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you, she must know  your public key.  For you to be able to confirm that the message  received came from her, you must know her public key.  It is important  that this information be accurate; if a \\\"bad guy\\\" convinces her that  his key is in fact yours, she will send messages which he can read.   RIPEM allows for three methods of key management: a central server,  the distributed finger servers, and a flat file.  All three are  described in the RIPEM users guide which is part of the distribution.  None of them provide perfect security.  The PEM standard calls for  key management by certificates; the addition of this feature to RIPEM  is planned, but chicken-egg issues still exist.  10)  Isn't it a bad idea to use patented algorithms in standards like PEM?   This issue has been considered in the standards process.  RFC 1310,  the specification for Internet standards, has a discussion (section  6) on what specifications for nondiscriminatory availability must be  met for a patented method to be included in a standard.  RFC 1421  addresses this issue with regard to the patents covering public-key  cryptography.   This does not, of course, mean that all questions are settled or that  everyone is in agreement.  An interesting exchange on the use of  patented algorithms in standards with regard to public-key  cryptography is in the League for Programming Freedom archive  (available via FTP: ftp.uu.net:/doc/lpf) in the files bidzos.letter  and bidzos.response.  (Amusingly, the LPF files on ftp.uu.net are  compressed with a patented algorithm.)  11)  What about RSADSI/PKP?   RSA Data Security, Inc. (RSADSI) is a California-based company  specializing in cryptographic technologies.  Public Key Partners is a  firm which holds exclusive sub-licensing rights of the following U.S.  patents and all of their corresponding foreign patents:        Cryptographic Apparatus and Method       (\\\"Diffie-Hellman\\\")............................... No. 4,200,770        Public Key Cryptographic Apparatus       and Method (\\\"Hellman-Merkle\\\").................... No. 4,218,582        Cryptographic Communications System and       Method (\\\"RSA\\\")................................... No. 4,405,829        Exponential Cryptographic Apparatus       and Method (\\\"Hellman-Pohlig\\\").................... No. 4,424,414   PKP claims these four patents cover all known methods of public key  cryptography.  The two businesses are rather closely related (for  example, the same person, Jim Bidzos, is president of both of them.)  PKP has licensed this technology to a considerable number of  companies (IBM, DEC, Motorola, AT&T, Lotus...) for use in their  products.  PKP has also threatened and filed lawsuits defending their  patents.   RIPEM was originally created with no connection to RSADSI other than  its use of the RSAREF library, and for no reason other than its  author's desire to see widespread use of public-key cryptography.  However, after the ball started rolling, people at RSADSI got  interested.  RSADSI decided to carry RIPEM on its FTP site, and some  people there started making their own RIPEM keys and contributing  code.  RIPEM even won the \\\"Best Application Built on RSAREF in 1992\\\"  award.  12)  Why do all RIPEM public keys look very similar?   RIPEM public keys begin with a PKCS (Public-Key Cryptography  Standards) identifier describing various characteristics about the  key, so the first bunch of characters in your key may be the same as  those of lots of other people's keys.  This does not mean your keys  are similar, but only that they are the same class of key, were  generated with the same program, are of the same length, etc.  13)  What is PGP?   PGP is another cryptographic mail program called Pretty Good Privacy.  PGP has been around longer than RIPEM, and works somewhat differently.  PGP is not compatible with RIPEM in any way, though PGP does also use RSA.   A few major differences between PGP and RIPEM:   - PGP has more key management features, particularly for users without    a direct network connection.   - RIPEM conforms to the PEM RFCs and thus has a greater probability    of working with other PEM software.  PGP makes no attempt to be    compatible with anything other than itself.   - RIPEM uses RSAREF, a library of RSA routines from RSADSI which    comes with a license allowing noncommercial use.  PGP uses its own    implementation of RSA.  PKP claims that it is a violation of its    patents to \\\"make, use or sell\\\" PGP in the U.S. or Canada without    either a license or written permission.  (See: \\\"DISCLAIMER\\\")    (See: \\\"What about RSADSI/PKP?\\\")  Phil Zimmermann, the author of    PGP, stopped distributing it after being threatened with legal    action; he believed that a licensing scheme could be arranged, but    it hasn't happened and there seems little prospect of it happening    in the future.  He acknowledges in the PGP User's Guide:     #In fact, if you live in the USA, and you are not a Federal agency,     #you shouldn't actually run PGP on your computer, because Public    #Key Partners wants to forbid you from running my software.  PGP is    #contraband.   - Both PGP and RIPEM are export-restricted, and cannot be sent outside    the U.S. and Canada without an export license.  However, PGP    already exists on many ftp sites in Europe and other places.   Whether you use PGP or RIPEM or whatever, the documentation to PGP is  recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues.  Unfortunately, it's not distributed separately from the program,  which can be difficult to find in the U.S. on FTP sites due to  liability concerns.  14)  What about RPEM?   RPEM stands for Rabin Privacy Enhanced Mail.  It was similar to RIPEM,  but used a public-key cipher invented by Rabin (which is not RSA) in  an attempt to avoid the patents on public-key systems.  It was  written by Mark Riordan, who later wrote RIPEM.   Its distribution was halted when, contrary to the beliefs of many  (including Rabin), PKP claimed that their patents were broad enough  to cover the cipher employed.  This claim is not universally  accepted, but was not challenged for pragmatic reasons.   RPEM is not really used anymore.  It is not compatible with RIPEM or PGP.  15)  What is MIME?   MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, and is  described in RFC 1341.  You can find out about it in the newsgroup  comp.mail.mime; a FAQ exists on it.  How PEM should interact with  MIME is not yet entirely clear; some people use the stopgap solution  of having a MIME type application/x-ripem in order to send RIPEM  messages as MIME ones.  I hope some standards will emerge.  Draft  Internet documents exist on the matter.  16)  What is TIS/PEM?   Trusted Information Systems is working on a version of Privacy  Enhanced Mail for general availability.  Last I heard, it was  rumored to be integrated into an existing mail user agent (MH)  rather than a stand-alone system, and in beta test.  I don't know  much more than that.  17)  I have this simple way to defeat the security of RIPEM...\",\"dwight tuinstra posts a very interesting message in which he comments on the effects of the Clipper chip on state and local police.

It (this FAQ, not RIPEM) was written and will be maintained by Marc VanHeyningen, <mvanheyn@whale.cs.indiana.edu>.  It will be posted to a variety of newsgroups on a monthly basis; follow-up discussion specific to RIPEM is redirected to the group alt.security.ripem.  This month, I have reformatted this posting in an attempt to comply with the standards for HyperText FAQ formatting to allow easy manipulation of this document over the World Wide Web.  Let me know what you think.  DISCLAIMER ---------- Nothing in this FAQ should be considered legal advice, or anything other than one person's opinion.  If you want real legal advice, talk to a real lawyer.  QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ---------------------  1)  What is RIPEM?   RIPEM is a program which performs Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) using  the cryptographic techniques of RSA and DES.  It allows your  electronic mail to have the properties of authentication (i.e. who  sent it can be confirmed) and privacy (i.e. nobody can read it except  the intended recipient.)   RIPEM was written primarily by Mark Riordan <mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu>.  Most of the code is in the public domain, except for the RSA routines,  which are a library called RSAREF licensed from RSA Data Security Inc.  2)  How can I get RIPEM?   RIPEM contains the library of cryptographic routines RSAREF, which is  considered munitions and thus is export-restricted from distribution  to people who are not citizens or permanent residents of the U.S. or  Canada.  Therefore, the following request is quoted from the README  file:   #Please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution  #outside of the USA or Canada.  This is a personal request from me,  #the author of RIPEM, and a condition of your use of RIPEM.   Note that RSAREF is not in the public domain, and a license for it is  included with the distribution.  You should read it before using  RIPEM.   The best way to get it is to ask a friend for a copy, since this will  reduce the load on those sites that do carry it (not to mention the  humans that run them.)  Naturally this requires that you trust the  friend.   RIPEM is available via anonymous FTP to citizens and permanent residents  in the U.S. from rsa.com; cd to rsaref/ and read the README file for  info.  Last I looked, this site contains only the source tree, and  does not contain compiled binaries or the nice Mac version.   RIPEM, as well as some other crypt stuff, has its \\\"home site\\\" on  rpub.cl.msu.edu, which is open to non-anonymous FTP for users in the  U.S. and Canada who are citizens or permanent residents.  To find out  how to obtain access, ftp there, cd to pub/crypt/, and read the file  GETTING_ACCESS.  For convenience, binaries for many architectures are  available here in addition to the full source tree.  3)  Will RIPEM run on my machine?   Probably.  It has already been ported to MS-DOS and most flavors of  Unix (SunOS, NeXT, Linux, AIX, ULTRIX, Solaris, etc.)  Ports to  Macintosh include a standard UNIX-style port and a rather nice  Mac-like port written by Raymond Lau, author of StuffIt.  More ports  are expected, and help of users is invited.  4)  Will RIPEM work with my mailer?   Probably.  How easy and clean the effective interface is will depend  on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer, though.  The users  guide, included with the distribution, discusses ways to use RIPEM  with many popular mailers, including Berkeley, mush, Elm, and MH.  Code is also included in elisp to allow easy use of RIPEM inside GNU  Emacs.   If you make a new interface for RIPEM or create an improvement on one  in the distribution which you believe is convenient to use, secure,  and may be useful to others, feel free to post it to alt.security.ripem.  5)  What is RSA?   RSA is a crypto system which is asymmetric, or public-key.  This means  that there are two different, related keys: one to encrypt and one to  decrypt.  Because one cannot (reasonably) be derived from the other,  you may publish your encryption, or public key widely and keep your  decryption, or private key to yourself.  Anyone can use your public  key to encrypt a message, but only you hold the private key needed to  decrypt it.  (Note that the \\\"message\\\" sent with RSA is normally just  the DES key to the real message. (See \\\"What is DES?\\\")   Note that the above only provides for privacy.  For authentication,  the fingerprint of the message (See \\\"What is a fingerprint, like  MD5?\\\") is encrypted with the sender's private key.  The recipient can  use the sender's public key to decrypt it and confirm that the message  must have come from the sender.   RSA was named for the three men (Rivest, Shamir and Adleman) who  invented it.  To find out more about RSA, ftp to rsa.com and look in  pub/faq/ or look in sci.crypt.  6)  What is DES?   DES is the Data Encryption Standard, a widely used symmetric, or  secret-key, crypto system.  Unlike RSA, DES uses the same key to  encrypt and decrypt messages.  However, DES is much faster than RSA.   RIPEM uses both DES and RSA; it generates a random key and encrypts  your mail with DES using that key.  It then encrypts that key with the  recipient's public RSA key and includes the result in the letter,  allowing the recipient to recover the DES key.   DES is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a  key length considered too short by modern standards.  However, it  should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large  corporation or government agency.  It is not unlikely that future  RIPEMs will strengthen the symmetric cipher, possibly by using  multiple encryption with DES.  7)  What is PEM, and how does RIPEM relate?   PEM is Privacy Enhanced Mail, a system for allowing easy transfer of  encrypted electronic mail.  It is described in RFCs 1421-1424; these  documents have been approved and obsolete the old RFCs 1113-1115.   RIPEM is not really a complete implementation of PEM, because PEM  specifies certificates for authenticating keys, which RIPEM does not  handle at this time.  Their addition is planned.  8)  What's this about distributing and authenticating keys?   For a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you, she must know  your public key.  For you to be able to confirm that the message  received came from her, you must know her public key.  It is important  that this information be accurate; if a \\\"bad guy\\\" convinces her that  his key is in fact yours, she will send messages which he can read.   RIPEM allows for three methods of key management: a central server,  the distributed finger servers, and a flat file.  All three are  described in the RIPEM users guide which is part of the distribution.  None of them provide perfect security.  9)  Why do all RIPEM public keys look very similar?   RIPEM public keys begin with a PKCS identifier describing various  characteristics about the key, so the first bunch of characters in  your key may be the same as those of lots of other people's keys.  This does not mean your keys are similar, but only that they are the  same class of key, were generated with the same program, are of the  same length, etc.  10)  What is a fingerprint, like MD5?   MD5 is a message digest algorithm produced by RSA Data Security Inc.  It provides a 128-bit fingerprint, or cryptographically secure hash,  of the plaintext.  It is cryptographically secure because it is not  possible (in a reasonable amount of computation) to produce a  different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint.  Thus,  instead of signing the entire message with the sender's private key,  only the MD5 of the message needs to be signed for authentication.   MD5 is sometimes used for other purposes; for example, it is often  used to map an input of arbitrary length to 128 bits of data, as a  passphrase interpreter or cookie generator.   MD5 is described in its entirety (including an implementation in C) in  RFC 1321.  11)  What is PGP?   PGP is another cryptographic mail program called Pretty Good Privacy.  PGP has been around longer than RIPEM, and works somewhat differently.  PGP is not compatible with RIPEM in any way, though PGP does also use RSA.   Some major differences between PGP and RIPEM:   - PGP has more key management features, particularly for users without    a direct network connection.   - RIPEM conforms to the PEM RFCs and thus has a greater probability of    working with other PEM software.  PGP makes no attempt to be compatible    with anything other than PGP (in fact, PGP 1.0 is not compatible with    PGP 2.0.)   - RIPEM uses RSAREF, a library of RSA routines from RSA Data Security    Inc.  RSAREF comes with a license which allows noncommercial use.    PGP uses its own implementation of RSA which is not licensed; thus,    PKP, the firm holding the U.S. patents on the RSA algorithm, claims    that it is a infringement of that patent to make, use or sell PGP in    the U.S. or Canada.  In acknowledgement of this, PGP's original    author, Phil Zimmermann, says in the documentation:     #In fact, if you live in the USA, and you are not a Federal agency,     #you shouldn't actually run PGP on your computer, because Public    #Key Partners wants to forbid you from running my software.  PGP is    #contraband.     - Both PGP and RIPEM are export-restricted, and cannot be sent outside    the U.S. and Canada.  However, PGP already exists on many ftp sites    in Europe and other places.   Whether you use PGP or RIPEM or whatever, the documentation to PGP is  recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues.   Note that the above facts, both regarding patent and export  restrictions, are somewhat controversial; many people think it  shouldn't be that way, and some people interpret various documents  differently.  Unfortunately, discussions of it on the net inevitably  seem to produce more heat than light, and probably belong in  misc.legal.computing.  (See:  \\\"DISCLAIMER\\\")  12)  What about RPEM?   RPEM stands for Rabin Privacy Enhanced Mail.  It was similar to RIPEM,  but used a public-key cipher invented by Rabin (which is not RSA) in  an attempt to avoid the patent on RSA.  It was written by Mark  Riordan, the same author as RIPEM.   Its distribution was halted when, contrary to the beliefs of many  (including Rabin), Public Key Partners (PKP) claimed that their patent  was broad enough to cover any public-key cipher whose strength rested  in the difficulty of factoring products of large primes, not just RSA.  This claim is not universally accepted by any means, but was not  challenged for pragmatic reasons.   RPEM is not really used anymore.  It is not compatible with RIPEM or PGP.  13)  What is MIME?   MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, and is  described in RFC 1341.  You can find out about it in the newsgroup  comp.mail.mime.  How PEM should interact with MIME is not yet entirely  clear; some people use the stopgap solution of having a MIME type  application/x-ripem in order to send RIPEM messages as MIME ones.  I  hope some standards will emerge.  Draft Internet documents exist on  the matter.  14)  I have this simple way to defeat the security of RIPEM...\",\"     \",\" This is the one part that really scares me.

I installed the newest drivers from Asante's ftp server.  The problem begins when I attach one more device to the SCSI chain - specifically a 50MB drive. I power up the drive, then the Mac. The Mac tests memory, etc. Just before the \\\"happy Mac face\\\" normally shows up, the power light on the EN/SC goes out, and the boot process stops. So I can use the network, or the external drive, but not both at once. This makes the Asante box pretty much unusable.  It doesn't look like a purely electrical SCSI problem, because if I turn on the drive just a second or so too late, so that it doesn't get noticed during the initial SCSI polling, the Mac boots normally and the adapter works, even though the hard disk is powered on and connected. The Mac has *never* once failed to boot from its internal drive up to now (and I've had it for over a year).  Here is what I tried: changing the SCSI ID's of the EN/SC and the disk -- several permutations; changing the order of devices, i.e. the EN/SC at the head or tail of the chain; overterminating with an external terminator (both devices have internal ones); underterminating, i.e. removing internal resistors from the hard disk; trying another EN/SC box; trying another identical drive; trying several different SCSI cables.

Two major differences in the running gear (that I'm aware of) need study. My '79 has a solid front axle housing whereas the newer models have independant front suspension. The solid axle is theoretically stronger and more reliable than the newer model, but only experience will tell. The independant front suspension is, no doubt, a compromise made to satisfy the typical user, who will never need a real utility vehicle. The second difference is the type of transfer case used on the newer models. I'm not sure, but I think Tioyota went to a full-time 4WD or all-wheel drive system.

But later, and especially after the bunker full of civilians was hit, they changed their tone.  It seemed to me that they didn't have the stomach for the reality of war, that innocent people really do die and are maimed in warfare.  It's like they were only pro-Gulf-War as long as it was \\\"nice and clean\\\" (smart missiles dropping in on military HQs), but not when pictures of dead, dying, and maimed civilians started cropping up.  What naive hypocrites!   [ discussion about blanket-bombing and A-bombs deleted.]                             ^^^^^^^^^  I should have said here \\\"militarily justified\\\".  It seems from your comments below that you understood this as meaning \\\"morally justified\\\". I apologize.   I have often wondered about this.  I've always thought that the first bomb should have been dropped on Japan's island fortress of Truk.  A good, inpenatrable military target.  The second bomb could've been held back for use on an industrial center if need be.  But I digress.  Yes, I have heard that we found evidence (after the war, BTW) that Japan was seriously considering surrender after the first bomb.  Unfortunately, the military junta won out over the moderates and rejected the US's ulimatum.  Therefore the second bomb was dropped.  Most unfortunate, IMO.   I don't regret the fact that sometimes military decisions have to be made which affect the lives of innocent people.  But I do regret the  circumstances which make those decisions necessary, and I regret the suffering caused by those decisions.    [...]   Actually, it was the fact that both situations existed that prompted US and allied action.  If some back-water country took over some other back-water country, we probably wouldn't intervene.  Not that we don't care, but we can't be the world's policman.  Or if a coup had occured in Kuwait (instead of an invasion), then we still wouldn't have acted because there would not have been the imminent danger perceived to Saudi Arabia.  But the combination of the two, an unprovoked invasion by a genocidal tyrant AND the potential danger to the West's oil  interests, caused us to take action.   [...]  I'm not setting up a strawman at all.  If you want to argue against the war, then the only logical alternative was to allow Hussein to keep Kuwait.  Diplomatic alternatives, including sanctions, were ineffective.  Well, in a sense, yes.  They probably had no idea of what end Hitler would lead their nation to.   They suffered along with the rest.  Why does this bother you so much? The world is full of evil, and circumstances are not perfect.  Many innocents suffer due to the wrongful actions of others.  It it regretable, but that's The-Way-It-Is.  There are no perfect solutions.  [...]  Probably because we're not the saviors of the world.  We can't police each and every country that decides to self-destruct or invade another.  Nor are we in a strategic position to get relief to Tibet, East Timor, or some other places.  Tell me how we could stop them and I'll support it.  I, for one, do not agree with the present US policy of \\\"sucking up to them\\\" as you put it. I agree that it is deplorable.   Are they?  Or are they supposed to reflect the population of the locale where the trial is held?  (Normally this is where the crime is committed unless one party or the other can convince the judge a change of venue is in order.)  I'm not an expert on California law, or even US law, but it seems that this is the way the system is set up.  You can criticize the system, but let's not have unfounded allegations of racial  prejudice thrown around.   No, not at all.  The point is that the fact that there were no blacks on the first jury and that Rodney King is black is totally irrelevant.   Germans, perhaps.  \\\"Peers\\\" doesn't mean \\\"those who do the same thing\\\", like having murderers judge murderers.  It means \\\"having people from the same station in life\\\", presumably because they are in a better position to understand the defendent's motivation(s).   OK, granted.  However, you are using this reasoning as part of *your* logical argument in this discussion.  This is not a court of law.  The media is not totally monolithic.  Even though there is a prevailing liberal bias, programs such as the MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour try to give a balanced and fair reporting of the news.  There are even conservative sources out there if you know where to look.  (Hurrah for Rush!)  BTW, I never used the word \\\"conspiracy\\\".  I don't accept (without *far* more evidence) theories that there is some all-pervading liberal conspiracy attempting to take over all news sources.   Hardly.  I didn't say that it's a Good Thing [tm] to kill innocent people if the end is just.  Unfortunately, we don't live in a perfect world and there are no perfect solutions.  If one is going to  resist tyranny, then innocent people on both sides are going to suffer and die.  I didn't say it is OK -- it is unfortunate, but sometimes necessary.   I would agree that it was evil in the sense that it caused much pain and suffering.  I'm not so sure that it was unnecessary as you say.  That conclusion can only be arrived at by evaluating all the factors involved. And perhaps it *was* unnecessary as (let's say) we now know.  That doesn't mean that those who had to make the decision to bomb didn't see it as being necessary.  Rarely can one have full known of the consequences of an action before making a decision.  At the time it may have seemed necessary enough to go ahead with it.  But don't assume that I feel the bombing was *morally* justified -- I don't!  I just don't condemn those who had to make a difficult decision under difficult circumstances.   You certainly are not in such a position if you are a moral relativist. I, as an absolutist, am in a position to judge, but I defer judgment.   Wrong.  They were neither moral then nor now.  They seemed necessary to those making the decisions to bring a quick end to the war.  I simply refuse to condemn them for their decision.  One day I will stand before Jesus and give account of every word and action; even this discourse in this forum.  I understand the full ramifications of that, and I am prepared to do so.  I don't believe that you can make the same claim.   And BTW, the reason I brought up the blanket-bombing in Germany was because you were bemoaning the Iraqi civilian casualties as being  \\\"so deplorable\\\".  Yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombing wasn't accurate enough to hit industrial/military targets in a decisive way by any other method at that time.  But in the Gulf War, precision bombing was the norm.  So the point was, why make a big stink about the relatively few civilian casualties that resulted *in spite of* precision bombing, when so many more civilians (proportionately and quantitatively) died under the blanket bombing in WW2?  Even with precision bombing, mistakes happen and some civilians suffer.  But less civilians suffered in this war than any other iany other in history!  Many Iraqi civilians went about their lives with minimal interference from the allied air raids.  The stories of \\\"hundreds of thousands\\\" of Iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk. Yes, bunk.  The US lost 230,000 servicemen in WW2 over four years and the majority of them were directly involved in fighting!  But  we are expected to swallow that \\\"hundreds of thousands\\\" of  *civilian* Iraqis died in a war lasting about 2 months!  And with  the Allies using the most precise bombs ever created at that!   What hogwash.  If \\\"hundreds of thousands\\\" of Iraqi civilians died,  it was due to actions Hussein took on his own people, not due to  the Allied bombing.

Well Matt, Mattias Timmander hasn't been playing with the MoDo elite league  team yet (just the MoDo junior team), so I predict he needs a few more years  here before he can join the B's.

He scored -if I remember correctly- 93 points this season,  and then we have to keep in mind that a 50+ point season in Sweden is  considered *very good* due to the limited number of games. Mariusz is  Djurgarden property (he was just on loan to Hammarby), so he will play  in Elitserien next season, unless the B's can get him of course.  I would say that Mariusz has to be one of the most exciting player to  watch in Swedish hockey this season.   Staffan\",\" [ description of experiment deleted ]   [ more deleted ]   A few years ago a friend and I took some 256 grey-level photos from a 1 bit Mac Plus screen using this method. Displaying all 256 levels synchronized to the 60Hz display took about 10 seconds. After experimenting with different aperture settings and screen brightnesses we found a range that worked well, giving respectable contrast. The quality of the images was pretty good. There were no visible contrast bands.  To minimize the exposure time the display program built 255 different 1 bit frames. The first contained a dot only for pixels that had value 255, the second only for pixels that had value 254, etc. These frames were stored using a sparse data structure that was very fast to 'or' onto the screen in sequence. Creating these frames sometimes took 5-10 minutes on that old Mac, but the camera shutter was closed during that time anyway. And yes, we wrote directly to the screen memory. Mea culpa.  Our biggest problem was that small images were displayed in the top left corner of the screen instead of the center. It took an extra week to have the film developed and printed, because the processors took the trouble to manually move the all images into the center of the print.

Helsingfors IFK have been around since 1897 but fans only started taking hockey seriously in the 1960s so I think you're exagerating here.   That's a rather bold claim, in the light of how successful the Canadian & American Olympic teams have been . . . and they've had to play according to our set of rules and on international ice. The 1992 Olympic teams contained about as much talent as your average expansion team. Canada had Eric Lindros, Sean Burke, Joe Juneau and Chris Kontos. Another four or five have been deep subs in the NHL. As for the Yanks, Keith Tkachuk, Scott Lachance, Bret Hedican, Shawn  McEachern, Steve Heintze, Ted Donato, Joe Sacco and Bill Guerin have been  3rd/4th line players in the NHL, while Robb Stauber has done well for the  Kings in goal. Nothing more. In fact, I'm sure that an All-Star team assembled from the best Finnish League teams would do no better in the NHL than Hartford  or Tampa Bay currently are doing. --- But what happens if _all_ top-class Finnish & Swedish players gradually end up with Helsinki & Stockholm as the North American-based ones gradually retire and no Canadian/American team is allowed to draft new players from Scandinavia?  Here is what THE HOCKEY NEWS scouts think of our NHL-based players:  (28-30=superstar) (23-27=star) (18-22=NHL regular+) (13-17=NHL regular) ( 8-12=role player)  FINLAND:    D-Jyrki Lumme.......20 D-Teppo Numminen....20 D-Peter Ahola.......13  C-Jari Kurri........25 C-Christian Ruuttu..16  R-Teemu Selanne.....27  L-Esa Tikkanen......20 (Obviously, Selanne's ratings would be higher today than they were in January)  SWEDEN: D-Ulf Samuelsson....21 D-Fredrik Olausson..20 D-Niklas Lidstrom...18 D-Calle Johansson...18 D-Kjell Samuelsson..17 D-Tommy Sjodin......13 D-Tommy Albelin......7  C-Mats Sundin.......26 C-Thomas Steen......18  R-Thomas Sandstrom..22 R-Ulf Dahlen........18 R-Michael Nylander..13  L-Per-Erik Eklund...18 L-Johan Garpenlov...16 L-Mikael Andersson..15 L-Jan Erixon........14  This would be interesting. Clearly, Finland's top five players (Winnipeg's Selanne & Numminen, Vancouver's Lumme, Los Angeles' Jari Kurri and New York's Tikkanen) are right up there with any five-man unit Pittsburgh & co. have. But I have my doubts about the home-based Finnish players - the national team did well in the Canada Cup and World Championships largely due to the efforts of Markus Ketterer (the goalie), 3-4 or the players listed above and luck. There's presumably a lot of decent players in Finland that wouldn't be superstars at the highest level but still valuable role players, however. My guess would be that the Finnish Canada Cup team would be a .500 team in the NHL. --- Sweden is easier to judge because they have more players in North America. Their points total (16 players) is 274 - seven more than Ottawa's 22 top players combined! If we estimate there are six more NHL regulars back home in  Sweden, an all-Swedish team would assemble about 350-360 skill points. Deducting some points from Pittsburgh, NY Rangers and other teams that rely on Swedish players, the Swedish team would finish in sixth place - about as high as Boston, Vancouver, Calgary and Montreal on paper! So, the \\\"dynasty\\\" talk isn't completely unfounded here. An all-Finnish/all-Swedish team might have an advantage because the players would be playing at home half of the time, won't have to adapt to a foreign country and a foreign language, and presumably play the wide-open European variant of hockey rather than have to learn the North American checking game. However, if free agency becomes a factor the top  Scandinavian players still might end up playing for large-market teams after a  couple of years the same way Edmonton's \\\"dynasty\\\" crumbled in the late '80s.  Some fringe players likely will be drafted by other NHL teams as having an  exclusive talent pool might be a bit unfair after all. I'd settle for a  compromise, prohibit all European teams from signing a North American during  the first two rounds but allow them to keep their top two players. After this,  the amateur draft should be open to anyone.  \",\"My girlfriend switched to gas-permeable hard lenses and no longer needs a one year old soft contact lens cleaning unit.

Although not many patients with Hep B go on to chronic hepatitis, it does still occur in a good number (20%?) and is something to keep in mind.  Hepatitis C (was: non-A, non-B Hep) much more frequently leads to chronic hep and cirrhosis.  There is also an autimmune chronic hepatitis that affects mostly younger women which also leads to cirrhosis.    Of course, cirrhosis is a most unkind disease.  The most dangerous effects relate to portal hypertension and loss of liver function.  Patients develop life-threatening variceal bleeds and hepatic comas, among many other problems, as a result of disturbances in hepatic circulation.  Less ominously, they can exhibit the effects of hyperestrogenemia which often characterize patients with cirrhosis.  These effects include telangiactasias (small red skin lesions) and, in men, gynecomastia (breast development).  The only real treatment for cirrhosis is liver transplant.  Keep in mind that cirrhosis is not expected, at least statistically, in your friend's case.  Nevertheless you might want to bring up the subject of chronic disease and cirrhosis with the doctor.  Hopefully he or she can then carefully explain these sequelae of Hep B infection to you, and offer you support.\",\"Hello,        While refurbishing our observatory I came across the above mentioned camera.

The 27th was a short day at work, we worked until eleven or eleven-thirty and left for home. I decided to go for a short walk. I went to Primorsky Park. I walked past the Eternal Flame and saw a group of about 8 to 10 people standing there. When I had walked another 15 to 20 yards I heard the screech of automobile brakes behind me. I turned my head toward the sound. It was a light blue GAZ-24 Volga. I see that the people who were standing there have gone over to the  car. A man and a woman get out. The man is expensively dressed, in a suit, and the woman has a raincoat on. She doesn't have anything on her head, and  her hair is let down, sightly reddish hair, a heavy-set woman. They're 40 to  45 years old. They get something out of the trunk. The people start to help them. I become curious just what are they pulling out of there?  When I got up close I heard them turn something on. I didn't see what it was,  but it was probably a tape recorder. They put it on the ground near the  Eternal Flame honoring the 26 Baku Commissars and formed a tight circle around it. I ask, \\\"What's going on?\\\" Someone tells me, \\\"Come listen.\\\" Well they were Azerbaijanis, I had asked in Azerbaijani. I hear appeals: \\\"Brother Muslims, our time has come . . . \\\" and something else along that line. I didn't understand what it was all about. I walked around the group trying to  get a look at the owner of the tape recorder. But the circle drew in tighter.  New people started coming from various directions, five here, seven there. And the comments started: \\\"Right, we should slaughter the Armenians!\\\" and \\\"There's no need to be afraid, all of Moscow is behind us.\\\" I even heard that: \\\"All  Moscow is behind us.\\\" Well I watched and listened in and realized that this  was no joke. I quietly left and went home.  Now before that at work I had heard that something was going on in Karabagh,  that there were demonstrations there. Well, people were saying all kinds of  things, but I didn't have any idea what was really going on.  My wife and son were at home, but my daughter was at my aunt's house in Baku.  I didn't say anything to my wife. We sat and drank tea. Sometime around two o'clock right behind our house suddenly there is noise, whistling, and  shouting. I looked out the window and saw a crowd. The crowd is moving slowly, like they show on TV when blacks in South Africa are striking or having a  demonstration and move slowly.  My wife asks what's going on out there. I say I don't know. I put on some outdoor clothes and went out to find out what it was all about. In the crowd people are shouting \\\"Down with the Armenians!\\\" and \\\"Death to the Armenians!\\\" I waited for the entire crowd to pass. At first they went down Narimanov Street  on the side with the SK club and the City Party Committee; then they turned  and went against the traffic--it's one way there--down the Street of the 26  Baku Commissars toward the streetcar line. I went home and told my wife there  was a demonstration going on. In fact I thought that we were having the same  kind of demonstrations that they had had in Yerevan and in Karabagh. Aside  from the things they were shouting, I was surprised that there were only young people in the crowd. And they were minors, under draft age.  My wife and son wanted to go upstairs to visit a friend, but I was kind of uneasy and said, \\\"No, let's stay at home instead.\\\" An hour went by, or maybe  an hour and a half. Well, I wasn't keeping track of the time, I can't say exactly how long it was. I look and see another crowd on Narimanov, but now on the side with the microdistricts, the bazaar, and the Rossiya movie theater.  I put outside clothes on and went out again. There's noise, an uproar outside, and the crowd has grown. There are more people. And whereas the first time  there were individual shouts, this time they are more focused, more  aggressive. No, I think, something's wrong here, this isn't any demonstration. They would run, stop, then walk quickly and make sharp dashes, and then run  again. I was walking along the sidewalk and they were in the street. I  followed them. I was thinking I'd just watch and see. Who knew where this was  leading? We came out on Lenin Square. At the square the SK club is on one  side, and the City Party Committee is on the other. I went toward the square  and heard noise and shouting, as though the whole town had turned out. There  was some sort of a rally going on. I go closer and hear exclamations, appeals. I heard both anti-Armenian and anti-Soviet appeals. \\\"We don't need  perestroika, we want to go on living like we have been.\\\" Now what did they  mean by \\\"living like we have been?\\\" The Azerbaijanis work like everyone else.  But too many people live at the expense of the government and at the expense  of others. Speculation, theft, and cheating go on all the time. And not just  in Azerbaijan, everywhere, in all the republics, but I've never seen it  anywhere else like I have in Azerbaijan.  Now at this rally someone says that they should go around to the Armenians'  apartments and drive them out, beat them and drive them out. True, I didn't  hear them say \\\"kill them\\\" over the microphone, I only heard \\\"beat them and  drive them out.\\\" I stayed at the square a few minutes longer. First one, then another are going up onto the stage, and no one tries to stop the crowd. Off to the side of the crowd there were small groups of three or four people, and  I think they were MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] or State Security KGB. There were also uniformed policemen there, but I didn't see any of them try  to pacify the crowd. New people kept coming up onto the stage.  Well I had finally decided that this could end badly: This was no demonstration, and I had to protect my family.  I left the Square to return home and suddenly noticed a truck. It was next to the City Party Committee, on Narimanov Street, it stood next to the tai- lor's shop there, a low truck, and it had low, wooden panels. I see that some- thing is being unloaded, crates of some sort. I decided to go look because after all those appeals I was apprehensive and thought there might be weapons in there. They pulled the crates out onto the square, not toward the City  Party Committee, but toward the SK club. And when I went right up to them I  saw that they were cases of vodka. There were two people handing down the  cases from the bed of the truck, and on the ground there were many people, 15  to 20. They were handing them down from the truck and each case was carried  off by two people. Two people, one case of vodka. And there was a man standing right next to the truck and he was handing out roundish black lumps, maybe  about the size of a fist, maybe a little bigger or smaller. It was anasha.  When I passed next to that person, he stood with his side to me. There was  about a yard and a half between us, and two people were standing near him. He  has a package in his hand, and he's pulling out anasha and handing it out. I  have never smoked it myself. Once I tried it for fun, but I've seen a lot of  people smoke it, I've seen it many times, and I know what it is. I strolled  around and no one asked me who I was or what I was doing there.  Before I got to the Glass Bazaar I heard more howling, more warlike shouting.  I turned around and saw them running. Well I'll just keep on going like I am,  I thought. When they caught up with me I saw that they were carrying flags.  And I recognized the person who was carrying the flag on my side of the  street. He's a young guy, 21 or 22 years old. He was carrying a red flag,  which had \\\"Ermeni oryum\\\" written on it in Azerbaijani, that means \\\"Death to  Armenians!\\\" That guy used to live off the same courtyard as us. I don't really know what his name is, but I know his father very well. His father's name is Rafik; he used to be a cook, and then became head chef. He used to have a dark blue Zhiguli van, then he sold it and now he has a white Zhiguli 06. His  family, as I said, lived on the same courtyard as we did. Our building was on  Narimanov Street, and theirs was on the Street of the 26 Baku Commissars;  their apartment was in the far entryway, on the fifth floor, the door on the  left. Now Rafik's little brother lives there, and he, Rafik, I heard, got a  new apartment either in the forth or eighth microdistrict. In a word, his son  was carrying a flag that said \\\"Death to Armenians!\\\" I was surprised because  before this I had gotten the impression that all of this nonsense was being  done not by people from Sumgait, but by Azerbaijanis from Agdam and Kafan.  Well anyway I went home. My wife was upset. I told her, \\\"It's OK, it'll pass,  they're young kids, they've just gotten all whooped up.\\\" Naturally I didn't  want her to get overly upset. After a while a new surge of crowd went by. And  this time they were breaking glass. I could hear it breaking, but I couldn't  see where. Well I think, here we go, the machine's in motion. They weren't  handing out that vodka and anasha for nothing. I didn't see people drinking  and smoking on the spot, but they certainly hadn't unloaded the vodka and  hashish to put in a store window!  So the thought flashed through my head that the machine was running, no one  would stop them now, they weren't even trying, although, I'll say it again,  the police were there, I saw them. And it's not just that the police weren't  breaking them up, they were joking with them, they were having a good time.  True, at the time I couldn't even imagine that under our government, our much- vaunted leadership--and I'm not afraid to say these words: so many people  died, So many women were abused, and how many abominations there were!--I  couldn't imagine that under our much-vaunted authorities, and if I were to be  specific, I would say under the much-touted authorities in our city of  Sumgait, I couldn't imagine that such things could take place.  When they started breaking glass I told my wife and son: \\\"Let's go upstairs.\\\"  We went to our neighbors, the Grigorians, on the fourth floor. And in the  evening, when those crowds started going past again, I went outside once more. I stopped at \\\"The Corner,\\\" a place called that right next to the bazaar. I  look and see a crowd on the run. And there, a few yards from the entrance to  the bazaar, are three respectable-looking men of around, say, 50 years old.  The crowd was running and one of the three waved with his arm and pointed  toward the bazaar. And then the whole crowd, as though it were one person,  wheeled and raced toward the bazaar. And not a soul went past those three, as  though it were off limits! Well everything got all churned up, there was more  noise, and the glass was flying again.  We spent the night at the neighbors'. My apartment was on the first floor, there was really no way to defend yourself there.  In the morning I went out to buy bread and to see what was happening in town.  On the way I saw someone hunched up, still. I never found out who it was or  what happened to him. There were 10 to 15 people standing near him. I got the  bread and on my way back, they had gathered around the person who was lying  there hunched up, sort of enclosing him; because of the way they were standing you couldn't even see him.  That was on the morning of February 28. Everyone knows the rest.

Now, try dealing with the rest of what I wrote.  What is more, the activities of the Armenian Government seem to have been efforts aimed at eradicating a race (the Turks) or aimed at carrying out a one-sided feud, instead of being a struggle for liberation. From the outset, the efforts of the Armenian revolutionaries within the Ottoman borders took the form of terrorist and destructive actions aimed at mass murder, cruelty and genocide, so that no other interpretation of them is possible. Armenian activities started during the reign of Abdulhamid II as individual acts of terror, and then developed into assassinations and surprise attacks. The element of brute force in these activities increased steadily, culminating in mass rebellions and widespread fighting during the First World War. Furthermore, when the Ottoman army withdrew from Eastern Anatolia after the 1915 Sarikamis defeat, Armenian revolutionaries initiated a series of cruelties in this area. Although the Russians occupied Eastern Anatolia as an enemy, nevertheless they were constrained by the rules of war. However, when they returned to their country in 1917 after the Revolution, Armenian revolutionaries were unchecked in this area for about a year until the Ottoman forces returned to Erzurum in 1918. During this period, Armenian revolutionaries executed massacres on the local people which is recorded in historical documents.[1]  For example, let us look at a report dated 21 March 1918 which the Commander of the Third Army submitted when he entered Erzurum and Erzincan:    \\\"They were completely and systematically destroyed and burned down    by Armenians, even the trees were cut down, and they are like a    building entirely consumed by fire in every sense of the word.\\\"   As for the people who had been living in Erzurum and Erzincan:  \\\"Those who were capable of fighting were taken away at the very beginning  with the excuse of forced labor in road construction, they were taken  in the direction of Sarikamis and annihilated. When the Russian army  withdrew, a part of the remaining people was destroyed in Armenian  massacres and cruelties: they were thrown into wells, they were locked  in houses and burned down, they were killed with bayonets and swords, in places  selected as butchering spots, their bellies were torn open, their lungs  were pulled out, and girls and women were hanged by their hair after  being subjected to every conceivable abominable act. A very small part   of the people who were spared these abominations far worse than the  cruelty of the inquisition resembled living dead and were suffering  from temporary insanity because of the dire poverty they had lived  in and because of the frightful experiences they had been subjected to.  Including women and children, such persons discovered so far do not  exceed one thousand five hundred in Erzincan and thirty thousand in  Erzurum. All the fields in Erzincan and Erzurum are untilled, everything  that the people had has been taken away from them, and we found them  in a destitute situation. At the present time, the people are subsisting  on some food they obtained, impelled by starvation, from Russian storages  left behind after their occupation of this area.\\\"[2]   Foreign observers who witnessed the events, including Russian Officers who did not desert their lines, submitted detailed reports proving the genocide to Ottoman commanders who received them as prisoners of war. What is most important is that they stated in their reports 'the  massacres did not happen by chance but were planned.'[3]  At the end of the war, the German author Dr. Weiss, his Austrian colleague Dr. Stein and his Turkish colleague Mr. Ahmet Vefik visited Trabzon, Kars, Erzurum and Batum between April 17th and May 20th 1918 to record the cruelties. Their writings not only show the scope of Armenian activities, but also reveal their goal and true nature.[4]  [1] (The Ottoman State, the Ministry of War), \\\"Islam Ahalinin Ducar Olduklari     Mezalim Hakkinda Vesaike Mustenid Malumat,\\\" (Istanbul, 1918).

Maybe I've misjudged you, Russell.  Anyone who agrees with something  I say can't be all bad.  ;-)  Seriously, I'm not sure whether I misjudged you or not, in one respect.   I still have a major problem, though, with your insistence that science  is mainly about avoiding mistakes.  And I still disagree with your  contention that nobody who doesn't use methods deemed \\\"scientific\\\"  can possibly know what's true and what's not.     Okay, so let's see if we agree on this: FIRST of all, there are degrees  of certainty.  It might be appropriate, for instance, to demand carefully  controlled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth (to the  extent that there is any such thing) the effectiveness of a certain  treatment. On the other hand, highly favorable clinical experience, even  if uncontrolled, can be adequate to justify a *preliminary* judgement that a treatment is useful.  This is often the best evidence we can hope for from investigators who do not have institutional or corporate support. In this case, it makes sense to tentatively treat claims as credible but to reserve final judgement until establishment scientists who are qualified and have the necessary resources can do more careful testing.  SECONDLY, it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of  evidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal.     I come to this dispute about what science is  not only as a mathematician but as a veteran of many arguments in sci.psychology (and occasionally in sci.med) about NLP (Neurolinguistic Programming).  Much of the work done to date by NLPers can be better categorized as informal exploration than as careful scientific research.  For years now I have been trying to get scientific and clinical psychologists to just take a look at it, to read a few of the books and watch some of the videotapes (courtesy of your local university library).  Not for the purpose of making a definitive judgement, but simply to look at the NLP methodology (especially the approach to eliciting information from subjects) and look for ideas and hypotheses which might be of scientific interest.  And most especially to be aware of the *questions* NLP suggests which might be worthy of scientific investigation.  Over and over again the response I get in sci.pychology is  \\\"If this hasn't been thoroughly validated by the accepted form of empirical research then it can't be of any interest to us.\\\"    To me, the ultimate reducio ad absurdum of the extreme \\\"There've got to be controlled studies\\\" position is an NLP technique called the Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure.  Simple phobias (as opposed to agoraphobia) may not be the world's most  important psychological disorder, but the nice thing about them is that  it doesn't take a sophisticated instrument to diagnose them or tell  when someone is cured of one.  The NLP phobia cure is a simple  visualization which requires less than 15 minutes.  (NLPers claim that it can also be used to neutralize a traumatic memory, and hence is useful in treating Post-traumatic Stress Syndrome.)  It is essentially a variation on the classic desensitization process used by behavioral therapists.  A subject only needs to be taken through the technique once (or, in the case of PTSD, once for each traumatic incident).  The process doesn't need to be repeated and the subject doesn't need to practice it over again at home.  Now to me, it seems pretty easy to test the effectiveness of this cure.  (Especially if, as NLPers claim, the success rate is extremely high.)   Take someone with a fear of heights (as I used to have).  Take them up  to a balcony on the 20th floor and observe their response.  Spend 15  minutes to have them do the simple visualization.  Send them back up to  the balcony and see if things have changed.  Check back with them in a  few weeks to see if the cure seems to be lasting.  (More long term  follow-up is certainly desirable, but from a scientific point of view  even a cure that lasts several weeks has significance.  In any case,  there are many known cases where the cure has lasted years.  To the best  of my knowledge, there is no known case where the cure has been reversed  after holding for a few weeks.)  (My own cure, incidentally, was done with a slightly different NLP technique, before I learned of the Fast  Phobia/Trauma Cure.  Ten years later now, I enjoy living on the 17th floor of my building and having a large balcony.)    The folks over in sci.psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to make this simple test.  They claim that only an elaborate outcome study will be satisfactory --- a study of the sort that NLP practitioners,  many of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice, can ill  afford to do.  (Most of them are also just plain not interested, because  the whole idea seems frivolous.  And since they're not part of the scientific establishment, they have no tangible rewards to gain  from scientific acceptance.)   The Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure is over ten years old now and the clinical  psychology establishment is still saying \\\"We don't have any way of  knowing that it's effective.\\\"    These academics themselves have the resources to do a study as elaborate  as anyone could want, of course, but they say  \\\"Why should I prove your  theory?\\\"  and  \\\"The burden of proof is on the one making the claim.\\\"   One academic in sci.psychology said that it would be completely  unscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn't  been described in a scientific journal.  (It's described in a number of  books and I've posted articles in sci.psychology describing it in as much  detail as I'm capable of.)    Actually, at least one fairly careful academic study has been done (with  favorable results), but it's apparently not acceptable because it's a doctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal.  To me, this sort of attitude does not advance science but hinders it.   This is the kind of thing I have in mind when I talk about \\\"doctrinnaire\\\"  attitudes about science.    Now maybe I have been unfair in imputing such attitudes to you, Russell.   If so, I apologize.    -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems  less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \",\"  So what should I carry if I want to comply with intelligent helmet laws?

Do the geese symbolize an inner frustration with ambiguity, a desire that everything be black and white, with no shades of gray?  Does the \\\"getaway car\\\" tell us that to try to renounce the existential nature of our being is not to \\\"get away\\\" from responsibility for our actions, but rather to take the role of the passive accomplice, the \\\"driver\\\" of the getaway car, as it were?

They don't care because the #message they hear is \\\"Life is Cheap\\\"!    And the education system and the Religious Leaders aren't doing much   about it, either.  With both parents working in this society, where is  the stabilizing influence at home?   Latchkey children are everywhere!  And these latchkey kids can watch whatever rotten videos and listen to  whatever violent hate-promoting \\\"music\\\" and videos they like because no  one is home to stop it.    This day and age, when there is about 100 times more things to learn  than when I went to school, our answer to this increased knowledge is  shorter school hours and more leisure time!  I say keep the kids in  school longer, feed them good food and teach them something, and when  they get home, have a parent there to interact and monitor them.  There  is a very old and now forgotten proverb: a child left on his own will  bring a parent to grief.  Daycare systems are not the answer.

Well, I dont know if Windows is a mature OS, if I have seen one (in which case that has to be X-Windows :) ), but dont be so quick to judge...  First of all to try to use plain vanilla Windows is as courageous as to try to use plain vanilla DOS. There are _lots_ of very nice commercial and shareware packages/utilities that will boost up Windows past what MS itself thought possible :)... For example, Norton Desktop for Windows 2.0 (a replace- ment for ProgMan) will give you group-within-a-group capability and will even change group icons, it will launch progs by association (well, FileMan does that too) or by dragging the file in the apps icon (now Mac doesnt do that, huh? :) )... And the list goes on and on... Now, Windows _is_ kinda hard to finetune, boost and configure, but thats trhe price to pay for not paying $$$ to get a Mac or an OS/2 capable machine (an entirely differet story ...)... On the other hand if you dont like the idea of PM's icons not correspnding to the files themselves, well they are not supposed to :).. PM is a Program _Launching_ utility not a file manager... Modify your  settings to have FM as your shell and not PM, or get a couple of utilities from cica that supposedly give you a 'Mac feel'... I dont wanna get in the discussion which is a better system: Mac's are good in their own way -- they are _different_ not better or worse than Win PCs-- (actually I am writing this from a Mac lab as a user assistant - so dont think I am partial to Win:) ) By all means check out the stuff in cica (ftp to ftp.cica.indiana.edu under the pub/pc/win3 subdir user: anonymous), or wait for StarTrek (Mac's OS on a PC !!! -- the threads we are gonna have then !!! :) )... Just trying to avoid another Mac-Win war...  \",\" I finished reading a very good book, \\\"The Will of God\\\", Weatherhead. This was very helpful to me in applying thought to the subject of the will of God.  Weatherhead broke the will of God into three distinct parts; intentional will, circumstancial will, and ultimate will.  He (Weatherhead) also refuted the last statement (above) by Michael Parkin above quite nicely.  Summarizing; _despite_ the failures of humankind, God's ultimate will is never to be defeated.  God's intentions may be interfered with, even temporarily defeated by the will of humankind, brought down by circumstance.  His ultimate will (the reconcilication of all humankind) will never be stopped.  Time after time, Weatherhead used the Cross as the best description of this process at work.  His points, paraphrased, were 1) God's intentional will was for Jesus, the Christ, to live out a full life and perform the work of the Living God.  2) The failures, sins, and deviousness of humankind frustrated God's intent for His Son.  3) Despite the circumstance, God's ultimate will was revealed in the Cross, as Jesus willingly (\\\"not my will, Lord, but yours\\\") died for the redemption of all humankind.  The Cross was utterly triumphant, overcoming even the most cruel of circumstances.   It was not the intentional will of God.  It was the circumstancial will, thus enabling the victory of the ultimate will.    Right, intentional will.  (Just like the Jewish people  We know neither the time nor the place.

Chris Mussack\",\"A couple of weeks ago I posted a question concerning communicating between VB and MSACCESS using DDE. The answers I received at that time allowed me to get a prototype of my project working. However, during this process I have come up with new problems.  1) There seems to be a limit of 255 characters for a DDE Topic string. Is this inherent in all DDE systems or just peculiar to MSACCESS or VB?  2) It is easy to query an Access database from VB using the DDE SQL command, (provided the above limitation is overcome by using short field and table names) but how is one meant to update a database?    a) A DDE SQL UPDATE command does not seem to work.    b) Initiating an Access macro using a DDE Execute command from VB cannot       be used because when the macro requests information from VB using a       second DDE channel the programs dead lock until time- outs occur.       (The VB to Access channel has to close before the Access to VB channel       is initiated, I guess.)    c) Access does not allow VB to DDE POKE the information.      The way I eventually managed to update a database was by sending key-    strokes from VB to Access using the SendKeys command. This technique has    the problem that Access cannot be minimised and it must always be in a    state ready to respond to the sequence of key-strokes VB sends.  Are all the above statements correct or have I made incorrect assumptions? Are there any better work arounds to the above? Are there any signs of an ODBC driver for Access?\",\"   I've got a used one for sale.  I used it in high school and just don't have  the occasion to get it out and play it anymore.

Just for the hell of it, let's destroy this remark. Let us imagine that the executive branch actually could extract keys from the escrow houses without anyone knowing, or telling. Now what? Dick has 80 bits of data. What the hell's he gonna do with it?   1) Trot around to the telco and say 'we'd like an unauthorised decrypting tap'. Uh huh.  2) Break in to watergate and install his own tap (so his people still do have to break in, neat, huh?) record some noise, then get the Executive Branch Phone Decryption Box (huh? they've got one? Goodness, wait 'til the washington post gets hold of this) and decrypt the noise.  3) More likely, stare at the key, and say 'Oh, hell it's not worth all this bloody hassle'   Truth is, even granted *lots* of covert power on the part of the Executive Branch, this system is *more* difficult to tap with than POTS gear. The fact that it is easier to tap than some hypothetical system neither you nor I am going to place on our phones is neither here nor there.   The only rational concerns I am seeing raised are:   a) is the key really just chopped in half, and not some XOR arrangement? That is, has some egregious technical error been built in to the plan?  b) is this is the first step toward strict regulation of strong encryption?     This is b), of course. I suspect not.

The Macroscrubber from Radio Electronics removes the protection so you  souldn't have any more problems.

One thought comes to mind about your problem...  When playing the tape  for viewing, are you feeding the signal from the source VCR through an  extra device before going to the TV?  If you feed it through a second VCR  first, that is your problem.  As to other devices such as converters, I  don't know if they would react or not.

This is the first in a series of regular postings aimed at new readers of the newsgroups.  Many groups of a 'controversial' nature have noticed that new readers often come up with the same questions, mis-statements or misconceptions and post them to the net.  In addition, people often request information which has been posted time and time again.  In order to try and cut down on this, the alt.atheism groups have a series of five regular postings under the following titles:     1.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Overview for New Readers    2.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Introduction to Atheism    3.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)    4.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Constructing a Logical Argument    5.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Atheist Resources  This is article number 1.  Please read numbers 2 and 3 before posting.  The others are entirely optional.

The articles titled \\\"A Primer on How to Work With the Usenet Community\\\", \\\"Answers to Frequently Asked Questions about Usenet\\\" and \\\"Hints on writing style for Usenet\\\" are particularly relevant.

However, please send any changes or corrections to the author, and please do not re-post copies of the articles to alt.atheism; it does nobody any good to have multiple versions of the same document floating around the network.                                   Finding Stuff  All of the FAQ files *should* be somewhere on your news system.  Here are some suggestions on what to do if you can't find them:  1. Check the newsgroup alt.atheism.  Look for subject lines starting with    \\\"Alt.Atheism FAQ:\\\".  2. Check the newsgroup news.answers for the same subject lines.     If you don't find anything in steps 1 or 2, your news system isn't set up    correctly, and you may wish to tell your system administrator about the    problem.  3. If you have anonymous FTP access, connect to rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27].    Go to the directory /pub/usenet/alt.atheism, and you'll find the latest    versions of the FAQ files there.     FTP is a a way of copying files between networked computers.  If you    need help in using or getting started with FTP, send e-mail to    mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with        send usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq     in the body.  4. There are other sites which also carry news.answers postings.  The article    \\\"Introduction to the news.answers newsgroup\\\" carries a list of these    sites; the article is posted regularly to news.answers.  5. If you don't have FTP, send mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu    consisting of the following lines:        send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources       send usenet/alt.atheism/faq       send usenet/alt.atheism/introduction       send usenet/alt.atheism/logic       send usenet/alt.atheism/resources  5. (Penultimate resort)  Send mail to mail-server@mantis.co.uk consisting of    the following lines:        send atheism/faq/faq.txt       send atheism/faq/logic.txt       send atheism/faq/intro.txt       send atheism/faq/resource.txt     and our poor overworked modems will try and send you a copy of the files.    There's other stuff, too; interesting commands to try are \\\"help\\\" and    \\\"send atheism/index\\\".  6. (Last resort)  Mail mathew@mantis.co.uk, or post an article to the    newsgroup asking how you can get the FAQ files.  You should only do this    if you've tried the above methods and they've failed; it's not nice to    clutter the newsgroup or people's mailboxes with requests for files.    it's better than posting without reading the FAQ, though!  For instance,    people whose email addresses get mangled in transit and who don't have     FTP will probably need assistance obtaining the FAQ files. \",\"  Do I have to be the one to say it?

The points (x,y,z) on a spherical surface with radius R and center (a,b,c) can be written as      (x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 + (z-c)^2 = R^2  This equation can be rewritten into the following form:       2ax + 2by + 2cz + R^2 - a^2 - b^2 -c^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2  Approximate the left hand part by   F(x,y,z) = p1.x + p2.x + p3.z + p4.1  For all datapoints, i.c. 4, determine the 4 parameters p1..p4 which minimise the average error |F(x,y,z) - x^2 - y^2 - z^2|^2.

Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.  The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu  as /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography  FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers every 21 days.   Contents:  * What is a one-way hash function? * What is the difference between public, private, secret, shared, etc.? * What are MD4 and MD5? * What is Snefru?   * What is a one-way hash function?    A typical one-way hash function takes a variable-length message and   produces a fixed-length hash. Given the hash it is computationally   impossible to find a message with that hash; in fact one can't   determine any usable information about a message with that hash, not   even a single bit. For some one-way hash functions it's also   computationally impossible to determine two messages which produce the   same hash.    A one-way hash function can be private or public, just like an   encryption function. Here's one application of a public one-way hash   function, like MD5 or Snefru. Most public-key signature systems are   relatively slow. To sign a long message may take longer than the user   is willing to wait. Solution: Compute the one-way hash of the message,   and sign the hash, which is short. Now anyone who wants to verify the   signature can do the same thing.    Another name for one-way hash function is message digest function.  * What is the difference between public, private, secret, shared, etc.?    There is a horrendous mishmash of terminology in the literature for a   very small set of concepts. When an algorithm depends on a key which   isn't published, we call it a private algorithm; otherwise we call it   a public algorithm. We have encryption functions E and decryption   functions D, so that D(E(M)) = M for any message M. We also have   hashing functions H and verification functions V, such that V(M,X) = 1   if and only if X = H(M).    A public-key cryptosystem has public encryption and private   decryption. Checksums, such as the application mentioned in the   previous question, have public hashing and public verification.   Digital signature functions have private hashing and public   verification: only one person can produce the hash for a message,   but everyone can verify that the hash is correct.    Obviously, when an algorithm depends on a private key, it's meant to   be unusable by anyone who doesn't have the key. There's no real   difference between a ``shared'' key and a private key: a shared key   isn't published, so it's private. If you encrypt data for a friend   rather than ``for your eyes only'', are you suddenly doing   ``shared-key encryption'' rather than private-key encryption? No.  * What are MD4 and MD5?    MD4 and MD5 are message digest functions developed by Ron Rivest.   Definitions appear in RFC 1320 and RFC 1321 (see part 10). Code is   available from [FTPMD].    Note that a transcription error was found in the original MD5 draft   RFC. The corrected algorithm should be called MD5a, though some   people refer to it as MD5.  * What is Snefru?\",\" My package is based on several articles about non-standard radiosity and some unpublished methods.

Good and evil are the most thought provoking polarities that come to mind.  The Bible provides us with many examples of the fragmentation of being. The warring opposites within us are a product of man's rebellion against God, which is described so vividly in the pages of the Scriptures.  Man was created with the order to become a god. Those were the words of St.  Basil in the fourth century. What he was trying to say was that God created man to be a partaker of the divine nature. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, this is called \\\"theosis,\\\" or \\\"deification.\\\"  One can also say that man was created to be whole, i.e. spirit, soul, and body operating in unison. The story of Adam and Eve is a picture of the archetypal humans before obtaining moral consciousness. Theirs was a harmonious relationship with each other, the world, and the Creator. That innocent harmony was shattered when they disobeyed God, their natural wholeness falling apart into two seemingly irreconcilable halves. Immediately, guilt and fear was manifested in their lives. They become bound to hardship, toil, and suffering.  This is symbolized in their exile from the paradisiac state.  The beast in the jungle does not possess moral consciousness. If it were to receive this self-awareness, the knowledge of good and evil, its paradisiac state would also be destroyed.  Was it the intention of the Creator to leave man in this state of innocence all the days of his existence on earth? Or was the gaining of self-awareness carefully staged by God, who did not desire that His masterpiece, mankind, be a blissful idiot?  God must have known that, for mankind to achieve any kind of moral value, he must pass through a confrontation with the opposites. There is no other way to achieve union with God.  Jesus Christ is the answer to the problem of the warring polarities. He was the perfectly integrated individual, reconciling the opposites, and making it possible for us to be integrated, i.e. to become God, not in His essence, but in His energies.  The opposites is THE Christian problem. The Apostle Paul describes it with the utmost precision in Romans 7:15-24. And he follows with the answer to his dilemma in vs 25.\",\"  It's not the picture tube. More likely the flyback. Emerson? can't admire.

Libertarians and anarchists are not alone in being uncomfortable with the use of state sponsored coercion.  The notion that coercion can be virtually eliminated in a society (or more properly that once it is eliminated on the part of the state it is no longer worth serious  consideration) is a view that is peculiar to libertarians and anarchists.    For example, does \\\"non-initiated force\\\" (coercion) include tax collection? Does it include the minimal level of regulation of commerce envisioned by Adam Smith?  Since coercion can be exercised by actors other than the state, how is the state to deal with it?  Exclusively through after the fact arbitration/legal compulsion?     Well, I must admit that the picture of libertarians as Amway participants is somewhat more reassuring than the idea of them trying to govern a  complex, conflictual, industrial society.  I'd venture to point out,  however, that if libertarians couldn't convince at least 85% of a group  of \\\"seminar participants\\\" to \\\"embrace\\\" their philosophy, their  propaganda skills need to be honed.    Frankly, however, it is no great trick to create a government for a  society in which (almost) everyone is assumed to agree about what is a proper government policy.  Once that is assumed, all sorts of annoying formalities can be dispensed with, elections, police, etc.  And as Mr. Marx said, the state will just wither away.    On the way there, however, would you like to explain how eliminating  virtually all policies that restrain private coercion in the  current society will help us to live happier lives?

I don't know if this is believeing blindly or not. I'm not sure how blindness comes into it. I do not deny reason, indeed I insist upon it, but reason only draws conclusions from evidence. If you decide in advance that your reason will act only on the evidence of the five physical senses, then you cut reason off from any possibility of reaching a conclusion outside the physical sphere (beyond the rather provocative, if inconclusive, conclusion that the physical sphere is not self explanatory).   Christians claim that they have received a different kind of evidence,  which they call faith, and which is a gift of God. That is, this evidence is the evidence of a thing which chooses to reveal or hide itself. The  evidence of the senses cannot tell you is such a ting exists. Reasoning on the evidence of the senses won't help either. But Christians do reason of the evidence of faith, and do claim that this evidence is wholly consistent with the evidence of the other senses, and indeed, that the evidence of these other senses is part of God's revelation of himself to us.  It is not necessarilly the case however that knowledge of a God must come through this route. There may be other senses than the physical ones providing evidence of non-physical realities. (There may, of course, be physical realities of a type for which we have no corresponding senses, for all we know.) These senses, if they exist, may provide valid evidence for reason to work on. And, as with all senses, these senses may be impaired in some people, that is, they may be spiritually blind. In this sense, belief in God becomes an act of sight, and it is disbelief which is blind.  Faith, as I have said, is not opposed to reason, it is simply a new source  of evidence on which reason may operate. It is clear that human beings have many systems for explaining the evidence of the physical senses, and similarly there are many systems for explaining the evidence provided by faith. Religious believers in general, and Christians in particular, use reason to help sift through the evidence to come to a clearer understanding of the evidence provided by faith. Science claims, with good reason, to be the most valid system for explaining the physical universe, and Christianity claims, also with good reason, to be the most valid system, possessed of the best evidence, for explaining Gods revelations of himself to man.  If you doubt that Christians use reason, read this newsgroup for a while and you will see rational debate aplenty.\",\"tes:  First, the only drug that could possibly be put in drug stations are marijuana  or its derivitives.

Holger  \",\"The following document summarizes the Clipper Chip, how it is used, how programming of the chip is coupled to key generation and the escrow process, and how law enforcement decrypts communications. Since there has been some speculation on this news group about my own involvement in this project, I'd like to add that I was not in any way involved.  I found out about it when the FBI briefed me on Thursday evening, April 15.  Since then I have spent considerable time talking with the NSA and FBI to learn more about this, and I attended the NIST briefing at the Department of Commerce on April 16.   The document below is the result of that effort.   Dorothy Denning ---------------                       THE CLIPPER CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY                                 Dorothy Denning                                  April 19, 1993   INTRODUCTION  On April 16, the President announced a new initiative that will bring together the Federal Government and industry in a voluntary program to provide secure communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement.  At the heart of the plan is a new tamper-proof encryption chip called the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" together with a split-key approach to escrowing keys.  Two escrow agencies are used, and the key parts from both are needed to reconstruct a key.   CHIP STRUCTURE  The Clipper Chip contains a classified 64-bit block encryption algorithm called \\\"Skipjack.\\\"  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys (compared with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling (compared with 16 for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  Throughput is 16 Mbits a second.  Each chip includes the following components:     the Skipjack encryption algorithm    F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips    N, a 30-bit serial number    U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip   ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP  To see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T telephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and we both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure conversation, my security device will negotiate a session key K with the device at the other end (in general, any method of key exchange can be used).  The key K and message stream M (i.e., digitized voice) are then fed into the Clipper Chip to produce two values:     E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and     E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement block.    The law enforcement block thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U concatenated with the serial number N, all encrypted under the family key F.   CHIP PROGRAMMING AND ESCROW  All Clipper Chips are programmed inside a SCIF (secure computer information facility), which is essentially a vault.  The SCIF contains a laptop computer and equipment to program the chips.  About 300 chips are programmed during a single session.  The SCIF is located at Mikotronx.  At the beginning of a session, a trusted agent from each of the two key escrow agencies enters the vault.  Agent 1 enters an 80-bit value S1 into the laptop and agent 2 enters an 80-bit value S2. These values serve as seeds to generate keys for a sequence of serial numbers.  To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1. S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a 64-bit block R1:          R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .  Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:            R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1]          R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .  R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow agencies.  As a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are written onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part U1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third disk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent 2 takes the second disk.  The third disk is used to program the chips. After the chips are programmed, all information is discarded from the vault and the agents leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional assurance that no information is left behind.   The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the room instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2, and the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to the escrow agencies.  The escrow agencies have as yet to be determined, but they will not be the NSA, CIA, FBI, or any other law enforcement agency.  One or both may be independent from the government.   LAW ENFORCEMENT USE  When law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line, they will first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get access to the communications line.  Let us assume that the tap is in place and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with Clipper.  They will first decrypt the law enforcement block with the family key F.  This gives them E[K; U] + N.  They will then take a warrant identifying the chip serial number N to each of the key escrow agents and get back U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are XORed together to produce the unit key U, and E[K; U] is decrypted to get the session key K. Finally the message stream is decrypted.  All this will be accomplished through a special black box decoder operated by the FBI. \",\"I've been trying to get my Fujitsu M2611T 45mb hard disk (circa  1990) to share my IDE card with a new Seagate ST3283A 245mb one.

As part of my self-introduction to X I've been trying to do some simple icon animation (sort of like icondoit from mswindows).  Changing your own applications icon is fairly simple:  If you have a widget ID you can just XtSetValues on XtNiconifyPixmap (or whatever) and you're done. Alternately you can set window manager hints.  These methods don't seem to work with icons which your application doesn't specifically own.  In my situation I have to change the icon of random windows sitting there in  my icon box so my question is:  Given a window-id, how do you change the icon pixure ?

Remember the default colormapFocusPolicy is keyboard (meaning the cmap focus follows the keyboard focus).  Since the dialog is modal, mwm won't allow keyboard focus onto your main shell, and so it won't allow cmap focus either.  Since it sounds as though you have keyboardFocusPolicy:pointer, I suggest you set colormapFocusPolicy:pointer also.  That way, the cmap focus won't slavishly follow keyboard focus, but will beat its own path.  (if you have keyboardFocusPolicy: explicit, you can set cmap focus explicit also, but you then need a binding to f.focus_color, probably on MB1).\",\"     Ditto here too...  \",\"There's a lot of whining about how much players are overpaid.

I cut some players, like Kenny Lofton, Chris Hoiles, Keith Mitchell, Tim Wakefield, and a bunch of pitchers, all of whom could have arguably made the team better at a cost of $1 million for the lot of them.  The total team salary is  $7,781,500, averaging slightly over $300K a player.

The Yankees were finishing 2nd to a team that was as good as the 26-28 Yankees, while the Yankees had aged some from their peak years.  Ruth and Gehrig couldn't play every position simultaneously.  IMO, given the various ages of the Braves and Reds this season, that the Braves will be closer to their peak, while the Reds have slightly passed their peak.  Also, if you're going to compare Braves and Yankees, a more appropriate comparison to the '93 Braves might be the '23 Yankees.

It may not use the exact words as quoted above but I'm sure many will agree that the same message is being issued.  Later on when I get back home I will try to find the precise section(s) but you can do the research for now (I hope).  I also realize that Yasser Arafat renounced the _Covenant_ *to the Western media only* but he has yet to inform the PNC officially and enequivocally of his exact intentions on this issue.  Therefore, as far as we are concerned the _Covenant_ still stands as the \\\"Bible\\\" (so to speak) of the mainstream Palestinian National movement!    As a staunch pro-Israel activist I can confidently say that Bnai Brith has NOT influenced my opinions on the Arab-Israeli conflict.  As I mentioned above, just a little research on the subject will lead anyone to reach a similar conclusion on the Palestinian National movement (the PLO in most cases).  BB does not properly speak for me nor many of the people around me who share my views.   What 1948 situation?  A negative situation I presume?  Is this the same \\\"situation\\\" when the Jordanian occupiers of East Jerusalem would not allow the Jews to go worship at the HOLIEST SITE IN JUDIASM?  Was this an example of Qu'ranic law being exercised?  If not, I have another suggested reading for you... get into the \\\"soc.culture.arabic\\\" newsgroup where the posters have been debating the topic \\\"Jews in the Qu'ran\\\" (and may I remind you the people doing the debating appear to be devout Muslims with some knowledge of the Qu'ran). You will find that Jews aren't really viewed positively by the Qu'ran (to put it lightly).  So how do you think Jews (or any other non-Islamic religion) will be treated by an Islamic state governed by the words of the Qu'ran?  I think the 1948-1967 \\\"situation\\\" in Jerusalem will return *at best*!  What do you think?   All I have to say to that is, once again, see s.c.a - \\\"Jews in the Qu'ran\\\" and think again.  \\\"Freedom of choice\\\" is *definitely* not an option in Qu'ranic law especially for non-Muslims and ALL women!  Remember the Gulf War?  I'm sure you saw the reports about how women had few rights in Saudi Arabia (an Islamic state).   Probably nothing!  Aside from how to break the news to his Palestinian brethren that the _Covenant_ is \\\"null and void\\\" without getting assassinated himself!   In conclusion, Ahmed, you should go to the library and find the _Palestinian National Covenant (1964)_ and read it VERY CAREFULLY.  By the way, Redpath Library DOES have it in stock because that is exactly where I found it when I was doing my research.

The \\\"whole Russian strategy\\\" is not specific to Detroit or to Devellano, who was GM before Murray.  What the previous GM also did was to trade  away several players who have gone on to do well with other teams, most notably (in my memory) Murray Craven, who had a few very good years with Philly after leaving here.  Also, it's not the volume of trades that will  necessarily improve a team, but the quality of them.  Trading Adam Oates for Bernie Federko was just plain stupid, even if Federko used to be a  great player at one time.  Most of Murray's trades have worked significantly to the Wings' advantage, with those that didn't being soured mainly by  injury to the players involved (such as Troy Crowder, who suffered back problems from which he never really recovered).  Put Scotty Bowman, Pat Burns, or any of the other better coaches in the  league behind the bench of this Detroit team, and they could beat anybody.\",\"I am looking for some information of hidden line removal using Roberts algorithm.

The Alps ones are usually carried by the same folks who run the Audio Amateur magazine.  \",\" Amusing, isn't it?  Seems only the SDCNs realize how much baseball is a *team* game, combining efforts from every player for the win.  Consider the Red Sox game last night.  The Sox won 4-3 in the bottom of the 13th.  Who won the game?  -Clemens pitched a strong nine (?) innings, allowing only two runs. -Ryan pitched a couple shutout innings, though he needed some excellent  defensive plays behind him to do so. -Quantrill pitched a couple of innings, gave up the go-ahead run, and  got credited with the win when the Sox scored two in the bottom of  the inning.  Looks like a team effort to me!  Yet only Quantrill got credit for the win.  How about the offense? -Dawson and Vaughn hit (I think) HRs early in the game.  Without either  one, the Sox would have lost in nine. -Quintana led off the 13th with a solid single. -Zupcic pinch-ran for Quintana, providing the speed to go from first  to third when... -Cooper ripped a *second* single in the inning. -Melvin avoided the DP, getting the run home with a sac fly.  Not much of  a help, but it was something. -Scrub Richardson then hit a double, scoring the speedy Cooper all the  way from first!  (Hill's lack of defense helped.)  Cooper and Zupcic were credited with runs, Melvin and Richardson were credited with RBIs.  But it seems to me that it was Quintana's hit that set up the whole inning!  And did Melvin really contribute as much as Richardson?  Furthermore, people seem to consider RBIs to be more significant than runs.  Did Melvin contribute more than Cooper?  Cooper provided the game-winning baserunner, and moved the tying run to third base with only one out!  Assigning credit based on Runs and RBIs is clearly ridiculous.  You can argue that OBP and SLG don't show you who came through in the clutch, but R&RBI don't do any better.  At least OBP and SLG don't *claim* to try to tell you that.  Here's to the Red Sox who contributed to last night's victory.

If the (naive) market is flooded with proprietary, but weak, encryption, then truly strong  encryption will be unable to compete. Suppose the govt had a secret TV broadcast standard, and then sold TVs below cost. Private industry has a better standard, but it's not as widespread due to the govt early flooding of the market with cheap proprietary sets. Even though the industry's technology is better, the programming is being broadcast to the govt's unduplicatable standard. Who could compete?    The other flaw, of course, is that making something voluntary today ensures that it will be voluntary in the future. I went to renew my CA drivers license last week and was required not only to give my SSN, but to PRODUCE AN SSN CARD to veryify the number!

So far the \\\"evidence\\\" suggests that Nixon was a victim of overzealous underlings and Kennedy was a womanizing disgust-o-blob with a dash of megalomania. After crushing the CIA and FBI who's to say Kennedy  wouldn't have created his own version of American Friendly Fascism?  Unfortunately however, we don't have all the evidence. So far this nation's citizens have been privy to about 12 hours of the total 4,000 hours of Nixon's tapes. What's on the rest of those babies? Some archivists have alluded that there is \\\"evidence\\\" to suggest that Nixon and his cronies, including George Bush, were aware of the plot to murder Kennedy before he was shot in Dallas.

The fact is, there are *two* references to Jesus in _Antiquities of the Jews_, one of which has unquestionably at least been altered by Christians.  Origen wrote, in the third century, that Josephus did not recognize Jesus as the Messiah, while the long passage says the opposite.  There is an Arabic manuscript of _Antiquities of the Jews_ which contains a version of the passage which is much less gung-ho for Jesus and may be authentic.    There is no question that Origen, in the third century, saw a reference to Jesus in Josephus.  There are no manuscripts of _Antiquities_ which lack the references.  It is possible that it was fabricated out of whole cloth and inserted, but I don't think it's very likely--nor do I think there is a consensus in the scholarly community that this is the case. (I know G.A. Wells takes this position, but that's because he takes the very small minority view that Jesus never existed.  And he is a professor of German, not of biblical history or New Testament or anything directly relevant to the historicity of Jesus.)\",\" I knew that Cutie would sell us out.

The story is this: I bought a car out of state, and I'm trying to get the safety inspection in Pennsylvania. The problem is that the car has  aftermarket tint on all windows except the windshield. The tint is rather weak, and you can clearly see the inside of the car through the tint.  The inspection garage said that they won't pass it unless I get a waiver from the state police. So I went to the state police - the officer told me that aftermarket tint is illegal, and I can get a waiver only for a pre-84 car or for a medical reason. I asked him to show me the section of the vehicle code that says it's illegal.  He showed it to me and the paraghaph said that you can't have tint, if you can't see the inside of the car because of the tint. When I told him that you can in fact see the inside very well, he shut the book and said \\\"It's just illegal, and in fact we can have someone give you a ticket for it right now.\\\" Well, won't argue with that...  Since the vehicle code says it's OK as long as you can see through the tint, I'd like to keep it (I'll re-read the vehicle code in the library).  I'd also like to get some sort of paper from the police that says it's OK, so I can get the inspection, and so that I won't get in trouble for the tint later on. I also wouldn't mind registering a complaint against that officer - he really pissed me off.  So does anyone have any experience getting that sort of a paper from the police, especially in Pennsylvania? Does anyone have any experience registering a complaint against an officer? I called the station  later on today, but they basically said there is no place where I could register a complaint against an officer... And if I do decide to keep the tint and get a ticket anyway, how much of a chance do I stand to succesfully appeal the ticket in court?  Any comments about it will be welcome!\",\"Do the words \\\"chilling effect\\\" stimulate impulses within that small collection of neurons you call a brain?  cpk --  It's been 80 days.

Questions to Israelis   Dear Josh  I appreciate the fact that you sought to answer my questions.  Having said that, I am not totally happy with your answers.  1.   You did not fully answer my question whether Israeli ID cards identify the holders as Jews or Arabs. You imply that U.S. citizens must identify themselves by RACE. Is that true ? Or are just trying to mislead the reader ? Do you know of any democratic country where people are asked to reveal their ethnical or religious identity to any public official who so requests ?  2.  The answer to the second question is evasive. There are all kinds of maps issued.  They are not equivalent to State policy. You did not respond to my question.  3.  Your answer to the third question (Israeli nuclear arsenal) is interesting. You say that Israeli 'probably' stocks nuclear weapons. What evidence have you for maintaining that ?  4.  My fourth question was answered by someone else who posted a Ma'ariv article documenting such cases. I did not ask about cases like Vanunu (everybody knew he was tried and imprisoned) but about those about whom nobody even knows that they have been tried and imprisoned.  5.  Thanks for clarifying the question concerning the legal status of the inhabitants of the occupied territories. From it I understand that there are two sets of laws in these ares, one for the occupier (civil law) and one for the occupied (military law). The law allows Israeli Arabs to settle in Hebron, it seems. If so, why doesn't it allow Hebron Arabs to settle in Israel ?  6. Your answer to the question concerning rights to return conflicts with what I was told, namely that hundreds of thousands of non-Jews who left for some reason or other the area under Israel control during the war of 1947-8, were prevented from returning for the sole reason they were not Jews. Jews who also left, for example to Europe, to avoid the clashes, were allowed to return. How can you justify such discrimination, if this is true ? Is the mere fact of a person leaving area of combat to seek refuge somewhere else a reason for stripping him of his right to live in his homeland ?  7.  Somebody answered my 7.question regarding Y. Rabin signing an order for ethnical cleansing in 1948. According to that information, Y. Rabin signed the order for the expulsion of all inhabitants of Lydda and Ramleh, about 50,000 people.  These expulsions were helped by massacres of civilians and other atrocities which remind Bosnia. I was referred to a book by Israeli journalist Benny Goodman called The Origin of the Palestinian Refugee Problem, published by Cambridge University Press. Is this book available in your library ?  8.  You maintain that there are some Israeli Arabs living in Israeli kibbutzim. I wonder how many and where. There is very little evidence available about that. As much as I know, many Arabs are working *for* kibbutzim, even for many years, but are not accepted as members. Could it be that kibbutzim do not want Arabs ?  9.  My question about the lack of civil marriage in Israel was whether it is true that the Israeli legislator intended to discourage intermarriage. You did not address this question but evaded it by saying that the 'entire religious establishment wants to keep it what way'. I am certain that if only religious communities in the U.S. would be asked, they would gladly abolish civil marriage so that people would depend upon rabbis and priests to officiate marriages. But Israel has always been ruled by a secular majority. Your answer is not satisfactory.   I would be glad to have some more input from you after these comments.\",\"[snip] [stats deleted - we've all seen them by now]  I nominate this last bit for \\\"Anti-Stathead Quote of the Week\\\".

I can hardly imagine what the result would have been if the Clinton administration had actually supported this plan, instead of merely acquiescing with repugnance as they've so obviously doing.  I don't believe the chip originated with the Clinton administration either, but the Clinton administration has embraced it and brought it to fruition.  Both of the major parties have what they consider excellent reasons for limiting your freedoms and violating your privacy, and even seem to feel that they're doing you a favor.  If this is really surprising to anyone it means they've been willfully ignoring quite a bit of previous evidence.  There's only one political party (not calling anarchists a party) that considers your freedom and privacy goals worthy in and of themselves.

A few of their most whomped-up diesel trucks, maybe, load permitting.  The military surplus stuff I've driven -- \\\"Jeep Classic\\\" (Willys/Kaiser/AMC, pre-independent suspension) and Power Wagons (Slant 6 in a crew-cab pickup) weren't exactly congenial at highway speeds, and I wouldn't swear any of them would do 80 except as a bedload on a semi.  You just gotta love the standard military tire, too, or at least the one they used to use.  Designed circa WW II as a compromise between traction in icky sticky goo and longevity on sharp rocks and so forth, it's quite ill-adapted to high speeds on civilian roadways.  For those who can't remember what they look like, imagine a mountain-bike tire with a road rib in the middle, scaled up to car size. Oh, yeah, and narrow too. One of the standard mods for civilizing a surplus  Jeep was to install tires and wheels that reflected some of the advancements made in ride and handling since D-Day.  But the point made by Wharfie and others still stands:  if you're going to do 80 in a mil-spec '58 Power Wagon (or a Jeep or a tank transporter or other unwieldy rubber-tired vehicle) anywhere, I'd suggest the American interstate.   Your safe speed there tends to be limited more by your car and skills, road maintenance, and the swarms of fools around you; the roads were designed for going like the devil.

Okay, I  guess I should have somehow known that this was the case. Let the buyer beware, huh Apple?  Be that as it may, I have been thinking about the  problem and I'm puzzled. Why  can't a defencieny in the  ROM be made up for in software. I write software for a living (on unix platforms) and I don't understand the \\\"it just can't be done\\\" responses I've gotten from those I have asked so far.  Isn't Mode32, or somesuch piece of  soft- ware, just such a fix.   Anyway, I was hoping someone knowledgeable about Mac internals could set me straight: is it simply impossible for a mac SE to print grayscale, or could someone armed with enough info and a little pro- gramming experience cook something up that would supplement the ROM's capabilities?  Also, how does one know if one's mac can support the grayscale and photograde that the Select 300 is supposedly capable of? ( Short of buying the printer and trying it out like I did)  Thanks for your help.\",\" What do you mean by omnipotent here?  Do you mean by \\\"omnipotent\\\" that God should be able to do anything/everything?  This creates a self-contradictory definition of omnipotence which is effectively useless.  To be descriptive, omnipotence must mean \\\"being all-powerful\\\" and not \\\"being able to do anything/everything\\\".  Let me illustrate by analogy. Suppose the United States were the only nuclear power on earth.  Suppose further that the US military could not effectively be countered by any nation or group of nations.  The US has the power to go into any country at any time for any reason to straighten things out as the leaders of the US see fit.  The US would be militarily \\\"omnipotent\\\".  But suppose further that the US holds to a doctrine/philosophy of not interfering in the internal affairs of any nation, such as the current civil war in the former Yugoslavian states.  Technically (in this scenario) the US would have the power to  unilaterally go into Yugoslavia and straighten out the mess.  But effectively the US could not intervene without violating its own policy  of non-interference.  If the policy of non-interference were held to strongly enough, then there would never be a question that it would ever be violated.  Effectively, the US would be limited in what it could actually do, although it had the power to do \\\"whatever it wanted\\\". The US would simply \\\"never want to interfere\\\" for such an idea would be beyond the consideration of its leaders given such an inviolate non-interference policy.  God is effectively limited in the same sense.  He is all powerful, but He cannot use His power in a way that would violate the essence of what He, Himself is.  I hope this helps to clear up some of the misunderstanding concerning omnipotence.

In terms of laws regarding individual rights, restrictions on police searches, etc... (all closely related to crime) Canadian laws parallel England's and differ greatly from those of the United States.     Actually, they do not have \\\"roughly the same... urban economy\\\",  and extremely different ethnic composition.   However, if you account for economic and ethnic differences, the difference disappears completely: Seattle's minorities are predominatly poor, while Vancouver's are middle or upper class. The rates for whites in both cities were found to be identicle, while the rate for poor, Seattle minorities was almost three times as great as for the well-to-do minorities of Vancouver. The pattern seems to be one of poverty and race relations, not one of gun control.   That is a gross distortion: \\\"Self-defense\\\" does not mean killing the attacker. There were 21 cases of civilians killing their  attacker in self-defence. But such cases represent less that 0.5% of the crimes prevented by armed self-defence; for every case you cite, there were over 200 other cases of self-defence where the crime was prevented but the attacker was not killed. (0.5%, by the way, is the most conservative possible figure, based on the National Crime Survey's estimate of 80,000 crimes prevented by armed self-defence each year. Most other  studies on the subject put the figure at 500,000 to 600,000. Those figures would imply less than 0.08% of sucessful self-defences involve killing the attacker.)   So, more correctly, there over 4000 (possibly as many as 25,000)  cases of civilians acting in self-defence, only 21 of which resulted in the death of the attacker. This is a significant factor, in comparison to the 592 homicides. If memory serves, homicides make up approximately 1% of the violent crimes the study considered, so the fair comparison would be 40 - 250 homicides prevented and 592 homicides. Clearly, the study can not be close to accurate, since it ignored these cases of self-defence.\",\"  Since I repost this message again for the second time, I hope to hear from some folks on this topic.

Water is water, but can exist in three forms--liquid, ice and vapor. Thus it is possible for one essence to exist in three forms.  And recently, the pastor of my church drew an analogy, which I also found useful--A woman is often percieved by others in three ways, depending on their relationship to her--a mother, a wife and an employee in a business.  Thus, it seems clear to me that the essence of God can subsist in the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit or, depending on one's particular need for Him.\",\" I was wondering if any one knew how the various hard drive compression utilities work.

This was appraently attempted in the case of Vanunu and failed.  It has happened before, and there is reason to believe it still goes on.  Read this:  From Ma'ariv, February 18 (possibly 28), 1992  PUBLICATION BAN          The State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many         years there have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were         sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of         their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever         being made public.  By Baruch Me'iri  All those involved in this matter politely refused my request, one way or another: \\\"Look, the subject is too delicate.  If I comment on it, I will be implicitly admitting that it is true; If I mention a specific case, even hint at it, I might be guilty of making public something which may legally not be published\\\".  The State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many years there have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever being made public. More precisely: A court ordered publication ban was placed on the fact of their arrest, and later on their imprisonment.  In Israel of 1993, citizens are imprisoned without us, the citizens of this country, knowing anything about it.  Not knowing anything about the fact that one person or another were tried and thrown in prison, for security offenses, in complete secrecy.  In the distant past -- for example during the days of the [Lavon - YA] affair -- we heard about \\\"the third man\\\" being in prison.  But many years have passed since then, and what existed then can today no longer be found even in South American countries, or in the former Communist countries.  But it appears that this is still possible in Israel of 1993.  The Chair of the Knesset Committee on Law, the Constitution and Justice, MK David Zucker, sent a letter on this subject early this week to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice, and the Cabinet Legal Advisor.  Ma'ariv has obtained the content of the letter:  \\\"During the past several years a number of Israeli citizens have been imprisoned for various periods for security offenses.  In some of these cases a legal publication ban was imposed not only on the specifics of the crimes for which the prisoners were convicted, but even on the mere fact of their imprisonment.  In those cases, after being legally convicted, the prisoners spend their term in prison without public awareness either of the imprisonment or of the prisoner\\\", asserts MK Zucker.  On the other hand Zucker agrees in his letter that, \\\"There is absolutely no question that it is possible, and in some cases it is imperative, that a publication ban be imposed on the specifics of security offenses and the course of trials.  But even in such cases the Court must weigh carefully and deliberately the circumstances under which a trial will not be held in public.  \\\"However, one must ask whether the imposition of a publication ban on the mere fact of a person's arrest, and on the name of a person sentenced to prison, is justified and appropriate in the State of Israel.  The principle of public trial and the right of the public to know are not consistent with the disappearance of a person from public sight and his descent into the abyss of prison.\\\"  Zucker thus decided to turn to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice and the Cabinet Legal Advisor and request that they consider the question.  \\\"The State of Israel is strong enough to withstand the cost incurred by abiding by the principle of public punishment.  The State of Israel cannot be allowed to have prisoners whose detention and its cause is kept secret\\\", wrote Zucker.  The legal counsel of the Civil Rights Union, Attorney Mordechai Shiffman said that, \\\"We, as the Civil Rights Union, do not know of any cases of security prisoners, Citizens of Israel, who are imprisoned, and whose imprisonment cannot be made public.  This is a situation which, if it actually exists, is definitely unhealthy.  Just like censorship is an unhealthy matter\\\".  \\\"The Union is aware\\\", says Shiffman, \\\"of cases where notification of a suspect's arrest to family members and lawyers is withheld.  I am speaking only of several days.  I know also of cases where a detainee was not allowed to meet with an attorney -- sometimes for the whole first month of arrest.  That is done because of the great secrecy.  \\\"The suspect himself, his family, his lawyer -- or even a journalist -- can challenge the publication ban in court.  But there are cases where the family members themselves are not interested in publicity.  The journalist knows nothing of the arrest, and so almost everyone is happy...\\\"  Attorney Yossi Arnon, an official of the Bar, claims that given the laws as they exist in Israel today, a situation where the arrest of a person for security offenses is kept secret is definitely possible.  \\\"Nothing is easier.  The court orders a publication ban, and that's that.  Someone who has committed security offenses can spend long years in prison without us knowing anything about it.\\\"  -- Do you find this situation acceptable?  Attorney Arnon: \\\"Definitely not.  We live in a democratic country, and such a state of affairs is impermissible.  I am well aware that publication can be damaging -- from the standpoint of security -- but total non-publication, silence, is unacceptable. Consider the trial of Mordechai Vanunu: at least in his case we know that he was charged with aggravated espionage and sentenced to 18 years in prison.  The trial was held behind closed doors, nobody knew the details except for those who were authorized to.  It is somehow possible to understand, though not to accept, the reasons, but, as I have noted, we at least are aware of his imprisonment.\\\"  -- Why is the matter actually that serious?  Can't we trust the discretion of the court?  Attorney Arnon: \\\"The judges have no choice but to trust the presentations made to them. The judges do not have the tools to investigate.  This gives the government enormous power, power which they can misuse.\\\"  -- And what if there really is a security issue?  Attorney Arnon: \\\"I am a man of the legal system, not a security expert.  Democracy stands in opposition to security.  I believe it is possible to publicize the matter of the arrest and the charges -- without entering into detail.  We have already seen how the laws concerning publication bans can be misused, in the case of the Rachel Heller murder.  A suspect in the murder was held for many months without the matter being made public.\\\"  Attorney Shiffman, on the other hand, believes that state security can be a legitimate reason for prohibiting publication of a suspect's arrest, or of a convicted criminal's imprisonment.  \\\"A healthy situation?  Definitely not.  But I am aware of the fact that mere publication may be harmful to state security\\\".  A different opinion is expressed by attorney Uri Shtendal, former advisor for Arab affairs to Prime Ministers Levi Eshkol and Golda Meir.  \\\"Clearly, we are speaking of isolated special cases.  Such situations contrast with the principle that a judicial proceeding must be held in public. No doubt this contradicts the principle of freedom of expression.  Definitely also to the principle of individual freedom which is also harmed by the prohibition of publication.  \\\"Nevertheless\\\", adds Shtendal, \\\"the legislator allowed for the possibility of such a ban, to accommodate special cases where the damage possible as a consequence of publication is greater than that which may follow from an abridgment of the principles I've mentioned. The authority to decide such matters of publication does not rest with the Prime Minister or the security services, but with the court, which we may rest assured will authorize a publication ban only if it has been convinced of its need beyond a shadow of a doubt.\\\"  Nevertheless, attorney Shtendal agrees: \\\"As a rule, clearly such a phenomenon is undesirable. Such an extreme step must be taken only in the most extreme circumstances.\\\"\",\"I recently had to move and forgot to update my address to the Orthodox mailing list.

On the drawing you have a set of reference points whose true x,y positions are known.    Now you digitize the drawing manually (in this case, using Yaron Danon's excellent Digitize program).  That is, you use a program which converts cursor positions to x,y and saves those values when you click the mouse.  Upon digitizing you notice that the reference point values that come out of the digitizing process differ in small but significant ways from the known true values.  This is understandable because the scanned drawing is a reproduction of the original and there are successive sources of distortion such as differential expansion and contraction of paper, errors introduced in the printing process, scanner errors and what have you.  The errors are not uniform over the entire drawing, so \\\"global\\\" adjustments such as stretching/contracting uniformly over x or y, or rotating the whole drawing, are not satisfactory.  So the question is: does any kind soul know of an algorithm for removing such distortion?  In particular, if I have three sets of points   Reference(x,y) (the known true values)  DistortedReference(x,y) (the same points, with known errors)  DistortedData(x,y) (other points, with unknown errors)  what function of Reference and Distorted could I apply to DistortedData to remove the errors.  I suspect the problem could be solved by treating the distorted reference points as resulting from the projection of a \\\"bumpy\\\" 3d surface, solving for the surface and then \\\"flattening\\\" it to remove the errors in the other data points.

It was looking sparse (about 40 people) until the speaker began, whereupon about 120 more people followed the loudspeakers from wherever they had been lost, and filled out the area something proud.  Mike Yacino of GOAL spoke.  One of his best throwaway lines was to remind us that all of us holders of carry permits there had been checked and certified clear of all crimes by the state; while the people in the Statehouse behind us only had to be certified clean of \\\"election fraud\\\" to hold their jobs.  Nancy Snow and Amos Hamburger were busy handing out ID buttons and sheets describing all the bills to be presented at the hearings, and telling people where to find their own representatives (and in too many cases, who they were).  Mike warned us that the committee was going to suspend its rules and discuss a bill that hadn't made it onto the official list.  It seems a delegation of students from Simon's Rock of Bard College (alma mater of Wayne Lo, who shot up the place with an SKS late last year) was being bussed in to testify for a bill to ban all sales of firearms or ammo to anyone who is not a state resident.  The hearings were originally scheduled in the (large) Gardner Auditorium at 10:30, but that had been pre-empted by the Governor's hearings on the Framingham Eight (women in prison for killing abusive husbands, and seeking release).  So we had until 1:30 to buttonhole our representatives, after which we would be squashed into an inadequate hearing room.  One of my representatives' staffers was somewhat offensively smarmy. He said, \\\"Oh, it must be gun hearings day again!  The gun lobby is always so organized every year.\\\"  I got a little pissed, and replied, \\\"I'm not from the gun lobby -- I'm from your district.\\\"  At 12:30, your second reporter arrived in time to notice a demonstration going on in front of the statehouse (where the pro-gunners weren't).  Randy Price from the TV News was there, in his mirror reflective shades, talking to one of the anti-gun types, and several Simon's Rock anti-gun \\\"close-the-loophole\\\" protestors. (Earlier, Randy had covered the GOAL rally.)  The room we had been assigned seated about 50.  Remember, there were about 160 gun owners there, plus another 20-30 students and teachers from Bard.  One of us had already reserved a seat; the other never got closer than the atrium outside -- and there was a crowd behind HIM.  A cop took up station at the entrance and prevented the rest of the crowd from coming in.  Soon after the debate started, a loudspeaker was set up outside in the hall for the benefit of everyone else.  Everyone who was there (inside and outside) got to sign up on a sheet saying what their position was on which bills.  Most of us signed up to \\\"support GOAL's position\\\" on \\\"all bills.\\\"  First, because of their time constraints, public officials got to testify.  And first up was the bill that nobody had seen (the students had some curfew, I guess).    Currently, Massachusetts law allows a non-resident to purchase long guns or ammo from a local dealer provided he complies with the laws of his own state.  Previously, the law was similar, but applied only to non-residents from states adjoining Massachusetts.  The Simon's Rock folks called the current law a \\\"loophole\\\" and wanted it closed.  Two of their reps spoke about Wayne Lo and his \\\"SKS assault rifle.\\\" The second one, Hodgekiss, a co-sponsor, had done his homework so well that he kept confusing Montana (Wayne Lo's home state) with Missouri, and became belligerent when about five gun owners in the gallery corrected him after his second muff.  Carr, from Gloucester, claimed that the new bill would put the law back the way it was, but he was lying: the new bill allows purchases by non-residents of adjoining states ONLY if they have licensing in their own state \\\"as strong as\\\" that in Massachusetts.  Since none of them do, that's that.  Some of the things these two said were really offensive.  \\\"In some of these other states, anyone can buy a gun as long as he's breathing!\\\" (Oooooo!)  \\\"We have some very, very good gun laws in Massachusetts; if only the other states would adopt the same type of laws, we wouldn't be having this situation -- but they won't.\\\"  (Naughty, naughty!)  Next up was Boston city councilman Albert \\\"Dapper\\\" O'Neill.  He was there to testify pro-gun, but in some ways he was a liability.  He's reasonably elderly and tends to wander and repeat himself, plus he's almost a caricature of a law-n-order politician.  He badmouthed the ACLU, said violent criminals should be executed, and that if he were judge, he'd give arrestees their \\\"last rights\\\" (pun intended) on the spot (at which many of the gun owners applauded, which bothered me.) He said that all the proposed gun restrictions were a step in the right direction -- for the criminals.  He said this FOUR times :-(  Two of the bills under consideration would allow police to rescind a CCW or FID, and confiscate all your guns, if someone had filed a restraining order against you.  (Note that the filing of a restraining order requires no warrant, no hearing, no evidence, and no conviction -- just an accusation.)  Senator Barrett of Reading testified in favor of it, and patronized the pro-gunners there several times by saying, \\\"I'm sure all the gun owners here will agree with me that we have to get these weapons out of the hands of people that our courts have convicted.\\\"  I haven't seen such a disgustingly disingenuous performance since Nixon whined that he wasn't a crook.  Barrett also spoke in favor of the bill making the FID card renewable every five years, instead of permanent as it is now.  The stated purpose is to remove FID cards from those who have become ineligible. \\\"Revenue has nothing to do with it.\\\"  (Yeah, right.)  Apparently, some congressmen think we're stupid enough to swallow the argument that it's preferable to process 1.6 million renewals every cycle in the vague hope of catching a recent felon than to simply take the goddamn card away from a criminal at conviction time.  As usual, hassle the law-abiding instead of the crook.  The two co-chairs of the committee were Rep. Caron and Sen. Jujuga. Jujuga didn't say much (he was a co-sponsor of both \\\"restraining order\\\" bills) but Caron struck me as a sharp guy that wouldn't let any bad logic or lies on the part of either side to go unchallenged.  (He  was a co-sponsor of one of the \\\"restraining order\\\" bills as well.)  One of the younger reps on the committee (forgot his name) was vociferously pro-gun, somewhat embarrassingly so.  His heart was in the right place, but his arguments seemed to be confined to, \\\"every year it's the same damn thing, you come in here with this crap...\\\" It's nice to have a friend on the committee, but he could have been more effective.  At about 3:00, it was clear that the hall-jam couldn't continue. Someone came out of another meeting hall and yelled at the cop because the loudspeaker was disturbing their meeting, so the loudspeaker was disconnected.  So they found a bigger hall upstairs.  One of us had to leave to catch his charter bus, and so missed the \\\"public\\\" testimony; the other got a seat this time.  Caron began by talking about how he got his FID 16 years ago, left the state, and then returned without notifying them of his address change. He complained that the state record system was not up-to-date and that his PD back in his city of birth still thought he lived there.  Great quote: \\\"If you purchase a gun today, it will not get into the state computer system until 1999.\\\"  (This was also an argument he used against the renewable FID card.)  Testimony was heard from several \\\"battered women,\\\" one of whom had been attacked by some guy in his 20's who had an FID card because he got it when he was 15 or thereabouts.  They used a lot of emotion and said how they were scared of these men.  A staffer of Attorney General Harshbarger testified in favor of this anti-gun bill, saying how 50,000 restraining orders were granted last year, and how these women needed to be protected.  Caron noted that a restraining order was granted for 10 days, and then a hearing was held to determine whether the order would be extended to a year.  He asked whether she would be satisfied if the FID were revoked at the time of this hearing rather than after the initial issuance of the FID.  She gave some long rambling circumlocution in response.  Then testimony against the bill was heard.  Mike Yacino (who looks something like Einstein) got up and made the point that restraining orders were issued on too little evidence, that judges like to issue restraining orders just to let things cool off no matter who they think is right (man or woman), and that the hearings for restraining orders are lightning sessions with little time to consider facts. Atty. Karen McNutt spoke with him a few times during his testimony.  Other pro-gunners got up to testify.  One said he had had to file a restraining order against a tenant to clear her out, and that she countered by filing one against him!  He noted that this would have allowed the state to confiscate his guns if the new bill became law. One of the junior reps noted that \\\"this is America\\\" and we have to be certain that individual rights are respected.  Senator Jujuga reiterated this, saying that \\\"people who abuse smaller people can go to Hell as far as I care, but we have to be careful about equating conviction with a restraining order.\\\"  (Point and match, Senator.)  Another pro-gunner got up and testified that he didn't know his citizenship \\\"expired every 5 years,\\\" and that a driver's license was a privilege, not a right like the right to keep and bear arms.  A third got up and said the problem was with the criminal justice system, and argued in favor of a death penalty bill and public hangings.  Senator Jujuga said he had himself tried to get a death penalty bill passed, and joking responded that he, too, favored public hangings.  The speaker then responded, \\\"I'll make you a deal.  You get me the rope, and I'll tie the noose.\\\"  Next came public testimony on the Simon's Rock bill.  A teacher testified that she had been the teacher of Wayne Lo, and that \\\"he wouldn't have been able to shoot people inside a building while he was outside\\\" without his evil gun.  She said that the \\\"loophole\\\" should be closed to prevent something like this from \\\"ever happening again\\\".  Four or five other kids testified in favor of this bill, one of spilling tears for the good legislators.  One of the students actually shot by Wayne Lo was also there.  Many of them had T shirts on, saying, \\\"As long as one person can buy a gun in anger, none of us are safe -- support gun control.\\\"  The committee was reluctant to grill or correct the kids, except for Caron, who corrected one student who had claimed that anyone could apply for an FID.  \\\"Only residents can get FID's,\\\" he said.  (How much do you want to bet that this kid had no idea he had been conned into testifying for a bill that would cut out-of-staters completely off?)  Yacino and McNutt spoke again, this time noting that the bill as written would affect both ammo AND ALL guns possessed by out-of-staters.  Karen also noted that hunters in CT, NH, and VT could be put away for a year if they wandered across the MA boundary somewhere in the woods and got challenged by game wardens.  Yacino underscored the fact that Lo COULD have gotten an FID as a resident student -- and, hell, even an CCW, as he had NO criminal or mental record.  One junior rep was upset that it would take MA residents longer to buy a gun than out-of-staters, and thought it was \\\"elitist\\\".  Another (Caron?) said that we need the protection of preventing non-residents from buying without an FID because only two other states in the union had \\\"FID-type\\\" cards, so complying with all the laws of one's home state was \\\"not enough.\\\"  One pro-gun speaker replied that this resembled a mother watching her son in a marching band and exclaiming, \\\"Everyone's out of step but Johnny!\\\"  All the Bard College people were filing out as the pro-gun testimony for this bill was made, and thus only pro-gunners were around when the other bills came under consideration.  The main bills remaining (and GOAL's position) were:  o  H.4375 and four others: Notify police chiefs so they can pull     licenses when a holder is convicted (strongly supported)  o  H.1732: Require trigger locks on all handguns sold (opposed)  o  H.962: Require trigger locks on all loaded firearms (strongly    opposed)  o  H.1350: Allow every municipality to enact their own gun laws     (opposed)  o  H.1731: Fund bullet-proof vests for municipal police (supported)  o  S.1097: State Constitutional Amendment for the RKBA (supported)  o  Several on police discretion in the issuance of FID cards (opposed)  o  Several altering non-resident license conditions (supported)  o  H.1135: Ban damn near all guns everywhere in the state (guess!)  Some of these took only 30 seconds to consider, as the remaining pro-gunners raised hands in unison either for or against them.  Mike Yacino noted that, besides the danger in screwing with a trigger lock on a loaded gun, that bill would make it illegal for a licensee to carry his concealed handgun unless it were locked.  Caron blew right through H.1350 when he saw that we opposed it. Again, he brought up the state's archaic records capability and said, \\\"This would create hundreds of different licensing systems.\\\"  The session ran late -- since it was the last scheduled hearing, it could not be adjourned until everyone who wanted to had testified.

TRANSLATION   The Vedas deal mainly with the subject of the three modes of material nature. O Arjuna, become transcendental to these three modes. Be free from all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and safety, and be established in the self.                                    PURPORT   All material activities involve actions and reactions in the three modes of material nature. They are meant for fruitive results, which cause bondage in the material world. The Vedas deal mostly with fruitive activities to gradually elevate the general public from the field of sense gratification to a position on the transcendental plane. Arjuna, as a student and friend of Lord Krsna, is advised to raise himself to the transcendental position of Vedanta philosophy where, in the beginning, there is brahma-jijnasa, or questions on the supreme transcendence. All the living entities who are in the material world are struggling very hard for existence. For them the Lord, after creation of the material world, gave the Vedic wisdom advising how to live and get rid of the material entanglement. When the activities for sense gratification, namely the karma-kanda chapter, are finished, then the chance for spiritual realization is offered in the form of the Upanisads, which are part of different Vedas, as the Bhagavad-gita is a part of the fifth Veda, namely the Mahabharata. The Upanisads mark the beginning of transcendental life.   As long as the material body exists, there are actions and reactions in the material modes. One has to learn tolerance in the face of dualities such as happiness and distress, or cold and warmth, and by tolerating such dualities become free from anxieties regarding gain and loss. This transcendental position is achieved in full Krsna consciousness when one is fully dependent on the good will of Krsna.  Bhagavad-Gita As It is Books of A.C.

FACT SHEET                    PUBLIC ENCRYPTION MANAGEMENT  The President has approved a directive on \\\"Public Encryption Management.\\\"  The directive provides for the following:  Advanced telecommunications and commercially available encryption are part of a wave of new computer and communications technology.  Encryption products scramble information to protect the privacy of communications and data by preventing unauthorized access.  Advanced telecommunications systems use digital technology to rapidly and precisely handle a high volume of communications.  These advanced telecommunications systems are integral to the infrastructure needed to ensure economic competitiveness in the information age.  Despite its benefits, new communications technology can also frustrate lawful government electronic surveillance.  Sophisticated encryption can have this effect in the United States.  When exported abroad, it can be used to thwart foreign intelligence activities critical to our national interests.  In the past, it has been possible to preserve a government capability to conduct electronic surveillance in furtherance of legitimate law enforcement and national security interests, while at the same time protecting the privacy and civil liberties of all citizens.  As encryption technology improves, doing so will require new, innovative approaches.  In the area of communications encryption, the U. S. Government has developed a microcircuit that not only provides privacy through encryption that is substantially more robust than the current government standard, but also permits escrowing of the keys needed to unlock the encryption.  The system for the escrowing of keys will allow the government to gain access to encrypted information only with appropriate legal authorization.  To assist law enforcement and other government agencies to collect and decrypt, under legal authority, electronically transmitted information, I hereby direct the following action to be taken:  INSTALLATION OF GOVERNMENT-DEVELOPED MICROCIRCUITS  The Attorney General of the United States, or her representative, shall request manufacturers of communications hardware which incorporates encryption to install the U.S. government-developed key-escrow microcircuits in their products.  The fact of law enforcement access to the escrowed keys will not be concealed from the American public.  All appropriate steps shall be taken to ensure that any existing or future versions of the key-escrow microcircuit are made widely available to U.S. communications hardware manufacturers, consistent with the need to ensure the security of the key-escrow system.  In making this decision, I do not intend to prevent the private sector from developing, or the government from approving, other microcircuits or algorithms that are equally effective in assuring both privacy and a secure key- escrow system.  KEY-ESCROW  The Attorney General shall make all arrangements with appropriate entities to hold the keys for the key-escrow microcircuits installed in communications equipment.  In each case, the key holder must agree to strict security procedures to prevent unauthorized release of the keys.  The keys shall be released only to government agencies that have established their authority to acquire the content of those communications that have been encrypted by devices containing the microcircuits.  The Attorney General shall review for legal sufficiency the procedures by which an agency establishes its authority to acquire the content of such communications.  PROCUREMENT AND USE OF ENCRYPTION DEVICES  The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with other appropriate U.S. agencies, shall initiate a process to write standards to facilitate the procurement and use of encryption devices fitted with key-escrow microcircuits in federal communications systems that process sensitive but unclassified information.  I expect this process to proceed on a schedule that will permit promulgation of a final standard within six months of this directive. \",\"  You sonuvabitch.

This was a heresy that was condemned in the Council of Chalcedon in 451 AD.  It grew up in reaction to Nestorianism, which held that the Son and Jesus are two different people who happened to be united in the same body temporarily.  Monophysitism is held by the Copts of Egypt and Ethipoia and by the Jacobites of Syria and the Armenian Orthodox.  It believes that Jesus Christ was God (which is correct), that he was man (which is correct), that he was one person (which is correct), but that he had only one nature and one will and oen energy (which is heretical, the orthodox position is that he had two natures and two wills and two energies, both divine and human, though the wills were in perfect harmony).  That is what Mike is trying to get across, that while Jesus came in human form, Mike says He did not have a human nature or a human will.  In reality, he had both, though neither made him subject to original sin. It is interesting to note that the Monothelites were a reaction to this conflict and attempted to solve the problem by admitting two natures but not two wills or two energies.  It also was condemned, at a late council in Constantinople I believe.

First somebody was accusing him of being self-righteous and unconvincing. Now we are told that we Christians should be embarrassed by him. (As well as by Josh McDowell, about whom I have no comment, having never read his work.)  Anyone who thinks that C. S. Lewis was self-righteous ought to read his introduction to The Problem of Pain, which is his theodicy. In it, he explains that he wanted to publish the book anonymously. Why? Although he believed in the argument he was presenting, he did not want to seem to presume to tell others how brave they should be in the face of their own suffering.

As all infants are in sin from the time of conception (cf Romans 5.12, Psalm 1.7), they cannot possibly merit heaven, and as purgatory is for the purging of temporal punishment and venial sins, it is impossible that origianl sin can be forgiven.  Hence, the unbaptized infants are cut off from the God against whom they, with the whole of the human race except Mary, have sinned.  Which is why Jesus said, \\\"Truly, truly I say to you, no one can enter the Kingdom of God unless he is born of water and Spirit\\\" which is the true meaning of born again (John 3.5).  Thus, as infants are in sin, it is very fair for them to be cut off from God and exlcuded from heaven.  As St. Augustine said, \\\"I did not invent original sin, which the Catholic faith holds from ancient time; but you, who deny it, without a doubt are a follower of a new heresy.\\\"  (De nuptiis, lib. 11.c.12)\",\"  I'm confused.  How is it Hal McRae's fault that he can't win with a team  whose best offensive player is Phil Hiatt?  I mean, let's be real.  Kansas City will have to get outstanding years from their entire staff just to end up near .500; they have less offense than any other team in baseball, even if you count the expansion teams.  \",\"DM> Fact or rumor....?

Adams (starowl@a2i.rahul.net)   Champaign, IL / southeast AL\",\"  This meaningless statement makes YOU look bad.  \",\" That's nothing.  When a friend of mine went shopping for a small sedan a few years ago, she brought me along as a token male so the salespeople wouldn't give her the \\\"bimbo\\\" treatment. Her first choice was a Mazda 323, and second choice was a Nissan Sentra.  We went to a Mazda dealership and described what \\\"we\\\" wanted.  We started negotiating on the price, and the salesdroid kept playing the \\\"let me run this price by the sales manager\\\".  After playing the \\\"good salesman, bad salesman\\\" game, we finally told him that if he didn't have the authority to negotiate a price, perhaps we should be speaking directly to someone who did.  He brought in the sales manager who proceeded to dick us around with every trick in the book.  (Read Remar Sutton's \\\"Don't Get Taken Every Time\\\" for a list.)  Finally, after playing a few more rounds of \\\"you'll have to work with us on this price\\\", also known as \\\"each time you come up a thousand dollars we'll come down ten\\\", the salesmanager gave a signal to his two sales cronies, stood up, and said \\\"well, we can't come down any more so I guess we can't help you\\\" and they trouped out of the room, leaving us sitting in the salesman's office all by ourselves.  Hmm. I'd read that sleazy salesmen sometimes bug their own offices so they can leave and listen in on couples discussing the sales offer, and I mentioned this aloud to my friend while we were sitting there wondering why they would leave us in the office instead of showing us to the door.  For lack of anything better to do, I picked up the phone on the desk and called another Mazda dealership, asked for a salesman, and began discussing what kind of price they would consider.  A few sentences into the conversation, Mr. Salesmanager broke into the line (!) and began telling me how rude he thought it was that I would call another dealership from \\\"his\\\" phone!  I said that since he'd announced that our business was over, he shouldn't care, and every time I tried to talk to the other sales guy the sales manager would drown out our voices with his own.  (How did he know that I was using the phone, anyway?)  Finally, I hung up and we headed out of the showroom. Sales manager and cronies come out of a little unmarked room and he begins to berate us again.  We say that we won't bother him anymore, we're going next door to the Nissan dealership.  Then comes the part I wish I could have videotaped.  As we go out the front door, the sales manager SHOUTS across the entire showroom, customers and all, \\\"Go ahead!

I believed this and to put it nicely, it was a piece of junk!  I loved this car, I babied it, I pampered it, and after 2 years, it just couldn't stay together, I would say that not everyone will have the problems that I had, but know this, it's not just the car, it is the ability to get the car fixed, which will NOT happen at any chrysler/dodge/take your pick dealer.  I don't care if there are going to reform their dealers/service with the intro of the LH cars, I will believe it when I see it.  Case and point, the local dodge dealer.  You drive up, just looking, you don't even get out of your door, when about 10 (yes 10) salesman all eye you like their next meal, and literally pounce on you, and try to get you to make a deal, on everything your eye wanders towards. Service is about 2 times worse than that.  I had an alignment problem, but they tried to tell me that the K frame was bent, and about 2000 dollars of work/parts to fix it.  Let me tell you the problems I had, and I took care of this car, I put alot of miles on it in the first couple years, but took it to every checkup it needed, and many that shouldn't have been.  1988 Dodge Shadow ES  These were replaced within the 4 years that I owned the car.

For about a year before I sold the car, I said to myself, it's a good car, I just can't find anybody competent enough the fix it.  In the end, before I traded it in for a Saturn, the power steering started acting up again.  I just stopped putting money into it.  I must have put at least $5000-$7000 worth of repairs over it's lifetime.  I am sorry but Lee Iacocca can bite me.  Bullshit, whoever backs em best, is just afraid the stupid things are going to fall apart, and no one will buy them without assurance, why the hell do you think that LH has been nicknamed Last Hope.  You can do better, and I know people will disagree with me here, but Japanese, like Honda, or Toyota, or the only american car company that I feel is a quality product, Saturn.  I will not touch another chrysler product again, no way.  I don't care how good the LH cars look good, and I will admit they look promising, but not with the support that you get.  GM isn't much better, thank god, they don't control Saturn, like they do their divisions, or it would be just another marketing ploy.    Don't get me wrong, i will be watching my car (which I do like) like a hawk for the next 4 years.  I am much more hesitant to say it (or any) car is really good, until it has proved itself to me.  But since someone else pointed out C&D as a source.  I will note, because I used to read these magazines, that Car and Driver has never had a good thing to say about most Chrysler products (Shadow for one), always were they moaning about the reguritated K-car, and engine.  Whereas Motor Trend always thought they were great cars.  No car magazine is really objective.  And although there are alot of people who don't like Consumers Reports, I will use them to reinforce my argument (I already know about the big stink with the Saturn crash tests, time will tell how good a car they are), the shadow/sundance rate much worse than average, in fact none of the chrysler's rate a better than average, I think the best one is just average.  Excluding the diamond star/mitsubishi stuff and the LH's.  You can find bad stuff about the Shadow.  Try as I might, when I researched the Saturn, I could not find anything bad about it.  There is a great deal of information about this company, just because it is a new american company and it has created quite a stir in the automotive community, for good reason.  Much more than the introduction of any new model lines of any established company.  I read an article, which had a sub-column, an I think this imprinted on me more than anything else.  Some big wig in Toyota said and I quote, \\\"We are watching them very closely.\\\"  Come on, everybody grow up, the foreign cars, especially the japanese have been kicking our butts, for good reason, the american car companies could not make a good product or support the customer the way they want these days, to set in their ways, which is one of the reasons Saturn was created.  They are still struggling because they haven't learned yet.  They have the ability, the workers are not inferior, the technology is not out of date, but their attitude is, and they are just finding this out.

This \\\"alt.taoism\\\" could also be a refuge  for debates about what \\\"Taoism *REALLY* means\\\" or speculations on sexual alchemy, etc..  e.g. (from Thyagi again):  Kent gloomily predicts (quoting from Thyagi's article):   I think that discussions of this nature are not completely out of place. What's happening is that that the term \\\"Taoism\\\" is becoming completely polluted and trivialized like the words \\\"magic\\\", \\\"Alchemy\\\",  \\\"Zen,\\\" etc., by writers appropriating the word to mean whatever they  want. This is seen by the spate of new age books entitled \\\"The Tao of\\\" this, that, and everything else. (With respect to some exceptions like the books by Jou, Tsung-Hwa.)  Any other comments/ideas? I look forward to seeing them. On balance, I say let misc.taoism rip and let the chips fall where they may.

Thanks! \",\" Ben,  Since you're obviously adept enough to understand how the trackball works, the only thing short of repairing it that I can think of is a thorough cleaning of all the parts, and then checking for the proper placement of the little blue rollers. Since they aren't fixed in position on their stainless steel pins, you might try sliding them into a slightly different position. On my PowerBook 100, I can slide them almost completely out of contact with the trackball. In fact, one of the notes from sumex on fixing the trackball advocates sliding the roller so that its _edge_ contacts the ball, not the center cylindrical area.  I've done this with my PB100, and it does seem to improve the feel, but needs to be adjusted from time to time. I just popped open one of our office's PB170s, and while there isn't as much latitude for movement, one could still adjust the roller slightly. If your PB140 is the same it might help.  I would suspect the most likely culprit to be a slippery blue roller. If you can take it out, clean it with a mild soapy solution, or isopropyl  alcohol. Also, be sure the ball is grease-free.  If you drop the ball in minus the retaining ring, roll the ball and see if it is actually causing the axle to spin.   If all this still doesn't solve it, then maybe a new one is in order. :-( It could be an electrical connection, in which case replacement would be necessary. But my experience with both mice and trackballs has been that dirt has been the normal problem, not an electrical malfunction.

The Braves have plenty of pitchers to fit this description, although right now I'd expect Smoltz or Glavine to take the mantle.   What the Braves lack, however, is an offensive stopper, somebody they can look to to bring them out of their hitting slump. There's just no one there.  The Braves got rid of their best pure hitter, Lonnie Smith, and only Terry Pendleton on the current roster has ever shown more than a cursory ability to hit.

Randy Weaver/Kevin Harris trial update: Day 4.  Friday, April 16, 1993 was the fourth day of the trial.  Synopsis: Defense attorney Gerry Spence cross-examined agent Cooper under repeated objections from prosecutor Ronald Howen.  Spence moved for a mistrial but was denied.  The day was marked by a caustic cross-examination of Deputy Marshal Larry Cooper by defense attorney Gerry Spence.  Although Spence has not explicitly stated so, one angle of his stategy must involve destroying the credibility of agent Cooper.  Cooper is the government's only eyewitness to the death of agent Degan. Spence attacked Cooper's credibility by pointing out discrepancies between Cooper's statements last September and those made in court. Cooper conceded that, \\\"You have all these things compressed into a few seconds...It's difficult to remember what went on first.\\\"  Cooper acknowledged that he carried a \\\"9mm Colt Commando submachine gun with a silenced barrel.\\\" [I thought a Colt Commando was a revolver!] Cooper continued by stating that the federal agents had no specific plans to use the weapon when they started to kill Weaver's dog.  When Spence asked how seven cartridges could be fired by Degan's M-16 rifle when Degan was apparently dead, Cooper could not say for sure that Degan did not return fire before going down.  Spence continued by asking with how many agents (and to what extent) had Cooper discussed last August's events, Cooper responded, \\\"If you're implying that we got our story together, you're wrong, counselor.\\\"  Spence continued to advance the defense's version of the events: Namely, that a marshal had started the shooting by killing the Weaver's dog.  Cooper disagreed.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Ronald Howen repeatedly objected to Spence's virulent cross-examination of agent Cooper, arguing that the questions were repetitive and Spence was wasting time.  Howen also complained  that Spence was improperly using a cross-examination to advance the defense's version of the events.  U.S. District Judge Edward Lodge sustained many of the objections; however, both lawyers persisted until Judge Lodge had the jury leave the room and proceded to admonish both attorneys.  \\\"I'm not going to play games with either counsel.  This has been a personality problem from day 1, so start acting like professionals.\\\"  Spence told the judge that, \\\"When all the evidence is in, we'll see that ... his [agent Larry Cooper] testimony is not credible, that he was panicked and cannot remember the sequence of events.\\\"  Spence continued, \\\"We're going to find...that there is a very unlikely similarity - almost as if it had come out of a cookie cutter - between the testimony of Mr. Cooper and the other witnesses.\\\"  Spence then moved for a mistrial on the grounds that Howen's repeated objections would prevent a fair trial, \\\"We can't have a fair trial if the jury believes I'm some sort of charlatan, if the jury believes I'm bending the rules or engaging in some delaying tactic or that I'm violating court orders.\\\"  Judge Lodge called the notion that his repeated sustainings of Howen's objections had somehow prejudiced the jury was \\\"preposterous\\\" and denied the motion for a mistrial.  Lodge did tell Howen to restrict his comments when objecting.  The trial resumed with the prosecution calling FBI Special Agent Greg Rampton.  The prosecution's purpose was simply to introduce five weapons found in the cabin as evidence: However, the defense seized on the opportunity to further address Cooper's credibility.  Defense attorney Ellison Matthews (Harris' other attorney) questioned Rampton about the dog.  Rampton stated that there were no specific plans to kill the Weaver's dog without being detected.  Matthews then had Rampton read  a Septtember 15, 1992 transcript in which Rampton had said that Cooper had said that the purpose of the silenced weapon was to kill the dog without being detected, if the dog chased them. Rampton then acknowledged that he believed that Cooper had said that, but he could not remember when.  He then stated that, \\\"I did not conduct the primary interview with Deputy Cooper, but I have had conversations with him since the interview was conducted.\\\"\",\"Boy that was really humorous.

The question is how much that quality is worth to a ham in amateur service, not commercial service   Ok, great. But how often does that come up?  How good is \\\"good enough\\\", and how much is someone willing to pay for it? A good ham-quality HT is maybe $500, while a commercial quality one is maybe $2000. Is the increased reliability and performance worth 4 times the price *in amateur service*? Only the individual involved can answer that question, and each ham has to decide for him/herself.  If Motorola quality is worth 4 times the price to you, then more power to ya'. But I'm amazed that folks make that choice. For, me, given that I've got $2000 to spend, I'l pick the Yaesu ht and a nice new HF rig every time over a Motorola ht alone, no matter how good it is.  To me, ham-quality gear is \\\"good enough\\\". To each his own...  73... Mike, N4PDY\",\" After IBM had invented the DES and the NBS had advertised for proposals, but before IBM had decided to respond, I argued strenuously that they  should not; they should keep it proprietary.   The biggest proponent of proposing was Dr. Lewis Branscomb.  Dr. Branscomb was the IBM Chief Scientist and had come to IBM from NBS.  Fortunately for all of us, Dr. Branscomb understood the answer to the above question much better than I.  He realized how difficult it would be to gain acceptance for any cryptographic mechanism.  Because of the necessary complexity, publicity would not be sufficient and neither would  authority.  In fact, it has taken both of those plus more than 15  years.  We have also had independence.  The DES was solicited by NBS, invented and proposed by IBM, and vetted by NBS.  It has also been examined and vetted by experts like Adi Shamir, who are not subject to influence by any of these.  Even now, there are still people posting on this list who do not trust the DES in spite of all the time, all of the analysis, and all of the public scrutiny.  (Of course, it is just this point that NIST misses when it attempts to  gain acceptance for a novel mechanism, developed in secret, on the basis of authority alone.)  We had a long thread here about whether or not the NSA can \\\"break\\\" the DES.  That is a silly question.  At some cost and in some time they can \\\"break\\\" anything.  The important question is at what cost and in what time.  The fundamental strength of the DES and RSA are not nearly so important as what we know about their strength.  As long as we understand the cost and duration for an attacker, then we can use them in a safe way. At this point, we may never replace either because of the inability of any successor to overcome this knowledge gap.  DES and RSA are among the most significant inventions of the century and the most important inventions in the history of cryptography. We are damned lucky to have them.\",\"    On Palm Sunday at our parish, we were \\\"invited\\\" to take the role of Jesus in the Passion.  I declined to participate.  Last year at the liturgy meeting I pointed out how we crucify Christ by our sins, so therefore it is appropriate that we retain the role of the crowd, but to no avail.      As a member of a liturgy committee, I can tell you that the problem is certain people dominating, who want to try out all kinds of innovations.  The priests don't seem even to _want_ to make any decisions of their own in many cases.  I guess it's easier to \\\"try something new\\\" than it is to refuse to allow it.     At our parish on Holy Thursday, instead of the priests washing feet (\\\"Who wants to get around people's feet,\\\" according to one of our priests) the congregation was \\\"invited\\\" to come up and help wash one another's hands.     The symbolism of this action distressed me, and again I refused to participate.  I thought that if we were to have to come up with rubrics for this liturgical action (i.e. \\\"Body of Christ\\\" -- \\\"Amen\\\" for receiving Communion), that they could be \\\"I am not responsible for the blood of this man.\\\"     Also for part of the Eucharistic Prayer (\\\"Blessed are You, God of all creation...\\\") was substituted some text read by a lay couple.  The priest certainly should not have given this part of the Mass over to others, and I was so disturbed that I declined to receive Communion that night (we aren't required to anyway -- I instead offered up prayers for our priests and parish).      The quality of the Mass has not changed.  Again, if it were to be celebrated according to the rubrics set down by the Church, it would still be \\\"liturgically\\\" beautiful.  The problem comes about from people trying to be \\\"creative\\\" who are not.     I think the answer to your question on participation could be that given by Father Peter Stravinskas in answer to the question posed by the title of Thomas Day's _Why Catholics Can't Sing_.  \\\"They don't want to\\\" because of all this nonsense.     By the way, for any non-Catholics reading this, the problem does not reflect bad liturgy by the Catholic Church, but by those who are disobedient to the Church in changing it on their own \\\"authority.\\\"\",\" There is a mini-epidemic of Coccidiodes that is occurring in, I believe, the Owen's Valley/ Bishop area east of the Sierras.

It's somewhat ironic that our exposure to bigotry happens in this instance to have originated in rec.scouting, since I always understood scouting to teach tolerance and diversity.  I understand bigotry to be irrational prejudice against other people who happen to be of a different race, religion, ethnic background, sex, or other inconsequential characteristics.  All the evidence I've seen indicates that sexual orientation and lack of belief in gods are exactly such inconsequential characteristics.

But I can't guarantee that I'm not way off base...  The permenant swap file is read/written to by windows by talking directly to the hard disk controller card.  The controller card must use the protocal set up by western digital (or something like that). Windows creates a file called spart.par in your windows directory that points to that file.  It then uses the physical information about your disk to index to information in that file.  compressed disks are actually \\\"logical\\\" disks.  These disks have different characteristics than the actual physical disk.  Furthermore, the information on the compressed disks must be uncompressed before it is used.  (i.e it must go through the decompression program that traps disk reads at the operating system level or the BIOS level).  Because of this \\\"inbetween\\\" program, windows cannot use direct methods to read from the \\\"logical\\\" disk.  a permenant swap file is only there to \\\"reserve\\\" an area of the disk that windows can use and to block that space from DOS.  Windows would theoretically not even have to access the file from DOS to use that disk space. (I don't know if it does or doesn't...but it checks for it somewhere everytime you boot windows.)  a temporary swap file is just a normal DOS file that is accessed by windows via DOS and the BIOS.  If a disk compression program or other TSR is loaded the file access must go through DOS...TSR'S (disk compression)...and BIOS in order to be access. (i.e. NEVER USE A TEMPORARY SWAP FILE...NEVER)  more on permenent swap files...  i'm sure everyone who has an uncompressed part of their compressed hard disk has seen the message \\\"you have selected a swap file greater than the suggested size...windows will only use the size suggested...do you wan't to create this swap file anyway\\\" or something like that.  well, a friend of mine (ROBERT) called microsoft and asked them what and why. what they said is that windows checks the amount of free disk space and divides that number by 2.  Then it checks for the largest contiguous block of free disk space.  Windows then suggests the smaller of the two numbers.  They also said that under absolutely no circumstances...NONE!...will windows uses a swap file larger than the suggested size.  Well...that's what he  said!  I call bull@#$#.  If this is true why does windows report the memory is available to me if it's not going to use it?  any takers?  James\",\" Huh?

Is it distressing Brendan?  The point is that any eugenic solution to the Jewish Problem as Elias has proposed smacks of pure Nazism.

In any case, that has nothing to do with the current case.

By that I refer to things such as: address and phone number, vehicle registration and license information, photographs, etc.   You should ask the ADL, if you want an authoritative answer.  My guess is that they collected information on anyone who did or might engage in political criticism of Israel.  I further believe that they did this as agents of the Israeli government, or at least in agreement with them. At least some of the information collected by the ADL was passed on to Israeli officials.  In some cases it was used to influence, or attempt to influence, people's access to jobs or public forums.

A few points need to be clarified:  The Equipment GROUNDING conductor, Green, green with a yellow stripe, bare, or the metal sheath or pipe of SOME wiring methods, is used as a safety ground, to carry fault currents back to the circuit breaker panel, and to limit the voltage on the metal case of utilization equipment or other metal objects.  It should never (except for a few exceptions to be discussed later) carry the normal operating current of a connected load.  Some equipment has filters in the power supply which may cause some slight current flow through the grounding conductor.    Much communications or audio equipment is sensitive to noise or slight voltages on the grounding conductor, and may require special wiring of the grounding conductors to provide reliable operation  (\\\"orange\\\" outlets are often used for this, with insulated grounding conductors wired back to the panel box, and in many cases back to the service.  Anyone installing such a system should read both the section on grounding in the National Electric Code and publications on installing quiet isolated ground systems.  The code requires the insulated grounding conductors (green wires) to run with the current carrying conductors back to the panel box, and, if required, back all the way to the service entrance , where it is bonded to the service ground (water pipe or rod)  Many of these systems are installed illegally or unsafely, where they do not provide a safe ground or a quiet ground or either.   The GROUNDED conductor of a circuit, often called the NEUTRAL, which is referred to in the code as the \\\"identified\\\" conductor and is supposed to be white or natural grey.  This conductor is supposed to be connected to ground in most electrical systems at a single point, generally at the service entrance panel.  This connection is through the Main Bonding Jumper.  (In many household service panels, the main bonding jumper is actually a bonding screw which attaches the neutral busbar to the case of the panel)    The Grounded conductor (neutral) is generally a current carrying conductor.  In the case of a 120 volt circuit it is one of the two conductors completing the circuit from the panel to the load device.    Since the grounded conductor (neutral) is only connected to the grounding conductor (bare or green) at the service entrance, if the load is any distance from the service and draws any significant current, there will be a small but measurable voltage between the grounded and grounding conductors at the load, under normal operating conditions.  If you should (incorrectly) connect the grounded (neutral) conductor to the grounding conductor at the load, some of the neutral current will flow instead through the grounding conductor.  Since there will now be current flowing through the grounding conductor, it will also no longer be quite at ground potential at the load end.  If the load equipment has a metal case, which is connected to the grounding conductor through the \\\"U\\\" ground plug, the metal case is now also no longer quite at ground potential.  The difference (under normal, non short-circuit conditions) may be only a few tenths of a volt, but it could also be a volt or two.  This normally does not present a shock hazard.    HOWEVER, if you let the metal case of the grounded equipment come into contact with an independently grounded object such as a water or gas pipe, a radiator, a metal air conditioning duct or such, part of the neutral current will try to flow through this aalternate ground path.  If the contact is not solid, you will get a significant arc (a low voltage, but possibly moderate current arc) Under the wrong conditions, this arcing could start a fire.  It is possible in some cases that the sneak ground current   could also flow through a wire of inadequate size, causing it to overheat.  With the incorrect non single-point grounding of the neutral, if there is a short circuit from hot to neutral, the high short circuit current which may flow will cause a much higher voltage on the grounding conductor, which increases the possibility for shock or fire.    Also if you incorrectly multiply connect the neutral and ground, the voltage on the ground system is seen as noise bu computer or audio equipment, often causing malfunction.  I have spent some hours tracking down such shorts in technical facilities where they were inducing severe hum into equipment.  The Neutral is usually bonded to the ground at the distribution transformer as well as at the service entrance of each dwelling.  This is done primarily for lightning protection, so that induced lightning currents have a short path back to ground, and also to assure that the currents drawn by shorts to grounded objects like pipes draw enough current to trip circuit breakers or blow fuses quickly.  The bad side of this is that not all the neutral current from the dwelling goes through the neutral wire back to the transformer.  Some of it flows through the grounding electrode (water pipe, etc.) this may cause corrosion in the pipes and possibly in things like underground fuel oil tanks, and it may also cause measurable AC magnetic fields due to the large loop between the \\\"hot\\\" conductors in the service and the neutral current in the water pipe and ground.  There are those who feel these fields may be unhealthy.  (don't flame ME on this, I'm just telling you where the field comes from, not it's health effect, as far as I'm concerned, the jury is still out on this.)  Note that the bonding jumper is only installed at the main panel, NOT at any sub distribution panels.  This is one reason why it is illegal to run service entrance cable with the sheath used as a neutral to a sub panel, you must have a seperate insulated conductor for the neutral.  The sheath can be used in this application only as the groundING conductor.  If the neutral is bonded to the grounding conductor in the sub panel, say by forgetting to remove the bonding screw, all the grounding conductors of the loads on that panel will be above ground, with the possible problems listed above.  The code makes exceptions for ranges and dryers, as well as feeds from one building to another.  In the cases of the range and dryer, the neutral may be used as the equipment ground under certain conditions, instead of a seperate wire.  Every time the code is revised, these exceptions come up for review.  These exceptions were, in fact the first required safety grounds, in the days before U ground outlets and such.  The appliance manufacturers don't want to have to redesign their ranges and driers, and the contractors don't want to have to run four wire cable (with four fairly heavy, expensive wires) in place of three wire to the appliances.  No question it would be safer with seperate neutrals to the stove, but the neutral current is low for most burner settings (since most current is in the 220 volt \\\"hots\\\" except at some low settings, the wires are large gauge, and there are few reported cases of injury or damage.  So far, the exceptions have survived. In the case of feeds between buildings, it's primarily for lightning protection.  People doing wiring should be aware what is and what isn't a legal grounding conductor.  Obviously, the bare wire in \\\"romex\\\" 'with ground' is.  Anywhere there is a green wire installed, such as in a portable cord, that is a good grounding conductor.  The sheath of BX clamped in BX connectors in metal boxes is a legal grounding conductor (in the US). (BX has an aluminum band run under the steel sheath to lower the resistance of the sheath.  You can just cut this aluminum band off at the ends, you don't have to bond it to anything, it does its job by touching every turn of the BX sheath.) Conduit or EMT (thinwall tubing) is generally a legal grounding conductor, but may require a bonding locknut where it enters a box or panel, particularly for larger pipes.    \\\"Greenfield\\\" (looks like big BX, but you pull your own wires in the empty sheath after you run it) is NOT a legal grounding conductor, as it doesn't have the aluminum band to bond it, and the spiral steel has too much resistance and inductance.  You have to run a seperate green grounding conductor inside the greenfield.  \\\"Wiremold\\\" is also not a legal grounding conductor, as the paint on the boxes often prevents good contact, and the \\\"feed\\\" to the wiremold extension is often from a box in the wall that may not be well connected to the first wiremold box.  I have personally discovered cases where the entire run of wiremold and the cases of everything plugged into all the outlets on the run were \\\"hot\\\" with 120 volts (Why do I get a shock every time I touch my computer and the radiator here in the office?) because there was no ground wire in the wiremold and one of the outlets had shorted to the edge of the wiremold box.  You must run a ground wire back in the wiremold from the outlets at least to the first box in the original wiring (conduit, BX, etc.) where you can \\\"bond\\\" the wire to the box with a screw, bnding clip, or whatever.  On another issue, while you should ground the green wire/lug on GCFI outlets when ever there is a place to ground them, it is legal in the NEC to use them without a ground if no ground is available.  It is better to have the protection of the Ground fault interrupter than no protection if you don't install it.  The interrupter doesn't depend on the ground to trip.  It is desirable to connect the ground if available, because if the ground is connected, the interrupter will trip as soon as a faulty device is plugged in, whereas without the ground, it will not trip until someone or something provides a ground path.  For those questioning the legal use of ungrounded GCFI's, read in the NEC, 210-7 (d) exception. (This is the 1990 code, my '93 code is in the city, but I know the rule hasn't changed.  It might be renumbered though.)   We have only touched the surface concerning grounding ;-} , there is much more to this subject, but most of you have fallen asleep by now.

Yep, that Kevin Mitchell.  I never would have expected him in the #1 spot.  It's no accident that the first two names are 1988 only.  As with first and second base, 1988 was the year of the glove.  Average DA was 20 points higher in both leagues than any other year.  Looks good.  Too bad he's moving to short.  Highest five-year regular, though he's only had one year as good as Kevin Mitchell :->.  The other elite fielders in the league.  This is an interesting line.  His 1988 figure was slightly below average. His 1990 was pathetic, and his 1991 was the next best year by anybody.  Part of that may be his mobility.  1988 was with the Yankees.  1990 was with the Padres, who appear to have a rotten infield.  1991 was with the Twins, and judging by Leius and Gaetti, the Metrodome may be a good place to play third.  Add another to the elite fielders list.  Too fielders whose career average may overstate their value.  I don't know what happened to Caminiti -- judging by the three previous years, his low 1992 may be a fluke.  Sabo is merely average, however.  His incredible 1988 (best year ever) brings his average up a lot.  Strange last two years.  According to reputation, one of the best fielders ever at third base. But at the end, he was below average.  (Average in 1988 was .643).  Boggs has been pretty good.  I don't know what happened in 1990, but every other year he has been above average, usually by quite a bit.  Last year -- a fluke or a portent?  Why is it that the two leagues usually have defensive averages very close to one another, but very different from year to year?  Any ideas?  Brook  is declining.  Three first-time regulars, above average in 1992.  I'm not sure why Jefferies gets all the grief about his fielding.  He's never had a good year, but while at second he improved to become an average fielder, and is an average fielder at third.  Zeile, on the other hand, is a below average fielder.  Each year he's about 10 points below average.  And it's probably not just the park, since Terry Pendleton had excellent DAs in the three years before this.  Moving back to second was a good idea.  So why is Hayes supposed to be good defensively?  He's had a grand total of one year above the league DA, and was pretty bad last year.  Howard Johnson and Carney Lansford -- separated at birth.  To his credit, HoJo did have one above average year (1990).  Lansford couldn't even break the .600 mark without the help of the year of the glove.  Good hitter, but his fielding needs work.  Not a good fielder.  Both are better off at shortstop.  Two consecutive horrible years for Leo.  Camden Yards doesn't seem to have helped his fielding any.    Texas slugger debuts with not only the lowest career DA, but the lowest DA at third ever.  Congratulations, Dean. --  Dale J.

I saw it.  Lankford was hurt, although the announcer said he told Torre he  could pinch hit if they needed him to.  I wondered the same thing.  But giving Joe the benefit of the   doubt, I'd say he was thinking that Lankford is hurt enough that  he didn't trust his ability to bat effectively but he wants his  speed on the bases so pinch run him.  Alicea I was completely  confused about.  Maybe he had a good record hitting against that  particular pitcher?  I don't know.  Anybody got an idea?  Well, so far I haven't seen much to say Whiten shouldn't be playing  but it is too bad that Gilkey is the odd man out when they play   Jordan ahead of him.  That I don't quite understand.  Yup, I looked for this on the replay too.  If I'm Joe Torre, I'm  going to have a talk with Bucky after the game on that one.  He's  got Lankford at third with Todd Zeile I believe - a hot hitter -   coming up - there's no reason to risk giving Lankford the go sign   in that situation unless he was sure the ball is going to the stands.    It's his job to watch the play develop - he should have known Larkin   was there to back up a bad throw.  That seemed inexcusable in my book.    BTW, I saw Dent do the same thing last year with Zeile rounding third   and going into a sure out at home in a critical situation.  On the   replay, there's Dent waving him around.  It looks like this might be a   serious problem.  The Card's weren't good base runners at all last year   and I wonder how much of the fault lies in the base coaching.

I'm sorry if anyone thinks that I am wasting space, but I thought you might want some relief from the \\\"So-and-so is a thief\\\" posts.  Not that I think we shouldn't hear about the bad deals, but it would be nice to hear some good news once in a while.  After seeing his post on one of the for sale groups, I mailed Mr. Mark Miller a request for his copy of WordPerfect 5.1 for DOS.  He suggested a price of $50 in his ad, but when I phoned him, he quoted $40 plus shipping.  That sounded more than fair to me, so I told him that I would send him a check the next day.  Imagine my surprise when I logged into my account the following day and found a message from him saying that it had already been sold (after I had just mailed the money order).  After another E-Mail message to him, he apologized and assured me that it was a mistake - I was the one who he was holding it for.  He sent the package as soon as he got the money, along with a letter stating a transfer of license.  This wasn't good enough for WordPerfect, so I asked him to fill out one of their forms.  No problem - we thought.  It took three times to get it to the right address (my fault).  Anyway, he mailed me the form for my signature and included a Workbook that I had no idea was included in the deal.  Again, he apologized for not sending it before.  I now have the world's best word processor and a renewed hope in the world that there are a few good ones left.  I recoend that if you ever see that Mark is selling anything thatat you may want, give him a call.  If I had the choice, I would purchase all of my software from him.

This feature adjusts the endpoints of lines so that the displayed line looks better on low resolution devices.  The PostScript literature explains the process to some extent.  They also give an example of how to \\\"emulate\\\" strokeadjust in PostScript environments where it is absent.  The suggested emulation is to modify the coordinates of the endpoints of a line using the following formula for each coordinate:   new_coord = (round (old_coord - 0.25)) + 0.25   Doing this we end up with all coordinates ending in \\\".25\\\".  From reading I thought that what they might actually do is:   new_coord = ((trunc (old_coord * 2)) / 2) + 0.25   This results in all the coordinates ending in either \\\"0.25\\\" or \\\"0.75\\\"  whichever is closer.  By doing some actual comparisons with Display PostScript, I find that neither of these is what DPS really uses.

So why is Cylink the only (and expensive) game in town?  Note: I think Cylink is great, and if my boss would double my salary, I'd buy  a bunch of their stuff :).  One thing that Clipper offers is interoperability, at a higher degree of  security than we currently have in non-proprietary voice encryption systems. This means it will be cheaper than anyone's proprietary scheme, and easier to  deploy.  This is, of course, either a bug or a feature depending on how you  look at it :).   Great!  Where can I buy it?  Another note: If \\\"Clipper\\\" increases the incentive to bring stronger  encryption to the mass market, all the better.  It's far overpriced at  the moment.   I don't care where we *need* to get it from, I care where we *can* get it  from, and whether it will interoperate with everyone else.    You can build them right now as long as you don't want to export (a  restriction I firmly oppose).  The only thing stopping people from making  cheap encryption is greed: they want a lock on the market.   Oh, come on.  Only if you trust it farther than it deserves.  A Clipper phone  *IS NOT* a substitute for a Cylink phone, or a STU-III.  It's a substitute  for the \\\"voice scramblers\\\" advertised in the back of Radio Electronics.   I disagree.

We were   having intermittent problems with our mail at the time. Please excuse me   if you have seen this before...  Should Christians fight?  Last week Alastair posted some questions about fighting, and whether there   are such things as \\\"justifiable wars\\\". I have started looking into these   things and have jotted down my findings as I go. I haven't answered all   his questions yet, and I know what I have here is on a slightly different   tack, but possibly I'll be able to get into it more deeply later, and post   some more info soon.  Our duty to our neighbour:  Do good to all men (Gal 6:10) Love our neighbour as ourselves (Matt 22:39)  Act the part of the good Samaritan (Luke 10) toward any who may be in   trouble. We will therefore render every possible assistance to an injured   man, and therefore should not be part of any organisation which causes   people harm (even medical corps of the army etc).  Christians are by faith \\\"citizens of the commonwealth of Israel\\\"   (Ephesians 2:11-12), and also recognise that \\\"God rules in the kingdoms of   men\\\", and therefore we should not be taking part in any of the struggles   of those nations which we are not part of due to our faith.  We are to be \\\"strangers and pilgrims\\\" amongst the nations, so we are just   passing through, and not part of any nation or any national aspirations   (this can also be applied to politics etc, but that's another story). We   are not supposed to \\\"strive\\\" or \\\"resist evil\\\" (even \\\"suffer yourselves to   be defrauded\\\") it is therefore incosistent for us to strive to assist in   preserving a state which Christ will destroy when he returns to set up   God's kingdom.  Our duty to the state.  \\\"Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar's and unto God   the things which be God's\\\" (Luke 20:25). \\\"Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power   but of God; the powers that be are ordained of God. Whosoever resisteth   the power, resisteth the ordinance of God\\\" (Rom 13:1-2). \\\"Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake; whether   it be to king as supreme... for so is the will of God that with well doing   ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men\\\" (1 Pet 2:13-15)  These scriptures make it clear that submission to the powers that be is a   divine command, but it is equally clear from Acts 5:19-29 that when any   ordinance of man runs counter to God's law, we must refuse submission to   it. The reason for this is that we are God's \\\"bond servants\\\" and His   service is our life's task. An example of the type of thing is in Col   3:22-23 where bondservants were to \\\"work heartily as unto the Lord\\\" - so   also we should work as if our boss was God - i.e. \\\"Pressed down, shaken   together, and running over\\\"... oops - a bit of a side track there...  In the contests between the nations, we are on God's side - a side that is   not fighting in the battle, but is \\\"testifying\\\" to the truth.  When we believe in God and embrace His promises, we become \\\"fellow   citizens with the Saints and of the Household of God\\\", and are no longer   interested in associations of the world. Think of this in relation to   unions etc as well. Paul tells us to \\\"lay aside every weight\\\" that we may   run \\\"the race that is set before us\\\", and if we are wise, we will discard   any association which would retard our progress - \\\"Thou therefore endure   hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. No man that warreth entangleth   himself with the affairs of this life, that he may please him who hath   chosen him to be a soldier\\\" (2 Tim 2:3-4).  One of these entanglements he warns about is \\\"be ye not unequally yoked   together with unbelievers\\\". One of the obvious applications of this is   marriage with unbelievers, but it also covers things like business   partnerships and any other position where we may form a close association   with any person or persons not believing the truth about God (in this case   the army). The principle comes from Deut 22:10 - remember that as well as   them being different animals of different strengths, one was clean and one   unclean under the law. These ideas are strongly stressed in 2 Cor 6:13-18   - I suggest you read this. The yoking also has another aspect - that of   servitude, and Jesus says \\\"take my yoke upon you\\\", so we are then yoked   with Christ and cannot be yoked with unbelievers. We have already seen   that we are bondservants of Christ, and Paul says \\\"become not ye the   bondservants of men (1 Cor 7:23 RV).  An example from the Old Testament: the question is asked in 2 Chr 19:2   \\\"Shouldest thou help the ungodly...?\\\". The situation here is a good   example of what happens when you are yoked together with unbelievers.   Jehoshaphat was lucky to escape with his life. Here are the facts: 1. He had made an affinity with Ahab, who had \\\"sold himself to work   wickedness before the Lord\\\" (1 Kings 21:25). 2. When asked by Ahab to form a military alliance, he had agreed and said   \\\"I am as thou art, my people as thy people\\\" (1 Kings 22:4) - an unequal   yoking. 3. He sttod firm in refusing the advice of the false prophets and insisted   on hearing the prophet of the Lord (trying to do the right thing), he   found that he was yoked and therefore couldn't break away from the evil   association he had made.  God says to us \\\"Come out from among them and be ye separate, and touch not   the unclean thing, and I will receive you and ye shall be my sons and   daughters\\\" (2 Cor 6:17).  This is more or less what I have found out so far - I'm still looking into   it, as I don't think I've answered all the questions raised by Alastair   yet. Heres a summary and a few things to think about:  The Christian in under command. Obedience to this command is an essential   factor in his relationship with Christ (John 15:10,14).  Total dedication to this course of action is required (Romans 12:1-2).  Disobedience compromises the close relationship between Christ and his   followers (1 Pet 2:7-8).  We are to be separated to God (Rom 6:4). This involves a master-servant   relationship (Rom 6:12,16).  No man can serve two masters (Matt 6:24,13,14).  All that is in the 'Kosmos' is lust and pride - quite opposed to Gos (1   John 2:16). Christs kingdom is not of this world (i.e. not worldly in   nature) - if it was, his servants would fight to deliver him. If Christ is   our master and he was not delivered by his servants because his kingdom   was not of this world, then his servants cannot possibly fight for another   master.  Strangers and pilgrims have no rights, and we cannot swear allegiance to   anyone but God.  The servant of the Lord must not war but be gentle to all (2 Tim 2:24) -   this does not just apply to war, but also to avoiding strife throughout   our lives. There is a war to be waged, not with man's weapons (2 Cor   10:3-4), but with God's armour (Eph6:13-20).  I'll probably post some more when I've had time to look into things a bit   further. \",\"I have an external hard drive I wish to use as startup disk. problem is, when I switch on the mac, it boots on the internal HD, but when I restart  (warm boot) the mac, it boots from the external. how do I make  it boot directly from the external ?  please email replies if possible.  thanks in advance.\",\"  RIX's files with the extension  .sci and .scf are just a RAW file with a 256 color palette.

The greatest danger of the escrow database, if it were kept on disk, would be the chance that a complete copy could somehow leak out.  You can design lots of protection, but with enough corruption a complete copy is always possible.   Storing it on paper or something very hard to copy at once may actually make sense.  Or a medium that can't be copied -- for example, something with very slow access times or which leaves a destructive trail if it is even read.  Of course then it's hard to backup.  However, I think the consequences of no backup -- the data is not there when a warrant comes -- are worse than the consequences of a secret backup.  An audit trail that reveals when data has been access, that *can't* be erased by the humans involved, is also necessary.\",\"Just my luck.

In 1974, Turkey had a democratic goverment and free press at that time.  Forget about internal news agencies, I haven't heard anything from any international source about any concentration camps with Greek Cypriot prisoners in Turkey. However, I heard Adana POW camp.  It was not secret and well  recognized POW camp.    I see,  They vanished in Turkish labor camps.  Turks have decided to acknowledge their existence first but later changed their minds releasing them.  Is that it?  What do you think happened to them?  I thought that MIA's are only the subject  of Rambo and Chuck Noris movies.  Seems that I am wrong.   You don't need to belive me.  Turkiye was never a clandestine state in its history,  It has been a respected and continuous member of UN  since the inception of UN.  No body ever questioned the UN membership of Turkey because of what had happened in 1974a and after.  Only a short  lived arms embargo was imposed unilaterally by USA to satisfy the  internal Greek loby.  I know what you would say next.  Let me answer it before wasting anytime.  Yes!  UN had a few condemning resolutions  against Turkey because of handling the Cyprus problem, especially after the 1980 coup.  Well, US and Israel had a few too.  What can I say? I am sure during Athens Junta duruing 1960-74, Greeks had their own share too.   Have you looked at the latest UN agenda for Cyprus talks mediated by Gali?  There was no issue whatsoever about any missing people among the negotiating parties.  was there? I heard many times from Denktas interviews by Turkish and International press.  He keeps saying that \\\"This was no longer an issue for peace talks.\\\"  Also, you don't want me fish for the Greek Cypriot politician's words (that Argic had posted zillion times) describing missing peoples as  a Greek-Cypriot myth.  Seems that there is a different opinions  among Greek-Cypriots as well about missing people in Turkish  custody.  [..]   I am not claiming anything.  I just told you what was given to Greek Cypriots as an answer by Turkish Goverment/Turkish Cypriots when they wanted to locate some of their own between July 15 and the final cease-fire in late August, 1974.  This answer seems to satisfy the international  community, the UN, and the Vasilu Goverment (since he did not make it an issue for the peace talks).  Also, I am not aware of any UN condemnation against Turkey about any missing Greek-Cypriot.  Are you?    BTW, do you mean that Nicos Sampson had a bloodless coup d'eta and nobody got hurt in those events?     Like I said before.  There is even a different opinion among Greek-Cypriots for this myth.

They enligthen ??? the use of S1 and S2 for keygeneration. ------------------------------------------- Date: Mon, 19 Apr 93 08:51:57 EDT From: denning@cs.cosc.georgetown.edu (Dorothy Denning) Subject: Re:  Clipper Chip  I just had another conversation with NSA to clarify some of the features of Clipper.  Please feel free to distribute this and my other messages on Clipper.  The name of the encryption algorithm is \\\"Skipjack.\\\"  Martin Hellman had written                  and the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part                 message which will then be encrypted under the system key SK                 producing                       E{ E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number;  SK}  To which I responded:          My understanding is that E[M; K] is not encrypted under SK (called the         \\\"family key\\\") and that the decrypt key corresponding to SK is held by         law enforcement.  Does anyone have first hand knowledge on this?  I was correct in that E[M; K] is not encrypted under SK.  However, Skipjack being a single-key system, there is, of course, not a separate decrypt key for the family key SK.          The unit key, also called the \\\"chip key,\\\" is generated from the         serial number N as follows.  Let N1, N2, and N3 be 64 bit blocks         derived from N, and let S1 and S2 be two 80-bit seeds used as keys.         Compute the 64-bit block                  R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1]          (Note that this is like using the DES in triple encryption mode with         two keys.)  Similarly compute blocks R2 and R3 starting with N2 and N3.         (I'm unlear about whether the keys S1 and S2 change.  The fact that         they're called seeds suggests they might.)  Then R1, R2, and R3 are         concatenated together giving 192 bits.  The first 80 bits  form K1 and         the next 80 bits form K2.  The remaining bits are discarded.  The seeds S1 and S2 do not change.   The whole process is performed on a laptop computer, and S1 and S2 are supplied by two independent people so that no one person knows both.  The same S1 and S2 are used during an entire \\\"programming session\\\" to generate keys for a stream of serial numbers.  Everything is discarded at the end (the computer could be thrown out if desired).  The serial number is 30 bits and the values N1, N2, and N3 are formed by padding the serial number with fixed 34-bit blocks (separate padding for each value).  The resulting keys K1 and K2 are output onto separate floppy disks, paired up with their serial number.  Each pair is stored in a separate file.  The floppy disks are taken away by two separate people on behalf of the two escrow agencies.

So don't swamp my mailbox :-)  I just think this is an valuable addition to the less than technical discussion that is rising here.

EDT                  Q   Why was the 10:00 a.m. postponed?                  MS. MYERS:  Just due to scheduling conflicts.  So as we  put out, the President will meet with the leaders of the national  police organizations at 2:00 p.m. in the Rose Garden, as opposed to  10:00 a.m.  The only other things on his schedule today are:  At  11:00 a.m. he'll meet with General Vessey, who, as you know, is on  his way to Vietnam to continue working on the MIA-POW issue.  At  12:30 p.m. he'll have lunch with the Vice President in the Oval  Office.  And at 2:00 p.m. he'll meet with the police organizations. Then from 3:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. he'll do his weekly photos with the  various groups.              Q   A photo op with Vessey?              MS. MYERS:  There's no coverage on the Vessey meeting.              Q   Why?              MS. MYERS:  Why?  It's a closed meeting.                Q   What about the lunch?              MS. MYERS:  The lunch?  No, there's no coverage.              Q   Is he meeting with any congress people today?              MS. MYERS:  Nothing scheduled.              Q   There are no meetings --              MS. MYERS:  There are no congressional meetings today,  no.              Q   Has the President been given any information by the  Pentagon or reached any conclusion about the validity of this report  from Hanoi?  Any instructions to Vessey on how to deal with the  Vietnamese on that subject?              MS. MYERS:  Well, clearly, the report is the first order  of business.  It's high on the agenda on something that they'll  discuss.  I think the President and General Vessey will discuss the  parameters of his visit to Vietnam today, but the President hasn't  drawn any conclusions about the report yet.  Certainly, it's  something that he wants General Vessey to talk with the Vietnamese  about first.              Q   Did the President talk with any Republican senators  yesterday about the stimulus package?              MS. MYERS:  He spoke with Senator Dole.              Q   How many times?              MS. MYERS:  I believe once during the day and once last  night.              Q   What was the outcome of that?              MS. MYERS:  They're continuing to work toward some kind  of an agreement on a jobs package.              Q   Is it your impression that Senator Dole is in any  way flexible on this?              MS. MYERS:  Well, I think we're hopeful that we're going  to get some kind of jobs package through the Senate, and we'll  continue to work with Senator Dole and others until we reach some  kind of an agreement.              Q   Did they discuss the VAT tax?              MS. MYERS:  I don't know if that came up.              Q   Can you check that?              MS. MYERS:  Sure.        Q   So what are they -- is the President offering to  scale down his program -- is that what he's trying to do, buy it down  to where Dole will sign on?              MS. MYERS:  Well, he's trying to protect as much of it  as he can.  But it's important to him to get some kind of a jobs  package through the Senate and through Congress now.  And as soon as  we reach some conclusions on that, we'll let you know.  But at the  moment, he's continuing to consult with members of Congress  including, obviously, Senator Dole.              Q   Is he talking to anybody else?              MS. MYERS:  I don't believe he talked to any other  Republicans yesterday.              Q   Is he talking to anybody today?              MS. MYERS:  I don't think anything is scheduled, but I  wouldn't rule it out.              Q   We were led to believe that the President called  Mr. Dole on the subject of Russian aid and that Bob Dole brought the  conversation around to stimulus package.  Is that correct?              MS. MYERS:  I think the President has contacted several  people on Russian aid.  I think that it was always expected that the  stimulus package or the jobs package will be part of any conversation  he would have with Senator Dole.  The primary objective of the  conversation was Russian aid.  That was the first order of business,  but it was both.              Q   In the President's mind, are they linked  politically in that if the Republicans continue to reject the  stimulus package, he thinks it will be harder to sell Russian aid to  the American people?  Has he made that argument?              MS. MYERS:  I can't talk about specifically what  arguments he might have made.  The President is obviously committed  to both.  He liked to see a jobs package to the American people  first.  But as you know, we outlined the details of additional  Russian aid last night in Tokyo.              Q   But does the President believe that the stimulus  package will make it more difficult to persuade Americans to vote for  Russian -- to accept a vote for Russian aid?              MS. MYERS:  I think that the President is going to  continue to work to pass the stimulus package, to pass a jobs  package, and we're still hopeful that we'll get some kind of jobs  package through the Congress.              Q   Is it fair to say that the President is negotiating  now with Dole?              MS. MYERS:  He's discussing options with him.              Q   On the stimulus, is it your understanding that over  the break some Democrats, themselves, have left the support that they  had earlier for the package, the stimulus package?              MS. MYERS:  I think we still have wide support in the  Senate for the jobs package.              Q   But specifically, that you've lost Democrats other  than Shelby?              MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so.  There hasn't been a  vote.              Q   What about Kohl?              Q   Kohl and Feingold?              MS. MYERS:  There hasn't been a vote yet.  And we'll  continue to work with senators to try to get a majority to try to  bring the package to a vote, because we believe that a majority of  the members of the United States Senate support the package.              Q   If you're weren't worried about Kohl and Feingold,  why did George mention Milwaukee projects the other day?              MS. MYERS:  I think George pointed out a number of  projects in a number of states that stand to be funded, or to lose  funding if this jobs package doesn't pass.              Q   No Democrats.  (Laughter.)              MS. MYERS:  I'll let you draw your own conclusions.              Q   Does he plan to talk to Dole again today or any  other Republicans again today?              MS. MYERS:  There's nothing specifically scheduled, but  again, I wouldn't rule it out.              Q   Does he plan to put out any more press releases to  any other states today?              MS. MYERS:  What we've done is we're in the process of  breaking down the benefits of the jobs package state by state.  I  think it's entirely feasible that as we sort of are able to sum those  up, we'll send out press releases to the various states that suggest  how their states would benefit from this package.              Q   Will you share those with us?              MS. MYERS:  Sure.  As we did yesterday.              Q   Do you have copies of the ones you sent --              MS. MYERS:  Yes, we made those available yesterday.  And  we certainly can continue to provide them today.              Q   Dee Dee, since yesterday's questions and subsequent  stories about the VAT, what further consideration of this issue has  been given?              MS. MYERS:  Nothing's changed since yesterday.  I think  the President commented on it this morning to say only that it was  something he knew was being considered by the task force and that he  has not made a decision on, and I don't think we have anything to add  to that.              Q   But he also said that business and labor groups are  telling him they support it.  Can you tell us --              MS. MYERS:  I think that there has been -- I'm not going  to speculate on who supports it.  I think the President said that  there has been some support among business and labor groups.  I don't  think he said he was directly contacted by them.              Q   Are we to take that to mean that the administration  has sounded out business and labor groups on this --              MS. MYERS:  I think there's been plenty of public  discourse on this over the years and even recently, but I don't think  I want to add to that.              Q   In February, though, the President said that this  was something to be considered 10 or 15 years down the road.  What  has happened between then and now to cause this administration to  change its mind?              MS. MYERS:  I think as we said yesterday, it is  something that the working groups are looking at.  They're  considering a wide variety of options on everything from funding to  specific options that will be covered by the President's health care  plan.  The President has not taken it up yet, has not made a decision  on it.  And beyond that, I don't have anything to add.              Q   You haven't answered the question.  It wasn't being  considered by anyone in the White House after the President's  comments in February, and George reaffirmed that in a briefing.              Q   And then suddenly --              Q   What happened?        MS. MYERS:  The working groups, as we have said  throughout, we instructed to consider a wide variety of options  across-the-board.  And one of the things that has been talked about  and that they are clearly considering is some kind of a value-added  tax.        Q   But the President himself took this off the table,  Dee Dee, and suddenly it reappears.  And this goes to the credibility  of this administration in a way.  What has happened in the meantime?        MS. MYERS:  The President has not looked at this, it  hasn't been presented to him, again, yet.  The working groups are  looking at it, as they're looking at a wide variety of options, and  no decisions have been made.        Q   And it raises the question of how independently the  task force is working.        MS. MYERS:  The task force was instructed to consider  all options, and they've taken that mandate seriously and they're  considering all options.        Q   But that's not the impression that the President  left in February.  The impression he left was that this was something  that was long-range, to be looked at 10, 15 years down the road.  The  clear implication of his remarks was that this was something that was  not on the table, not an option.         Q   \\\"If it changes I'll tell you.\\\"              Q   Bring him on.        Q   And you repeatedly referred to the President's  remarks, telling us that those were still in operation.              MS. MYERS:  It's changed, and we told you.  (Laughter.)              Q   But that's what Alice Rivlin's comments and Donna  Shalala comments were about.  I mean, that seemed like an  orchestrated effort because you have two independent Cabinet officers  --        MS. MYERS:  I wouldn't -- no, Alice Rivlin's not a  Cabinet member, first of all.  Second of all, it was not  orchestrated, but clearly, they both said yesterday and in the last  couple of days that it's something that's being looked at.  We  confirmed that yesterday.  And I don't have anything to add to that.        Q   Is it because he has very few options?        Q   Is this something that it will be incumbent upon  the task force to convince the President about?  In other words, has  the President himself personally ruled it out and it's now up to the  task force to convince him to put it back on the table?  Or is it, in  fact, back on the table, having been placed there by discussions with  the President?          MS. MYERS:  It is not the working group's mission at  this point to convince the President of anything.  It is their  mission to put before him his options and to explain the benefits and  the costs and the basic pros and cons of each of those options.  I  think that they will certainly present the VAT to him in that  context, and at this point he's not -- that presentation has not been  made, but it's something that he will hear and he has not made a  decision on.        Q   They will present it to him as one of his options,  though he specifically ruled it out?        MS. MYERS:  Correct.        Q   Dee Dee, is this more than a trial balloon?  Is  this a serious consideration that the working groups are giving to  this form of taxation?        MS. MYERS:  It's simply a statement of fact.  The  working groups are considering a wide variety of options on a number  of issues relating to health care reform.  One of the options that  they're looking at is the VAT.         Q   Dee Dee, when the working groups were examining  this possibility, was this on the table during the same time period  that you were telling us that it was not?        MS. MYERS:  I don't know what the specific timing of  their drafting of options is.  I don't know.        Q   Who was telling you that it was not under  consideration?        MS. MYERS:  I was referring back to the President's  comments.        Q   Have they discovered that the sin taxes won't raise  enough money to fund the core benefit package?        MS. MYERS:  No, there's no decisions that have been made  on how to pay for the health care plan.              Q   I'm asking whether the projections --              MS. MYERS:  There's a number of options depending on how  the plan is structured.  You can't decide how much the plan is going  to cost until you decide what the plan is going to look like.  And so  you can't discuss what financing options have been ruled in our out  until you know.        Q   Dee Dee, we've been told that they have a computer  models on a number of possible packages.        MS. MYERS:  Correct.          Q   The question is whether they have now determined  whether sin taxes would not produce enough money for even the barest  minimum package.  That is not a very difficult computation.        MS. MYERS:  It is a question that you know that we're  not going to answer until -- there's a number of options being  considered.  It depends on how the package is structured.  The exact  details of the package and the financing mechanisms used to pay for  them are all among the decisions that have yet to be made.                Q   And when the President has been meeting with health  care -- his health care advisors, which we are told he has been doing  --              MS. MYERS:  Correct.              Q      they have never once said to him, these are your  funding options, including the VAT?  He has never heard the word VAT  in his --              MS. MYERS:    I am not going to comment on the specific  nature of the daily -- they're not daily, but the quasi-regular  briefings.              Q   Well, you have.              MS. MYERS:  I have not, other than to say that he's not  considered the VAT.  And I think that is a true statement.              Q   No, but you said that it has not been presented to  him as an option.              MS. MYERS:  Correct.              Q   That doesn't mean he hasn't heard about it.              MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to get into the details of  what's discussed.  I think that statement stands for itself.              Q      specific, Dee Dee.  When you say he hasn't  looked at it, do you mean that he hasn't looked at it in terms of  paying for medical coverage, or hasn't looked at it in general?   Because back in Chilicothe he was very specific in defining how it  works, what the advantages are, the whole thing.  It sounds like --              MS. MYERS:  But that was -- I think in Chilicothe, if  you go back to his remarks there, it was a broader philosophical  discussion of the tax structure.  And I think the comments were  generally in reference to the overall economic plan.  But clearly,  it's something that he's thought about in the broad context.  I mean,  that was clear in Chilicothe.  What I'm saying is that in the process  of the working groups it's something that he hasn't considered yet.   It's something that the working groups will present to him among the  number of options, and that no decisions have been made.  And I'm not  going to comment any further on the details of the meetings where  health care issues are being discussed.              Q   It's your statement from this podium that no  discussion of this has taken place.  You say that no option -- that  the option has not been presented to him.              MS. MYERS:  That is correct.              Q   Do you stand by -- does the White House still stand  by George's statement in March that this will not be in the proposal?              MS. MYERS:  No decisions have been made.  We have  nothing to add to what's already been said.              Q   Let me follow up here.  Do you stand by what Rivlin  said yesterday, that if any kind of VAT were to be used or  considered, that other changes to the tax code would have to be made  so that it would be less regressive?              MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to comment any further on what  might happen if.              Q   But do you stand by the previous conversations in  February that if there were to be a VAT, I think the President said  you'd exclude food and energy --              MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to comment on the specific  structure of a decision that hasn't been made.              Q   Was the President aware prior to Donna Shalala's  comments yesterday that this was under consideration by the working  groups?              MS. MYERS:  I don't know specifically what --              Q   Could you check for us, because that's a real  important credibility question?              MS. MYERS:  Sure.              Q   Since the task force was brought together this  issue has been discussed, at the beginning and throughout, as one  fairly painless way to raise a lot of money.  Were you all kept in  the dark?  Was the Press Office kept in the dark over the past month  and a half when you've been denying that a VAT tax would be  considered that it was actually on the table over there as an option?              MS. MYERS:  I think we've said all that we have to say.   It is something the working groups are looking at.  The President has  not made a decision about it yet.  And beyond that, I have nothing to  add.              Q   Well, sorry, Dee Dee, there are still a couple of  questions that we are going to have to ask because we have a problem  with credibility here -- yours primarily.  What we're asking is, if  you all were not told at all that this thing was being considered  while you were coming out here and telling us that it was not, or if  it's a case that you were coming out here and deliberately misleading  us.              MS. MYERS:  I don't believe that anyone has ever come  out here and deliberately misled you from this podium -- ever --ever.              Q   Has anyone tried to shade it a little bit to  indicate something -- has anybody told anybody to come out --              MS. MYERS:  We're not trying to shade answers or  deliberately mislead anybody.  I've said what I have to say about  this issue.              Q   All we were trying to find out --              MS. MYERS:  I understand what you're trying to find out  and I've given you the answers, Helen.              Q   We're trying to find out what changed -- what made  it an option again.  That's the --              MS. MYERS:  The working groups were given a broad  mandate to investigate all options, and they are doing that.                Q   Yes, but it wasn't an option before.  How can you  investigate it if the President has taken it off the table?              MS. MYERS:  It is something that they're obviously  considering and the President has not made a decision on.              Q   Yes, but he took it off the table in February.              MS. MYERS:  Working groups are considering it.  They'll  present it to the President at some point and he'll make a decision.              Q   Why would they consider it if he has taken it off  the table?              MS. MYERS:  It's clearly on the table.               Q   Yes, but he took it off the table.  Did he change  his mind?              MS. MYERS:  It's back on the table, Bill.              Q   Did he change his mind?              MS. MYERS:  He said this morning that he hasn't made a  decision about it.  He obviously knows that it's on the table.  It's  something that he will look at at some and when we have a decision on  this we'll let you know.              Q   So he must have changed his mind, right?              MS. MYERS:  At some point it will be looked at.  I mean,  --              Q   Dee Dee, there's like two options -- either he  changed his mind or the working groups think they're authority  exceeds the President's.              MS. MYERS:  The working groups were given a broad  mandate to look at all options; they've done that.              Q   Are you going to put out his income tax?              MS. MYERS:  Yes, there will be something available on  his income tax probably later this afternoon.  His return will be  available.               Q   Will there be any kind of briefing to go through  it?              MS. MYERS:  No, nothing's planned.  I think someone will  be available, probably not in a briefing setting, but to walk you  through the questions.              Q   We're used to be walked line-by-line through the  presidential tax forms.              MS. MYERS:  I've seen those briefings.  (Laughter.)              Q   Could we have one?              MS. MYERS:   No, I don't think there will be any kind of  a formal briefing, but there will be somebody available to answer  your questions about it.              Q   Did they file a joint form?              MS. MYERS:  Yes.              Q   When did he file it?              MS. MYERS:  I believe it's being filed today.              Q   Dee Dee, is there going to be a backgrounder for  Miyazawa?              MS. MYERS:  No, there will be a readout after the  meeting.              Q   No backgrounder today?              MS. MYERS:  No backgrounder today.              Q   This is complicated stuff.  We need help.   (Laughter.)              MS. MYERS:  We can't give you taxes and Miyazawa all in  one day, it's too confusing.  (Laughter.)              Q   Vance and Owen have opened the doors on the use of  force in Bosnia.   They've both said that, A, they never ruled it  out, and B, it might be necessary now.  Does that influence your  thinking on whether or not to change your approach?              MS. MYERS:  There's been no change in our policy towards  Bosnia.  We have always said that we'd consider --              Q   But does that impact upon your decision?  Are they  people whose opinions would carry weight with you?              MS. MYERS:  They're people whose opinions carry weight  certainly.  I mean, the President supports the process that they've  initiated.  But there's been no change in our policy for Bosnia,  although we're considering a number of options right now.  If the  Serbs don't come back to the negotiating table, if they don't sign on  to some kind of an agreement, we will consider additional options,  which we've been saying regularly.              Q   One follow-up question then?  We cannot get a  straight answer from anyone in the administration.  Why do you not  set a deadline for the Serbs?  Can you tell us the strategic or  tactical reasons for not giving them a deadline to come to the table?              MS. MYERS:  We're continuing to put pressure on them  every day.              Q   Which doesn't work so --              MS. MYERS:  Well, we think it is having some effect.   We're going to continue to tighten sanctions.  As you know, we  support the omnibus resolution.  We expect that to come to a vote on  the 26th.                Q   You say it's having an effect -- can you give us  any documentation?              MS. MYERS:  I'd be happy to provide somebody to talk to  you about the impact of the sanctions and things like that.              Q   There's been no -- you have not been able to  provide anybody who can tell us that the sanctions have had any  effect in Bosnia.  Serbia, yes; in Bosnia, no.              MS. MYERS:  I think that they've had effect in Serbia  and we think they've had some effect in Bosnia.  And again, I'll be  happy to provide somebody to walk you through the details of that, if  you'd like.              Q   We would like to hear from someone who can show us  what the effect has been in Bosnia.  We had the briefing on all of  the terrible things that are happening in Belgrade, but we haven't  seen anything that indicates an impact on the fighting.  Can you  provide something along those lines?              MS. MYERS:  I will see what I can get you.              Q   On the extra Russian aid that Christopher announced  this morning -- where is that money coming from?              MS. MYERS:  We'll have to work with Congress on the  details of that package.              Q   So that would be new money that you would hope to  get?              MS. MYERS:    Yes, that's new money, in addition to the  $1.6 billion announced in Vancouver.  So I assume that you all have  seen the $1.8-billion package that was announced this morning in  Tokyo by Secretary Christopher.              Q   Isn't there a concern, though, about offering  something which you have to get in Congress?  I mean, that was the  concern with Vancouver; you didn't want to do that.              MS. MYERS:  The concern with Vancouver was to do  something immediately, which required money that was already approved  in the Fiscal '93 budget.  What we're looking at now is a little bit  longer-term plan to build on top of the $1.6 billion that we  announced in Vancouver.  This clearly will require congressional  approval, or some of it will anyway, and we're going to continue to  work with Congress to make that happen.              Q   To what extent has that been vetted or agreed to by  Congress?              MS. MYERS:  The President has had a number of  conversations with members and will continue to work with them as  this process moves forward.              Q   Was Christopher able to put this package out with a  fair degree of understanding that you will be able to get it through  Congress?              MS. MYERS:  It was created in consultation with  Congress.              Q   In meeting with the law enforcement officials, is  that -- does that have a set speech and a goal?  A direction?              MS. MYERS:  Yes, the President will talk about -- and  the law enforcement organizations are endorsing the President's jobs  package.  They believe particularly the summer jobs package will help  give kids something to do.              Q   Who are they?              MS. MYERS:  It's members or leadership from three  organizations:  NAPO, which is the National Association of Police  Organizations; IBPO, which is the International Brotherhood of Police  Organizations, I believe; and IUPA, which is the International Union  of Police Associations.              Q   Will the FBI chief be there?              MS. MYERS:  The FBI chief?  No.              Q   Or any other federal law enforcement officials?              MS. MYERS:  No, it will be the President and these  national law enforcement organization leaders.              Q   Does the $1.8 billion announced today include the  $400 million that's in the FY '94 budget for disarmament?              MS. MYERS:  No.  The Nunn-Lugar money is separate.              Q   So this would be the $700 million that's in the  budget already, plus another $1.1 billion?              MS. MYERS:  I believe all of this is on top of the $700  million already in the budget.              Q   Is this going to be part of the supplemental or  Fiscal '94 --              MS. MYERS:  We'll work with Congress on the exact  funding mechanism -- on exactly how this will be paid for.              Q   This $1.8 billion on top of --              MS. MYERS:  On top of $700 million -- on top of the $400  million Nunn-Lugar money we announced earlier.              Q   And this is what prompted the President to call Bob  Dole -- it was on this tranche, not on the previous money he was  calling Bob Dole?              MS. MYERS:  Correct.              Q   Is there a briefing on Miyazawa?              MS. MYERS:  There will be a readout after the meeting  with Miyazawa.  Tomorrow.              Q   Dee Dee, on a totally unrelated matter, some  Republicans who are active in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are  complaining about this new cozy relationship between the White House  and the Chamber of Commerce.  There are -- the town hall meeting the  other night, the satellite and all of this relationship. Does the White House feel that you're getting too close to these  Chambers of Commerce?              MS. MYERS:  That's an interesting charge.  (Laughter.)   After how many years of Democrats being accused of not paying any  attention to the Chambers, now there are those who would accuse us of  being too close.  I think that's interesting.  But no, we're thrilled  by the support we've received from the national Chamber and local  Chambers across the country and we'll continue to work with them on  this and other initiatives.              Q   What's the status of the President thinking about  going to this Democratic retreat?              MS. MYERS:  It's on his calendar.  I think he'll almost  certainly go.              Q   All three days?              MS. MYERS:  We haven't figured out exactly when he'll be  there yet.                Q   Is it open to coverage?              MS. MYERS:  No, I believe the whole thing is closed.              Q   Is he going to have any kind of address, statement,  anything at all on the gay rights march on the 25th?              MS. MYERS:  We're still looking at that.  We haven't  made a final decision about how we'll -- who will make a statement or  what --              Q   Any meetings scheduled with any of the leaders?              MS. MYERS:  Nothing is scheduled, but I wouldn't rule it  out.              Q   What about an AIDS czar?              MS. MYERS:  It's coming.              Q   Anything on the weekend?              Q   There's been a suggestion that he's going to this  retreat to avoid having to participate in the gay rights -- or appear  or have any involvement in the gay rights march.              MS. MYERS:  No, I think this is something he's been  discussing for a long time -- appearing at the Senate Democratic  retreat.              Q   The weekend?              MS. MYERS:  Weekend?  Don't know -- the only thing on  right now is the radio address on Saturday.              Q   Any travel plans?              MS. MYERS:  If it changes -- none right now.              Q   He's not going to be off campaigning for his  stimulus package?              MS. MYERS:  No specific plans right now.              Q   What about mid-week?  Anything likely?              MS. MYERS:  It's possible.  Yes, I think it's likely  that we'll travel next week -- certainly the weekend.              Q   Has he called Thurmond about his daughter?              MS. MYERS:  I don't know.  I'll check.              Q   Going to name a drug czar this weekend?              MS. MYERS:  This weekend?  I don't believe so.              Q   And the radio address on Saturday -- is that going  to be focused on the stimulus package?              MS. MYERS:  I'm sure it will.              THE PRESS:  Thank you.\",\"What is the phone number for Alias? A toll-free number is preferred, if available.  Thanks \",\" I guess the San Jose Mercury news is wrong then, and if so, why is the DA  involved?   \",\"In my postings I have made a proposal for comments and discussion. Those who don't want to discuss its merits and drawbacks are not forced to do so.  However I would make anybody who incites others to harm me or harass in a personal manner, legally responsible for their deeds. I cannot accept and will not accept threats to my personal integrity and I urge anybody who opposes terror to refrain from direct or indriect threats.  PS: My proposal has nothing to do with Nazi eugenics. It has to do with the search for peace which would enable justice. I don't consider that justice is done, when non-Jews who fled or were expelled in 1948/1967 are not permitted to return to their homeland. This can at best be called pragmatism, a nice word for legitimizing the rule of the strong. It can never be called justice. And peace without justice will never be peace. It is my conviction that the situation in which a state, through the law, attempts to discourage mixed marriages (as Israel does), is not normal. Such a state resembles more Nazi Germany and South Africa than Western democracies, such as the United States, in which Jews are free to marry whom they wish and do so in the thousands. My proposal may have drawbacks but it is meant to force anybody to anything, just to compensate for a certain time mixed couples for the hardships tehy endure in a society which disapproves of intermarriage.When the day will come and Israel will become a truly civil and decmoractic society, in which the state is not concerned with the religious or ethnic affiliation of its constituency, such a Fund would not be needed any more. I don't mind if Jews wish to marry Jews and keep their traditions, why not ? But this is not the affairs of a state. Western democracy clearly separates these domains and I am certain that most American Jews enjoy this fact and would not love to live in a state termed Christian State and to have their Green cards stamped with a mark JEW.  I would ask those who are genuinely interested in an exchange of views and personal experiencces to refrain from emotional, infantile outbursts which might leed readers to infer that Jews who respect Judaism are uncivilized. Such behaviour is not good for Judaism.\",\"  How about:   The Holocaust  The Spanish Inquisition  Jonestown  (just to name a few) ?  Authorities sometimes tell people to do evil things.

As for biggest surprise, I'd say that Buchberger had higher expectations this year due to his \\\"breakthrough\\\" year (for him) last year, so he didn't really raise his game.  My suggestion would be Shjon Podein, one of the callups from Cape Breton during the year.  He was quite far down on the depth chart in the Oilers stable of prospects, but made a big impact on the team.  He has 12 goals in his 33 games and is only -1.  Those are decent numbers for a third-line player who was seemingly doomed to minor-league oblivion.  The Oilers coaching staff likens his style to John Tonelli. I think he'll be on the full-time roster next year.  As for biggest disappointment, you could name any of the players the Oilers dumped for lousy production this year (Nicholls, Gilchrist, Tikkanen) or even Shayne Corson, but Mellanby isn't far off.  --  Andrew Scott                    | andrew@idacom.hp.com HP IDACOM Telecom Division      | (403) 462-0666 ext. 253\",\"       Yeah, right.

Because his messengership is universal, he has been distinguished by  miracles that relate to almost all species of creation.     Just as the supreme aide of a renowned ruler, arriving with many gifts in a city where various people live, will be welcomed by a representative of each people who acclaims him and bids him welcome in his own language so, too, when the supreme messenger of the Monarch of Pre- and  Post-Eternity  (Ezel and Ebed  Sultani) honored the universe by coming as an envoy to the inhabitants of the earth, and brought with him the light of truth and spiritual gifts sent by the Creator of the universe and derived from the realities of the whole universe, each species of creation -from water, rocks, trees, animals and human beings to the moon, sun and stars- welcomed him and acclaimed his prophethood, each in its own language, and each bearing one of his miracles.     Now it would require a voluminous work to mention all his miracles.  As the punctilious scholars have written many volumes concerning the proofs of His prophethood, here we will briefly point out only the general category into which fall fhe miracles that are definite and accepted as accurate reports.     The evidences of the prophethood of Muhammad (SAW) fall into two main categories:        The first is called irhasat and includes the paranormal  events that happened at the time of his birth, or before his  declaration of prophethood.        The second group pertains to all the remaining evidences  of the prophethood, and contains two subdivisions:       1) Those wonders that were manifested after his departure from this world in order to confirm his prophethood, and   2) Those that he exhibited during the era of his prophethood.  The latter has also two parts:    2.1) The evidences of his prophethood that became manifest in his own personality, his inner and outer being, his moral conduct and perfection, and      2.2) The miracles that: related to substantial matters.   The last part again has two branches:    2.2.1) Those concerning the Qur'an and spirituality, and   2.2.2) Those relating to matter and creation.  This last  branch is again divided into two categories:    2.2.2.1) The first involves the paranormal happenings  that occured during his mission either to break the  stubbornness of the unbelievers, or to augment the faith of the belivers.  This category has twenty different sorts, such as the splitting of the moon, the flowing of water from the fingers, the satisfying of large numbers with a little food, and the speaking of trees, rocks and animals Each of these sons has also many instances, and thus has, in meaning, the strength of confirmation by consensus.    2.2.2.2)  As for the second category, this includes events lying in the future that occured as he had predicted upon Allah (SWT)'s instructions.  Now starting from the last category, we will summarize a list of them.(1)  (1) Unfonunately, I could not write as I had intended without choice, I wrote as my head dictated, and I could not completely conform to the order of this classification. \",\"Quoting pmetzger@snark.shearson.com (Perry E.

Speaking as an atheist (heterosexual, for what it's worth), this is one of the least attractive parts of some varieties of Christianity.  Although I'm sure it's possible to argue theologically that we shouldn't make analogies between discrimination on the basis of sex and race and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, morally the case looks unanswerable (for those outside religion): the three forms _are_ analogous; we shouldn't discriminate on the basis of sex, race or sexual orientation.  I found the moderator's FAQs on the subject instructive, and recommend everyone to read them.  There seem to be three different levels of acceptance:  1) Regard homosexual orientation as a sin (or evil, whatever) 2) Regard homosexual behaviour as a sin, but accept orientation (though presumably orientation is unfortunate) and dislike people who indulge 3) As 2, but \\\"love the sinner\\\" 4) Accept homosexuality altogether.  My experience is that 3 is the most common attitude (I imagine 1 and 2 are limited to a few fundamentalist sects).  I suppose I can go along with 3, except that I have this feeling that a 14--15 year old living in a community with this attitude, on discovering that they were more attracted to members of the same sex, would not feel the love of the community, but would rather feel the pressure not to exhibit their feelings.

In this case I'd say the relevant statistic would be the number of combatants (total troops) compared to total casualties from among the total civilian population in the affected geographical area.   Vietnam and Korea might make good comparisons.   Western news in general, but in particular the American \\\"mass media\\\": CBS, NBC, ABC, etc.  The general tone of the news during the whole war was one of \\\"those poor, poor Iraqis\\\" along with \\\"look how precisely this cruise missile blew this building to bits\\\".   I agree.   Perhaps so.  And maybe the atomic bomb was a mistake too.  But that's easy to say from our \\\"enlightened\\\" viewpoint here in the 90's, right?  Back then, it was *all-out* war, and Germany and Japan had to be squashed. After all, a million or more British had already died, hundreds of  thousands of French, a couple hundread thousand or so Americans, and  millions of Russians, not to mention a few million Jews, Poles, and  other people of slavic descent in German concentration camps.  All  things considered, the fire-bombings and the atomic bomb were essential (and therefore justified) in bringing the war to a quick end to avoid even greater allied losses.  I, for one, don't regret it.   Sure.  And it's the people who suffer because of them.  All the more reason to depose these \\\"entrenched political rulers operating in their own selfish interests\\\"!  Or do you mean that this applies to the allies as well??   I make no claim or effort to justify the misguided foreign policy of the West before the war.  It is evident that the West, especially America, misjudged Hussein drastically.  But once Hussein invaded Kuwait and  threatened to militarily corner a significant portion of the world's oil supply, he had to be stopped.  Sure the war could have been prevented by judicious and concerted effort on the part of the West before Hussein invaded Kuwait, but it is still *Hussein* who is responsible for his decision to invade.  And once he did so, a strong response from the West was required.   Well, it's not very \\\"loving\\\" to allow a Hussein or a Hitler to gobble up nearby countries and keep them.  Or to allow them to continue with mass slaughter of certain peoples under their dominion.  So, I'd have to say yes, stopping Hussein was the most \\\"loving\\\" thing to do for the most people involved once he set his mind on military conquest.  I mentioned it.  If we hadn't intervened, allowing Hussein to keep Kuwait, then it would have been appeasement.  It is precisely the lessons the world learned in WW2 that motivated the Western alliance to war.  Letting Hitler take Austria and Czechoslavkia did not stop WW2 from happening, and letting Hussein keep Kuwait would not have stopped an eventual Gulf War to protect Saudi Arabia.   Sure.  What was truly unfortunate was that they followed Hitler in his grandiose quest for a \\\"Thousand Year Reich\\\".  The consequences stemmed from that.  What should I say about them?  Anything in particular?    So?  It was the *policemen* on trial not Rodney King!!  And under American law they deserved a jury of *their* peers!  If there had been black officers involved, I'm sure their would have been black jurors too. This point (of allegedly racial motivations) is really shallow.   So?  It's \\\"hard to imagine\\\"?  So when has Argument from Incredulity gained acceptance from the revered author of \\\"Constructing a Logical Argument\\\"?  Can we expect another revision soon??  :)  (Just kidding.)   I have to admit that I wonder this too.  But *neither* the prosecution nor the defense is talking.  So one cannot conclude either way due to the silence of the principals.     OK.  It certainly seemed to me that there was excessive force involved. And frankly, the original \\\"not guilty\\\" verdict baffled me too.  But then I learned that the prosecution in the first case did not try to convict on a charge of excessive force or simple assault which they probably would have won, they tried to get a conviction on a charge of aggravated assault with intent to inflict serious bodily harm.  A charge, which news commentators said, was akin to attempted murder under California law.  Based on what the prosecution was asking for, it's evident that  the first jury decided that the officers were \\\"not guilty\\\".  Note,  not \\\"not guilty\\\" of doing wrong, but \\\"not guilty\\\" of aggravated assault  with the *intent* of inflicting serious bodily harm.  The seeds of the  prosecutions defeat were in their own overconfidence in obtaining a  verdict such that they went for the most extreme charge they could.  If the facts as the news commentators presented them are true, then I feel the \\\"not guilty\\\" verdict was a reasonable one.   Thanks mathew, I like the quote.  Pretty funny actually.

The point that Darren raises is a very Lutheran viewpoint.   While reason is a gift from God, it is also infected by sin. Yet we do not reject reason entirely--and neither, I think,  does Darren.  We need reason, as Darren himself has pointed out, to comprehend God's revelation of himself in the Bible. But reason alone is not sufficient to comprehend and believe the Word.  We need, first and foremost, faith.  For \\\"the sinful mind is hostile to God.  It does not submit to God's law, *nor can it do so*\\\"  (Romans 8:7).  Luther accepted Scripture as the sole means of revelation (\\\"Sola Scriptura\\\"), but accepted the necessity of the use of reason (with faith) in comprehending that revelation. Yet Luther also said, regarding baptism, \\\"But mad reason rushes forth, and, because Baptism is not dazzling like the works which we do, regards it as worthless.\\\" (Large Catechism, Fourth part, Baptism).  To make matters more complicated, Luther was the sort of theologian that many  people would describe as an `absolutist'.  I've seen him  described as a `take no prisoners' theologian.  We might conclude, given these observations, that Luther was inconsistent or mad.  And surely at least some have come to that conclusion.  But it might be useful to recall that Jesus was also called mad.  And Peter felt compelled to defend himself and the apostles against a charge of drunkenness on Pentecost.  So we as Christians ought to be careful about rejecting Luther (or others)  as mad.  Rather, we should imitate the Bereans, who examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true (Acts 17:11).  The basis for the confidence with which Luther, Peter, Paul, and many others preached the gospel was not just reason, but faith and the Holy Spirit.  This is not faith divorced from reason, but a faith that guides, informs, and uses reason.  The Spirit enables us to know the truth and to proclaim it boldly.  God does not want us to preach the message that \\\"I think that Jesus might have risen from the dead\\\" but rather \\\"I know that my redeemer lives!\\\"  (Job 19:25).  The Christian does not side with Pilate in saying \\\"What is truth?\\\" but rather follows Christ, who said, \\\"In fact, for this reason I was born, and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth.  Everyone on the side of truth listens to me\\\" (John 18:37).  We can know the truth because God has promised us that we can know the truth.  Jesus said, \\\"If you hold to my teachings, you are really my disciples.  Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free\\\" (John 8:31,32).  The Proverbs urge us \\\"Buy the truth, and do not sell it.\\\" (Pr 23:23). The Psalmist prayed \\\"Do not snatch to word of truth from my mouth\\\" (Ps 119:43).  Evidently he believed that the word of truth was in fact `in his mouth'.    Yet we do indeed appear arrogant if our claim to the truth is motivated by self-glorification.  But if we present the truth as the teachings of Scripture, revealed by the  Spirit, and not our own invention, and if we stand ready to be proved wrong on the basis of Scripture, as Luther did, then we are not arrogant, but humble.  We should humbly trust in God's promise of truth, just as we trust in his promise of forgiveness.  REXLEX> It is only because of God's own revelation that we can be  REXLEX> absolute about a thing.  Darren> But how far does that get you?  Once God's revelation stops, Darren> and your own reasoning begins, possibility for error appears.  I agree that we must make a distinction between the clear teachings of Scripture, and the products of our own reason--even when such reasoning is based on Scripture.  However I think I would draw the line of distinction more `reasonably'  :-)  and less `academically' than you would.  Darren> For example, let's suppose that our modern Bible translations Darren> include a perfect rendering of Jesus words at the Last Supper, Darren> and that Jesus said, exactly, \\\"This is my body.\\\"  Darren> We'll presume that what he said was totally without error and Darren> absolutely true.  What can we be certain of?  Not much.  Darren> At the moment he stops speaking, and people start Darren> interpreting, the possibility of error appears.  Did he mean Darren> that literally or not?  We do not have any record that he Darren> elaborated on the words.  Was he thinking of Tran- or Con- Darren> substantiation?  He didn't say.   Darren is almost at the point of making a very Lutheran statement about the Lord's supper.  The Lutheran approach is to say that if Jesus said, \\\"This is my body,\\\" then that is what we should believe.  Other interpretations are rejected simply because they are not taught in Scripture.  Recall that Jesus' words do not stand alone on this subject.  We also have Paul's words in 1 Corinthians 11:17-34,--in which he passed on to us, what he received from the Lord.  In particular he said, \\\"For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.\\\"  By these words we should believe that the bread that we eat in the Lord's Supper really is bread (as well as the Lord's body)--as our senses in fact tell us.  Does this *prove* that tran-substantiation is false?  I suppose someone could say that Paul spoke metaphorically of the Lord's body as bread, simply because that is the way the body appears when we eat it.  But this thought is found nowhere in Scripture.  So we reject it.  Thus the primary reason for rejecting tran-substantiation is not that we can prove it false, but that it is simply not found in Scripture.  [side remark] I've been told that the Lutheran doctrine on real presence is con-substantiation.  But it has been non-Lutherans who have told me this.  We tend not to use the word.  I almost think that this is used more by professors of comparative religion, who need labels to compare Catholic, Lutheran and Reformed teachings on the Lord's Supper.  But almost every church wants to call their own teaching \\\"real presence\\\" because that was the traditional teaching of  the church. [end side remark]  Darren> When Christians speak as if they believe their own reasoning Darren> can never lead them astray -- when we implicitly claim that we Darren> are infallible -- the non- Christians around us rarely believe Darren> that implicit claim.  Witnessing is hardly going to work when Darren> the person you are talking to believes that you are either too Darren> foolish to recognise your own limits, or intentionally trying Darren> to cover them up.

As long as we're trading references, I'd like to suggest Dr. Siegbert Becker's paperback, \\\"The Foolishness of God: The place of reason in Lutheran theology,\\\" published by Northwestern Publishing House. This book was based on Becker's doctoral thesis at the University of Chicago.\",\" Yes, I do agree with your definition.  My use of the term \\\"always\\\" is rather deceptive, I admit.      Hold it.  I said that all of scripture is true.  However, discerning exactly what Jesus, Paul and company were trying to say is not always so easy.  I don't believe that Paul was trying to say that all women should behave that way.  Rather, he was trying to say that under the circumstances at the time, the women he was speaking to would best avoid volubility and cover their heads.  This has to do with maintaining a proper witness toward others.  Remember that any number of relativistic statements can be derived from absolutes.  For instance, it is absolutely right for Christians to strive for peace.  However, this does not rule out trying to maintain world peace by resorting to violence on occasion.  (Yes, my opinion.)    Sure.  The Bible preaches absolute truths.  However, exactly what those truths are is sometimes a matter of confusion.  As I said, the Bible does preach absolute truths.  Sometimes those fundamental principles are crystal clear (at least to evangelicals).  Sometimes they are not so clear to everyone (e.g. should baptism be by full immersion or not, etc).  That is largely because sometimes, it is not explicitly spelled out whether the writers are speaking to a particular culture or to Christianity as a whole.  This is  where scholarship and the study of Biblical contexts comes in.      God revealed his Truths to the world, through His Word.  It is utterly  unavoidable, however, that some people whill come up with alternate  interpretations.  Practically anything can be misinterpreted, especially when it comes to matters of right and wrong.

However, SDIO is not (I repeat, is not) going to fund an orbital prototype. The best we can hope from them is to 1) keep it alive for another year, and 2) fund a suborbital vehicle which MIGHT (with major modifications) just make orbit. There is also some money for a set of prototype tanks and projects to answer a few more open questions.  Better news comes from the new Spacelifter effort. The USAF managers of this program are very open to SSTO and will have about $50M next year for studies. This would be enough to bring DC-Y to PDR.

In practice there is little difference in quality but more care is needed  with inkjet because smudges etc. can happen.   A cheap laser printer does not manage that sort of throughput and on top of  that how long does the _first_ sheet take to print? Inkjets are faster than  you say and in both cases the computer often has trouble keeping up with the  printer. (I have a 486/33 and a lot of drivers cannot keep up with the  printer)  A sage said to me: \\\"Do you want one copy or lots of copies?\\\", \\\"One\\\",  \\\"Inkjet\\\".    Paper cost is the same and both can use refills. Long term the laserprinter  will need some expensive replacement parts (consumables) and on top of that  are the amortisation costs which favour the lowest purchase cost printer.  HP inkjets understand PCL so in many cases a laserjet driver will work if the  software package has no inkjet driver.   There is one wild difference between the two printers: a laserprinter is a  page printer whilst an inkjet is a line printer. This means that a  laserprinter can rotate graphic images whilst an inkjet cannot. Few drivers  actually use this facility.

This is very typical of the elitist Liberal attitude that The People  are incapable of thinking for themselves.  This elitist attitude will be the eventual undoing of the arrogant liberal tide sweeping America, as The People begin to realize more and more that they are being treated like errant children and robbed of their freedoms by a bunch of Utopian arrogent socialist jerks.         Although I find myself often disagreeing with the populist rationale of Mr. Limbaugh, I find him entertaining and I often agree with his  conclusions.  The fact that he sends liberal reactionaries like these idiots through the roof makes him all the more entertaining.     Actually, I find Limbaugh's oratory less than sizzling and his debating skills sometimes lacking, even though his conclusions are often correct.  I would suggest that a bankrupt leftist ideology that hopes to use concentrated  political power and a loaded gun to force everyone to do the \\\"right\\\" things (where \\\"right\\\" is defined by the elitist academics who lead the movement) is showing an acute case of \\\"myopic social perspective\\\", not to mention arrogance and utter stupidity.  Limbaugh is certainly far from perfect, but his opponents in the established body politic and the media are the ones arguing for Federal control of virtually all aspects of the lives of the Citizenry, and for the elimination of local control over Affairs Public.    Perhaps Limbaugh has a following because The People are tired of being treated  like errant children by a self-important group of arrogant controlling myopic  people who have no understanding of how life operates outside of the \\\"oughta-be's\\\" inside their own hopelessly closed minds.     OK, let us take your word for that and work with it.  A nice specific incident.     Hmmm, \\\"Congress shall pass no law regarding an establishment of religion, nor prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\\\"  Liberal translation: \\\"the federal government (as long as it is run by Liberals) may force local school districts to include certain iconic content in Christmas displays, while prohibiting others.\\\"  I think Limbaugh has you on this one.  It seems to me that he is arguing for LESS imposition of the federal government into religion.  Nice job on the specificity of that one, too.    [Analysis of historical/modern communication media deleted]    Ah yes, it is a conspiracy of profound proportions.  Methinks that you may be a bit resentful of Mr. Limbaugh's success because you attribute it primarily to luck (how, after all, could anyone with profound differences of opinion from yourself have become successful without the operation of conspiracy or blind luck!)  Do you feel this same level of knee-jerk resentment against lottery winners, or do you congratulate them on their good fortune?     This should be great fun, since it is the Liberal movement in America that is pushing the hardest for centralized fascist control of The People and business (government/business 'partnership' indeed), and Mr. Limbaugh  is the populist nemesis of that movement.  I have read Mr. Limbaugh's book, and although it was not the most literary piece I have read in recent memory it certainly did not contain \\\"venom\\\" at all, let alone \\\"venom\\\" comparable to an individual who callously murdered millions out of racism.     A very serious tone in that oratory.     You neglect to mention that Mr. Limbaugh (have you ever listened to his show,  BTW?) continuously encourages his audience to think for themselves rather than blindly following any media icon, himself included.  You yourself mention  that he makes no bones about his show being strictly about his own opinions. He also adopts a rather satirical approach, and presumes his audience to be intelligent enough to distinguish satire from seriousness (and he says as much). This is in contrast to the average mass-media show, in which the audience is treated as society's intellectual lowest common denominator.  I am sure that Adolf Hitler was a master of satire; I am sure he was just kidding when he said that the Jews were the cause of Germany's problems and needed to be exterminated.     This is not religion, it is clearly a perverse worship of race.  Since Christ was a Jew, it seems quite unlikely that Hitler's characterization of the Aryan as \\\"the highest image of the Lord\\\" fits with Christian doctrine.     Private religious schools have a vastly better record of success than publicly funded schools.  American history is indeed primarily Judeo- Christian.  I suppose that Mr. Limbaugh pointing out facts is equivalent to Adolf Hitler worshiping the Aryan race.  I think you might be reaching just a wee bit here.     Definite suggestion that the government should control the entertainment industry here.    Just a guess here, but I don't think that Mr. Limbaugh would advocate government control of Hollywood.  You should perhaps call his radio show to confirm this.  I believe this is more a criticism of Hollywood and the depraved moral values it espouses, not an advocation of government control  of Hollywood.  90's Liberals, on the other hand, want to have complete government control  of our school systems, so that the government can teach The People at an early age the \\\"right\\\" way to view religion and morality.  I believe Mr.  Limbaugh is against this, as his satirical use of the \\\"young heads full of mush\\\" hyperbole indicates.     Pretty strong conspiracy theory insinuated here, with an implicit plea for government power to be used to break up the conspiracy.     Indication here that \\\"Elements of the Media\\\" (since career is a self-selected categorization, perhaps an inferred 'larger percentage than represented in the populace at large') has a leftist bias.  Doesn't sound too unreasonable. No insinuation that CNN should not report in an objective fashion, only that for reporters to say that they do not have any personal bias in the situation is disingenuous to megalomaniacal.  You may disagree, and it may well be exagerrated, but it is not an unreasonable  opinion; and Mr. Limbaugh goes well out of his way to make sure that his  audience knows that these are his opinions, unlike most other reporting that  purports to achieve perfect objectivity but in actuality will in some degree  or other, in a statistical sense, reflect the biases of the reporters.  Who  is being disingenuous here, Mr. Shaw or Mr. Limbaugh?  Again, you should ask Mr. Limbaugh himself, but I expect that he would oppose government control of the media.              It is indeed depressing to see such myopia and tiresome Liberal arrogance. Liberals love to play games with paradigms as a way of discrediting people who disagree with them.  Why don't you challenge conservative ideology on an intellectual level rather than engaging in ludicrous comparisons? Perhaps the underpinnings of your ideology are intellectual only in that they exist in your mind, not the real world.     Perhaps there are a few among the intellectually challenged who percieve Rush Limbaugh as a hate-monger, but in my experience he has been spreading laughter at the ludicrous self-importance of the Left, not hatred.  As to Mr. Bush, you may be correct about his fascist economic leanings. Mr. Reagan, on the other hand, did his best to reverse the fascist trend of government involvement in business.  Mr. Clinton is increasing fascism in America through \\\"business/government partnership\\\" and increased levels of taxation.  Perhaps you should not have skipped your vocabulary classes in grade school.     Hmmm.  Seems to me that Limbaugh is not in any way comparable to Hitler because he has not murdered six million Jews and many, many others out of racism.  I come from a mixed-race family, so I am quite well attuned to racism; I don't hear any coming from Rush Limbaugh.  The only place I hear  racism coming from these days and being taken seriously is from the Liberal  Left.  The Liberal Left is the movement I see trying to get America hooked on the opiates of Socialized Medicine, Socialized Transportation, Socialized Education, etc.  The Left already has America hopelessly addicted to  that Liberal drug, the Social Security Chain Letter.  It is quite clear to me that while the Hitler analogy does not really apply to either Rush  Limbaugh or William Jefferson Clinton, if one of the two is closer than  the other it is clearly the Fascist Clinton.

Did you know that the word 'Karabag' itself is a 'Turkish' name?

Well, anyway, it is not surprising that Armenians also collaborated with the  Nazis.   \\\"Wholly opportunistic the Dashnaktzoutun have been variously   pro-Nazi, pro-Russia, pro-Soviet Armenia, pro-Arab, pro-Jewish,   as well as anti-Jewish, anti-Zionist, anti-Communist, and    anti-Soviet - whichever was expedient.\\\"[1]  [1] John Roy Carlson (Arthur Derounian), 'Cairo to Damascus,'      Alfred A. Knopf, New York, 1951, p. 438.    As a dear friend put it, the Tzeghagrons (Armenian Racial Patriots)  was the youth organization of the Dashnaktzoutun. It was based in Boston (where ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism Triangle is located) but  had followers in Armenian colonies all over the world. Literally Tzeghagron means 'to make a religion of one's race.' The architect of the Armenian Racial Patriots was Garegin Nezhdeh, a Nazi Armenian who became a key leader of collaboration with Hitler in World War II. In 1933, he had been invited to the United States by the Central Committee of the Dashnaktzoutun to inspire and organize the  American-Armenian youth. Nezhdeh succeeded in unifying many local Armenian youth groups in the Tzeghagrons. Starting with 20 chapters in the initial year, the Tzeghagrons grew to 60 chapters and became the largest and most powerful Nazi Armenian organization. Nezhdeh also provided the Tzeghagrons with a philosophy:   \\\"The Racial Religious beliefs in his racial blood as a deity.   Race above everything and before everything. Race comes first.\\\"[1]  [1] Quoted in John Roy Carlson (real name Arthur Derounian), \\\"The     Armenian Displaced Persons,\\\" in 'Armenian Affairs,' Winter,     1949-50, p. 19, footnote.   Now wait, there is more.  THE GRUESOME extent of February's killings of Azeris by Armenians in the town  of Hojali is at last emerging  in Azerbaijan - about 600 men,  women and  children dead  in the  worst outrage  of the four-year war over Nagorny Karabakh.  The figure  is drawn  from Azeri investigators,  Hojali officials and casualty lists published in the Baku press. Diplomats and aid workers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates.  The 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one of the last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full control of Nagorny Karabakh,  the subject of a new  round of negotiations in Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fighting retreat and  a massacre, but  investigators say that most  of the dead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was first suppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku. Later  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-stricken Azerbaijan's wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2,000 dead.  The State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov,  the cheif investigator of a 15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  \\\"Hojali Disaster\\\", said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum on preliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman Memmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed in the Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and more than 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700 dead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswoman of the Azeri Ministry of Defence.  FranCois Zen  Ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the International Red Cross  in Baku, said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of Agdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosque from  Hojali, most  of  them  civilians. \\\"We  did  not count  the bodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy,\\\" Mr Zen Ruffinen said. \\\"We have some idea since we gave the body bags and products to wash the dead.\\\"  Mr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the number of  dead in the  massacre. \\\"Don't  get worked up.  It will take  several months  to  get a  final  figure,\\\" the  43-year-old lawyer said at his small office.  Mr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years to reach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714 wounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist uprising in Baku in January 1990.  Those  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  power three weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly what  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70 miles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians.  Officially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, being the  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the republic's forensic department. \\\"This  is just a small percentage of the dead,\\\" said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic's chief forensic scientist. \\\"They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the chaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury our dead within 24 hours.\\\"  Of these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14 years old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 and axes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highland snows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs of deliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penises cut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov's report. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those believed to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said.  Files  from  Mr  Rasulov's  investigative  commission  are  still disorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, six policemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, the names of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. The most heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so far comes  from Towfiq  Manafov,  an Azeri  investigator  who took  a helicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  27 February.  \\\"There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to count properly: 470-500  in Hojali, 650-700 people  by the stream and the road and 85-100  visible around Nakhchivanik village,\\\" Mr Manafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter pilot.  \\\"People waved up  to us for help. We saw  three dead children and one  two-year-old alive  by  one  dead woman.  The  live one  was pulling at her arm for the mother to get up. We tried to land but Armenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had to return.\\\"  There  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  in circulation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last few months and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in Hojali at the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages taken over by Armenian forces.

Assuming that they are using civilians for cover, are they not killing SOLDIERS in THEIR country? If the buffer zone is to prevent attacks on Israel, is it not working?

You see, there is more to the shelling of the villages.... it is called RETALIATION... \\\"GETTING BACK\\\" ...\\\"GETTING EVEN\\\". It doesn't make sense to shell the villages. The least it shows is a reckless disregard by the Israeli government for the lives of civilians.

I think Basil is a very intelligent person and I respect what he writes. Basil is a person that I would gladly call a friend. He is, however, not me. Nor am I Lebanese, as some seem to suspect.    Tim, you are ignoring the fact that the Palestinians in Lebanon have been disarmed. Hezbollah remains the only independent militia. Hezbollah does not attack Israel except at a few times such as when the IDF burned up Sheikh Mosavi, his wife, and young son. Of course, if Israel would withdraw from Lebanon and stop assassinating people and shelling villages they wouldn't make the Lebanese so mad as to do that. Furthermore, with Hezbollah  subsequently disarmed, it would not be possible.   Tim, when is the last time that you recall any trouble on the Syrian border? Not lately, eh?  Israel knows very well that the Syrians are able to restrain ALL who would use territory under their control to attack Israel. While Lebanon would be better off with Syria and Israel out of its borders, the presence of Syrian troops in Lebanon has meant a sharp decrease in attacks on Israeli territory (not on Israeli troops in Lebanon, however. Please note the distinction) in the past two years.   I disagree, Basil has always seemed to me to be a cool-headed person, slow to anger (certainly more so than I). What is most important is that he is an  actual witness to things from the other end of the Israeli guns.

Of course you could always do a  simple script to do this , but I have a feeling I'm missing something simple here.  Comments / suggestions appreciated.  Thanks in advance\",\" I agree and disagree.  John is saying that the batters efforts will result in 4 more wins then losses.  While you are probably correct that 400% does not mean 4 more wins then losses, it means something.  I would rather have a player who increased my teams chances of winning by 1% in each of 400 PAs then I would a player who increased my chances of winning by .5% in each of 400 PAs.  Thus, there appears to me to be an obvious positive association between John's statistic and winning games.  Thus, before you disregard this stat, it appears to me that further study must go into what sort of relationship there is.   The only problem here is an insistance that these number mean exactly how many wins the team has.  First, we are using averages over many seasons and applying them to one game.  Second, remember some players performance take away from the chance of you winning.  That is a player who gets an out gets a \\\"negative probability\\\" in most cases. Thus, I'm not sure in any given game when you add up all the numbers for a team who won that they will add up to 1 in that game.  Sometimes, they will add up to more then one sometime, less than one.  Also, the pitchers' bad performances (giving up 6 runs) may have given them a large negative percentage for that game.  Also, any batter that pulled an 0-4 night would give large negatives.       No, but really only because you have a smaller sample size.  I would think however, that the number of runs you score in the first inning would be just as good as a prediction as how many runs you score  in the last inning.  And, realize something else a closer usually comes in in a close situation, not a blow out.  It is hard to argue that any runs that a closer gives up in a game have equal importance to those given up in the first inning.  Look, a closer giving up runs often means a team will lose many games.  On, the other hand a starter who gives up runs often still leaves his team a chance to win.  The offence has many more outs to do something about.  But, I am not saying all late inning situations are equally important either.  If I am down 8 runs in the ninth, it really does not matter how many runs my pitcher gives up in the ninth.           No, but why would you assume that the teams probability of winning would be 0 before the possesion in which the free throws were made.  Look, if you are down 1 point with 5 seconds left, there is a fairly high probability that you will win the game if you are in possesion of the ball.  And, do not forget that somebody elses missed shots, turnovers, fouls, bad defense, etc. caused a \\\"negative chance\\\" that the team would win.   From reading all of the discussion on this statistic, I feel that those who critisize it to a certain extent are doing so out of an agenda. At first look this statistic valadates clutchness.  But, it really does not.  Cluthness revolves around the idea that certain players in crucial situation elevate their performance and others performance goes down.  I've never seen convincing proof that this really happens. So, if you assume there is no clutchness, then that means that except for a lot of noice, this statistic has a positive association to player performance.  There is a way to get rid of the noice if you do not believe in clutchness.  Certainly, we could find out what the average value of a home run is for example.  We may find for instance, that a home run increases your chance of winning by 15% on average while a strikeout decreases your chance of winning by 5%. I bet if this were done we would find that this statistic was just as good as other statistics we have for predicting wins and losses.  How do we evaluate relief pitchers?  Say John and Sam have the exact same pitching statistics (runs, earned runs, K's, BB's, etc.)  Both had exceptional numbers.  John, however only pitched in closer situations, while Sam was a Mop up man.  Who was more valuble to their team?  Probably John.  Who was the better  pitcher?  They were probably about the same.\",\"************************************************************ *     For Sale - Jazz Compact Discs                        * ************************************************************  I have the following CDs for sale, they are all in mint condition and are fairly hard to find.

The  satellite was in three sections separated by two booms.  The central section  housed the DISCOS Disturbance Compensation System, which consisted of a proof  mass of special non-magnetic alloy housed within a spherical cavity.  The  proof mass flew a true gravitational orbit, free from drag and radiation  pressure.  Teflon microthrusters kept the body of the satellite centered  around the proof mass, thereby flying the entire satellite drag free.       TRIAD was one of the APL-designed Navy Navigation Satellites.  The  2nd-generation operational navigation satellites flying today (NOVA) use a  single-axis version of DISCOS.  TRIAD was also the sixth APL satellite to be  powered by an RTG (APL flew the first nuclear power supply in space, in 1961).

One has a duty to have one's marriage properly recorded and witnessed.    - But there are also people who have been through a wedding ceremony   without making a genuine commitment, and therefore are not married   in God's eyes.

For the purposes of a contest, you'll probably not compete if'n you can't afford the ride to get there.

For example, would you allow Rockwell to 'loan' you the engines?  And so forth...   This depends on the how soon the new launch system comes on line.

For example, how about a scheme using RSA, and some hybrid of DES-CFB and another strong stream cipher (Maybe IDEA-CFB)?  This could be substantially the same as the cripple chip, except that instead of key-registration, the police could demand that you give up your secret key to them (with a court- issued warrant).  Then, they could read the last few months of wiretapped messages you've sent, and assuming you've committed no crimes, you could generate a new key pair and go about your business.  I find that I'd be willing to pay RSA for the right to use such a system, especially given the alternative.  If you were unwilling to give up your secret key, then you'd probably stay in jail (has anyone got a real legal precedent for this?).    This would allow court-issued warrants to be used to gather information on suspected criminals, but it couldn't be done in secrecy, and there would be enormously less likelihood of corruption or theft of escrowed keys.

A TTL gate has the basic structure of AND/OR/INVERT, and an inversion of a sum of a product is just exactly ONE gate delay.  The reason to find a minimal sum of products is that this matches a hardware optimization.   A positive-OR gate (such as the 9-gate solution uses) has TWO gate delays (and there's another gate delay in the second term) so that the second solution, while simpler in logic symbols, can  be expected to be something less than optimal in the real world. ECL is similar to TTL, in that it can support an OR/AND gate with the minimum delay (unlike TTL, you get both true and inverse outputs for 'free' when using ECL).   PALs are basically large programmable AND/OR/INVERT gates (with your choice of internal connections between the various sections, and perhaps some latches), so a minimum sum of products ALSO is a way to shoehorn a logic design into  a few PALs.  It's not comparably easy to design with a minimization of logic gates, but some software packages claim to allow you to do so, and will take just about any mess of gates (as a nodelist with 74xxx series logic ICs) and produce a description of a logic cell array to do the same job.

The new cryptography scheme was announced today by the White House and the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), which will implement the technical specifications of the plan.  A NIST spokesman acknowledged that the National Security Agency (NSA), the super- secret military intelligence agency, had actually developed the encryption technology around which the new initiative is built.          According to NIST, the technical specifications and the Presidential directive establishing the plan are classified.  To open the initiative to public review and debate, CPSR today filed a series of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests with key agencies, including NSA, NIST, the National Security Council and the FBI for information relating to the encryption plan.  The CPSR requests are in keeping with the spirit of the Computer Security Act, which Congress passed in 1987 in order to open the development of non-military computer security standards to public scrutiny and to limit NSA's role in the creation of such standards.          CPSR previously has questioned the role of NSA in developing the so-called \\\"digital signature standard\\\" (DSS), a communications authentication technology that NIST proposed for government-wide use in 1991.  After CPSR sued NIST in a FOIA lawsuit last year, the civilian agency disclosed for the first time that NSA had, in fact, developed that security standard. NSA is due to file papers in federal court next week justifying the classification of records concerning its creation of the DSS.          David Sobel, CPSR Legal Counsel, called the administration's apparent commitment to the privacy of electronic communications, as reflected in today's official statement,  \\\"a step in the right direction.\\\"  But he questioned the propriety of NSA's role in the process and the apparent secrecy that has thus far shielded the development process from public scrutiny.  \\\"At a time when we are moving towards the development of a new information infrastructure, it is vital that standards designed to protect personal privacy be established openly and with full public participation.

Remember 'Cyprus'?   Too bad. In fact, by 1942, Nazi Armenians in Europe had established  a vast network of pro-German collaborators, that extended over two  continents. Thousands of Armenians were serving the German army and  Waffen-SS in Russia and Western Europe. Armenians were involved in  espionage and fifth-column activities for Hitler in the Balkans and  Arabian Peninsula. They were promised an 'independent' state under  German 'protection' in an agreement signed by the 'Armenian National  Council.' (A copy of this agreement can be found in the 'Congressional  Record,' November 1, 1945; see Document 1.) On this side of the Atlantic,  Nazi Armenians were aware of their brethrens alliance. They had often  expressed pro-Nazi sentiments until America entered the war. In summary, during World War II Armenians were carried away with the German might and cringing and fawning over the Nazis. In that zeal, the Armenian publication in Germany, Hairenik, carried statements as follows:[1]  \\\"Sometimes it is difficult to eradicate these poisonous elements (the Jews)  when they have struck deep root like a chronic disease, and when it   becomes necessary for a people (the Nazis) to eradicate them in an uncommon  method, these attempts are regarded as revolutionary. During the surgical  operation, the flow of blood is a natural thing.\\\"   Now for a brief view of the Armenian genocide of the Muslims and Jews - extracts from a letter dated December 11, 1983, published in the San Francisco Chronicle, as an answer to a letter that had been published in the same journal under the signature of one B. Amarian.   \\\"...We have first hand information and evidence of Armenian atrocities   against our people (Jews)...Members of our family witnessed the    murder of 148 members of our family near Erzurum, Turkey, by Armenian    neighbors, bent on destroying anything and anybody remotely Jewish    and/or Muslim. Armenians should look to their own history and see    the havoc they and their ancestors perpetrated upon their neighbors...   Armenians were in league with Hitler in the last war, on his premise    to grant them self government if, in return, the Armenians would    help exterminate Jews...Armenians were also hearty proponents of   the anti-Semitic acts in league with the Russian Communists.

What I see as arrogance and the problem I have  with it is not a sense of personal certainty, but a lack of respect for others who come to differing conclusions.  Clearly, this is not just  Christian vs. Non-Christian; there is a whole spectrum of belief systems within Christianity.  I do not tend to argue with others about matters of personal faith because, like aesthetics, it is not demonstable by objective means.    Choosing what to believe and rely on are important areas of personal  sovereignty.  What bothers me is when others suggest that, in these  matters of faith, their specific beliefs are not only true to them  but are absolute and should be binding on others.  It follows from this that God must give everyone the same revelation of truth, and thus  anyone who comes to a different conclusion is intentionally choosing the wrong path.  This is the arrogance I see; a lack of respect for the honest conclusions of others on matters which are between them and God. Even a personal certainty leaves room for the beliefs of others.  It is universalizing those matters of personal faith, coupled by a proud notion that one's relationship with God is superior to other's, that leads to arrogance.

(Nothing serious, just enough to keep him out of a game. :)    In most cases, the owners have very little to do with it.  They give their general managers one order when it comes to the draft...find me the best players so that our team will win the Stanley Cup.  Whether that player is in Kindersley, Saskatchewan or Chelyabinsk, Russia, if the GM believes him to be the better player, the GM should be drafting him.  Where do you get off calling the NHL THEIR league, when referring to Canadian players.  It doesn't belong to them, it belongs to the owners.  The owners can do what they want.  While a 'Canadian content' rule might be enforcable here in Canada, there is enough doubt that it would be enforcable in the US that the CFL (sorry for the football reference) didn't even TRY to push their import ratio rule on the Sacromento Goldminers.  Increasing the competition for the 'elite' positions, in most cases, would make players better anyways.  (Oh yeah, and how many Europeans play at the lower levels of professional hockey in North America?  While there are some that play in the AHL, or the IHL where that's an NHL team's primary farm club, you don't hear of many Europeans playing in the CHL, the ECHL, or on the secondary farm teams in the IHL.  (ie. the Jets do have a few Russian players in Moncton, but I don't believe there are any Europeans in Ft. Wayne.)) So with all those teams, there are plenty of positions for hockey players in North America.   I'm in favour of the NHL being the league for the premier players in the world.

To me, an absolute is something that is constant across time, culture, situations, etc.  True in every instance possible.  Do you agree with this definition?  I think you do:   A simple example:  In the New Testament (sorry I don't have a Bible at work, and can't provide a reference), women are instructed to be silent and cover their heads in church.  Now, this is scripture.  By your definition,  this is truth and therefore absolute.    Do women in your church speak?  Do they cover their heads?  If all  scripture is absolute truth, it seems to me that women speaking in and  coming to church with bare heads should be intolerable to evangelicals.   Yet, clearly, women do speak in evangelical churches and come with bare  heads.  (At least this was the case in the evangelical churches I grew  up in.)  Evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture  to be absolute truth.  (And there are plenty of other examples.) Can you reconcile this?   I don't claim that there are *no* absolutes.  I think there are very few, though, and determining absolutes is difficult.    But you are claiming that all of Scripture is absolute.  How can you determine absolutes derived from Scripture when you can't agree how to interpret the Scripture?    It's very difficult to see how you can claim something which is based  on your own *interpretation* is absolute.  Do you deny that your own background, education, prejudices, etc. come into play when you read the  Bible, and determine how to interpret a passsage?  Do you deny that  you in fact interpret?\",\"Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, lend me your ears for but a moment,     The National Legue Eastern Division Champions will be the...

I didn't suggest that all  government regulations be subject to referenda.  So I don't follow the  comments above.   I mean that an ideology that treats all government regulation as equally undesirable and seeks to abolish all regulations is unlikely to draw support among more than a miniscule portion of the electorate.  Furthermore, I am suggesting that such a plan is not feasible in an industrial society because the weight of litigation and/or misery it would produce would effectively crush productive effort.  No, I'm not surprised.  I just think it's interesting that on one hand libertarians assume a limited government can be decreed, yet on the other posit an entire government made up of people who carry guns.  (I realize that many libertarians assume that such a government will be  counterbalanced by a fully armed citizenry, but it is worth noting that widespread civilian ownership of guns does not necessarily prevent the establishment of totalitarian government, e.g. Iraq.)  Yup, sure do.  But since I also support the constitutional requirement that the government provide for the general welfare (Article I section 8), I'm willing to justify such programs on that basis.  Well, in the first place, I don't support a \\\"socialized economic system.\\\" I think within limits that capitalism is a fine idea.  But it is not the case that \\\"any third party...is...as likely to be ignorant or corrupt as the buyer or seller.\\\"  There are multitudes of examples where such a statement is demonstrably false.  Regulation of stock market transactions that provide a reasonable basis for buyers to avoid fraud is only one example.  jsh \",\" Firstly, I would never consider trying to make a one-shot timer. Your 2F2 cap will have been designed as a RAM battery substitute, rather than for use in applications where you wish to drain the cap with a constant current. Their performance, in some respects, is more akin to batteries than to a normal cap. The other point is that big electro's are usually rated with -5%+20% tolerances, so calculating exactly what capacitance you have (particularly when considering the cold).  You should be looking at designing a micropower oscillator and divider chain, that \\\"rolls over\\\" (from zero to maximum count, or vice-versa) once every 1,209,600 seconds. If you were to use something like a 110Hz clock, you would need a divider chain of 2^27, to give an error of less than one percent in the firing times over the six week period. Of course, you could trim the 110Hz oscillator to give you exact time, but the likelyhood of the oscillator remaining exactly constant at -40 is low anyway.  I would suspect that there would be far more battrey drain in firing the solenoid than there would be in the timer circuit.  Caveat - I'm not experienced in low temperature electronics, so I can't guarantee that this (or any other) approach is the best for inhospitable conditions.

If the HGA was working,  they could slew around in near real time (Less speed of light delay).  But when they were imaging toutatis????  didn't someone have to get lucky on a guess to find the first images?     Also, I imagine S-L 1993e will be mostly a visual image.  so how will that affect the other imaging missions.  with the LGA,  there is a real tight allocation of bandwidth.

For instance, several plants in different cities each made one of six partial concentrates, which were then shipped back-and forth and remixed in a complicated scheme so that no single plant made the whole formula.

The IR source could be emitting a signature; I'm leaning toward 30 KHz square wave with 50% duty cycle.  I am considering the use of a quadrant detector from Centronic Inc. to give information to a pan/tilt head to point the sensor and thus determine the angles.

For instance, 'No one should ever deliberately inflict pain on another simply to take pleasure in his suffering' might be thought of as a plausible example.  Even in a world of sadists who all rejected it, the contention remains true, just as '5 + 7 = 12' remains correct even if there is no one left to count.  The problem for the objectivist is to determine the status of moral truths and the method by which they can be established.  If we accept that such judgements are not reports of what is but only relate to what ought to be (see naturalistic fallacy) then they cannot be proved by any facts about the nature of the world.  Nor can they be analytic, since this would involve lack of action-guiding content;  'One ought always to do the right thing' is plainly true in virtue of the vords involved but it is unhelpful as a practical guide to action (see analytic and synthetic).  At this point the objectivist may talk of 'self-evident truths', but can he deny the subjectivist's claim that self-evidence is in the mind of the beholder?  If not, what is left of the claim that some moral judgements are true?  THe subjectivist may well feel that all that remains is that there are some moral judgements with which he would wish to associate himself.  To hold a moral opinion is, he suggests, not to know something to be true but to have preferences regarding human activity.\\\"\",\"  With yet another tax being floated by the Clinton administration to pay for new ``free'' social programs, I've really begun to suspect that the Canadians, long resentful of their place in the American shadow, brainwashed an American draft dodger who fled to Canada some time between 1966 and 1968, tutored him in the ways of Canadian socialism, awarded him with smokeless marijuana cigarettes when he got the correct answers, then returned him to the states (under the control of the domineering wife assigned to his case) to attain high public office and destroy the evil individualistic and free market forces in America, thus shaping America in the Canadian image.\",\" wondering                                                       -------------  Do you mean Juan Berenguer?

(although the Internet comes close.)\",\" I don't find this a credible argument, for two reasons.  One you have supplied below: unless I care about entering the USA at any time in the future (eg. the Taiwanese backyard cloners - who BTW have been known to decap custom silicon and reproduce it on daughterboards when pirating high-profit arcade machines and the like - who wouldn't care less), I am not  going to care much about US confidentiality, am I?  Only people like the real me, who does care about travelling to various countries for business reasons, will sit up and follow laws like this, but I would contend that we're not the main threat.  I also have grave doubts whether an algorythm widely distributed in silicon could possibly be called \\\"classified.\\\"  It's like handing out military secrets to the whole world in envelopes marked \\\"don't open me.\\\"  I can imagine several credible defences which could be employed if it came to a trial.  One would be the stupidity of the government's actions.   Amusing thought: could they have employed an algorythm which is infeasable for a fast software implementation, but which is easy in custom hardware? In DES, the extensive use of permutation tables (trivial in hardware: you just swap bus lines), but relatively slow in software have had a big effect on the speed difference between hardware and software implementations of that cipher (indeed, I suspect that Lucifer's designers were well aware that it would be, and approved.)  Certain algorythms (usually parallel search algorythms) can be very slow in software, yet can fly in custom hardware. I have no proof of their employment in Clipper -- it is pure conjecture.   However, as a software implementation of this cipher is something that its  designers would have been trying to avoid at all costs, then the inclusion  of such techniques seems credible.  Hmmm... I also wonder what Intergraph thinks about the use of the name \\\"Clipper\\\" for this device. :) \",\"  How could this possibly be \\\"environmental vandalism\\\" when there is no \\\"environment\\\" to vandalize up there?

No doubt.  People are always looking for something to protest about, so it would be no surprise.   Well, look on the, er, bright side.

This description   1. ignores the role of the ballast,  2. misrepresents the heating effects in the starter.  The bimetalic strip cools down immediately after the contacts short circuit, because the neon discharge stops, and much less heat is generated from the I^2R loss in the metal as compared to the neon discharge.  The starter contacts open before the tube fires.  Actually, the tube fires as a result of the back-emf generated in the ballast because of this immediate opening of the starter's contacts.  A capacitor is connected in parallel with the contacts to prevent excessive arcing during the firing.  The neon reionizes but does not draw sufficient current to prevent firing of the tube itself.\",\"High power assault gun?  Why, you must be talking about the 155mm Howitzer.

This is a second RFD, replacing the one originally posted in January '93 (and never taken to a vote).  The proposed groups are described below:  NAME:   comp.os.ms-windows.nt.setup STATUS:  Unmoderated. PURPOSE: Discussions about setting up and installing Windows NT, and about   system and peripheral compatability issues for Windows NT.  NAME:  comp.os.ms-windows.nt.misc STATUS:  Unmoderated. PURPOSE: Miscellaneous non-programming discussions about using Windows NT,   including issues such as security, networking features, console   mode and Windows 3.1 (Win16) compatability.  RATIONALE:  Microsoft NT is the newest member of the Microsoft Windows family  of operating systems (or operating environments for those who wish  to argue about the meaning of an \\\"OS\\\").  The family ranges from  Modular Windows through Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups to  Windows NT at the high end.  To date, Microsoft has shipped over  50,000 beta copies and pre-release SDKs of Windows NT -- the  actual release is slated for May/June '93.   While Windows NT has an entirely new design internally, it shares  an application programming interface with the other members of the  Windows family; its Win32 API includes the Win16 API used in Win-  dows 3.1, and the Win32s API subset (Win32 less threads, networking  and security) can be used to create 32-bit applications for  Windows 3.1.   The user interface is also practically identical to that of Windows  3.1, with the addition of logins and a few other features.  It uses  Program Manager, File Manager and other applets, and generally pre-  sents an identical appearance to the user.  Many of the announced  Windows NT applications are ports of existing Windows 3.1 apps, and  NT also runs existing 3.1 applications.   Thus, it appears logical that Windows NT should share the following  groups with the other members of the Windows family:   comp.os.ms-windows.apps   comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.tools   comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.misc   comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.win32    The following groups are also clearly applicable to Windows NT as  well as Windows 3.1:   comp.os.ms-windows.announce   comp.os.ms-windows.advocacy    In conclusion, the only clear argument for the separation of the  Windows 3.1 and Windows NT hierarchies is different internal  structures of Windows 3.1 and Windows NT.  And yet operating  systems such as OS/2, Macintosh OS, Xenix and Coherent all have  undergone major rewrites without having been split into separate  newsgroup hierarchies.   Further, Windows 3.1 is due for a major rewrite itself in 1994 --  when the fully 32-bit, protected-mode and with-DOS-built-in next-  generation Windows, \\\"Chicago\\\", debuts next year, surely it should  remain in the same hierarchy.  And what, then, would be the jus-  tification for separating Windows NT from other Windows versions?   DISCUSSION PERIOD:  The discussion period will run from 27 April, 1992 to 18 May, 1993.    VOTING:  The CFV (Call for Votes) will be issued around 19 May, 1993, based on  the feedback received during the discussion period.  No votes will  be accepted prior to the CFV.\",\"  not a flame, just a point:  I'd be scared at 130 here, not because i feel drivers who are STUPID.

That's *your* *interpretation* of these texts.   2 Peter 1:20-21 But know this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture is a matter  of one's own interpretation, for no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.  The study notes in my Bible offer three possible meanings for verse 20. Apparantly it's not as clear to Charles Ryrie as it is to you.  2 Timothy 3:16-17 All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work.  Galations 1:11-12 For I would have you know, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man.  For I neither received it from man,  nor was I taught it, but I receieved it through a revelation of Jesus Christ.  When I read these passages, it was not immediately clear to me what every phrase meant.  I had stop and think about the possible connotations of words, what the intent of the author may have been, wonder if the translator used the correct English word to convey the  same meaning: I had to interpret.  If you want to believe that your  are not interpreting Scripture as you read, there's probably nothing  I can say to change your mind.  But I think it's naive to think that  our culture, experiences, education, do not affect everything we read.   In college, I took an entire course in Biblical interpretation.  Go to any Christian bookstore, there are scores of books on interpreting and understanding Scripture.

When graphed, these define the 'flight envelope' of that aircraft, presumably so named because the graphed line encloses (envelopes) the area on the graph that represents conditions where the aircraft doesn't fall out of the sky.  Hence, 'pushing the envelope' becomes 'operating at (or beyond) the edge of the flight (or operational) envelope'.   Note that the envelope isn't precisely known until someone actually flies the airplane in those regions -- up to that point, all there are are the theoretical predictions.  Hence, one of the things test pilots do for a living is 'push the envelope' to find out how close the correspondence between the paper airplane and the metal one is -- in essence, 'pushing back' the edges of the theoretical envelope to where the airplane actually starts to fail to fly.  Note, too, that this is done is a quite calculated and careful way; flight tests are generally carefully coreographed and just what is going to be 'pushed' and how far is precisely planned (despite occasional deviations from plans, such as the 'early' first flight of the F-16 during its high-speed taxi tests).

Numerous articles in major newspapers  (London Times) and periodicals (Newsweek) during the war, had suggested  the existence of a significant collaboration between Armenians and the  Nazis. Arthur Derounian deserves credit for being the first person to  deal with this issue extensively. Derounian's motives were twofold: his  deeply held democratic convictions gave him a sense of duty and he felt  obliged to shed light on this yet another dark chapter of Armenian history. Concurrently, Derounian embarked on what one would call 'crisis control'  or face-saving. In order to forestall any potential attacks on the larger  Armenian community in the United States, he marginalized collaboration  as deplorable but insignificant.[1]  [1] John Roy Carlson (real name Arthur Derounian), 'The Plotters,'     E.

A magazine called Mitteilungsblatt der Deutsch-Armenischen Gesselschaft  is the clearest and most definite proof of this collaboration. The   magazine was first published in Berlin in 1938 during Nazi rule of Germany  and continued publication until the end of 1944. Even the name of the  magazine, which implies a declaration of Armenian-Nazi cooperation,  is attention-getting.   This magazine, every issue of which proves the collaboration, is historically  important as documentary evidence. It is a heap of writing that should be  an admonition to world opinion and to all mankind.    In Nazi Germany, Armenians were considered to be an Aryan race and certain  political, economic, and social rights were thus granted to them. They   occupied positions in public service and were partners in Nazi practices.  The whole world of course knows what awaited those who were not considered   \\\"Aryan\\\" and what befell them.

No. RK makes radial cuts around the circumference of the cornea, up to 8 I think, and these change the curvature of the cornea through stress chages.

The technology of cellular phones will probably be spread spectrum and quite difficult to record the crypttext without the key.  If the frequency path depends on they key, as I understand it to, it *could* be made effectively impossible to record.  Once it hits land you can record it if you have telco access.  The telco isn't supposed to give that without a warrant.  That's the rule today.  But even so, the evidence would not be admissible, I think, unless the judge so ordered.  I think that even interception of the crypttext without a warrant would be illegal.   Cops can't record today's plain cellular calls and then ask a judge, \\\"Hey, can we have permission to listen to those tapes?\\\" can they?   Yes, that is a major concern, but I think that they think they can win just by having 99.5% of the USA use this system.  They don't even have to care about the cautious .5% that's left.  They don't catch the really smart crooks anyway.   John Gotti, who would have to be retarded not to realize he was likely to be wiretapped, glibly chatted away on his tapped phone about murder plans.  That's why he's in jail now.

They like this enough that they are dropping the so called \\\"Digital Telephony\\\" proposal, according to rumours.  However the meaning of that is complex, since they still want to get at the crypttext on telco systems, and that requires a bit of work.\",\"As promised, I spoke today with the company mentioned in a Washington Times article about the Clipper chip announcement. The name of the company is Secure Communicatiions Technology (Information will be given at the end of this message on how to contact them).     Basically they are disturbed about the announcement for many reasons that we are. More specifically however, Mr. Bryen of Secure Communications brought to light many points that might interest most of the readers.     His belief is that AT&T was made known of the clipper well before the rest of the industry. This is for several reasons, several of which are:   - A company of AT&T's size could never be able to make a decision to use    the new chip on the SAME DAY it was announced.   - Months ago they proposed using their own chip for AT&T's secure telephone    devices. AT&T basically blew them off as being not interested at all.    This stuck them as strange, until now...      Also I spoke with Art Melnick, their cryptographer, he expressed several concerns over the new Clipper Chip:    - The obvious backdoor will be able to let many people decrypt the code.    - Once the key is released to authorities the security of the crypto     system is lost forever. These keys can end up in the hands of any agency     of the government.    - The fact that the escrowed keys never change means that the algorithm     is vulnerable over time to an attacker.    - The classified algorithm may hide another backdoor. But he feels that     it is probably to keep people from forging fake serial numbers, or     changing the keys themselves.    - Additionally he feels that the NSA has probably spent enough time and     money in working on a way to keep this chip from being reversed     engineered, that he feels that reverse engineering it will be very     difficult to do. He feels that they have developed a suitable technique     to protect the chip from this attack. Also he feels that the chip is     hardware encoded with the algorithm and not microcoded onto the chip.  Additonally I spoke with Mr. Melnick about their algorithm. He couldn't tell me much about their new agorithm because it hasn't been patented yet. However he told me a little:   - The algorithm will be released for public review after patents have been    granted for it. This is so the crypto community can see that it is    secure.   - The algorithm is called NEA for New Encryption Algorithm.    The details were sketchy because now it is held as a trade secret    until the patent was issued, but I was told that it will incorporate    the following:      - It will have fast encryption of data (Exact specs not given, but       Mr. Melnick stated \\\"Much faster than what an RS-232 can put out.\\\")      - It is a symmetric cipher, just like IDEA and DES.      - It will use 64 bit data blocks for encryption (like DES and IDEA).      - The key length was not given to me, but Mr. Melnick states that       it is _adujustable_ and is \\\"More than adequate for security.\\\"      - The algorithm is written in C and Assembler in software form, and       can be ported to many platforms (Unlike the the Clipper Chip which       is hardware ONLY and cannot be made into software) This I       consider a definite plus for the NEA for widespread use.      - The algorithm will accomodate public key distribution techniques       such as RSA or Diffie-Hellman. This will also be supported in the       hardware chip.      - Right now the projected cost of the NEA chip will be about 10 dollars       for each!! (Clipper will run 25 each chip [that is if it is produced       enough, which probably won't happen]).      - They currently sell a program called C-COM that uses the algorithm       and a special streaming protocol that does not divide the encrypted       data into \\\"blocks.\\\" This could prevent plaintext attacks if you know       what the block header is. This program operates at all supported       RS-232 speeds and uses the software implementation of the algorithm.      - Most importantly: IT DOES NOT HAVE A BACKDOOR!!    Right now the company is afraid that the new clipper chip will put them out of business. This is a very real possibility. So they really need help in stopping the clipper chip from becoming a standard. If you want to contact them, they can be reached at..

The problem in this case is at least as bad as that of trying to explain quantum mechanics and relativity in the terms of ordinary experience.

Getting a flushed face is due to the heart pumping the blood faster than a regular pulse.  I suspect this is related to an increase in sodium levels in the blood, since note *sodium chloride* monosodium glutamate. Both are sodium compounds. Our bodies require sodium, but like everything else, one can get too much of a good thing.   Again, this could be related to increased blood flow from increased heart rate, from the sodium in the MSG. Distended crainial arteries, essentially. One of many causes of headaches. There is no discrepency her, necessarily.    Well stomache ache and vomiting tend to be related. Again, not necessarily a discrepency. More likely a related reaction. Vomiting occurs as a response to get rid of a noxious compound an organism has eaten. If a person can't digest the stuff (entirely possible - the list of stuff people are allergic to is quite long), and lacks an enzyme to break it down, gastrointestinal distress (stomach or belly ache) would be expected.     These are respiratory reactions, and are now considered to be similar to vomitting. They are a way for the body to dispose of noxious compounds. They are adaptiove responses. Of course, it is possible some other food or environmental compound could be responsible for the symptoms. But it's important to remember that a lot opf these effets can be additive, synergystic, subtractive, etc, etc. It would be necessary to know exactly what was in a dish, and what else the person was exposed to. Respiratory does sound suspicious BUT  resopiration and heart rate are connected.  Things in the body are far from simple...very inetractive place, the vertebrate body.    People respond in a myriad of ways to the same compound. It depends upon what it is about the compound that \\\"pisses off\\\" their body. Pollen, for example, of some plants aggrivates breathing in many people, because, when inhaled, it sets of the immune system, and an histamine attack is launched. The immune system goes overboard, causing the allergic person a lot of misery. And someone with an allergy to some pollens will have trouble with some herb teas that contain pollens (Chamomile, linden, etc). Drinking the substance can perturb that person's system as much as inhaling it.    See above. And don't think that heart rate changes, and circulatory problems are not serious. They can be deadly.  and brain damage.   The area of the brain effected is the neuroendocrine system controlling the release of gonadotropin, the supra-hormone controlling the cyclical release of testosterone and estradiol, as well as somatostatin, and other steroids. Testing for effective dose would be, uh, a wee bit unethical.   poisoning.   Absolutely. But it could also be some synergystic mess from eating , say, undetected shrimp or mushrooms (to which many are allergic), plus too much alcohol, and inhaling too much diesel fumes biking home, plus, let's say, having contracted flu from one's sig. other 3 days before from drinking out of the same glass. Could be all sorts of things.  But it might be the MSG.    If noone else got sick, its likely not food poisoning. Probably stomach flu or an undetected thing the guy's allergic to.   Anyway, the human body's not a machine; people vary widely in their responses, and a lot of reactions are due to combinations of things.\",\"Is it possible to use WinQVT/Net on a machine that uses NDIS to connect to a Token Ring ?

I've misplaced the original text, but the story started with one resident calling the  cops on a gang member.  Sure enough, a few nights later, there was a  drive-by performed at the resident's house.  Except that this time, unlike in LA, the entire street came out and returned fire, putting an end to the car's occupants.  The gang packed up and left.

You seem content to underestimate the electorate; I'm willing to try to raise their consciousness.   I think we can.  HCI was founded in what, 1980?  In the mid-80's, they ran a \\\"One  Million Strong!\\\" campaign for two years before reaching this goal.   My understanding is that they \\\"reached\\\" it by the stratagem of including wide classes of people other than dues-paying members.  (I can't speak authoritatively on this -- maybe somebody else has details.)  Then they started running a \\\"Two Million Strong!\\\" campaign for a while -- but they let it slip into unannounced obscurity when it became clear that they simply were never going to reach that level of membership.  In 1964, just after the commencement of the Dodd Hearings -- the starting point of the modern gun-control movement, the NRA had a mere 625,000 members.   By 1968, barely after the first murmurs of future registration, it had  about a million.  Today, it has over three million members, making it the third largest membership organization in the country (next to AARP and AAA). And its membership is GROWING FASTER than at any previous time.  (Historical figures from Kukla's \\\"Gun Control,\\\" pp. 61 and 420.)  As you say, many of the people in the middle of this debate are bemused by their T-bones and MTV.

Both courses, Intensive Elementary Japanese and  Intensive Intermediate Japanese, are ten week, ten credit courses  each equivalent to one full year of Japanese language study.  They begin  June 7 and end August 13.  The courses meet five days per week, five hours  per day.  There is a flat rate tuition charge of $1600 per course.   Fellowships available for science and engineering students.  Contact  Steven Brener, Program Manager of the Japanese Science and Technology Management Program, at the University of Pittsburgh at the number or address below.

Students and professionals in the engineering and scientific  communitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June 1993 and  January 1994.   PROGRAM OBJECTIVES The program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and the  United States.  It is also designed to let scientists, engineers, and managers experience how the Japanese proceed with technological development.  This is  facilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities and laboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop long-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts.   PROGRAM DESIGN To fulfill the objectives of the program, participants will be required to  develop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and its culture.  Correspondingly, JSTMP consists of three major components:  1. TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE Several Japanese language courses will be offered, including intensive courses designed to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a relatively short time.  2. EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE A particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the cultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in  manufacturing and information technology.  Courses will be available in a  variety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology, Sociology, History, and Political Science.  Moreover, seminars and colloquiums will be conducted.  Further, a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or  research facilities in the United States will be scheduled.   3. AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAN Upon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU,  participants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe, and participate in the management of technology.  Internships in Japan will generally run for one year; however, shorter ones are possible.   FELLOWSHIPS COVERING TUITION FOR LANGUAGE AND CULTURE COURSES, AS WELL AS STIPENDS FOR LIVING EXPENSES ARE AVAILABLE.

If you want the nothings you drop in your wife's ear to remain secret and private, that is not even on the agenda for debate. Note that there is NO role for you to contain private info in this. The only reference is to information already in the hands of others. The 'unauthorized release' bit is also drawing a long bow. Most of these cases are by people who have legitimate access abusing it, and revealing, or often selling the info. These people are, of course, in this proposal, the people who will have the keys.  The criminals also use lawers, courts, the CIA, white-house officials and pens to go about their business. When will they be outlawed as well? Yeah, several of them would be a better idea than CLipper!  Them again, the protections of law and the courts have been seriously erroded over the last decade ofr so.                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ NSA   Yeah, this bit is VERY true.   Note the repeated mixing of telephone scrabeling and encryption. A demo of the above claim on an ordanary POTS would be a good nights entertainment I suspect. Note also the 'many'. not 'all', as the general tone implies.                                  ^^^^^^^^^                                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  The case record seems to indicate that what is needed is a brutal tightening of the current abuses. I have not heard, yet, of a case that was impeaded by the use of secure encryption by the men in black. The other side, abuse by law enforcers is well documented, even by govt agencies. And the phone vs other coms is blurred yet again.                                   Lets run that line twice. Not **VERY** carefully what it says. The stated purpose of the key eschrow is to make the use of Clipper compulsory. Note the word \\\"ensure\\\". As to 'protect', or 'law-abiding', I will leave to you. So to the person who asked if it included the outlawing of other encryptions, the answer in this press release is, YES.   Just as they only can wiretap now with a warrent.    Just makes sure that the illegal ones are preserved.   Where do you find many experts. Any ex KGB people looking for a contract? :-) And as a later posting asks, what of the STU-IIIs they already have. It will be very interesting to see if the military and US embasies start to use it. After all, it is secure, isn't it. The govt will answer that point by its own actions.                                                  ^^^^^^^^  Again, personal use seems to be a unaskable question.                                                    ^^^^^  Ah, so warrents are not always needed it seems.   The ITARs seem to slightly impeed this.   Note that all this wonderfull stuff will be in secret. Only the 'proper people' will be able to express an opinion, hence only the desired result will emerge.   Encryption and codes have been around for millenia. They are generaly in equilibrium with the technology of the time. The systematic study of cyphers has resulted in a swing in favor of the encrypter, AT THE MOMENT. I have no doubt that the factoring problem will fall in time. Probably fofr practical purposes by the middle of the next century.   It is a little hard to critisise a non-proposal.   Note we drop back to 'phone-mode' again. If this is a true answer, it can be rephrased as \\\" It sucks big time. Anyone who can drive the crypt work-bench will use it for light amusement before breakfast.\\\"   This link between the security of the key-eschrow, and the actual algorithm is  a real winner. Given that I have 2 secret 40 bit numbers, could someone please explain how the details of an encryption algorithm will reveal them?   Just make sure you read the CVs REAL carfully, OK.

I would say \\\"less secure, less conveniant, more expensive ( PGP is free ), less available, and more prone to being comprimised\\\" Proofs to the contarary will be welcome. Note PROOF.   They don't seem to be saying anything that makes much sense. And this proposal DOES prohibit it except in a very limited way. And, this is the one explicit reference to personal rights. It is a denial. And yes, I don't think that the Mexicans, Brazilians, and Canucks are included in Clinton et als magnanamous gesture.   The 'false tension' is false. The balance is between two repugnant points. The RIGHT to privacy is hand-waved to non-existance by putting it behind the \\\"false assessment\\\". It is assumed that the removal of the right to take what ever steps YOU deem suitable to protect YOUR privacy is non negotiable, hence is defined in the govenment language to be non-existant. If you don't agree, you must be a criminal, as only criminals don't agree with out laws. Also note the non- question. \\\"If what is here was not possible...\\\"   It indicates we know that Bush dropped the ball in squashing that nasty < insert suitable retoric > and will stamp out this disorderly, unruley outbreak of freedom and ultra-national sentiment.   This one is a real giggle. In Australia or France, they will have to reveal the keys, and the algorithm.

I will attempt to construct a facsimile of what was previously said, and  then address Kermit's offering.  John Redelfs originally wrote...    jr> I learned that a man cannot frustrate justice by repenting on his   jr> death bed because repentance is more than a feeling of remorse.  It   jr> requires faith in Christ proven by following him, by keeping his   jr> commandments.  Such cannot be accomplished on ones deathbed.  Tom Albrecht responded...    ta> So Jesus must have lied to the thief on the cross.  John Redelfs wrote back that...    jr> Paradise and salvation are not the same thing.  Salvation is better.   jr> Refer to John 14:2.  I responded to John that...    rw>    I don't see the effort to equate salvation with paradise.   rw>   rw>    Rather, I see implied the fact that only those who are saved   rw> may enter paradise.  To which Kermit wrote...  kt> Incomplete reference: kt> kt> See also the discussion: Did Jesus go into Hell in the BibleStudy group kt> for the arguments that Paradise and Hell(sheol) are places after death kt> The discussion (no LDS were involved as far as I could see) argued using kt> standard Christian argument from the Bible that pretty much support the kt> LDS position. kt> kt>    Christ went to paridise after his death and burial. kt> kt>    He taught the prisoners and freed them from Darkness. kt> kt>    When he was resurrected, he had not yet ascended to his father. kt> kt> The arguement centered around what was or wasn't the proper biblical kt> terms for those places.       I respond.       The question that was raised was not if Jesus went to infernal Paradise      before entering into heaven. No one has made a point for or against       that issue, nor have they compared the LDS position against orthodox      belief. The infernal paradise is held to be Abraham's bosom (Luke 16),       the place of the righteous dead in sheol (equivalent to hades).       The point that was raised by John was that someone could not repent      on their death bed. Tom Albrecht pointed to a Biblical example that was      contradictory to what John's position put forward. The thief on the       cross was promised by Christ to be with Him in Paradise, the abode of       the righteous dead. John's position possibly needs to be reworked.      Kermit needs to address the topic at hand.\",\"One thing is certain, though, its still too cold.  After about 40  Hell! This is WARM.

I have thought about the implications, and it is scary.    We have a whole generation of families broken up because some men have  decided that is is okay to leave their wives and children for the thrill of a younger, more attractive woman.  If we accept that it is legitimate for Jane to have divorced, how can we not accept anyone's decision to divorce because he has found someone with whom he can have a more \\\"deep, committed relationship.\\\"  Marriage is not a state of being, it is a mutual journey in life. Love is not a passive feeling, it must be actively willed.  Is it acceptable for an older executive to dump his wife of many  years who stayed home to care for the children because he can't be happy sexually unless he is with a beautiful young blonde?  The real solution for both in the couple to make a renewed effort.    Hold fast to the faith.  Has not the Lord repeatedly compared His relation to His people as a faithful and enduring husband?  We learn something very deep and very mystical when we marry and remain faithful through times of trial.  My spouse has a brain tumor that has left her partially paralyzed. If it were to resume growing (it is in remission, thanks be to God!) then perhaps the time would come when we could not have sexual relations.  That's life...the Lord would certainly not give me permission to seek someone else to satisfy my \\\"needs.\\\"    The idea that it is alright to divorce if a couple \\\"grows apart\\\" seems to me to lead to such a monstrous destruction of the meaning of marriage that I feel we must make every effort to avoid any hint of compromise.

I would go further, and say that much of the damage to the environment has been caused by the secular worldview, or by the humanist worldview, and especially by the secular humanist worldview.  This is not to say that ALL secular humanists are necessarily avid destroyers of the environment, and I am sure that there are many who are concerned about the environment. But at the time of the Renaissance and Ref ormation in Western Europe man became the centre, or the focus of culture (hence \\\"humanism\\\"). This consciousness was also secular, in the sense that it was concerned primarily with the present age, r ather than the age to come. Capitalism arose at the same time, and the power of economics became central in philosophy. This doesn't mean that economics did not exist before, simply that it began to dominate the conscious cultural values of Western European society and its offshoots. This cultural shift was, in its later stages, accompanied by industrial revolutions and the values that justified  them.  There was a fundamental cultural shift in the meaning of \\\"economics\\\" - from the Christian view of man as the economos, the steward, of creation to the secular idea of man as the slave of economic forces and powers. There were denominational differences among the new worshippers of Mammon. For some the name of the deity was \\\"the free rein of the market mechanism\\\", while for others it was \\\"the dialectical forces of history\\\". But in both the capitalist West and the socialist East the environment was sacrificed on the altar of Mammon. The situation was mitigated in the West because thos e who were concerned about the damage to the environment had more freedom to oppose what was happening and state their case.

Anybody knows compression-algorithms & -factors for voice ?  I've posted some info on CELP coding on sci.crypt.  Looks like you can squeeze speech into 4000bps if you have a fast enough computer like a sparcstation (or a Newton with the Acorn Risc Machine in it :-) )  This drops the bandwidth to so low a figure that it's feasible to run speech over tcp/ip running on top of slip down a v32bis modem.  Not only will this let us run point to point encrypted speech, it'll let us run speech internationally over the internet if no-one stops us by getting *very* heavy about regulations.  The thought of this, if the administration realised, would probably scare them shitless.  Now of course the trick is to develop and define a standard protocol for internet speech *damn fast*, allowing anyone who feels brave to inplement custom handheld hardware as well as us hacking it on our workstations.  Shouldn't be too difficult.  The CELP stuff is standardised, we use tcp/ip streams, and a protocol allowing silences to be used to catch up on any net lag, and also to avoid sending any data during silences (ie it's not wise to be synchronised real-time on each end because any net delays would add up to big voice-lags)  As for me, I'm going to press ahead on trying this stuff as soon as I get my sparc back from being loaned out and buy the necessary microphone. It'll save me a fortune in calling my friend in texas every night :) (whether encrypted or not)  You know, surely *someone* is working on this.  Who?  It's so obvious, why doesn't it exist already?

As for 'war' I am not sure how I would define it. If you just look at attacks on villages then there is no way of deciding when it started. Would you count the riots in the 20's and 30's? Violence but not war. I personally think that 'war', as opposed to civil disturbance or whatever, requires organisation, planning and some measure of regualr or semi-regular forces. Perhaps the Arab Liberation Army counts. I could easily be convinced it was so. From what I know they did not have a great deal of planning let alone organisation. The Haganah and Palmach certainly did. That is not a cause for criticism, it merely reflects the great organisation generally in the 'Zionist' camp.   Now you are being silly aren't you? In any case the war did NOT start with the invasion of the Arab Armies. You see we both agree on something. And the previous posters were wrong, no?   Again I am not sure, I doubt you want my opinion anyway, but I think war requires organisation as I said before. It needs a group to command and plan. If Fatah lauches rockets from Southern Lebanon (and are you sure you have the right group - not the Moslems again?) then that sounds like war to me. Stone throwing does not.

Does not the creator know his creation better than the creation?  Does Toyota know what's better for the Corolla than the Corolla?   Then I guess ignorance is bliss for you.

So you have no reason to lead a good life. Leading a good life is meaningless.   Why do you do such a meaningless thing?   Has the resurrection sunk in?  Jesus is alive.  Jesus is NOT dead.

Now I just try to get them off my tail.  In heavy traffic I slow down a bit, mostly so I have more buffer zone in front to balance the minimal buffer behind, but I also often find that the  jerk behind will notice traffic moving faster in other lanes, switch into one of them, and pass me - which is fine, because then I can keep a better eye on the jerk from behind, while looking ahead, rather than from in front, while splitting my attention between ahead and the mirrors.  In traffic so heavy that there is no way for the jerk to pass, I might pull over, as if to look for a street number or name, (still ignoring the jerk) just to get the jerk off my tail.    If this all sounds, well, wimpy or un-Denizenly or pessimistic, or perhaps  (for any psych types) passive-aggressive, consider that I prefer to get my adrenaline jollies from riding, rather than from yelling at jerks.    A ride can improve my whole day, while yelling at a jerk is likely (for me) to ruin my ride or my day with my own anger.  In the worst case, yelling at the jerk could ruin my life - since even a tiny jerk in a cage behind me is better armed (with the cage) than I am on a bike.   On the other hand, you might try subtly arranging to be the last vehicle to legally cross one or more intersections, leaving the jerk waiting for cross traffic (and thus off your tail), or crossing illegally (hopefully in front of the waiting police).

Keenan believes in pressuring the opposition and taking the initiative (within the limits of his system)...while Roger has a reactive hockey philosophy...which is why Messier will be able to and has played for Keenan, but thought Roger's way was a sure loser.   Roger is a great assistant coach...but considering what must be bad blood between Nielson and Messier, it would be a mistake to bring him back even in that role.\",\" And this means that the FBI will want to track the customer lists of  better encryption phones, because \\\"the only reason a person would want  one is to evade the police.\\\"  They don't have to track customer lists - they merely have to digitally listen to any phone line and eliminate any that don't have the clipper header/signature.  (No-one has said how it will be modulated - want a bet it's a non-standard and hence easily recognisable baudrate?)  Devices to scan exchanges and detect modems etc already exist.  I've seen them advertised in the trade press.  Once you eliminate crippled crypto devices and ordinary data modems, what's left is crypto worth looking more closely at.  I guess any substitute scheme will have to be v32bis or v.fast to disguise it, though then they just start looking at the data too...  Whatever happens though, the effect of this new chip will be to make private crypto stand out like a sore thumb.\",\" Look at the 4053.  This is a triple 2-to-1 transmission-gate analog multiplexer, with positive and negative power supplies (can be run from a single-ended supply as well).  With dual supplies, the logic inputs still range from ground (0 Volts) to VDD.  This is a neat (well, I think so) design for a switchable-polarity amplifier:                   +-----/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\-------+                  |                  |                  |    /--------\\\\    | INPUT -+-/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\--+----| -      |    |        |              |  opamp |----+------- OUTPUT        +-/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\--+----| +      |                  |    \\\\--------/                  | CONTROL ---------X (analog switch)                  |                  |                 ---                 GND  All resistors are equal-value.  When the analog switch is closed, the amp is inverting-gain-of-one.  With the switch open, it is non-inverting-gain-of-one.  You can clean up the circuit to trim out input offset current if this hurts the balance (this would show up as carrier feed-through).  For high frequencies, the slew-rate of the opamp might cause problems, especially if it isn't symmetrical (and it usually isn't). \",\"The difficulties of a high Isp OTV include: Long transfer times (radiation damage from VanAllen belts for both  the spacecraft and OTV Arcjets or Xenon thrusters require huge amounts of power so you have to have either nuclear power source (messy, dangerous and source of radiation damage) or BIG solar arrays (sensitive to radiation, or heavy) that make attitude control and docking a big pain.  If you go solar, you have to replace the arrays every trip, with current technology. Nuclear power sources are strongly restricted by international treaty.  Refueling (even for very high Isp like xenon) is still required and] turn out to be a pain.  You either have to develop autonomous rendezvous or long range teleoperation to do docking or    ( and refueling) .  You still can't do much plane change because the deltaV required is so high!  The Air Force continues to look at doing things this way though. I suppose they are biding their time till the technology becomes available and the problems get solved.  Not impossible in principle, but hard to do and marginally cheaper than one shot rockets, at least today.  Just a few random thoughts on high Isp OTV's. I designed one once...\",\" There's a program called \\\"Icon Frightener\\\" included with the book Stupid Windows Tricks by Bob LeVitus and Ed Tittel (Addison-Wesley, 1992).  It's freeware.  If it's not on the net anywhere, I'll happily email a copy to someone who's willing to upload it (I can't upload through our Internet firewall). \",\"I should have guessed. It's time for the annual Pittsburgh Penguins whine-a-thon. Bowman was complaning about cheap shots by the Devils in Game 1. I'm sorry, Mr. Bowman, you're a great coach, but those \\\"cheap shots\\\" were nothing compared to what's going to come. Also, I guess you were only able to notice the cheap shots made by the guys not in white. It's amazing what those black and gold colored glasses will do.   PS - Nice dive on that high stick Mario. Everyone knew it was a high stick, you could have stayed on your feet and saved your diving talent for later.\",\"Mornin' all.  I was wonderin'..... I got screenpeace (the screensaver, which I think is *very* good), and I got a problem with it... There is an option there, \\\"realize colour table\\\", and if it's switched on, some wallpapers' colours will get *ucked up with some screensavers (e.g. the \\\"flashlight\\\" one).  If I turn it off, however, it works well, and it's faster, so I have it off.  All's nice and well.  However, If I turn it off, then it will be on again next time I start windows.  All the setting are set in the win.ini file, and I *do* have \\\"save settings on exit\\\" selected.  also, I tried manually changing the setting in the win.ini file to \\\"n\\\" (for no-->realize colour table), and started windows.  It will be fine for that session, but the next session will *again* turn the option on.  I tried adding a +R (read-only) attribute to my win.ini file, and it worked, but my bitmap (wallpaper) saver didn't work then. Actually, it's the same application.  Anywya, it didn't work, since it must change the setting at the win.ini file.  so anyone out there got any answers/suggesions/comments for me?  thanks, i.a.  Mickey aka mp\",\" All very true.  I'm going on what I have read and heard from friends. Basically the Glock is great but I have heard/read that it is a lot harder to learn proper handling because of the type of safety that it has.  I was looking at a Glock .40S&W and the S&W 4006 a couple of weeks ago and the safties on the guns were very different.  The saftey on the 4006 seemed a lot more \\\"safe\\\"  (for lack of a better word) than the one on the Glock.  Of course this could also be a bad thing if you were to pull the gun on somebody.  You would spend more time fiddling around turning the safety off.  Personally I like the Glocks because they are very light and I think they look really cool (guess that's why they use them in so many movies) but I wouldn't get one as my first semi-auto because of the safety.

In one of Jesus' revelation in this century, \\\"...same thing as in the old days.  People refuse to believe my messengers.  Even when I was alive here on earth, they refuse Me.  What more when I am just talking through somebody else?\\\" (paraphrased).  With all the knowledge believers accumulated, He would think that we would be 'enlightened' enough to detect which ones are  'authentic and divine' as opposed to 'evil or man-made'.  These signs, these miracles, are you afraid that they are not from God? That these are the signs we should not open our hearts and mind to for thinking   they are evil? Well, is faith in God evil? Is true peace evil?  Is true love that is divine and pure evil?  Why can't someone accept that God can do what He wants in fulfillment of His   generous love and Jesus' never ending forgiveness to those who turn back to   Him for salvation? Why are we refusing God's messenger of this truth?  The mother to all who are   in Christ? What brings us these:     fears of being shamed by what others will think or say about us?         which, in contrary, could be pleasing to God?     fears of being humbled?     fears of being judged as wrong (wrt mainstream standard of what is right)? Why can't we tolerate non-believers' mockery or ridicule of us for the   sake of peace, love and obedience to God?  The humbling lessons left to us   by martyrs and saints? We'd rather engage in never-ending bickering and disproof of each other's   opinion - looking at each other's mistakes - for the sake of arguments,   instead of having communion in one body with Christ. What makes us go blind to the truth that God is All Powerful and that He can   not be binded by what people wrote and have written about Him in all ages? Why is our faith in God limited?  By all the words and literature we muster? What prevents us from going *beyond* being saved and extend God's rich love   to others who are not?  Why are our eyes not wide open to see that He continuously sees our faith, hope   and love which glorify Him and so He gives us indications of His    acknowledgements with signs/miracles (ordinary/common or divinely inspired)    everywhere?  Isn't that like an atheist/agnostic's view that all these   are just ordinary here on earth and not caused by anything supernatural?  Why then does the Holy Mother comes back to remind us:   \\\"We must really __accept that prayer__ changes the course of things and that   with prayers __even wars can be prevented__.\\\" but then she continues:   \\\"You often have an egotistic attitude.  Dear children, in these days you   have prayed very much, __but your hands have remained empty__.\\\" Why hesitate in proclaiming what needs to be done:   \\\"prayer, conversion, peace, penance, fasting, the Holy Mass, living life   as what the Gospel brings.\\\"? Why not do so?  How?  To the world?   \\\"Start in your family.  Be a good example.  Live the Word.\\\" Why worry if it is going to be of good use to many?   \\\"The fruits, __leave them to the Lord__, do not worry about anything or    anyone but entrust yourself to the Lord.\\\"  Although the Holy Mother does not insist because:   \\\"You are free; I bow before the freedom which God gives you.\\\" but she follows this with:   \\\"You are surprised because I say to you: Decide for God and yet, see how   you have lived this day.\\\" Why does she constantly conveys:   \\\"Take this life toward God in the way as to __experience__ the Lord Himself   in your __behavior__ and __not only__ when you pray\\\" or one time when we    decide that we are saved, or talk/write about God, etc. The Holy Mother warns:   \\\"Satan (the serpent) is always trying to dissuade you to turn you away from   my peace plan and prayer.\\\"  (Rev 12:17, the dragon became angry with the woman   and went off to wage war against the rest of her offsprings, those who keep   God's commandments, and bear witness to Jesus.)  Do you have fear or hate for God's current messenger of true peace, love and   our motherly protector from the anti-Christ? The one who is being apprehensive of communism, wars, famine and other evils   that the serpent brings upon us?  This obedient and blessed new Eve? The mother who warns us so we can be prepared and be strong against Satan? Haven't there been renewed faith, hope, love, peace and obedience wherever   this messenger has shared her blessings and graces that God has given her   in good purpose? Why do we choose to be blind? Why fear the truth that God has been giving us a chance and sharing Christ's   ever-forgetting forgiveness to us through the obedient mother? The mother who has been consecrated the task __to reverse__ the disobedient   harm and example done by the ancient Eve. She has been preparing the new Eden with her Immaculate Heart. The new Eden as sanctuary (the womb) for the next coming and judgement of the    righteous by our Lord, Jesus Christ; when The Lamb marries His bride. Shouldn't we give her a hand in her exhaustive job of preparing us for the   second coming of her Son as she has been conceived without sin to bear   the Son of God in her womb? Why fear true peace, love and renewed faith and obedience to God that Mary   faithfully brings to God's children?  She has been protecting the flock   (the rest of the offsprings) from the greedy dragon so as to present more    righteous members for her Son's coming. Not all apparitions and miracles that resulted from them are worthy   of belief.  With prayer and guidance from the Holy Spirit and, of course,   approval of our Church authorities, we should be aware of the true and   divinely inspired ones; specifically, the ones which aligns with the   Scripture.     Also, our Lady reminds us of recommendation of __silence__ in our prayers:   \\\"If you speak unceasingly in your prayers, how will you be able to hear   God?  Allow Him room to answer you, to speak to you.\\\"   She encourages us (with motherly nurturing) to continue in exuberant  faith, hope and love to Jesus, constantly.  NOT with mere emotions,  but with deep, constant obedience to Jesus, her Beloved Son and acknowledgement of our need to have Him as part of our lives.  Let's not wait to the last minute to renew our faith and the life that God wants us to live; when there won't be enough time or when it will be late.

All production would have to be    local.  There are not all that many people who have both the skill    AND motivation to assemble worthwhile firearms from scratch.    High-ranking crime figures could obtain imported Uzis and such, but    the average person, and average thug, would be lucky to get a zip-gun    - and would pay through the nose for it.  Good point you make.  However, a zip gun, by definition, is a crude, homemade gun--certainly not something capable of sustained, accurate fire, but it would be useful as a means of getting a normal gun.  Recall the tiny, single-shot pistols made by the Allies during World War II for use by partisans.  They were essentially well-made zipguns, incapable of effective fire beyond a few feet.  But they were useful as a means of killing German soldiers for their guns.  Also note that the crowd-pleasin' favorite, the Sten gun, was specifically designed to require as little machine work as possible. The point's been made here that one could make a Sten clone with steel tubing, hand tools and a welder.  I still think that while the point is good, I think there's a difference between marijuana and firearms, in that quality marijuana can be grown locally; there's no need to import the stuff.  If guns are banned, I think the demand for \\\"real\\\" guns will be sufficient to make smuggling economically feasible, thus rendering a ban moot.  In any case, the result would be the same--people who aren't criminals won't have firearms, and \\\"bad guys\\\" will continue to have access to them, one way or another.  And I don't see that as a necessary situation.\",\"I booked a hotel (Red Roof Inn) last week in Cincinnati (Blue Ash, which is at the northern tip of the metro. Cincy area).

Can we perhaps as the question of whether the Constitution might have been written to appeal to the principles, rather than, as you appear to believe, it was written with something else in mind and \\\"propoganda\\\" put out by its supporters.         But let's be honest about something, here.  When was the last time you brought up all the valid points against your own arguments?         Or are they simply propogranda?  We can't know what Phill *really* means because he's obviously using arguments designed to convince.          If they're true or false, regardles of why they were said, why on earth did you make a point of calling them \\\"propogranda?\\\"  That would seem to be irrelevent.          Oh, I have no argument with questioning them.  I don't believe they no longer apply, but that's because I think most of them were good arguments.  I'm not entirely happy about the situation, because they were obviously only applied to a minority of the time, but I don't think that alone is sufficient to invalidate them.          Since the U.S. constitution is the basis for the U.S. political system, most changes in it would require Constitutional change.  In this particular case, however the fillibuster is a matter of procedure and tradition.  It only *should* have been made part of the Constitution. :-)           In principle no?  That they had less power of that they should have had less power?           Phill, we're discusing the power of legislative houses.  While the Prime Minister *is* member of Parliament, he is more analgous (although badly) to the U.S. President.          Now, please explain to me how the U.S. House of Representatives is \\\"in principle\\\" more powerful than the House of Lords (or the Senate) but in practice is less.  Are you suggesting that the writers of the Constitution *really* intended for them to be more powerful, but gosh darn the thing was ratified before they realized they'd forgotten to put those extra restrictions on the Senate in?         Not at all.  As any entry level political science course will tell you, people who want laws implemented will always choose the level of government to \\\"attack\\\" which presents them with the best chance of getting what they want.  With national \\\"interest groups\\\" it is simply a very rational thing to do to want the Federal government to enact a law rather than the states.  Less people to persuade, and less  \\\"contributions\\\" to make.          Why do those concerned about abortion primarily concentrate at the Federal level?  Simply because if they win that battle all the little state battlefields are won by extension.  The same extends to insurance, medicine, and most other questions.        Local government has not \\\"failed\\\" in that it hasn't done what it should, but that it is dominated by local interests.  Thus non-local interests who want localities to abide by their rules can't get their rules past the local government.  Thus, since they've got more clout, only in the wrong place, they appeal to the next higher level because it can impose its will on the lower.        I mean, let's get real here.  Do we *really* need the Congres of the United States deciding that x traffice light should be on thus- and such pattern?  Or that *carjacking* needs to be a federal as opposed to a local crime?        The more people want the more Congress will take power to \\\"sell\\\" it to them for their votes.  I don't think the rise of \\\"special interests\\\" is coincidence with the increased power of Congress.          Bingo.  The higher up the governmental ladder the less actual need matters, because political power can be concentrated at higher levels, while people with less cloud only find themselves reduced to in effectiveness.          Then why not simply leave New York's education to New York?  I remain unconcinved that there is any state in the Union which is not capable of educating its own children if that's what they want to do.  And if you leave it to them, you only have to worry about the \\\"pork\\\" in that state.  And since industries can't concentrate their political power and wealth, rather they must divide it among the states to try and get what they want, individual voices have more relative impact.         The problem with the fillibuster is not that you must \\\"buy off\\\" states, but that the Congress has acquired too much power to sell pork.          But why on earth should we want to redirect it?  You said yourself  that you have to sell pork to get things through Congress.  If Congres has less authority to sell pork and retains its authority to enact national legislation within its granted jurisdiction, the pork problem is significantly reduced.          The current blocks essentially state that inaction is preferable to action, thus it the system is weighted against action.  Considering the government the usually the institution with the sole power to enforce its decisions by force, I consider bias against making those decisions a good thing.          The difference with the lower pyramid is that a) they have more legal, legitimate authority in most matters under our Constitution than the federal government, and b) at those lower levels power is harder to concentrate.  And c) you get the benefit of not imposing new deicisons on everybody at once.  You get to see them tried out without a national decision.  Congressional action usually treats the entire country as a whole, yet even with similar problems in different areas, different solutions may be called for.         And while I often don't agree with the decisions my local and state reps make, at least I have a better option of going to the city council and shooting my mouth off.  I'd much rather the majority of laws be made by accessible people who hang around and end up having to put up with them rather than somebody far off in Washington with half a million or more constituents.         I'm curious what you base your assumption that lower levels are more corrupt.            Phill, *you* brought up the Federalist papers.  We were arguing the fillibuster and whether or not a minority of Senators should be allowed to hold up a bill.  You claimed the Senate was suppose to be a far less powerful House, and I contended there was nothing in the Constitution or other writings which indicated this. Which was when you brought up that we can't decide what the founders wanted based on the Federalist papers.  You argued against them, I never argued from them.  I have primarily referred to the Constitution, which places only very small restrictions on the Senate than for the House.          The U.S. Constitution is a nuts-and-bolts document.  The Delcaration of Independence was the high-brow reasoning.  (There are a couple of other examples, though, such as the reasoning for the power to tax, and the reasoning for the power to grant permits, both in Article I, Section 8.)          To a certain extend I do believe the veto has become something it wasn't intended.  However, I also believe it is inevitable considering the Congress' own abuse of their power to make bills say whatever they want them to say.  Unlike most people I think we shouldn't be worrying about the veto, which is fine, but of the problem in Congress which almost necessitates its abuse.          *BUSH?*  Phill, that's absurd.  Bush had *37* vetos, one of which was over-ridden.  Go read up on FDR if you think that's anything resembling a record.          Why not?  What is inherently wrong with biasing the system against action?  Historically governemnt action in the U.S. when dealing with issues with a bare minority and a large minority have not been successful.  When you're in a position of imposing federal power on diverse people, why should the federal government not have to got through something more than a bare majority          Now we're switching from a general question of a fillibuster to a specific bill.  I don't see how it make a difference.          Sure it's arguable.  Theyr'e *arguing* it.  However, requiring 60% to bring it to a vote ensures that they'll have to have a *good* argument.  Something that isn't based solely on party lines.          No, I am completely happy with a system which requires a minority for *action*.  Since U.S. history is a history of carving up population groups and implementing piece-meal on minorities, I feel minorities should have sufficent clout to prevent action they feel strongly enough about.  And 41% is hardly a tiny minority.  I don't advocate the minority being capable of initiating actionm but I see no problem with biasing the *federal* system against action. \",\"DH>>Does anyone out their have a mountain tape backup that I could compare DH>>notes with, (jumper settings, software, ect...)

What happens to a Russian, to a Czech, does not interest me in the slightest. What the nations can offer in good blood of our type, we will take, if necessary by kidnapping their children and raising them with us. Whether nations live in prosperity or starve to death interests me only in so far as we need them as slaves for our culture; otherwise, it is of no interest to me. Whether 10,000 Russian females fall down from exhaustion while digging an anti-tank ditch interest me only in so far as the anti-tank ditch for Germany is finished. We shall never be rough and heartless when it is not necessary, that is clear. We Germans, who are the only people in the world who have a decent attitude towards animals, will also assume a decent attitude towards these human animals. But it is a crime against our own blood to worry about them and give them ideals, thus causing our sons and grandsons to have a more difficult time with them. When someone comes to me and says, \\\"I cannot dig the anti-tank ditch with women and children, it is inhuman, for it will kill them\\\", then I would have to say, \\\"you are a murderer of your own blood because if the anti-tank ditch is not dug, German soldiers will die, and they are the sons of German mothers.

The women will be brought before the courts without mercy, and where the facts are not sufficiently proved - such borderline cases always happen - they will be sent to a concentration camp. This we must do, unless these one million Poles and those hundreds of thousands of workers of alien blood are to inflict untold damage on the German blood. Philosophizing is of no avail in this case.

I can't : see it having trouble keeping up.  His pcplus for dos works great,  re: What to do after the high speed modem arrives.       Edition 01 Apr 93  This article applies only to Windows 3.0 and 3.1, and not to NT, OS/2 or DOS apps not running under Windows.  One of the unadvertised limitations of most current Windows PCs is that their RS-232C (serial, COM) performance is seriously deficient.  Almost everyone who purchases a high-speed modem (V.32bis, V.32, PEP or HST) discovers the problem the first time they try to download a file or accept an incoming FAX (at 9600+) after upgrading the modem.  Overrun and retry errors abound, even when the only active application is the datacomm or FAX program.  If the transfer completes at all, it may take even longer than with the old 2400bps modem.   There are three reasons for the problem:  1. The Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitters (UARTs) used in most    PCs are primitive Ns8250 devices with single-byte FIFO buffers.  If the    operating system/driver cannot read and flush each character at high    interrupt rates, the next incoming character overwrites the FIFO and    the previous one is lost.  DOS, being a fairly single-minded    environment during datacomm, can usually keep up. Windows can't.  2. Windows has more operating system overhead than plain DOS, and    interrupts often take longer to service.  Overruns are much more likely    than under DOS.  As soon as you report to your PC/modem vendor that you    are losing data, you may be advised that \\\"you need to upgrade to a    16550\\\". More likely, since there seems to be a conspiracy of ignorance    about this issue,  you'll get no useful advice at all.  Most of the    store-front and mail-order sources I spoke with in attempting to solve    my own problem had never heard the term \\\"16550\\\" and many didn't even    know what a UART was.  3. Even your PC has Ns16550A UARTs (and PS/2's do), or if you can upgrade    your mother/COM board or add a new COM board, you may STILL experience    errors and overruns because the standard MicroSoft Windows COM drivers    don't take full advantage of the 16550.  Windows 3.1 is improved in this    regard over 3.0, but I still recommend a driver upgrade.  Applications    like ProComm+/Win (which is what I use) cannot get around this problem    by themselves.  If you have a modem CARD, you may not have a problem, as the modem part of the card can be designed to be aware of the state of the UART, and avoid overrunning it; however, I wouldn't want to bet that the card designers were that clever, and will insist on a 16550 UART if I ever buy a modem card.  Some modem cards don't even have conventional UARTs, but if they are to work with standard Windows drivers, they need to simulate one. Use MSD.EXE (below) to see what the modem card is, or is pretending to be.   The Hardware Situation.  The UARTs on most PC COM ports are based on National Semiconductor Ns8250 or Ns16450 chips (or megacells inside VLSI chips where you can't replace them).  You can ID the UART type on your system by running the MicroSoft diagnostic program \\\\WINDOWS\\\\MSD.EXE.  Be sure to run it in DOS *before* bringing up Windows.   The Windows serial API may prevent MSD from accurately identifying a 16550 if you run it from a Windows DOS prompt.  The Ns16550 UART has separate 16-byte transmit and receive FIFOs with configurable trigger levels, and can run reliably at clock rates up to 460,800 bps, although with current modem technology, there's no point in pushing your luck by going over 115,200 bps. The 16550 has shorted access cycle times than the 16450 or 8250.  The 16550 also has DMA capability, but it is not clear that any PC drivers ever use this.  For more technical info, see National Semiconductor Application Note AN-491.  So, what UART component do you have?  Try to locate the UART on your mother board, multi-function I/O card, COM board or ISA/MCA modem card.  If you can't find a socketed component with the numbers \\\"8250\\\" or \\\"16450\\\", your COM ports are probably buried in VLSI, and you won't be able to perform a chip replacement.  If you can DISABLE your VLSI COM ports (as I chose to do), you can at least add an aftermarket COM board.  If you have one or more socketed 8250 or 16450 chips, you can buy plug-in Ns16550AFN or PC16C550CN (low power CMOS version) ICs from several suppliers typically for $9 to $15 each.  The \\\"N\\\" chip is the normal 40-pin dual-in-line package.  Other styles are available, but avoid any Ns16550 chips without the \\\"A\\\" (the 16C550C are presumably all OK).  Early Ns chips have bugs, although National will reportedly exchange those of their own manufacture for free.  Clone chips are available from various IC makers other than National.  The manual for the TurboCom drivers states support for the following (apparently equivalent) chips: National Semiconductor: 16550A, 16551, 16552 Chips&Technology:       82C607 Texas Instruments:      t16c550a Silicon Systems:        73M550 VLSI                    16C550 TurboCom warns about the pre-\\\"A\\\" Ns16550 and Western Digital 16C550, says that problems have been reported with early IBM PS/2 55SX and 70 systems (IBM reportedly will upgrade them).  If you DON'T have socketed 8250/16450 chips, you'll need to buy an after- market COM or multi-function board. If this is a modem card situation, you may be hosed. To add a new COM or multi-function card, you'll need to either disable the COM1/2 port(s) you are replacing, or re-assign them to COM3/4 (although watch out for IRQ conflicts without TurboCom).  Although cheaper cards are available, in the interest of getting the problem solved quickly I elected buy the Modular Circuit Technology MCT-AIO+ card from:  JDR Microdevices 2233 Samaritan Drive San Jose  CA  95124 (800) 538-5000 voice US (408) 559-1200 voice other (800) 538-5005 FAX US  The MCT-AIO+ (and the \\\"+\\\" is important) sells for $89.95.

Meanwhile, back at the MCT card from JDR... I only needed two serial ports, and am running out of IRQs on my PC, so I disabled my built-in VLSI-based 8250 ports. However, with the TurboCom driver (below), I could have set the internals as COM3 and 4, using IRQ sharing.   The Software Situation  Simply upgrading to 16550 UARTs will not completely solve common overrun problems.  The standard MS serial drivers don't take full advantage of the 16550. The Windows 3.0 drivers are even less capable, and the Windows 3.1 drivers have the following limitations:  - They enable only the receive FIFO, and only at rates above 2400 bps.  - They never enable the transmit FIFO, which  results in an interrupt    rate of 10x during uploads.  - They set the trigger level at 14 bytes (too high - it's easy for 2    more bytes to arrive before the driver can read the FIFO).  - The Ports menu of the Control Panel only allows speeds up to 19200.    With a V.32bis modem,  sparse data and text can easily compress 3:1    or more, suggesting that a host DTE connect rate of 57,600 bps would    be effective.  - The API won't accept rates above \\\"CBR_128000\\\".  - The API won't let DOS programs know there is a 16550 there, and even    if it did, DOS programs that aren't 16550-aware get little benefit    from a 16550 port with the standard drivers.  - They don't allow IRQ sharing for COM3,4.  - The BIOS doesn't initialize COM3,4 properly in many systems.  - Windows provides no workaround for apps that don't provide port    speed options above 19200 bps.  These problems are reportedly NOT solved in Windows NT or DOS 6.0, and may or may not be addressed in any Windows releases after 3.1 (but before 4.0). Rumors suggest they \\\"may\\\" be solved in Windows \\\"4.0\\\".  You can get replacement drivers that solve all of those problems by buying a copy of \\\"TurboCom\\\", current version 1.2, from:  Bio-Engineering Research Pacific CommWare Division 180 Beacon Hill Lane Ashland  OR   97520-9701 (503) 482-2744 voice (503) 482-2627 FAX (503) 482-2633 BBS MCImail:    344-5374 CompuServe: 71521,760  Price was around $50 as I recall.  Bio-Eng is not set up to accept credit cards, so I had to send a check.  Egghead and 1-800-Software list TurboCom but as far as I know, they don't stock it.  Bio is not a software company per se.  They apparently needed reliable hi-speed serial connections for an in-house instrument application, wrote their own driver, discovered a market for it, revised it to be a general purpose COM driver suite. They recently upgraded it for Windows 3.1.  It is run-time licensed.  I now have my host (DTE) connect rate set to 57,600 bps most of  my datacomm apps, and I am having ZERO problems with downloads. I routinely see transfer rates that exceed 2,000 bps. I am also using 115,200 bps when linking an HP95LX to my PC, with lossless bi-directional I/O. Uploads to various remote systems are another matter, because many hosts are still using antique UARTs and drivers.  Note that 19200 is still the highest rate that the Windows 3.1 Port menu in Control Panel will allow in configuring a COM port.  TurboCom gets around this by allowing you to specify, on each port, a factor that will set the real UART rate to a multiple of the rate passed through the Windows APIs and dialog boxes.  I also have CTS/RTS hardware flow control enabled, and I suggest that you do the same.  Even if you only ever transfer 7-bit ASCII data, Xon/XOff is not a sufficiently reliable method of flow control.  The informal (DEC) standard for Xon/Xoff hysteresis is that the sender may transmit another 16 (yes, sixteen) bytes after receipt of the Xoff from the receiving system or device.  The 16 byte FIFO in the 16550 is clearly not big enough to let us rely exclusively on Xon/Xoff.  A well-respected datacomm engineer has informed me that the 16550's can't really do CTS/RTS all by itself in the DOS/Windows environment, so using data rates above 115,200 may still be risky.  Even with hardware flow control, a 16550 with TurboCom can still experience overruns in very busy systems, with lots of apps running and serious swapping in progress. If this is your situation, you may need to buy a co-processed COM board, but this will cost you more than a 16550/TurboCom upgrade.  A review of two such boards, and a review of TurboCom, can be found in the Feb'93 issue of \\\"Windows Sources\\\" magazine. I suggest trying a 16550/TurboCom upgrade first, and experiment with process priorities and time slices if you are a \\\"power user\\\" whose thrashing system still runs into comm problems.   Closing Soapbox Comments  The state of RS-232C serial datacomm support is an embarrassment across the computer industry.  Because it is the oldest standard I/O interface, the job of designing hardware and writing software often seems to be assigned to the least senior or lowest ranked engineers at computer companies.  The design of the average serial port is at least ten years behind the state of the art. In my last job, with a major workstation vendor, I lobbied for improved serial ports when they were doing the initial designs of a new system.  That family of machines was subsequently introduced with 16550 ports.  However, this is the exception.  Few computer companies seem to have any champions for decent I/O.  You may as well learn what you can about serial I/O, because this situation shows no sign of improving soon.  When V.FAST arrives, I expect cries of outrage from Windows users world-wide whose 8250 PCs \\\"sort of\\\" work today with V.32, but will fail miserably with V.FAST.  Without a hardware-buffered UART (like the 16550) and without software drivers that use that UART to best advantage, a V.FAST modem will be a waste of money.

ESPN had prior contracts to baseball to show Monday night games and had contracted all the other bs shows well in advance.  The NHL TV deal was very late in the scheduling process (you normally have to do this one-plus year out.  The NHL package was finished two weeks before the season started).  ESPN has shown tremendous commitment to the NHL by squeezing in extra telecasts when it could (like the last Minnesota game) and putting Stanley Cup games as backup to their baseball telecasts (which by favorable circumstances they could pull off last night).  But the bottom line is that ESPN cannot break contracts at will.

Mahan  --- TGV Window Washer ------------------------------- Mahan@TGV.COM ---------\",\"In the April edition of \\\"One Small Step for a Space Activist\\\", Allen Sherzer & Tim Kyger write:   \\\"Another problem is what are called 'wraps' (or sometimes    the 'center tax'). When work for a large program like    Freedom or Shuttle is performed at a NASA center, the    center skims off a portion which goes into what amounts    to a slush fund. This money is used to fund work the    center manager wants to fund. This sum is estimated to    be over a third of the funds allocated. Think about    that: Of the $30 billion cost of Freedom, fully $10    billion won't be spent on anything having anything    to do with Space Stations! Now, maybe that $10 billion    was wisely spent (and maybe it wasn't), but the work done    with it should stand on its own merits, not distorting    the cost of other projects. Congress has no idea of the    existense of these wraps; Congress has never heard the    term 'center tax'. They look at the Station they are    getting and the price they are paying and note that    it doesn't add up. They wonder this blissfully unaware    that a third of the money is going for something else.\\\"  My dear friends, your mixing fact and fiction here. A couple of weeks ago, when I first read this in your posting, I talked with one of the cost experts here in Space Station at Headquarters [if you wondering why I didn't post a response immediately, I do have a real job I'm supposed to be doing here at Headquarters, & digging up old 20 kHz data & looking into Sherzer/Kyger claims rates pretty low on the totem pole of priority. Also, I spent last weekend in Kansas City, at the National Science Teachers  Association conference, extolling the virtues of SSF to 15,000 science teachers.]  First off, yes, the concept of 'center tax', or 'wrap' does exist. If I recall the numbers correctly, the total 'tax' for the SSF program for this fiscal year is around $40 Million. This was computed by adding up the WP-1, WP-2, and WP-4 center 'taxes'. With the SSF budget for this fiscal year at $2.2 Billion, my calculater says the tax percentage is 04/2.2 = 1.8%  Over the life of the SSF program, using your figure of $30 billion for the cost of SSF, a tax at a 1.8% rate comes to $540 million. This is alot less than $10 billion, but I will concede it's still an appreciable amount of pocket change.  I should note that your estimate of the tax rate at 1/3 could be close to the actual rate. The tax is only charged on funds that are spent at the center (kind of like McDonalds at some states, where you do have to pay sales tax if you eat the food at the restaurant, but you don't if you get it take-out). For example, at WP-4, the vast bulk of the funds we receive go to the Rocketdyne Contract, and are *NOT* subject to the center tax (I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I'd guess at least 95% of the WP-4 funds go to Rocketdyne). So, you could be right about a tax rate of 1/3, but it's only applied to funds spent at the center, and not to the prime contracts.  This leads to the obvious question \\\"What is the government doing with SSF funds that don't go to the prime contractors? (i.e. ok, WP-4 gets a slice of the $30 billion pie. A big portion of this slice goes to Rocketdyne. What happens to the balance of the funds, which aren't eaten up by the center tax?)\\\"  At WP-4, we call these funds we spend in-house supporting development funds (as they are supporting the development work done by Rocketdyne). We have used these funds to setup our own testbed, to checkout the electrical power system architecture. Our testbed has a real life solar array field (left over from solar cell research research a few years back), with lead-acid car batteries (to simulate the Nickel-Hydrogen batteries on SSF), DC switchgear, DC-DC converter units, and simulated loads. Data from the testbed was used in a recent change evaluation involving concerns about the stability of the power system.  We have also used the supporting development money to purchase Nickel Hydrogen batteries, which are on life testing at both Lewis and the Crane Naval facility in Indiana. As a side point, 6 of the battery cells on test recently hit the four year life test milestone. 38 cells have completed 18,552 to 23,405 cycles (the on-orbit batteries go through 5,840 cycles per year).  As a final example, my 'home' division at Lewis used the supporting development funds to purchase personal computers and work stations, for performing system analyses (like modeling of the performance of the electrical power system, availability calculations using a Monte-Carlo simulation, setting up a  database with information on weight of the power system elements).  Finally, the money raised by the 'tax' does not all go into a 'slush fund.' At Lewis, the director does control a small discretionary fund. Each year, any individual at Lewis can submit a proposal to the director to get money from this fund to look at pretty much anything within the Lewis Charter.  Most of the tax, however, goes to fund the 'general' services at the Center, like the library, the  central computer services division, the Contractor  who removes the snow, etc. Thus, it is rather difficult to determine what percentage of the SSF budget doesn't go for SSF activities. To get an accurate figure, you would have to take the annual expenditure for the library (for example), and then divide by the amount of the library funds used to support SSF (which would be hard to compute by itself - how would you figure out what percentage of the bill for Aviation Week for 1 year is 'billable' to SSF, would you base it on the person-hours SSF employees spend reading AV-week versus the rest of the center personnel). You would then have to compare this estimate of the SSF portion of the library expense with the portion of the tax that goes to support the library. Who knows, maybe SSF overpays on the tax to run the library, but we underpay for snow removal?

From  the writings  of tye biographers  you  quoted,  I can  perceive,  maybe chauvinistically,  the  remnants of  her  Armenian genes. Even  though she  is only  1/64th Armenian, she   seems   to   have   many   of   the   strong characteristics  of Armenian  women. Her  Armenian ancestry is  traced to Eliza Kewark  (an Armenian from  India), who  married  the Scottish  merchant Thedore Forbes.  From the union was  born Kathleen Scott  Forbes,  who  married  James  Crombie  from Aberdeen. They  had a  daughter Jane,  who married David  Littlejohn.  Their  daughter  Ruth  married William Gill. Ruth Silvia Gill, the grandmother of Lady  Diana,   married  Lord  Fermoy,   and  their daughter, Frances  Ruth Burke Roache,  married the eight Earl of Spencer, who  was the father of Lady Diana. It is noteworthy  that Eliza Kewark was also referred  to as  Mrs. Forbesian  (a characteristic Armenian  surname  ending).  An  Armenian-Scottish gene mix is dynamite.  Levon K.

Anyway, the Armenians tore apart the Ottoman Empire's eastern provinces, massacred 2.5 million defenseless Turkish women, children and elderly  people, burned thousands of Turkish and Kurdish villages and exterminated  the entire Turkish population of the Armenian dictatorship between  1914-1920. Such outrageous sleight of hand that is still employed today  in Armenia brings a depth and verification to the Turkish genocide  that is hard to match. A hundred years ago Armenians again thought  they could get whatever they wanted through sheer terror like the  Russian anarchists that they accepted as role models. Several Armenian  terror groups like ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle  resorted to the same tactics in the 1980s, butchering scores of innocent Turks and their families in the United States and Europe. It seems that  they are doing it again, at a different scale, in fascist x-Soviet Armenia  today.   Source: Stanford J.

Their hope was their participation in the Russian  success would be rewarded with an independent Armenian state carved out of  Ottoman territories.

But they have been systematically            IGNORING or SUPPRESSING an excellent one for 30 years!                  The late Physicist Dewey B. Larson's comprehensive            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he            calls the \\\"Reciprocal System\\\", is built on two fundamental            postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of            space and time:                      (1) \\\"The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE            component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE            UNITS, and in two RECIPROCAL forms, SPACE and TIME.\\\"                      (2) \\\"The physical universe conforms to the relations of            ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its magnitudes are            ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN.\\\"                      From these two postulates, Larson developed a COMPLETE            Theoretical Universe, using various combinations of            translational, vibrational, rotational, and vibrational-           rotational MOTIONS, the concepts of IN-ward and OUT-ward            SCALAR MOTIONS, and speeds in relation to the Speed of Light            (which Larson called \\\"UNIT VELOCITY\\\" and \\\"THE NATURAL            DATUM\\\").                        At each step in the development, Larson was able to            MATCH objects in his Theoretical Universe with objects in the            REAL physical universe, (photons, sub-atomic particles            [INCOMPLETE ATOMS], charges, atoms, molecules, globular star            clusters, galaxies, binary star systems, solar systems, white            dwarf stars, pulsars, quasars, ETC.), even objects NOT YET            DISCOVERED THEN (such as EXPLODING GALAXIES, and GAMMA-RAY            BURSTS).                            And applying his Theory to his NEW model of the atom,            Larson was able to precisely and accurately CALCULATE inter-           atomic distances in crystals and molecules, compressibility            and thermal expansion of solids, and other properties of            matter.                  All of this is described in good detail, with-OUT fancy            complex mathematics, in his books.                   BOOKS of Dewey B.

Several of them, INCLUDING the last one, are available            from: The International Society of Unified Science (ISUS),            1680 E. Atkin Ave., Salt Lake City, Utah  84106.  This is the            organization that was started to promote Larson's Theory.             They have other related publications, including the quarterly            journal \\\"RECIPROCITY\\\".                         Physicist Dewey B. Larson's Background                     Physicist Dewey B. Larson was a retired Engineer            (Chemical or Electrical).  He was about 91 years old when he            died in May 1989.  He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in            Engineering Science from Oregon State University.  He            developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE            chemical properties based only on the elements used.                      Larson's lack of a fancy \\\"PH.D.\\\" degree might be one            reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is            NOT A VALID REASON.  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider            to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES.  At the same            time, it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX            physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer,            well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC            ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, ETC..                       Larson did NOT have the funds, etc. to experimentally            test his Theory.  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so.             He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER            researchers' experimental and observational data.  And in            many cases, HIS explanation FIT BETTER.                      A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX            physicists and astronomers have!  They CLAIM to be looking            for a \\\"unified field theory\\\" that works, but have been            IGNORING one for over 30 years now!                      \\\"Modern physics\\\" does NOT explain the physical universe            so well.  Some parts of some of Larson's books are FULL of            quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who            agree.  And remember that \\\"epicycles\\\", \\\"crystal spheres\\\",            \\\"geocentricity\\\", \\\"flat earth theory\\\", etc., ALSO once SEEMED            to explain it well, but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG.                           Prof. Frank H. Meyer, Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior,            was/is a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson's Theory, and was (or            still is) President of Larson's organization, \\\"THE            INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE\\\", and Editor of            their quarterly Journal \\\"RECIPROCITY\\\".  He moved to            Minneapolis after retiring.                   \\\"Super Collider\\\" BOONDOGGLE!                           I am AGAINST contruction of the \\\"Superconducting Super            Collider\\\", in Texas or anywhere else.  It would be a GROSS            WASTE of money, and contribute almost NOTHING of \\\"scientific\\\"            value.                      Most physicists don't realize it, but, according to the            comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist            Dewey B. Larson, as described in his books, the strange GOOFY            particles (\\\"mesons\\\", \\\"hyperons\\\", ALLEGED \\\"quarks\\\", etc.)            which they are finding in EXISTING colliders (Fermi Lab,            Cern, etc.) are really just ATOMS of ANTI-MATTER, which are            CREATED by the high-energy colliding beams, and which quickly            disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible            with their environment.                      A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a            few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not            seen there before, and the physicists will be EVEN MORE            CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW!                      Are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $8.3            BILLION cost?!!  Don't we have much more important uses for            this WASTED money?!                            Another thing to consider is that the primary proposed            location in Texas has a serious and growing problem with some            kind of \\\"fire ants\\\" eating the insulation off underground            cables.  How much POISONING of the ground and ground water            with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of            the \\\"Supercollider\\\"?!                                 Naming the \\\"Super Collider\\\" after Ronald Reagon, as            proposed, is TOTALLY ABSURD!  If it is built, it should be            named after a leading particle PHYSICIST.                     LARSONIAN Anti-Matter                           In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe, anti-matter is NOT a simple case of            opposite charges of the same types of particles.  It has more            to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the            photons of which they are made, in relation to the            vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light,            which Larson calls \\\"Unit Velocity\\\" and the \\\"Natural Datum\\\".                       In Larson's Theory, a positron is actually a particle of            MATTER, NOT anti-matter.  When a positron and electron meet,            the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their            respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each            other.                        In Larson's Theory, the ANTI-MATTER half of the physical            universe has THREE dimensions of TIME, and ONLY ONE dimension            of space, and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our            MATERIAL half.                      LARSONIAN Relativity                           The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury            has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the            rate of 574 seconds of arc per century.  531 seconds of this            advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational            perturbations from the other planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter,            etc.).  The remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to            help \\\"prove\\\" Einstein's \\\"General Theory of Relativity\\\".                      But the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieved results            CLOSER to the 43 seconds than \\\"General Relativity\\\" can, by            INSTEAD using \\\"SPECIAL Relativity\\\".  In one or more of his            books, he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH            ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury.                      Larson TOTALLY REJECTED \\\"General Relativity\\\" as another            MATHEMATICAL FANTASY.  He also REJECTED most of \\\"Special            Relativity\\\", including the parts about \\\"mass increases\\\" near            the speed of light, and the use of the Lorentz Transform on            doppler shifts, (Those quasars with red-shifts greater than            1.000 REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT,            although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME.).                       In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe, there are THREE dimensions of time instead            of only one.  But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured            from our material half of the physical universe.  The one            dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time.  At low            relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are            NEGLIGIBLE; but at high speeds, they become significant, and            the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR.            [Larson often used the term \\\"COORDINATE TIME\\\" when writing            about this.]                            In regard to \\\"mass increases\\\", it has been PROVEN in            atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near            the speed of light.  But the formula for acceleration is            ACCELERATION = FORCE / MASS, (a = F/m).  Orthodox physicists            are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR: FORCE.  In Larson's Theory,            mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero.  FORCE is            actually a MOTION, or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS, or RELATIONS            BETWEEN MOTIONS, including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS.             The expansion of the universe, for example, is an OUTward            SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of            the so-called \\\"Big Bang\\\" (which is yet another MATHEMATICAL            FANTASY).                                                                 THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION                 I wish to recommend to EVERYONE the book \\\"THE UNIVERSE            OF MOTION\\\", by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North Pacific            Publishers, (P.O. Box 13255, Portland, Oregon  97213), 456            pages, indexed, hardcover.                      It contains the Astrophysical portions of a GENERAL            UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by that            author, an UNrecognized GENIUS, more than thirty years ago.                      It contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL Astrophysical            mysteries, including the FORMATION of galaxies, binary and            multiple star systems, and solar systems, the TRUE ORIGIN of            the \\\"3-degree\\\" background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma-           ray bursts, and the TRUE NATURE of quasars, pulsars, white            dwarfs, exploding galaxies, etc..                      It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL            looking for, if they are ready to seriously consider it with            OPEN MINDS!                      The following is an example of his Theory's success:            In his first book in 1959, \\\"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL            UNIVERSE\\\", Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING            GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding            them.  They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson's            comprehensive Theory.  And when QUASARS were discovered, he            had an immediate related explanation for them also.                    GAMMA-RAY BURSTS                 Astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching            their heads about the mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS.  They were            originally thought to originate from \\\"neutron stars\\\" in the            disc of our galaxy.  But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in            Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions            uniformly, and their source locations in space do NOT            correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of            directional coincidence).                      Gamma-ray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by            the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson.  According to page 386 of            his book \\\"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\\\", published in 1984, the            gamma-ray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the            ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls            the \\\"Cosmic Sector\\\".  Because of the relationship between the            anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and            the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can            pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at            random.  (This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do            not correspond with known objects, and come from all            directions uniformly.)                      I wonder how close to us in space a source location            would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most            life on Earth!  There would be NO WAY to predict one, NOR to            stop it!                      Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past, which            are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were            actually caused by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS!                   LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation                           About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the            vicinity of the sun are binary or double.  But orthodox            astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory            theory about how they form or why there are so many of them.                      But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY            CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of            the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey            B. Larson.                      I will try to summarize Larsons explanation, which is            detailed in Chapter 7 of his book \\\"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\\\"            and in some of his other books.                      First of all, according to Larson, stars do NOT generate            energy by \\\"fusion\\\".  A small fraction comes from slow            gravitational collapse.  The rest results from the COMPLETE            ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements (heavier than IRON).  Each            element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT.  The heavier the            element is, the lower is this limit.  A star's internal            temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and            absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually            reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and            lighter elements.                      When the internal temperature of the star reaches the            destructive temperature limit of IRON, there is a Type I            SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION!  This is because there is SO MUCH iron            present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms            and the atom building process, which Larson explains in some            of his books [better than I can].                      When the star explodes, the lighter material on the            outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less            than the speed of light.  The heavier material in the center            portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to            the speed of light, because of the high temperature.  The            explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light, and            it expands OUTWARD IN TIME, which is equivalent to INWARD IN            SPACE, and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while.                      Over long periods of time, both masses start to fall            back gravitationally.  The material that had been blown            outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star.  The            material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a            WHITE DWARF star.  BOTH stars then start moving back toward            the \\\"MAIN SEQUENCE\\\" from opposite directions on the H-R            Diagram.                      The chances of the two masses falling back into the            exact same location in space, making a single lone star            again, are near zero.  They will instead form a BINARY            system, orbiting each other.                       According to Larson, a white dwarf star has an INVERSE            DENSITY GRADIENT (is densest at its SURFACE), because the            material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown            outward) in time.   This ELIMINATES the need to resort to            MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about \\\"degenerate matter\\\", \\\"neutron            stars\\\", \\\"black holes\\\", etc..                   LARSONIAN Solar System Formation                 If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the            exploding star is relatively SMALL, then, instead of a single            white dwarf star, there will be SEVERAL \\\"mini\\\" white dwarf            stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably            still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affected            by its heat, etc.).  These will become PLANETS!                        In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, Larson used all            this information, and other principles of his comprehensive            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, to derive            his own version of Bode's Law.                         \\\"Black Hole\\\" FANTASY!                 I heard that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently            completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO \\\"black            holes\\\" merging together into a SINGLE \\\"black hole\\\", and            concluded that the new \\\"black hole\\\" would have MORE MASS than            the sum of the two original \\\"black holes\\\".                      Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED            FLAG, causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of \\\"black            holes\\\", etc.!                      After reading Physicist Dewey B. Larson's books about            his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe, especially his book \\\"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\\\", it is            clear to me that \\\"black holes\\\" are NOTHING more than            MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES!  The strange object at Cygnus X-1 is            just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR, NOT the \\\"black            hole\\\" that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want            to \\\"prove\\\" their theory.                           By the way, I do NOT understand why so much publicity is            being given to physicist Stephen Hawking.  The physicists and            astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawking's severe physical            problem somehow makes him \\\"wiser\\\".  It does NOT!                      I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist            Dewey B. Larson while he was still alive.  Widespread            publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson's            Theory, books, and organization (The International Society of            Unified Science).                                             ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION                 I heard of that concept many years ago, in connection            with UFO's and unorthodox inventors, but I never was able to            find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed.                      I found a possible clue about why they might work on            pages 112-113 of the book \\\"BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER\\\", by            the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson, which describes part of            Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe.  I quote one paragraph:                      \\\"As indicated in the preceding chapter, the development            of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally            different concept of the nature of electrical resistance.             The electrons, we find, are derived from the environment.  It            was brought out in Volume I [Larson's book \\\"NOTHING BUT            MOTION\\\"] that there are physical processes in operation which            produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that,            although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in            many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities            for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are            limited.  It follows that there is always a large excess of            free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the            universe, most of which are uncharged.  In this uncharged            state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension            space, because they are inherently rotating units of space,            and the relation of space to space is not motion.  In open            space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently            in the same location with respect to the natural reference            system, in the manner of a photon.  In the context of the            stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron,            like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by            the progression of the natural reference system.  All            material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons            similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation.             Meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later,            whereby electrons are returned to the environment.  The            electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth            therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level.\\\"                            Note that in Larson's Theory, UNcharged electrons are            also massLESS, and are basically photons of light of a            particular frequency (above the \\\"unit\\\" frequency) spinning            around one axis at a particular rate (below the \\\"unit\\\" rate).             (\\\"Unit velocity\\\" is the speed of light, and there are            vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light,            according to Larson's Theory.)  [I might have the \\\"above\\\" and            \\\"below\\\" labels mixed up.]                      Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass-           LESS UN-charged electrons flying around at the speed of            light!                      If this is true, then the ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION            fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these            electrons, or other particles in space, perhaps GIVING them a            charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to            achieve propulsion. (In Larson's Theory, an electrical charge            is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular            frequency (above the \\\"unit\\\" frequency) superimposed on the            rotation of the particle.)                        The paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to            confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is            generated in clouds.               SUPPRESSION of LARSONIAN Physics                 The comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson has            been available for more than 30 YEARS, published in 1959 in            his first book \\\"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE\\\".                      It is TOTALLY UN-SCIENTIFIC for Hawking, Wheeler, Sagan,            and the other SACRED PRIESTS of the RELIGION they call            \\\"science\\\" (or \\\"physics\\\", or \\\"astronomy\\\", etc.), as well as            the \\\"scientific\\\" literature and the \\\"education\\\" systems, to            TOTALLY IGNORE Larson's Theory has they have.                      Larson's Theory has excellent explanations for many            things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers, such            as gamma-ray bursts and the nature of quasars.                      Larson's Theory deserves to be HONESTLY and OPENLY            discussed in the physics, chemistry, and astronomy journals,            in the U.S. and elsewhere.  And at least the basic principles            of Larson's Theory should be included in all related courses            at UW-EC, UW-Madison, Cambridge, Cornell University, and            elsewhere, so that students are not kept in the dark about a            worthy alternative to the DOGMA they are being fed.

The Subject:  After-market cruise controls  The Background: I recently broke my ankle in a road-bicycling accident (4 places, five  screws, yuk! :-( ).  In two weeks I will be returning to Texas (my home) from my school (BYU) in Provo, Utah.  As you can imagine, trying to drive nearly 1300 miles with a broken right ankle isn't just the epitome of a good time.  My car does not have a cruise control, so I would have to do all the pedalling (ha ha) with my messed-up ankle.  My question: What is the general opinion of after-market cruise control units?  I realize that a cheap CC (cruise control) from, say, Pep Boys, isn't going to be as good as a factory or professionally installed unit (if there is such a thing).  And I uderstand that I probably can't expect much in the way of accuracy, looks and that sort of thing;  But anything's gotta be better than trying to drive with a hosed ankle.  I have a 1984 Jeep Cherokee, 4 speed, standard, 4*4, 2.5L engine with kettering(sp?) ignition (y'know, distributor cap, rotor, that set-up--not electronic.  Maybe you could've guessed it being an '84, but I'm just trying to give information as completly as I can).  I found a CC unit for 80 bucks.  It seems to use the vehicles vacuum system  instead of an electric servor/motor.  Is this good or bad?  If I did buy this CC, which vacuum hose should I tap?  It has two speed sensors:  One magnetic, and one that gets a signal from the  negative side of the distributor, kinda like a tach pick-up, or so I understand.  I can use either one.  Which is best?  The manual says (I read it in the store today) that the magnetic/axle set-up is more accurate, but harder to install.  Is there really a big difference?  It has a sensor for the brake pedal, just like other CCs, but does NOT have a sensor for the clutch pedal.  So if I wasn't paying real close attention I might push the clutch in while the cruise is trying to get the speed up.  Which would wind the engine up kinda high until I got my wits about me and turned  the thing off.  I'm pretty coordinated, so this doesn't bother me, if it were for my girlfriends car, *then* it would bother me, but I'm ok with it.  The installation also calls for an attachment to a steady-on brake signal and a switched-on brake signal.  I think I can get a switched brake signal from the correct side of the brake light blade fuse.  Am I right?  But I'm not sure where to get the steady-on brake signal, or, for that matter, what exactly it is?  Any ideas as to what the manufaturer wants and where to get it?  I think I can figure the other things out.  Like how to hook-up the negative side tach-type sensing gizmo and the cabin control unit, and the ground and all that miscellaneous business.  But I need a little help with:   1.  Is it worth the money and safety risk (if any) for such a      device?  2.  Is there any particularly good after-market CC?  3.  Are \\\"professionally\\\" installed CCs signifacantly better and      worth the cabbage?  4.  If the unit I saw (sorry, no manufacturer or model number, just      that it is at Pep Boy and its $80) is sufficient for my simple       needs, how do I get the thing installed properly (specifically,      the questions above)?  My father and I built a \\\"Veep\\\" (Volkswagen powered Jeep CJ-2A) when I was in high school, so I consider myself fairly good with tools, electronics, and cars.  So the installation doesn't scare me.  I just want to be certain that I get the thing installed correctly as my Cherokee is just a wee bit more complicated than my Veep. :-)  I appreciate your time in reading my post, and I would appreciate any expertise or opinion anybody has on the subject.

You are a tad out of touch....  First, gay comunities all over the country are in the process of excluding NAMBLA from parades etc.  #2  Nobody from NAMBLA is gonna get a job in a day care centre.  The same liberals you are upset about are also passing laws that make tough background checks for childcare people.  #3  Tell me, how would you feel if your employer fired you for your antigay post on the internet?  Would you be upset ?  I`ll bet you would be pissed! To some, your posts ,ight make the company look bad. While your posts offend me I dont think it would be right for you to get fired over it.  I dont believe the gay comunity is asking for hiring quotas like the affirmative action laws of the 60's did. My understanding is that the gay community just wants the same rights the srtraights have.  I dont think people should have their leases cancelled when their landlord finds out they are gay.  I dont think that when someone sees someone walk out of a gay business and then blabs it all over work that the gay person gets fired. Do you REALLY think these are justified ?  #4  Clayton, I am told you are a parent a couple times over. Have you been following the strip in the paper \\\"For Better or For Worse\\\" ?  I honestly want your opinion as a parent on the strip.    Do you really care about your childeren as much as friends of mine tell me ?  How much do you care about your childeren ? How much do you care about other people's childeren?  Do you care about MY childeren? Do you care about my sister's childeren ?  If one of your kids told you he/she was gay, would you throw them out of your home in the middle of the night?  Would you approve of your childeren driving down to San Francisco to trow bottles at and beat up on gay people?  Would you condone your childeren beating up on someone elses childeren ? \",\" John 12:24-26: \\\"Most assuredly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls onto the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it produces much grain.   \\\"He who loves his life will lose it, and he who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life.   \\\"If anyone serves Me, let him follow Me; and where I am, there My servant will be also.  If anyone serves Me, him My Father will honor.\\\"  Why would I want an eternal life if I hate this one?  If we were created by a deity, why would that deity not wish us to enjoy what he has given us?  Why would I want to live forever?  The challenge in my life is that I will die, and that I must give my life the meaning I wish it to have before that happens.  My time is here and will someday pass; I will be content to live on in the memories of my friends, and once they too are dead, then I will no longer have any reason to exist.  In short: even if your deity *does* exist, that doesn't automatically mean that I would worship it.  I am content to live my own life, and fend for myself, so when I die, I can be proud of the fact that no matter where I end up, it will be because of *my* actions and *my* choices.  If your god decides to toss me into a flaming pit for this, then so be it.  I would much rather just cease to exist.  But if your god wants my respect and my obedience, then it had better earn these; and if it does, then they will be very strong and true.   Jesus wasn't the only one who rose from the dead -- I think it was Osiris who did the same, as well as a few characters from Greek or Norse legend, if memory serves.  But still: WHY would I want to rise from the dead?  Why do *you* want to?   If your god wants to win my devotion, then it knows what it can do -- provide some way for me to believe without having to resort to blind faith that could be applied equally well to any religion.   That's precisely it.  I neither see nor know Zeus either, nor Odin. Shall I offer them the same devotion I offer Jesus?   You've got to understand my point-of-view: I see Christians spouting Bible verse all the time as if it were some sort of magic spell that will level all opposition.  Truth is, it's not.  Robert has never demonstrated that he actually understands what the verses imply; he just rattles them off day by day.  Some brazenly fly in the face of common sense and reality, and I point these out where I can.  But even more than that, even when Christians *do* try to explain the verses in their own words, they do so from a Christian point of view, which is that every human being would want to be a Christian if only he or she understood the Christian message properly, and then all strife and suffering on the earth would end.  Here's the problem with that: substitute \\\"Moslem\\\" or \\\"Buddhist\\\" or \\\"Satanist\\\" instead of \\\"Christian\\\", and it means the same thing.  Christanity is a very nice belief set around a very nice book.  But if you want to make me believe that it has any bearing on the REAL WORLD, you've got some convincing to do.   And in my opinion, you're bumbling about blindly making up entities where there aren't any, and depriving yourself of a true understanding and enjoyment of your life.  As long as you keep your beliefs to yourself, I'll keep my beliefs to myself -- but as soon as you start waving them around, expect me to toss in my opinions, too.\",\" Yah.  So?

I also think Phil> the germans did some work on these in WWII.  The NACA came up with them before World War II.  NASA is directly descended from the NACA, with space added in.  You'll notice that I didn't mention sweep wings even though the X-5, tested at what's now Dryden, had them.  We did steal that one dirctly from the Germans.  The difference is that swept wings don't change their angle of sweep, sweep wings do.  Perhaps the similarity of names has caused some confusion?  747s have swept wings, F-111s have sweep wings.   Phil> A lot of this was also done by the military...  After NASA aerodynamicists proposed them and NASA test teams demonstrated them.  Richard Whitcomb and R.T. Jones, at Langley Research Center, were giants in the field.  Dryden was involved in the flight testing of winglets and area ruling (in the 70s and 50s, respectively).  It's true that we used military aircraft as the testbeds (KC-135 and YF-102) but that had more to do with availability and need than with military involvement.  The YF-102 was completely ours and the KC-135 was bailed to us.  The Air Force, of course, was interested in our results and supportive of our efforts.  Dryden flew the first digital fly by wire aircraft in the 70s. No mechnaical or analog backup, to show you how confident we were. General Dynamics decided to make the F-16 flyby-wire when they saw how successful we were.  (Mind you, the Avro Arrow and the X-15 were both fly-by-wire aircraft much earlier, but analog.)  Phil> Egad! I'm disagreeing with Mary Shafer!    The NASA habit of acquiring second-hand military aircraft and using them for testbeds can make things kind of confusing.

Because  we prevented Greece, the cradle of democracy, from losing face before European countries by forcing the Greek  government to recognize our legal rights.\\\"  On Turco-Greek relations, he pointed  out that both countries are predestined  to live  in  peace for  geographical and  historical reasons and said  that Turkey and Greece must  resist the foreign powers  who  are  trying  to   create  a  rift  between  them  by cooperating, adding  that in  Turkey he  observed that  there was will to improve relations with Greece.  NEWSPOT, January 1993   MACEDONIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS TO FACE TRIAL IN GREECE.  Two ethnic Macedonian  human rights activists will  face trial in Athens for alleged crimes against the Greek state, according to a Court Summons (No. 5445) obtained by MILS.    Hristos  Sideropoulos and  Tashko Bulev  (or Anastasios  Bulis) have been charged under Greek criminal law for making comments in an Athenian magazine.    Sideropoulos and  Bulev gave an  interview to the  Greek weekly magazine  \\\"ENA\\\"  on  March  11,  1992,  and  said  that  they  as Macedonians were  denied basic human  rights in Greece  and would field  an ethnic  Macedonian  candidate for  the up-coming  Greek general election.    Bulev said in the interview: \\\"I am not Greek, I am Macedonian.\\\" Sideropoulos said  in the  article that \\\"Greece  should recognise Macedonia.  The  allegations  regarding  territorial  aspirations against  Greece are  tales... We  are in  a panic  to secure  the border, at  a time when the  borders and barriers within  the EEC are falling.\\\"    The  main  charge  against  the two,  according  to  the  court summons,  was   that  \\\"they  have   spread...intentionally  false information  which  might  create   unrest  and  fear  among  the citizens,  and  might affect  the  public  security or  harm  the international interests of the country (Greece).\\\"    The  Greek  state  does  not   recognise  the  existence  of  a Macedonian ethnicity. There are believed to be between 350,000 to 1,000,000  ethnic  Macedonians   living  within  Greece,  largely concentrated in the north. It is  a crime against the Greek state if anyone declares themselves Macedonian.    In  1913  Greece,   Serbia-Yugoslavia  and  Bulgaria  partioned Macedonia into three  pieces. In 1919 Albania  took 50 Macedonian villages. The part under  Serbo-Yugoslav occupation broke away in 1991  as the  independent Republic  of Macedonia.  There are  1.5 million Macedonians in the Republic; 500,000 in Bulgaria; 150,000 in Albania; and 300,000 in Serbia proper.    Sideropoulos  has been  a long  time campaigner  for Macedonian human rights in  Greece, and lost his job as  a forestry worker a few years ago.  He was even exiled to an  obscure Greek island in the mediteranean. Only pressure from Amnesty International forced the Greek government  to allow him to return to  his home town of Florina (Lerin) in Northern  Greece (Aegean Macedonia), where the majority of ethnic Macedonians live.    Balkan watchers see the Sideropoulos  affair as a show trial in which  Greece is  desperate to  clamp down  on internal  dissent, especially  when it  comes to  the issue  of recognition  for its northern neighbour, the Republic of Macedonia.    Last year the  State Department of the  United States condemned Greece for its bad treatment of ethnic Macedonians and Turks (who largely live in Western Thrace). But it remains to be seen if the US government  will do anything until  the Presidential elections are over.

I was raised Roman Catholic before becoming an atheist, so I have stated this Creed you quote nearly every Sunday until I was about 18.  For some reason, I always took the 'resurrection' in this statement to mean the resurrection of the soul, but I guess resurrection does strictly mean the raising of the physical body.  I have some questions on this point:  1.  I always thought that Christians believe the descent into hell was  pretty much immediate, and that there are people burning in hell right now.  You seem to be implying that it will not occur until after the \\\"great judgement\\\" (which I read as meaning the proverbial Judgment Day). I was always a little confused on this point, even when I was with the church -- maybe someone can clear it up for me.  Where will my \\\"soul\\\" (which, by the way, I don't believe in) exist until that time?  2.  Will the new body I will have be created out of the same atoms  that my body now is made of, or will it be built from scratch?  My physical body now is susceptible to aging, etc. -- so I guess my new body will have to be radically different in order to be immortal so it can be tortured for all eternity?  3.  Since I will have a physical body, I assume it will need a physical place to exist in -- where is this hell?  In the center of the earth? Do you think we could find it if we dig?  Mark Schnitzius schnitzi@eola.cs.ucf.edu Univ. of Central Florida  [There is not complete agreement on the details of the afterlife.  I think the most common view is that final disposition does not occur until a final judgement, which is still in the future.  In the meantime, some believe that people \\\"sleep\\\" until the final resurrection (or because God is above time, pass directly from death to the future time when the resurrection occurs), while others believe that souls have a disembodied, pre-resurrection existence until then. There are probably other alternatives that I'm omitting.  The new body is generally conceived of being implemented in a different \\\"technology\\\" than the current one, one which is not mortal. (Paul talks about the mortal being raised to immortality, and Jesus' resurrected body -- which is the first example -- clearly was not subject to the same kind of limitations as ours.)  It is assumed that there are enough similarities that people will recognize each other, but I don't think most people claim to know the details.  I don't think I'd say it's the same atoms.  I'd assume there would be some analog of a physical place, but I wouldn't expect to find it under the earth or up in the sky.  I'd suspect that it's in another dimension, outside this physical world, or whatever.

Jordan Water to the Negev: A Strategic Asset XI.     The Negev Becomes a Dumping Ground XII.   The Dimona Nuclear Plant XIII.  The Negev as a Military Base XIV.  The Negev in the Year 2000  Just after the creation of the State of Israel, the phrase \\\"the Jewish pioneers will make the desert bloom\\\" was trumpeted throughout the Western world. After the Six Day War in 1967, David Ben-Gurion declared in a letter to Charles de Gaulle: \\\"It's by our pioneering creation that we have transformed a poor and arid land into a fertile land, created built-up areas, towns and villages in abandoned desert areas\\\".  Contrary to Ben-Gurion's assertion, it must be affirmed that during the 26 years of the British mandate over Palestine and for centuries previous, a productive human presence was to be found in all parts of the Negev desert - in the very arid hills and valleys of the southern Negev as well as in the more fertile north. These were the Bedouin Arabs.  The real desertification of the Negev, mainly in the southern part, occurred after Israel's dispossession of the Bedouin's cultivated lands and pastures. Nowadays, the majority of the 12,800 square-kilometer Negev, which represents 62 percent of the State of Israel (pre-1967 borders), has been desertified beyond recognition. The main new occupiers of the formerly Bedouin Negev are the Israeli army; the Nature Reserves Authority, whose chief role is to prevent Bedouin from roaming their former pasture lands; and vast industrial zones, including nuclear reactors and dumping grounds for chemical, nuclear and other wastes. Israeli Jews in the Negev today cultivate less than half the surface area cultivated by the Bedouin before 1948, and there is no Jewish pastoral activity.  I. Agricultural and pastoral activities of the Negev Bedouin before and after 1948 -------------------------------------------------- In 1942, according to British mandatory statistics, the Beersheba sub-district (which corresponds more or less to Israel's Negev, or Southern, district) had 52,000 inhabitants, almost all Bedouin Arabs, who held 11,500 camels, 6,000 cows and oxen, 42,000 sheep and 22,000 goats.  The majority of the Bedouin lived a more or less sedentary life in the north, where precipitation ranged between 200 and 350 mm per year. In 1944 they cultivated about 200,000 hectares of the Beersheba district - i.e. 16 percent of its total area and *more than double the area cultivated by the Negev's Jewish settlers after 40 years of \\\"making the desert bloom\\\"*  The Bedouin had a very low crop yield - 350 to 400 kilograms of barley per hectare during rainy years - and their farming techniques were primitive, but production was based solely on animal and human labor. It must also be underscored that animal production, although low, was based entirely on pasturing. Production increased considerably during the rainy years and diminished significantly during drought years. All Bedouin pasture animals - goats, camels and sheep - had the ability to gain weight quickly over the relatively rainy winters and to withstand many waterless days during the hot summers. These animals were the result of a centuries-old process of natural selection in harsh local conditions.  After the creation of the State of Israel, 80 percent of the Negev Bedouin were expelled to the Sinai or to Southern Jordan. The 10,000 who were allowed to remain were confined to a territory of 40,000 hectares in a region were annual mean precipiation was 150 mm - a quantity low enough to ensure a crop failure two years out of three. The rare water wells in the south and central Negev, spring of life in the desert, were cemented to prevent Bedouin shepherds from roaming.  A few Bedouin shepherds were allowed to stay in the central Negev. But after 1982, when the Sinai was returned to Egypt, these Bedouin were also eliminated. At the same time, strong pressure was applied on the Bedouin to abandon cultivation of their fields in order that the land could be transferred to the army.  No reliable statistics exist concerning the amount of land held today by Negev Bedouin. It is a known fact that a large part of the 40,000 hectares they cultivated in the 1950s has been seized by the Israeli authorities. Indeed, most of the Bedouin are now confined to seven \\\"development towns\\\", or *sowetos*, established for them.\",\"I'm working on an X11R5 application and have concerns regarding  standard colormaps.  these colormaps.\\\"  I wonder what window manager the writer had  in mind.  Neither twm or mwm seem to create standard colormaps.  Of course, one can use xstdcmap to create standard colormaps.   However, xstdcmap doesn't seem to try very hard to avoid  conflicts with the default colormap.  When I use standard  colormaps created by xstdcmap, the rest of my display goes black.   So it seems as if use of standard colormaps causes the very  problem standard colormaps are intended to avoid.  Perhaps  if every application used standard colormaps, things would  be wonderful.  But not many applications seem to use  standard colormaps.  Finally, the operation of the functions XmuGetColormapAllocation,  XmuStandardColormap, and XmuCreateColormap seem inconsistent  with the section 14.3 of the X11R5 XLIB documentation.      According to the section 14.3 of the X11R5 XLIB documentation (p. 436):      For GrayScale colormaps, only the colormap, red_max, red_mult, and      base_pixel members are defined.  The other members are ignored.       To compute a GrayScale pixel value, use the following expression:              (gray * red_mult + base_pixel) &0xFFFFFFFF      XmuGetColormapAllocation, defined in mit/lib/Xmu/CmapAlloc.c, is      used by XmuLookupStandardColormap, defined in mit/lib/Xmu/LookupCmap.c     to select red_max, green_max, and blue_max values for the      call to XmuStandardColormap.  When the RGB_GRAY_MAP property is      specified, XmuGetColormapAllocation sets red_max to 30% of the      total number of cells in the gray scale, sets green_max to 59%      of the total number, and sets blue_max ot 11% of the total number.     Referring to section 14.3, one would expect XmuGetColormapAllocation      to set red_max to the total number of cells in the gray scale.      When the RGB_GRAY_MAP property is specified, XmuStandardColormap,      defined in mit/lib/Xmu/StdCmap.c, sets red_mult, green_mult,      and blue_mult all equal to 1.  Referring to section 14.3,      one would expect green_mult and blue_mult to be ignored.\",\"For Sale 1988 Honda CBR600 (Hurricane).

I am working on a project for my marketing class and I'd like to ask your help.  The assignment is to come up with a product and create a marketing plan for it.  Technical issues are not terribly important at this point.  Well, my group's plan is to market a \\\"full page\\\" monitor for laptop computers.  It would be a third-party product to be installed by authorized repair centers (like Newer Technology's PaletteBook screen).  The idea is that the screen would fold in such a way that you would get twice the screen height of a normal screen (remember, technical issues aside!).  In fact, by adjusting the fold of the screen and the monitor configuration, you could have regular OR \\\"full\\\" height.  The screen would probably be monochrome. The motivation behind this is that laptop computers seem to be very popular among business people.  Business people also commonly use word processing and spreadsheet applications for which it is very convenient to see a large portion of the document.  Because of the target users and applications, color screens aren't really a neccessity.  We could hopefully keep the cost between $2000 and $3000.  Now, please don't write this off as completely ridiculous.  I really need some constructive feedback.  So, if you would, please reply to me via email and let me know: 1. If you would consider buying a \\\"full page\\\" laptop screen 2. How much you would be willing to pay for it 3. Any helpful commentaries on the idea  Also, if you take this idea and make a lot of money off it (doubtful, but who knows!), please send me some.

Naftaly  \",\"Since I was the one responsible for these divergent threads of approx. 40+ posts (going back to: The Braves could be better off if an injury happens), I may as well inject a little more fuel to the flame!  1)  Back at the beginning of Spring Training, I though Lopez would make the squad easily.  Olson was still recovering from his late-season injury (knee, I believe), and there were questions as to whether he would be able to play before June.  And then Berryhill was dinged up.  I was looking forward to this, because I believe that Lopez can hit AND field the position.  Before last season, he was the Braves \\\"Defensive Catcher\\\" prospect, while Brian Deak was the Braves \\\"Offensive Catcher\\\" prospect.  Besides, Olson and Berryhill couldn't hit their way out of a wet cardboard box, and don't walk enough to be useful.  But Olson recovered quickly, Berryhill recovered, and the Braves went with the two vets.  I still say that if one of those two had been down at the start of the season, he wouldn't have gotten his job back.  2)  There is a certain logic to keeping Olson and Berryhill around. After all, ML catchers are in short supply and suffer from wear and tear.  There are teams out there without ONE average ML catcher (California and Seattle come to mind).  Certainly, trying to move Olson or Berryhill through waivers would be unlikely to work. Plus, you'd have to eat that salary, which isn't huge, but isn't tiddleywinks either (I think Olson's at about $800,000, Berryhill at $450,000, but that's only what I recall).  3)  Yes, I think arbitration-eligibility may have a role to play in this also.  What is it, that 5/6 of the 2+year players aren't eligible for arbitration?   Only the 1/6 that were on the roster the longest are eligible?  Of course, the system may change, but the extent of that change is not yet known.  From a business standpoint, it may make sense to keep Lopez down until June/the first time Olson/Berryhill go on the DL.  4)  I am still disappointed that Lopez isn't on the team. I still prefer to think of myself as a fan when it comes to the Braves, and the truth is that I'd rather see our best team on the field, which, IMO, includes Lopez.  Of course,today we play the Cubs.  Hopefully, we won't need him. ;)  As for the Schuerholz/Cox conversation, I imagine it went like this:  (Remember, they've BOTH been GM's) (the following is not meant to be read by the humor-impaired)  Cox:  OK, we've sent Jones down.  His fielding could be a little smoother.  Besides, Blauser can hit OK and his fielding is better than it used to be.  Schuerholz:  Well, we'll have to send Nieves down too.  Deion just won't sign that baseball only contract.  We can't count on him in October, so we have to keep Nixon around for the defense.  Besides, Gorman's not ready to give up on Billy Hatcher yet.  Once Hatcher's gone AND Deion signs, we can move Nixon for Frankie Rodriguez.  That ought to give us some pitching depth in 1995.  Cox:  Yep, that'll be nice.  Too bad Deion won't sign. OK, I'll look for Nieves when Justice starts having Berry-Berry...er, back problems again.  Now, what about Klesko?  Schuerholz:  Well, we've still got to fork out another 1.5 mil for Bream.  If we keep Klesko, we either lose the money or Cabrera.  I keep dangling Sid in front of Dal Maxwell, but somehow he doesn't seem to be the same GM.  First Jeffries for Jose, and now Whiten for Clark!  If he gets rid of Brian Jordan, then I'd HAVE to believe that he and Whitey Herzog switched bodies at the Winter Meetings!  Cox:  OK, keep trying on Bream, and I'll wait til the trading deadline for my Hunter/Klesko platoon.  Maybe I can get a few extra at-bats for Cabrera while we wait.  Try California... if Snow starts slowly, maybe WhiteyDal will bite on Sid. And if that doesn't work, then perhaps Sid's knees could be \\\"persuaded\\\" to act up.  There's always the 15-day DL!  Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha!  Schuerholz:  What about Caraballo?  Cox:  Well, he's not that much better than Lemke.  Maybe if he starts in Richmond, he'll start walking more.  Besides, if he's going to be arbitration-eligible, better to stretch him out so that we actually get some value from him before he makes the big bucks.  Schuerholz:  Now, let's see.  That leaves Lopez.  Cox:  NOOOOO!  I gotta keep Lopez!  Sure, I didn't think Olson would recover this quickly.  Maybe I can talk Caminiti into running into him again?  Schuerholz:  Nope, Lopez has gotta go.  You know that he'll get $3 million in arbitration.  May as well put it off that one extra year.  Besides, until Olson's shown his stuff a little bit, I can't trade him.  Besides, Berryhill's a left-handed hitter.  You know how rare that is?  Cox:  Don't you mean a left-handed whiffer?  Pretty common, if you ask me.  I mean, he made Pat Borders look good in the World Series.  PAT BORDERS!!!  Schuerholz:  Hey, you're the one who wouldn't write Lopez into the lineup.  Cox:  Well, you're the one who went out and got me Jeff Reardon!  Besides, I thought Lopez wouldn't be used to our pitching staff's stuff.  He got some time with them this spring...looked pretty good.  Come on, surely we only need to keep one stiff behind the plate?  Schuerholz:  Yeah, but which stiff?  Whichever one we keep will be hurt by May.  Cox:  OK, OK, you made your point.  Keep them both.  Surely one of them will be on the DL by June at the latest.  Then I can call up Lopez, and then we can win 110 games!  The Pennant! THE WORLD SERIES!  I'll be up there with John McGraw!  Casey Stengel!  Earl Weaver!  Oh, they laughed at me in Toronto, but have you ever had to deal with George Bell?  I'll finally get my just reward!  Mwa-ha-ha-ha!  Schuerholz:  Easy, Bobby.  Have you been taking those \\\"happy pills\\\" left around by Chuck Tanner?  Why'd you ever hire that guy anyhow?

Fascist x-Soviet Armenian Government engaged in  disgusting cowardly massacres of Azeri women and children. I am really sorry if that fact bothers you.    More ridicule, I take it? Still not addressing the original points made.   Then what seems to be the problem? Did you ever read newspaper at all?   \\\"PAINFUL SEARCH ..\\\"  THE GRUESOME extent of February's killings of Azeris by Armenians in the town  of Hojali is at last emerging  in Azerbaijan - about 600 men,  women and  children dead  in the  worst outrage  of the four-year war over Nagorny Karabakh.  The figure  is drawn  from Azeri investigators,  Hojali officials and casualty lists published in the Baku press. Diplomats and aid workers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates.  The 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one of the last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full control of Nagorny Karabakh,  the subject of a new  round of negotiations in Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fighting retreat and  a massacre, but  investigators say that most  of the dead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was first suppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku. Later  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-stricken Azerbaijan's wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2,000 dead.  The State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov,  the cheif investigator of a 15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  \\\"Hojali Disaster\\\", said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum on preliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman Memmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed in the Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and more than 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700 dead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswoman of the Azeri Ministry of Defence.  FranCois Zen  Ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the International Red Cross  in Baku, said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of Agdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosque from  Hojali, most  of  them  civilians. \\\"We  did  not count  the bodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy,\\\" Mr Zen Ruffinen said. \\\"We have some idea since we gave the body bags and products to wash the dead.\\\"  Mr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the number of  dead in the  massacre. \\\"Don't  get worked up.  It will take  several months  to  get a  final  figure,\\\" the  43-year-old lawyer said at his small office.  Mr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years to reach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714 wounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist uprising in Baku in January 1990.  Those  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  power three weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly what  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70 miles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians.  Officially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, being the  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the republic's forensic department. \\\"This  is just a small percentage of the dead,\\\" said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic's chief forensic scientist. \\\"They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the chaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury our dead within 24 hours.\\\"  Of these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14 years old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 and axes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highland snows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs of deliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penises cut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov's report. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those believed to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said.  Files  from  Mr  Rasulov's  investigative  commission  are  still disorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, six policemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, the names of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. The most heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so far comes  from Towfiq  Manafov,  an Azeri  investigator  who took  a helicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  27 February.  \\\"There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to count properly: 470-500  in Hojali, 650-700 people  by the stream and the road and 85-100  visible around Nakhchivanik village,\\\" Mr Manafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter pilot.  \\\"People waved up  to us for help. We saw  three dead children and one  two-year-old alive  by  one  dead woman.  The  live one  was pulling at her arm for the mother to get up. We tried to land but Armenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had to return.\\\"  There  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  in circulation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last few months and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in Hojali at the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages taken over by Armenian forces.  THE INDEPENDENT, London, 12/6/'92   HEROES WHO FOUGHT ON AMID THE BODIES  AREF  SADIKOV sat  quietly  in the  shade of  a  cafe-bar on  the Caspian Sea  esplanade of Baku and  showed a line of  stitches in his trousers, torn  by an Armenian bullet as he  fled the town of Hojali just over three months ago, writes Hugh Pope.  \\\"I'm still  wearing the same  clothes, I don't have  any others,\\\" the  51-year-old carpenter  said,  beginning his  account of  the Hojali disaster. \\\"I was wounded in five places, but I am lucky to be alive.\\\"  Mr Sadikov and  his wife were short of  food, without electricity for more than a month, and cut off from helicopter flights for 12 days. They  sensed the  Armenian noose was tightening  around the 2,000 to  3,000 people left in  the straggling Azeri town  on the edge of Karabakh.  \\\"At about 11pm  a bombardment started such as we  had never heard before,  eight  or  nine   kinds  of  weapons,  artillery,  heavy machine-guns, the lot,\\\" Mr Sadikov said.  Soon neighbours were  pouring down the street  from the direction of  the  attack. Some  huddled  in  shelters but  others  started fleeing the town,  down a hill, through a stream  and through the snow into a forest on the other side.  To escape, the  townspeople had to reach the Azeri  town of Agdam about 15  miles away. They  thought they  were going to  make it, until at  about dawn  they reached a  bottleneck between  the two Armenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak.  \\\"None of my group was hurt up to then ... Then we were spotted by a  car on  the road,  and the  Armenian outposts  started opening fire,\\\" Mr Sadikov said.  Azeri militiamen fighting their way  out of Hojali rushed forward to force  open a  corridor for the  civilians, but  their efforts were mostly  in vain.  Mr Sadikov  said only  10 people  from his group of  80 made it  through, including his wife  and militiaman son.  Seven  of  his  immediate  relations  died,  including  his 67-year-old elder brother.  \\\"I only had time to reach down  and cover his face with his hat,\\\" he said, pulling his own big  flat Turkish cap over his eyes. \\\"We have never got any of the bodies back.\\\"  The first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire. One hero  of the  evacuation, Alif  Hajief, was  shot dead  as he struggled to change  a magazine while covering  the third group's crossing, Mr Sadikov said.  Another hero,  Elman Memmedov, the  mayor of Hojali, said  he and several others  spent the whole day  of 26 February in  the bushy hillside, surrounded by  dead bodies as they tried  to keep three Armenian armoured personnel carriers at bay.  As the  survivors staggered the  last mile into Agdam,  there was little comfort  in a town from  which most of the  population was soon to flee.  \\\"The night  after we reached  the town  there was a  big Armenian rocket attack. Some people just  kept going,\\\" Mr Sadikov said. \\\"I had to  get to the  hospital for treatment. I  was in a  bad way. They even found a bullet in my sock.\\\"  Victims of  war: An  Azeri woman  mourns her  son, killed  in the Hojali massacre in February  (left).

Save your almost maniacal devotion to the almighty      plus/minus ... it is the most misleading hockey stat available.       Until the NHL publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice      time per game and some measure of its \\\"quality\\\" (i.e., is the player put out      in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game; is he matched up      against the other team's top one or two lines; short-handed, etc), I would      much rather see the +/- disappear altogether instead of having its dubious      merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications.  Thank you for posting this.  As the person who first brought up the fact that Jagr has a much higher +/- than Francis, I can assure you that I brought it up as an example of the absurdity of +/- comparisons, even on the same team.  I never, ever thought that anyone would argue that Jagr's higher +/- actually reflected better two-way play.  In my opinion, Francis's low +/- is purely a result of him being asked to play against opponents top scorers at all times; the fact that he can chip in 100 points while neutralizing the other team's top center is a testament to how valuable he is, even if his +/- suffers.  On the other hand, Jagr, for how big, fast and skilled he is, can't even get 90 points, no matter how inflated his +/- is.  (By the way, don't get me wrong -- I like Jagr.  He may be a lazy floater, but he turns it on at exactly the right times -- like overtime of playoff games). \",\"   The 5426 has its own set of drivers.

It was largely the mainstream Christian's disgust #at such practices as polygamy which resulted in their irrational hatred.  True, but that is exactly the \\\"problem\\\": the Mormon extermination order was issued not just by a Christian, it was ALLOWED under the Constitution of the United States, which was instituted precisely to prevent incidents like this \\\"order\\\" from occurring in the first place...  As I indicated in an earlier posting, your \\\"irrational hatred\\\" is clearly evidenced by individuals like Robert Weiss (who could have been Gov. Boggs' Lieutenant; he would have fitted right in, drewling et al), and seems a modern-day occurrence, based on results (slander, persecution, misrepresentation, lies, denying Mormons representation in their own user group, etc. etc.  In intent and purpose, what really has changed?  #The situation is not entirely different today.  Many irrational feelings #and beliefs are justified through religion.  I don't think most of them #are started because of religion, but religion certainly helps justify and #perpetuate prejudices and practices by providing a neat justification #which discourages critical thought.  True, as evidenced by numerous examples, as I am sure you're aware.  #>In any regard, Mormon history alone indicates that secular authorities (and #>I don't even discuss how Uthan's were suckered into allowing part of their #>lands in becoming nerve-gas and atomic bomb testing grounds...) is far from #>being trusted or righteous.

What I mean is that secular authorities are to be watched, as we believe that Satan has been given some power and dominion over the earth to divert truth, judgment, and justice.  In addition, we believe that the adversary has power to influence the unjust and idolatrous (greed for money would be a good example) in order to bring about persecution, war, oppression, and evil combinations.  As an intelligent being, don't you suppose that the destroyer would yield his influence foremost on those with political power?

Boggs et al.) may be out to harm and destroy us.

I would echo that question.  I'm not trying to be    contentious.  But assuming that the Pope has universal jurisdiction    and authority, what authority do you rely upon for your decisions?    What prevents me from choosing ANY doctrine I like and saying that    Papal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time?    This is especially true, since Councils of Bishops have basically    stood by the Pope.  The ultimate question is the traditional theology of the Church.  This is the *only* thing that it is possible to resist a Pope for: his departure from the traditional doctrine of the Church.  If commands from *any* authority conflict with Tradition, the commands must be disobeyed.  My own view on this is that this conflict could only happen in a major way.  God would never allow a hair-splitting situation to develop; it would be too complex for people to figure out.  I don't view the present situation in the Church as anything extremely complicated. Run through a list of what has happened in the last 30 years in the Catholic Church, and any impartial observer will be aghast.     It appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter is    disagreements over what is tradition and Tradition, and also over    authority and discipline.    The problems stem from a general widespread ignorance of the Catholic Faith, in my opinion.  Most Catholics know about zilch about the Catholic Faith; this leaves them wide open for destruction by erring bishops.  It's basically the Reformation part II.  There is not even a question in my mind that in some respects the shards of the Catholic Church are currently being trampled upon by the Catholic hierarchy.  I could go on listing shocking things for an hour, probably.  Take the situation in Campos, Brazil, for example.  I'm reading a book on what happened there after Vatican Council II.  The bishop, Antonio de Castro-Mayer, never introduced all the changes that followed in the wake of Vatican II.  He kept the traditional Mass, the same old catechisms, etc.  He made sure the people knew their faith, the Catholic theology of obedience, what Modernism was, etc.  He innoculated the people against what was coming.  Well, one day the order came from Rome for his retirement.  It came when the Pope was sick.  Bishop de Castro-Mayer waited until the Pope recovered, then inquired whether this command was what the Pope really wanted, or something that some Liberal had commanded in his absence. The Pope confirmed the decision.  So the good bishop retired.  The injustice that followed was completely incredible.  A new bishop was installed.  He proceeded to expel most of bishop de Castro-Mayer's clergy from their churches, because they refused to celebrate the New Mass.  The new bishop would visit a parish, and celebrate a New Mass. The people would promptly walk out of the church en masse.  The bishop was *enraged* by this.  He usually resorted to enlisting the help of the secular authorities to eject the priest from the church.  The priests would just start building new churches; the people were completely behind them.  The old parishes had the New Mass, as the bishop desired -- and virtually no parishioners.  The prime motivation for all this was completely illegal, according to canon law.  No priest can be penalized in any way for saying the traditional Mass, because of legislation enacted by Pope Saint Pius V. Nor is there any obligation to say the New Mass.  During all this process, the people of Campos, not just private individuals, but including civil authorities, were constantly sending petitions and letters to Rome to do something about the new Modernist bishop.  NOTHING was ever done; no help ever arrived from Rome. Eventually 37 priests were kicked out, and about 40,000 people.     My question to the supporters of SSPX is this:    Is there ANY way that your positions with respect to church reforms   could change and be conformed to those of the Pope? (assuming that   the Pope's position does not change and that the leaders of SSPX   don't jointly make such  choice.)     If not, this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority.    If I adopt the view that \\\"I'm NOT wrong, I CAN'T be wrong, and    there's NO WAY I'll change my mind, YOU must change yours\\\", that    I've either left the Catholic Church or it has left me.  If the Pope defines certain things ex cathedra, that would be the end of the controversy.  That process is all very well understood in Catholic theology, and anyone who doesn't go along with it is an instant non-Catholic.  The problem here is that people do not appreciate what is going on in the Catholic world.  If they knew the Faith, and what our bishops are doing, they would be shocked!     We sould argue from now until the Second Coming about what the \\\"real\\\"    traditional teaching of the Church is.  If this were a simple matter    East and West would not have been separated for over 900 years.  This isn't the case in the Catholic Church.  There is a massive body of traditional teaching.  The Popes of the last 150 years are especially relevant.  There is no question at all what the traditional doctrine is.     I thought that the teaching magisterieum of the church did not allow    error in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term.`    I may be wrong here, I'm not Roman Catholic. :-)  That's heresy, more or less.  Although they have done a great job since the Reformation, the last 30 years have seen so many errors spread that it's pitiful.  Infallibility rests in the Pope, and in the Church as a whole.  In the short term, a Pope, or large sections of the Church can go astray.  In fact, that's what usually happens during a major heresy: large sections of the Church go astray.  (The Pope historically has been much more reliable.)  Everything will always come back in the long run.     What would be the effect of a Pope making an ex cathedra statement    regarding the SSPX situation?  Would it be honored?  If not, how    do you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility?    Again, I'm not trying to be contentions, I'm trying to understand.    Since I'm Orthodox, I've got no real vested interest in the outcome,    one way or the other.  Yes, it would be honored.  Infallibility is infallibility.  But what is he going to define?  That the New Mass is a better expression of the Catholic Faith than the old?  That sex education in the Catholic schools is wonderful?  That all religions are wonderful except for that professed by the Popes prior to Vatican II?     It does if the command was legitimate.  SSPX does not view the    Pope's commands as legitimate.  Why?  This is a VERY slippery slope.\",\" It is interesting that you posted those lyrics, because just the other day I was thinking of doing the same.

It (this FAQ, not RIPEM) was written and will be maintained by Marc VanHeyningen <mvanheyn@cs.indiana.edu>.  It will be posted to a variety of newsgroups on a monthly basis; follow-up discussion specific to RIPEM is redirected to the group alt.security.ripem.  WHAT'S NEW ---------- I am now running a World Wide Web archive of RIPEM information.  It does not contain much of anything that isn't available elsewhere, but it has convenient pointers to the most current version of this FAQ and some other stuff.  The URL is \\\"http://cs.indiana.edu/ripem/dir.html\\\".  This month's version has a fair amount of new pointers to information on patents and stuff like that.  I've also reordered a few things to have a more sensible ordering.  I hope I don't have to edit this again soon. :-)  DISCLAIMER ---------- Nothing in this FAQ should be considered legal advice, or anything other than one layperson's opinion.  If you want real legal advice, talk to a real lawyer, preferably one with experience in patent law, export regulations, or whatever area of law is in question.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ---------------------  1)  What is RIPEM?   RIPEM is a (not yet complete, but useful) implementation of Privacy  Enhanced Mail (PEM).  RIPEM allows your electronic mail to have the  four security facilities provided by PEM: disclosure protection  (optional), originator authenticity, message integrity measures, and  non-repudiation of origin (always).  (See: \\\"What is PEM?\\\")   RIPEM was written primarily by Mark Riordan <mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu>.  Most of the code is in the public domain, except for the RSA routines,  which are a library called RSAREF licensed from RSA Data Security Inc.   The current version of RIPEM is 1.0.5; the current version of the  Macintosh port of RIPEM is 0.7.  2)  How can I get RIPEM?   RIPEM uses the library of cryptographic routines RSAREF, which is  considered munitions and thus is export-restricted from distribution  to persons who are not citizens or permanent residents in the U.S or  Canada without an export license.  No such license has been obtained  (nor would one likely be granted unless the RSA key exchange were  shortened to 512 bits and the symmetric cipher changed to something  weaker than DES.  There are some suggestions that this situation may  change now that Clinton is in office.)  The author requests in the  README file that this law not be violated:   #Please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution  #outside of the USA or Canada.  This is a personal request from me,  #the author of RIPEM, and a condition of your use of RIPEM.   Note that RSAREF is not in the public domain, and a license for it is  included with the distribution.  You should read it before using  RIPEM.   RIPEM is available via anonymous FTP to citizens and permanent  residents in the U.S. from rsa.com; cd to rsaref/ and read the README  file for info.  Note that the non-RSAREF portion of RIPEM is not a  product of RSA Data Security, Incorporated; they merely are helping  distribute it.   RIPEM, as well as some other crypt stuff, has its \\\"home site\\\" on  ripem.msu.edu, which is open to non-anonymous FTP for users in the  U.S. and Canada who are citizens or permanent residents.  To find out  how to obtain access, FTP there, cd to pub/crypt/, and read the file  GETTING_ACCESS.  For convenience, binaries for many architectures are  available here in addition to the full source tree.  3)  Will RIPEM run on my machine?   Probably.  It has already been ported to MS-DOS and most flavors of  Unix (SunOS, NeXT, Linux, AIX, ULTRIX, Solaris, etc.)  Ports to  Macintosh include a standard UNIX-style port and a rather nice  Mac-like port written by Raymond Lau, author of StuffIt.  More ports  are expected, and help of users is invited.  4)  Will RIPEM work with my mailer?   Probably.  How easy and clean the effective interface is will depend  on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer, though.  The users  guide, included with the distribution, discusses ways to use RIPEM  with many popular mailers, including Berkeley, mush, Elm, and MH.  Code is also included in elisp to allow easy use of RIPEM inside GNU  Emacs.   If you make a new interface for RIPEM or create an improvement on one  in the distribution which you believe is convenient to use, secure,  and may be useful to others, feel free to post it to alt.security.ripem.  5)  What is RSA?   RSA is a crypto system which is asymmetric, or public-key.  This means  that there are two different, related keys: one to encrypt and one to  decrypt.  Because one cannot (reasonably) be derived from the other,  you may publish your encryption, or public, key widely and keep your  decryption, or private, key to yourself.  Anyone can use your public  key to encrypt a message, but only you hold the private key needed to  decrypt it.  Note that the \\\"message\\\" sent with RSA is normally just  the DES key to the real plaintext. (See \\\"What is DES?\\\")   Note that the above only provides for disclosure protection.  For  originator authenticity, message integrity, and non-repudiation of  origin services to be implemented, the fingerprint of the message  (See \\\"What is a fingerprint, like MD5?\\\") is encrypted with the  sender's private key.  The recipient, or a dispute-resolving  authority, can use the sender's public key to decrypt it and confirm  that the message must have come from the sender and was not altered.   RSA was named for the three men (Rivest, Shamir and Adleman) who  invented it.  To find out lots more about RSA and modern cryptography  in general, ftp to rsa.com and look in pub/faq/.  Some information  also may be in sci.crypt.  6)  What is DES?   DES is the Data Encryption Standard, a widely used symmetric, or  secret-key, crypto system.  Unlike RSA, DES uses the same key to  encrypt and decrypt messages.  However, DES is much faster than RSA.   RIPEM uses both DES and RSA; it generates a random key and encrypts  your mail with DES using that key.  It then encrypts that key with the  recipient's public RSA key and includes the result in the letter,  allowing the recipient to recover the DES key.   DES is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a  key length considered too short by modern standards.  However, it  should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large  corporation or government agency.  It is not likely that the PEM  standard will incorporate support for other symmetric ciphers in the  near future, because there is a strong feeling that PEM should be  stable so it can become utilized widely without early problems with  interoperability.  7)  What is a fingerprint, like MD5?   MD5 is a message digest algorithm produced by RSA Data Security Inc.  It provides a 128-bit fingerprint, or cryptographically secure hash,  of the plaintext.  It is cryptographically secure because it is not  possible (in a reasonable amount of computation) to produce a  different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint.  Thus,  instead of signing the entire message with the sender's private key,  only the MD5 of the message needs to be signed for authentication.   MD5s can also be exchanged directly for authentication; for example,  RIPEM public keys include an MD5 of the public key in the file, so  parties wishing to confirm their keys are authentic via a separate  channel merely need exchange MD5s of keys and verify their accuracy.   MD5 is sometimes used for other purposes; for example, it is often  used to map an input of arbitrary length to 128 bits of data, as a  passphrase interpreter or cookie generator.   MD5 is described in its entirety (including an implementation in C) in  RFC 1321.   There have been some recent suggestions that MD5 may not be as strong  a hash as was originally believed; presumably some other hash  function will be used if this is accepted as true.  8)  What is PEM?   PEM is Privacy Enhanced Mail, a standard for allowing transfer of  encrypted electronic mail generated over a long period of time by a  working group of experts.  It is described in RFCs 1421-1424; these  documents have been approved and obsolete the old RFCs 1113-1115.   RIPEM is not really a complete implementation of PEM, because PEM  specifies certificates for authenticating keys, which RIPEM does not  handle at this time.  Their addition is planned.  9)  What's this about distributing and authenticating keys?   For a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you, she must know  your public key.  For you to be able to confirm that the message  received came from her, you must know her public key.  It is important  that this information be accurate; if a \\\"bad guy\\\" convinces her that  his key is in fact yours, she will send messages which he can read.   RIPEM allows for three methods of key management: a central server,  the distributed finger servers, and a flat file.  All three are  described in the RIPEM users guide which is part of the distribution.  None of them provide perfect security.  The PEM standard calls for  key management by certificates; the addition of this feature to RIPEM  is planned, but chicken-egg issues still exist.  10)  Isn't it a bad idea to use patented algorithms in standards like PEM?   This issue has been considered in the standards process.  RFC 1310,  the specification for Internet standards, has a discussion (section  6) on what specifications for nondiscriminatory availability must be  met for a patented method to be included in a standard.  RFC 1421  addresses this issue with regard to the patents covering public-key  cryptography.   This does not, of course, mean that all questions are settled or that  everyone is in agreement.  An interesting exchange on the use of  patented algorithms in standards with regard to public-key  cryptography is in the League for Programming Freedom archive  (available via FTP: ftp.uu.net:/doc/lpf) in the files bidzos.letter  and bidzos.response.  (Amusingly, the LPF files on ftp.uu.net are  compressed with a patented algorithm.)  11)  What about RSADSI/PKP?   RSA Data Security, Inc. (RSADSI) is a California-based company  specializing in cryptographic technologies.  Public Key Partners is a  firm which holds exclusive sub-licensing rights of the following U.S.  patents and all of their corresponding foreign patents:        Cryptographic Apparatus and Method       (\\\"Diffie-Hellman\\\")............................... No. 4,200,770        Public Key Cryptographic Apparatus       and Method (\\\"Hellman-Merkle\\\").................... No. 4,218,582        Cryptographic Communications System and       Method (\\\"RSA\\\")................................... No. 4,405,829        Exponential Cryptographic Apparatus       and Method (\\\"Hellman-Pohlig\\\").................... No. 4,424,414   PKP claims these four patents cover all known methods of public key  cryptography.  The two businesses are rather closely related (for  example, the same person, Jim Bidzos, is president of both of them.)  PKP has licensed this technology to a considerable number of  companies (IBM, DEC, Motorola, AT&T, Lotus...) for use in their  products.  PKP has also threatened and filed lawsuits defending their  patents.   RIPEM was originally created with no connection to RSADSI other than  its use of the RSAREF library, and for no reason other than its  author's desire to see widespread use of public-key cryptography.  However, after the ball started rolling, people at RSADSI got  interested.  RSADSI decided to carry RIPEM on its FTP site, and some  people there started making their own RIPEM keys and contributing  code.  RIPEM even won the \\\"Best Application Built on RSAREF in 1992\\\"  award.  12)  Why do all RIPEM public keys look very similar?   RIPEM public keys begin with a PKCS (Public-Key Cryptography  Standards) identifier describing various characteristics about the  key, so the first bunch of characters in your key may be the same as  those of lots of other people's keys.  This does not mean your keys  are similar, but only that they are the same class of key, were  generated with the same program, are of the same length, etc.  13)  What is PGP?   PGP is another cryptographic mail program called Pretty Good Privacy.  PGP has been around longer than RIPEM, and works somewhat differently.  PGP is not compatible with RIPEM in any way, though PGP does also use RSA.   A few major differences between PGP and RIPEM:   - PGP has more key management features, particularly for users without    a direct network connection.   - RIPEM conforms to the PEM RFCs and thus has a greater probability    of working with other PEM software.  PGP makes no attempt to be    compatible with anything other than itself.   - RIPEM uses RSAREF, a library of RSA routines from RSADSI which    comes with a license allowing noncommercial use.  PGP uses its own    implementation of RSA.  PKP claims that it is a violation of its    patents to \\\"make, use or sell\\\" PGP in the U.S. or Canada without    either a license or written permission.  (See: \\\"DISCLAIMER\\\")    (See: \\\"What about RSADSI/PKP?\\\")  Phil Zimmermann, the author of    PGP, stopped distributing it after being threatened with legal    action; he believed that a licensing scheme could be arranged, but    it hasn't happened and there seems little prospect of it happening    in the future.  He acknowledges in the PGP User's Guide:     #In fact, if you live in the USA, and you are not a Federal agency,     #you shouldn't actually run PGP on your computer, because Public    #Key Partners wants to forbid you from running my software.  PGP is    #contraband.   - Both PGP and RIPEM are export-restricted, and cannot be sent outside    the U.S. and Canada without an export license.  However, PGP    already exists on many ftp sites in Europe and other places.   Whether you use PGP or RIPEM or whatever, the documentation to PGP is  recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues.  Unfortunately, it's not distributed separately from the program,  which can be difficult to find in the U.S. on FTP sites due to  liability concerns.  14)  What about RPEM?   RPEM stands for Rabin Privacy Enhanced Mail.  It was similar to RIPEM,  but used a public-key cipher invented by Rabin (which is not RSA) in  an attempt to avoid the patents on public-key systems.  It was  written by Mark Riordan, who later wrote RIPEM.   Its distribution was halted when, contrary to the beliefs of many  (including Rabin), PKP claimed that their patents were broad enough  to cover the cipher employed.  This claim is not universally  accepted, but was not challenged for pragmatic reasons.   RPEM is not really used anymore.  It is not compatible with RIPEM or PGP.  15)  What is MIME?   MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, and is  described in RFC 1341.  You can find out about it in the newsgroup  comp.mail.mime; a FAQ exists on it.  How PEM should interact with  MIME is not yet entirely clear; some people use the stopgap solution  of having a MIME type application/x-ripem in order to send RIPEM  messages as MIME ones.  I hope some standards will emerge.  Draft  Internet documents exist on the matter.  16)  What is TIS/PEM?   Trusted Information Systems is working on a version of Privacy  Enhanced Mail for general availability.  Last I heard, it was  rumored to be integrated into an existing mail user agent (MH)  rather than a stand-alone system, and in beta test.  I don't know  much more than that.  17)  I have this simple way to defeat the security of RIPEM...\",\"dwight tuinstra posts a very interesting message in which he comments on the effects of the Clipper chip on state and local police. Actually, reading between the lines, it could be a very good thing for civil liberties in one respect, since it will at least prevent cowboy cops and cowboy state and local agancies from reading your traffic if they tap it illegally.  There has been extensive discussion in the eff forum, for example, about inadmissible taps being used to develop information that could then lead to admissible evidence.

It (this FAQ, not RIPEM) was written and will be maintained by Marc VanHeyningen, <mvanheyn@whale.cs.indiana.edu>.  It will be posted to a variety of newsgroups on a monthly basis; follow-up discussion specific to RIPEM is redirected to the group alt.security.ripem.  This month, I have reformatted this posting in an attempt to comply with the standards for HyperText FAQ formatting to allow easy manipulation of this document over the World Wide Web.  Let me know what you think.  DISCLAIMER ---------- Nothing in this FAQ should be considered legal advice, or anything other than one person's opinion.  If you want real legal advice, talk to a real lawyer.  QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ---------------------  1)  What is RIPEM?   RIPEM is a program which performs Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) using  the cryptographic techniques of RSA and DES.  It allows your  electronic mail to have the properties of authentication (i.e. who  sent it can be confirmed) and privacy (i.e. nobody can read it except  the intended recipient.)   RIPEM was written primarily by Mark Riordan <mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu>.  Most of the code is in the public domain, except for the RSA routines,  which are a library called RSAREF licensed from RSA Data Security Inc.  2)  How can I get RIPEM?   RIPEM contains the library of cryptographic routines RSAREF, which is  considered munitions and thus is export-restricted from distribution  to people who are not citizens or permanent residents of the U.S. or  Canada.  Therefore, the following request is quoted from the README  file:   #Please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution  #outside of the USA or Canada.  This is a personal request from me,  #the author of RIPEM, and a condition of your use of RIPEM.   Note that RSAREF is not in the public domain, and a license for it is  included with the distribution.  You should read it before using  RIPEM.   The best way to get it is to ask a friend for a copy, since this will  reduce the load on those sites that do carry it (not to mention the  humans that run them.)  Naturally this requires that you trust the  friend.   RIPEM is available via anonymous FTP to citizens and permanent residents  in the U.S. from rsa.com; cd to rsaref/ and read the README file for  info.  Last I looked, this site contains only the source tree, and  does not contain compiled binaries or the nice Mac version.   RIPEM, as well as some other crypt stuff, has its \\\"home site\\\" on  rpub.cl.msu.edu, which is open to non-anonymous FTP for users in the  U.S. and Canada who are citizens or permanent residents.  To find out  how to obtain access, ftp there, cd to pub/crypt/, and read the file  GETTING_ACCESS.  For convenience, binaries for many architectures are  available here in addition to the full source tree.  3)  Will RIPEM run on my machine?   Probably.  It has already been ported to MS-DOS and most flavors of  Unix (SunOS, NeXT, Linux, AIX, ULTRIX, Solaris, etc.)  Ports to  Macintosh include a standard UNIX-style port and a rather nice  Mac-like port written by Raymond Lau, author of StuffIt.  More ports  are expected, and help of users is invited.  4)  Will RIPEM work with my mailer?   Probably.  How easy and clean the effective interface is will depend  on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer, though.  The users  guide, included with the distribution, discusses ways to use RIPEM  with many popular mailers, including Berkeley, mush, Elm, and MH.  Code is also included in elisp to allow easy use of RIPEM inside GNU  Emacs.   If you make a new interface for RIPEM or create an improvement on one  in the distribution which you believe is convenient to use, secure,  and may be useful to others, feel free to post it to alt.security.ripem.  5)  What is RSA?   RSA is a crypto system which is asymmetric, or public-key.  This means  that there are two different, related keys: one to encrypt and one to  decrypt.  Because one cannot (reasonably) be derived from the other,  you may publish your encryption, or public key widely and keep your  decryption, or private key to yourself.  Anyone can use your public  key to encrypt a message, but only you hold the private key needed to  decrypt it.  (Note that the \\\"message\\\" sent with RSA is normally just  the DES key to the real message. (See \\\"What is DES?\\\")   Note that the above only provides for privacy.  For authentication,  the fingerprint of the message (See \\\"What is a fingerprint, like  MD5?\\\") is encrypted with the sender's private key.  The recipient can  use the sender's public key to decrypt it and confirm that the message  must have come from the sender.   RSA was named for the three men (Rivest, Shamir and Adleman) who  invented it.  To find out more about RSA, ftp to rsa.com and look in  pub/faq/ or look in sci.crypt.  6)  What is DES?   DES is the Data Encryption Standard, a widely used symmetric, or  secret-key, crypto system.  Unlike RSA, DES uses the same key to  encrypt and decrypt messages.  However, DES is much faster than RSA.   RIPEM uses both DES and RSA; it generates a random key and encrypts  your mail with DES using that key.  It then encrypts that key with the  recipient's public RSA key and includes the result in the letter,  allowing the recipient to recover the DES key.   DES is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a  key length considered too short by modern standards.  However, it  should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large  corporation or government agency.  It is not unlikely that future  RIPEMs will strengthen the symmetric cipher, possibly by using  multiple encryption with DES.  7)  What is PEM, and how does RIPEM relate?   PEM is Privacy Enhanced Mail, a system for allowing easy transfer of  encrypted electronic mail.  It is described in RFCs 1421-1424; these  documents have been approved and obsolete the old RFCs 1113-1115.   RIPEM is not really a complete implementation of PEM, because PEM  specifies certificates for authenticating keys, which RIPEM does not  handle at this time.  Their addition is planned.  8)  What's this about distributing and authenticating keys?   For a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you, she must know  your public key.  For you to be able to confirm that the message  received came from her, you must know her public key.  It is important  that this information be accurate; if a \\\"bad guy\\\" convinces her that  his key is in fact yours, she will send messages which he can read.   RIPEM allows for three methods of key management: a central server,  the distributed finger servers, and a flat file.  All three are  described in the RIPEM users guide which is part of the distribution.  None of them provide perfect security.  9)  Why do all RIPEM public keys look very similar?   RIPEM public keys begin with a PKCS identifier describing various  characteristics about the key, so the first bunch of characters in  your key may be the same as those of lots of other people's keys.  This does not mean your keys are similar, but only that they are the  same class of key, were generated with the same program, are of the  same length, etc.  10)  What is a fingerprint, like MD5?   MD5 is a message digest algorithm produced by RSA Data Security Inc.  It provides a 128-bit fingerprint, or cryptographically secure hash,  of the plaintext.  It is cryptographically secure because it is not  possible (in a reasonable amount of computation) to produce a  different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint.  Thus,  instead of signing the entire message with the sender's private key,  only the MD5 of the message needs to be signed for authentication.   MD5 is sometimes used for other purposes; for example, it is often  used to map an input of arbitrary length to 128 bits of data, as a  passphrase interpreter or cookie generator.   MD5 is described in its entirety (including an implementation in C) in  RFC 1321.  11)  What is PGP?   PGP is another cryptographic mail program called Pretty Good Privacy.  PGP has been around longer than RIPEM, and works somewhat differently.  PGP is not compatible with RIPEM in any way, though PGP does also use RSA.   Some major differences between PGP and RIPEM:   - PGP has more key management features, particularly for users without    a direct network connection.   - RIPEM conforms to the PEM RFCs and thus has a greater probability of    working with other PEM software.  PGP makes no attempt to be compatible    with anything other than PGP (in fact, PGP 1.0 is not compatible with    PGP 2.0.)   - RIPEM uses RSAREF, a library of RSA routines from RSA Data Security    Inc.  RSAREF comes with a license which allows noncommercial use.    PGP uses its own implementation of RSA which is not licensed; thus,    PKP, the firm holding the U.S. patents on the RSA algorithm, claims    that it is a infringement of that patent to make, use or sell PGP in    the U.S. or Canada.  In acknowledgement of this, PGP's original    author, Phil Zimmermann, says in the documentation:     #In fact, if you live in the USA, and you are not a Federal agency,     #you shouldn't actually run PGP on your computer, because Public    #Key Partners wants to forbid you from running my software.  PGP is    #contraband.     - Both PGP and RIPEM are export-restricted, and cannot be sent outside    the U.S. and Canada.  However, PGP already exists on many ftp sites    in Europe and other places.   Whether you use PGP or RIPEM or whatever, the documentation to PGP is  recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues.   Note that the above facts, both regarding patent and export  restrictions, are somewhat controversial; many people think it  shouldn't be that way, and some people interpret various documents  differently.  Unfortunately, discussions of it on the net inevitably  seem to produce more heat than light, and probably belong in  misc.legal.computing.  (See:  \\\"DISCLAIMER\\\")  12)  What about RPEM?   RPEM stands for Rabin Privacy Enhanced Mail.  It was similar to RIPEM,  but used a public-key cipher invented by Rabin (which is not RSA) in  an attempt to avoid the patent on RSA.  It was written by Mark  Riordan, the same author as RIPEM.   Its distribution was halted when, contrary to the beliefs of many  (including Rabin), Public Key Partners (PKP) claimed that their patent  was broad enough to cover any public-key cipher whose strength rested  in the difficulty of factoring products of large primes, not just RSA.  This claim is not universally accepted by any means, but was not  challenged for pragmatic reasons.   RPEM is not really used anymore.  It is not compatible with RIPEM or PGP.  13)  What is MIME?   MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, and is  described in RFC 1341.  You can find out about it in the newsgroup  comp.mail.mime.

I installed the newest drivers from Asante's ftp server.  The problem begins when I attach one more device to the SCSI chain - specifically a 50MB drive. I power up the drive, then the Mac. The Mac tests memory, etc. Just before the \\\"happy Mac face\\\" normally shows up, the power light on the EN/SC goes out, and the boot process stops. So I can use the network, or the external drive, but not both at once. This makes the Asante box pretty much unusable.  It doesn't look like a purely electrical SCSI problem, because if I turn on the drive just a second or so too late, so that it doesn't get noticed during the initial SCSI polling, the Mac boots normally and the adapter works, even though the hard disk is powered on and connected. The Mac has *never* once failed to boot from its internal drive up to now (and I've had it for over a year).  Here is what I tried: changing the SCSI ID's of the EN/SC and the disk -- several permutations; changing the order of devices, i.e. the EN/SC at the head or tail of the chain; overterminating with an external terminator (both devices have internal ones); underterminating, i.e. removing internal resistors from the hard disk; trying another EN/SC box; trying another identical drive; trying several different SCSI cables.

The older models are VERY well built. Unless Toyota lost its mind, I would assume, until  proven otherwise, that the newer models have inherited some if not all of the qualities of their ancestors.  Two major differences in the running gear (that I'm aware of) need study. My '79 has a solid front axle housing whereas the newer models have independant front suspension. The solid axle is theoretically stronger and more reliable than the newer model, but only experience will tell. The independant front suspension is, no doubt, a compromise made to satisfy the typical user, who will never need a real utility vehicle. The second difference is the type of transfer case used on the newer models. I'm not sure, but I think Tioyota went to a full-time 4WD or all-wheel drive system.

Most of the Flames neglected to show up, especially in their own zone, as the Kings hit at least five posts! The Flames best line was probably Skrudland-Paslawski-Berube (which tells how bad the Flames were). Gary Suter scored a great goal (in fact all three Flame goals were scored by D-men - Yawney and Dahlquist getting the others), but also made some bonehead plays. For the Kings, Pat Conacher was especially impressive.   The games was VERY chippy, as Dan Mirouelli lost control early and never recovered it; there were high-sticks, cross-checks, punches, hits from behind. Fleury got a game misconduct for rubbing out Warren Rychel from behind. Flames dominated the game physically, but failed to take advantage due to horrendous defensive lapses (I don't think Vernon can be blamed for any of the goals). Calgary went with 7 D-men, as Roger Johansson played LW; he looked lost IMHO - I hope King inserts Chris Lindbergh, Paul Kruse, or Sergei Makarov for Wednesday's game.

At first, the news media seemed entranced by all the new gizmos the military was using, not to mention the taped video transmissions from the missiles as they zeroed in on their targets.  But later, and especially after the bunker full of civilians was hit, they changed their tone.  It seemed to me that they didn't have the stomach for the reality of war, that innocent people really do die and are maimed in warfare.  It's like they were only pro-Gulf-War as long as it was \\\"nice and clean\\\" (smart missiles dropping in on military HQs), but not when pictures of dead, dying, and maimed civilians started cropping up.  What naive hypocrites!   [ discussion about blanket-bombing and A-bombs deleted.]                             ^^^^^^^^^  I should have said here \\\"militarily justified\\\".  It seems from your comments below that you understood this as meaning \\\"morally justified\\\". I apologize.   I have often wondered about this.  I've always thought that the first bomb should have been dropped on Japan's island fortress of Truk.  A good, inpenatrable military target.  The second bomb could've been held back for use on an industrial center if need be.  But I digress.  Yes, I have heard that we found evidence (after the war, BTW) that Japan was seriously considering surrender after the first bomb.  Unfortunately, the military junta won out over the moderates and rejected the US's ulimatum.  Therefore the second bomb was dropped.  Most unfortunate, IMO.   I don't regret the fact that sometimes military decisions have to be made which affect the lives of innocent people.  But I do regret the  circumstances which make those decisions necessary, and I regret the suffering caused by those decisions.    [...]   Actually, it was the fact that both situations existed that prompted US and allied action.  If some back-water country took over some other back-water country, we probably wouldn't intervene.  Not that we don't care, but we can't be the world's policman.  Or if a coup had occured in Kuwait (instead of an invasion), then we still wouldn't have acted because there would not have been the imminent danger perceived to Saudi Arabia.  But the combination of the two, an unprovoked invasion by a genocidal tyrant AND the potential danger to the West's oil  interests, caused us to take action.   [...]  I'm not setting up a strawman at all.  If you want to argue against the war, then the only logical alternative was to allow Hussein to keep Kuwait.  Diplomatic alternatives, including sanctions, were ineffective.  Well, in a sense, yes.  They probably had no idea of what end Hitler would lead their nation to.   They suffered along with the rest.  Why does this bother you so much? The world is full of evil, and circumstances are not perfect.  Many innocents suffer due to the wrongful actions of others.  It it regretable, but that's The-Way-It-Is.  There are no perfect solutions.  [...]  Probably because we're not the saviors of the world.  We can't police each and every country that decides to self-destruct or invade another.  Nor are we in a strategic position to get relief to Tibet, East Timor, or some other places.  Tell me how we could stop them and I'll support it.  I, for one, do not agree with the present US policy of \\\"sucking up to them\\\" as you put it. I agree that it is deplorable.   Are they?  Or are they supposed to reflect the population of the locale where the trial is held?  (Normally this is where the crime is committed unless one party or the other can convince the judge a change of venue is in order.)  I'm not an expert on California law, or even US law, but it seems that this is the way the system is set up.  You can criticize the system, but let's not have unfounded allegations of racial  prejudice thrown around.   No, not at all.  The point is that the fact that there were no blacks on the first jury and that Rodney King is black is totally irrelevant.   Germans, perhaps.  \\\"Peers\\\" doesn't mean \\\"those who do the same thing\\\", like having murderers judge murderers.  It means \\\"having people from the same station in life\\\", presumably because they are in a better position to understand the defendent's motivation(s).   OK, granted.  However, you are using this reasoning as part of *your* logical argument in this discussion.  This is not a court of law.  The media is not totally monolithic.  Even though there is a prevailing liberal bias, programs such as the MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour try to give a balanced and fair reporting of the news.  There are even conservative sources out there if you know where to look.  (Hurrah for Rush!)  BTW, I never used the word \\\"conspiracy\\\".  I don't accept (without *far* more evidence) theories that there is some all-pervading liberal conspiracy attempting to take over all news sources.   Hardly.  I didn't say that it's a Good Thing [tm] to kill innocent people if the end is just.  Unfortunately, we don't live in a perfect world and there are no perfect solutions.  If one is going to  resist tyranny, then innocent people on both sides are going to suffer and die.  I didn't say it is OK -- it is unfortunate, but sometimes necessary.   I would agree that it was evil in the sense that it caused much pain and suffering.  I'm not so sure that it was unnecessary as you say.  That conclusion can only be arrived at by evaluating all the factors involved. And perhaps it *was* unnecessary as (let's say) we now know.  That doesn't mean that those who had to make the decision to bomb didn't see it as being necessary.  Rarely can one have full known of the consequences of an action before making a decision.  At the time it may have seemed necessary enough to go ahead with it.  But don't assume that I feel the bombing was *morally* justified -- I don't!  I just don't condemn those who had to make a difficult decision under difficult circumstances.   You certainly are not in such a position if you are a moral relativist. I, as an absolutist, am in a position to judge, but I defer judgment.   Wrong.  They were neither moral then nor now.  They seemed necessary to those making the decisions to bring a quick end to the war.  I simply refuse to condemn them for their decision.  One day I will stand before Jesus and give account of every word and action; even this discourse in this forum.  I understand the full ramifications of that, and I am prepared to do so.  I don't believe that you can make the same claim.   And BTW, the reason I brought up the blanket-bombing in Germany was because you were bemoaning the Iraqi civilian casualties as being  \\\"so deplorable\\\".  Yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombing wasn't accurate enough to hit industrial/military targets in a decisive way by any other method at that time.  But in the Gulf War, precision bombing was the norm.  So the point was, why make a big stink about the relatively few civilian casualties that resulted *in spite of* precision bombing, when so many more civilians (proportionately and quantitatively) died under the blanket bombing in WW2?  Even with precision bombing, mistakes happen and some civilians suffer.  But less civilians suffered in this war than any other iany other in history!  Many Iraqi civilians went about their lives with minimal interference from the allied air raids.  The stories of \\\"hundreds of thousands\\\" of Iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk. Yes, bunk.  The US lost 230,000 servicemen in WW2 over four years and the majority of them were directly involved in fighting!  But  we are expected to swallow that \\\"hundreds of thousands\\\" of  *civilian* Iraqis died in a war lasting about 2 months!  And with  the Allies using the most precise bombs ever created at that!   What hogwash.  If \\\"hundreds of thousands\\\" of Iraqi civilians died,  it was due to actions Hussein took on his own people, not due to  the Allied bombing.

He scored -if I remember correctly- 93 points this season,  and then we have to keep in mind that a 50+ point season in Sweden is  considered *very good* due to the limited number of games. Mariusz is  Djurgarden property (he was just on loan to Hammarby), so he will play  in Elitserien next season, unless the B's can get him of course.  I would say that Mariusz has to be one of the most exciting player to  watch in Swedish hockey this season.   Staffan\",\" [ description of experiment deleted ]   [ more deleted ]   A few years ago a friend and I took some 256 grey-level photos from a 1 bit Mac Plus screen using this method. Displaying all 256 levels synchronized to the 60Hz display took about 10 seconds. After experimenting with different aperture settings and screen brightnesses we found a range that worked well, giving respectable contrast. The quality of the images was pretty good. There were no visible contrast bands.  To minimize the exposure time the display program built 255 different 1 bit frames. The first contained a dot only for pixels that had value 255, the second only for pixels that had value 254, etc. These frames were stored using a sparse data structure that was very fast to 'or' onto the screen in sequence. Creating these frames sometimes took 5-10 minutes on that old Mac, but the camera shutter was closed during that time anyway. And yes, we wrote directly to the screen memory. Mea culpa.  Our biggest problem was that small images were displayed in the top left corner of the screen instead of the center. It took an extra week to have the film developed and printed, because the processors took the trouble to manually move the all images into the center of the print.

Helsingfors IFK have been around since 1897 but fans only started taking hockey seriously in the 1960s so I think you're exagerating here.   That's a rather bold claim, in the light of how successful the Canadian & American Olympic teams have been . . . and they've had to play according to our set of rules and on international ice. The 1992 Olympic teams contained about as much talent as your average expansion team. Canada had Eric Lindros, Sean Burke, Joe Juneau and Chris Kontos. Another four or five have been deep subs in the NHL. As for the Yanks, Keith Tkachuk, Scott Lachance, Bret Hedican, Shawn  McEachern, Steve Heintze, Ted Donato, Joe Sacco and Bill Guerin have been  3rd/4th line players in the NHL, while Robb Stauber has done well for the  Kings in goal. Nothing more. In fact, I'm sure that an All-Star team assembled from the best Finnish League teams would do no better in the NHL than Hartford  or Tampa Bay currently are doing. --- But what happens if _all_ top-class Finnish & Swedish players gradually end up with Helsinki & Stockholm as the North American-based ones gradually retire and no Canadian/American team is allowed to draft new players from Scandinavia?  Here is what THE HOCKEY NEWS scouts think of our NHL-based players:  (28-30=superstar) (23-27=star) (18-22=NHL regular+) (13-17=NHL regular) ( 8-12=role player)  FINLAND:    D-Jyrki Lumme.......20 D-Teppo Numminen....20 D-Peter Ahola.......13  C-Jari Kurri........25 C-Christian Ruuttu..16  R-Teemu Selanne.....27  L-Esa Tikkanen......20 (Obviously, Selanne's ratings would be higher today than they were in January)  SWEDEN: D-Ulf Samuelsson....21 D-Fredrik Olausson..20 D-Niklas Lidstrom...18 D-Calle Johansson...18 D-Kjell Samuelsson..17 D-Tommy Sjodin......13 D-Tommy Albelin......7  C-Mats Sundin.......26 C-Thomas Steen......18  R-Thomas Sandstrom..22 R-Ulf Dahlen........18 R-Michael Nylander..13  L-Per-Erik Eklund...18 L-Johan Garpenlov...16 L-Mikael Andersson..15 L-Jan Erixon........14  This would be interesting. Clearly, Finland's top five players (Winnipeg's Selanne & Numminen, Vancouver's Lumme, Los Angeles' Jari Kurri and New York's Tikkanen) are right up there with any five-man unit Pittsburgh & co. have. But I have my doubts about the home-based Finnish players - the national team did well in the Canada Cup and World Championships largely due to the efforts of Markus Ketterer (the goalie), 3-4 or the players listed above and luck. There's presumably a lot of decent players in Finland that wouldn't be superstars at the highest level but still valuable role players, however. My guess would be that the Finnish Canada Cup team would be a .500 team in the NHL. --- Sweden is easier to judge because they have more players in North America. Their points total (16 players) is 274 - seven more than Ottawa's 22 top players combined! If we estimate there are six more NHL regulars back home in  Sweden, an all-Swedish team would assemble about 350-360 skill points. Deducting some points from Pittsburgh, NY Rangers and other teams that rely on Swedish players, the Swedish team would finish in sixth place - about as high as Boston, Vancouver, Calgary and Montreal on paper! So, the \\\"dynasty\\\" talk isn't completely unfounded here. An all-Finnish/all-Swedish team might have an advantage because the players would be playing at home half of the time, won't have to adapt to a foreign country and a foreign language, and presumably play the wide-open European variant of hockey rather than have to learn the North American checking game. However, if free agency becomes a factor the top  Scandinavian players still might end up playing for large-market teams after a  couple of years the same way Edmonton's \\\"dynasty\\\" crumbled in the late '80s.  Some fringe players likely will be drafted by other NHL teams as having an  exclusive talent pool might be a bit unfair after all. I'd settle for a  compromise, prohibit all European teams from signing a North American during  the first two rounds but allow them to keep their top two players. After this,  the amateur draft should be open to anyone.  \",\"My girlfriend switched to gas-permeable hard lenses and no longer needs a one year old soft contact lens cleaning unit.

Although not many patients with Hep B go on to chronic hepatitis, it does still occur in a good number (20%?) and is something to keep in mind.  Hepatitis C (was: non-A, non-B Hep) much more frequently leads to chronic hep and cirrhosis.  There is also an autimmune chronic hepatitis that affects mostly younger women which also leads to cirrhosis.    Of course, cirrhosis is a most unkind disease.  The most dangerous effects relate to portal hypertension and loss of liver function.  Patients develop life-threatening variceal bleeds and hepatic comas, among many other problems, as a result of disturbances in hepatic circulation.  Less ominously, they can exhibit the effects of hyperestrogenemia which often characterize patients with cirrhosis.  These effects include telangiactasias (small red skin lesions) and, in men, gynecomastia (breast development).  The only real treatment for cirrhosis is liver transplant.  Keep in mind that cirrhosis is not expected, at least statistically, in your friend's case.  Nevertheless you might want to bring up the subject of chronic disease and cirrhosis with the doctor.  Hopefully he or she can then carefully explain these sequelae of Hep B infection to you, and offer you support.\",\"Hello,        While refurbishing our observatory I came across the above mentioned camera.

Not surprisingly, literature promoting cognitive therapy also claims to be superior.  What are the facts?  Early in my research I didn't have a bias towards either medication or cognitive therapy.  I was interested in a treatment that worked.  After reading journals published after 1986, the cognitive therapy camp claims a higher success rate (approx 80%), a lower drop-out rate, and no side effects associated with medication.  Lars-Goran Ost published an excellent article titled \\\"Applied Relaxation: Description of a coping technique and a review of controlled studies.\\\"  This is from Behav. Res. Ther., vol. 25, no. 5, pp. 397-409, 1987.  The article provides instructions on how to perform applied relaxation (AR).

The 27th was a short day at work, we worked until eleven or eleven-thirty and left for home. I decided to go for a short walk. I went to Primorsky Park. I walked past the Eternal Flame and saw a group of about 8 to 10 people standing there. When I had walked another 15 to 20 yards I heard the screech of automobile brakes behind me. I turned my head toward the sound. It was a light blue GAZ-24 Volga. I see that the people who were standing there have gone over to the  car. A man and a woman get out. The man is expensively dressed, in a suit, and the woman has a raincoat on. She doesn't have anything on her head, and  her hair is let down, sightly reddish hair, a heavy-set woman. They're 40 to  45 years old. They get something out of the trunk. The people start to help them. I become curious just what are they pulling out of there?  When I got up close I heard them turn something on. I didn't see what it was,  but it was probably a tape recorder. They put it on the ground near the  Eternal Flame honoring the 26 Baku Commissars and formed a tight circle around it. I ask, \\\"What's going on?\\\" Someone tells me, \\\"Come listen.\\\" Well they were Azerbaijanis, I had asked in Azerbaijani. I hear appeals: \\\"Brother Muslims, our time has come . . . \\\" and something else along that line. I didn't understand what it was all about. I walked around the group trying to  get a look at the owner of the tape recorder. But the circle drew in tighter.  New people started coming from various directions, five here, seven there. And the comments started: \\\"Right, we should slaughter the Armenians!\\\" and \\\"There's no need to be afraid, all of Moscow is behind us.\\\" I even heard that: \\\"All  Moscow is behind us.\\\" Well I watched and listened in and realized that this  was no joke. I quietly left and went home.  Now before that at work I had heard that something was going on in Karabagh,  that there were demonstrations there. Well, people were saying all kinds of  things, but I didn't have any idea what was really going on.  My wife and son were at home, but my daughter was at my aunt's house in Baku.  I didn't say anything to my wife. We sat and drank tea. Sometime around two o'clock right behind our house suddenly there is noise, whistling, and  shouting. I looked out the window and saw a crowd. The crowd is moving slowly, like they show on TV when blacks in South Africa are striking or having a  demonstration and move slowly.  My wife asks what's going on out there. I say I don't know. I put on some outdoor clothes and went out to find out what it was all about. In the crowd people are shouting \\\"Down with the Armenians!\\\" and \\\"Death to the Armenians!\\\" I waited for the entire crowd to pass. At first they went down Narimanov Street  on the side with the SK club and the City Party Committee; then they turned  and went against the traffic--it's one way there--down the Street of the 26  Baku Commissars toward the streetcar line. I went home and told my wife there  was a demonstration going on. In fact I thought that we were having the same  kind of demonstrations that they had had in Yerevan and in Karabagh. Aside  from the things they were shouting, I was surprised that there were only young people in the crowd. And they were minors, under draft age.  My wife and son wanted to go upstairs to visit a friend, but I was kind of uneasy and said, \\\"No, let's stay at home instead.\\\" An hour went by, or maybe  an hour and a half. Well, I wasn't keeping track of the time, I can't say exactly how long it was. I look and see another crowd on Narimanov, but now on the side with the microdistricts, the bazaar, and the Rossiya movie theater.  I put outside clothes on and went out again. There's noise, an uproar outside, and the crowd has grown. There are more people. And whereas the first time  there were individual shouts, this time they are more focused, more  aggressive. No, I think, something's wrong here, this isn't any demonstration. They would run, stop, then walk quickly and make sharp dashes, and then run  again. I was walking along the sidewalk and they were in the street. I  followed them. I was thinking I'd just watch and see. Who knew where this was  leading? We came out on Lenin Square. At the square the SK club is on one  side, and the City Party Committee is on the other. I went toward the square  and heard noise and shouting, as though the whole town had turned out. There  was some sort of a rally going on. I go closer and hear exclamations, appeals. I heard both anti-Armenian and anti-Soviet appeals. \\\"We don't need  perestroika, we want to go on living like we have been.\\\" Now what did they  mean by \\\"living like we have been?\\\" The Azerbaijanis work like everyone else.  But too many people live at the expense of the government and at the expense  of others. Speculation, theft, and cheating go on all the time. And not just  in Azerbaijan, everywhere, in all the republics, but I've never seen it  anywhere else like I have in Azerbaijan.  Now at this rally someone says that they should go around to the Armenians'  apartments and drive them out, beat them and drive them out. True, I didn't  hear them say \\\"kill them\\\" over the microphone, I only heard \\\"beat them and  drive them out.\\\" I stayed at the square a few minutes longer. First one, then another are going up onto the stage, and no one tries to stop the crowd. Off to the side of the crowd there were small groups of three or four people, and  I think they were MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] or State Security KGB. There were also uniformed policemen there, but I didn't see any of them try  to pacify the crowd. New people kept coming up onto the stage.  Well I had finally decided that this could end badly: This was no demonstration, and I had to protect my family.  I left the Square to return home and suddenly noticed a truck. It was next to the City Party Committee, on Narimanov Street, it stood next to the tai- lor's shop there, a low truck, and it had low, wooden panels. I see that some- thing is being unloaded, crates of some sort. I decided to go look because after all those appeals I was apprehensive and thought there might be weapons in there. They pulled the crates out onto the square, not toward the City  Party Committee, but toward the SK club. And when I went right up to them I  saw that they were cases of vodka. There were two people handing down the  cases from the bed of the truck, and on the ground there were many people, 15  to 20. They were handing them down from the truck and each case was carried  off by two people. Two people, one case of vodka. And there was a man standing right next to the truck and he was handing out roundish black lumps, maybe  about the size of a fist, maybe a little bigger or smaller. It was anasha.  When I passed next to that person, he stood with his side to me. There was  about a yard and a half between us, and two people were standing near him. He  has a package in his hand, and he's pulling out anasha and handing it out. I  have never smoked it myself. Once I tried it for fun, but I've seen a lot of  people smoke it, I've seen it many times, and I know what it is. I strolled  around and no one asked me who I was or what I was doing there.  Before I got to the Glass Bazaar I heard more howling, more warlike shouting.  I turned around and saw them running. Well I'll just keep on going like I am,  I thought. When they caught up with me I saw that they were carrying flags.  And I recognized the person who was carrying the flag on my side of the  street. He's a young guy, 21 or 22 years old. He was carrying a red flag,  which had \\\"Ermeni oryum\\\" written on it in Azerbaijani, that means \\\"Death to  Armenians!\\\" That guy used to live off the same courtyard as us. I don't really know what his name is, but I know his father very well. His father's name is Rafik; he used to be a cook, and then became head chef. He used to have a dark blue Zhiguli van, then he sold it and now he has a white Zhiguli 06. His  family, as I said, lived on the same courtyard as we did. Our building was on  Narimanov Street, and theirs was on the Street of the 26 Baku Commissars;  their apartment was in the far entryway, on the fifth floor, the door on the  left. Now Rafik's little brother lives there, and he, Rafik, I heard, got a  new apartment either in the forth or eighth microdistrict. In a word, his son  was carrying a flag that said \\\"Death to Armenians!\\\" I was surprised because  before this I had gotten the impression that all of this nonsense was being  done not by people from Sumgait, but by Azerbaijanis from Agdam and Kafan.  Well anyway I went home. My wife was upset. I told her, \\\"It's OK, it'll pass,  they're young kids, they've just gotten all whooped up.\\\" Naturally I didn't  want her to get overly upset. After a while a new surge of crowd went by. And  this time they were breaking glass. I could hear it breaking, but I couldn't  see where. Well I think, here we go, the machine's in motion. They weren't  handing out that vodka and anasha for nothing. I didn't see people drinking  and smoking on the spot, but they certainly hadn't unloaded the vodka and  hashish to put in a store window!  So the thought flashed through my head that the machine was running, no one  would stop them now, they weren't even trying, although, I'll say it again,  the police were there, I saw them. And it's not just that the police weren't  breaking them up, they were joking with them, they were having a good time.  True, at the time I couldn't even imagine that under our government, our much- vaunted leadership--and I'm not afraid to say these words: so many people  died, So many women were abused, and how many abominations there were!--I  couldn't imagine that under our much-vaunted authorities, and if I were to be  specific, I would say under the much-touted authorities in our city of  Sumgait, I couldn't imagine that such things could take place.  When they started breaking glass I told my wife and son: \\\"Let's go upstairs.\\\"  We went to our neighbors, the Grigorians, on the fourth floor. And in the  evening, when those crowds started going past again, I went outside once more. I stopped at \\\"The Corner,\\\" a place called that right next to the bazaar. I  look and see a crowd on the run. And there, a few yards from the entrance to  the bazaar, are three respectable-looking men of around, say, 50 years old.  The crowd was running and one of the three waved with his arm and pointed  toward the bazaar. And then the whole crowd, as though it were one person,  wheeled and raced toward the bazaar. And not a soul went past those three, as  though it were off limits! Well everything got all churned up, there was more  noise, and the glass was flying again.  We spent the night at the neighbors'. My apartment was on the first floor, there was really no way to defend yourself there.  In the morning I went out to buy bread and to see what was happening in town.  On the way I saw someone hunched up, still. I never found out who it was or  what happened to him. There were 10 to 15 people standing near him. I got the  bread and on my way back, they had gathered around the person who was lying  there hunched up, sort of enclosing him; because of the way they were standing you couldn't even see him.  That was on the morning of February 28. Everyone knows the rest.

From the outset, the efforts of the Armenian revolutionaries within the Ottoman borders took the form of terrorist and destructive actions aimed at mass murder, cruelty and genocide, so that no other interpretation of them is possible. Armenian activities started during the reign of Abdulhamid II as individual acts of terror, and then developed into assassinations and surprise attacks. The element of brute force in these activities increased steadily, culminating in mass rebellions and widespread fighting during the First World War. Furthermore, when the Ottoman army withdrew from Eastern Anatolia after the 1915 Sarikamis defeat, Armenian revolutionaries initiated a series of cruelties in this area. Although the Russians occupied Eastern Anatolia as an enemy, nevertheless they were constrained by the rules of war. However, when they returned to their country in 1917 after the Revolution, Armenian revolutionaries were unchecked in this area for about a year until the Ottoman forces returned to Erzurum in 1918. During this period, Armenian revolutionaries executed massacres on the local people which is recorded in historical documents.[1]  For example, let us look at a report dated 21 March 1918 which the Commander of the Third Army submitted when he entered Erzurum and Erzincan:    \\\"They were completely and systematically destroyed and burned down    by Armenians, even the trees were cut down, and they are like a    building entirely consumed by fire in every sense of the word.\\\"   As for the people who had been living in Erzurum and Erzincan:  \\\"Those who were capable of fighting were taken away at the very beginning  with the excuse of forced labor in road construction, they were taken  in the direction of Sarikamis and annihilated. When the Russian army  withdrew, a part of the remaining people was destroyed in Armenian  massacres and cruelties: they were thrown into wells, they were locked  in houses and burned down, they were killed with bayonets and swords, in places  selected as butchering spots, their bellies were torn open, their lungs  were pulled out, and girls and women were hanged by their hair after  being subjected to every conceivable abominable act. A very small part   of the people who were spared these abominations far worse than the  cruelty of the inquisition resembled living dead and were suffering  from temporary insanity because of the dire poverty they had lived  in and because of the frightful experiences they had been subjected to.  Including women and children, such persons discovered so far do not  exceed one thousand five hundred in Erzincan and thirty thousand in  Erzurum. All the fields in Erzincan and Erzurum are untilled, everything  that the people had has been taken away from them, and we found them  in a destitute situation. At the present time, the people are subsisting  on some food they obtained, impelled by starvation, from Russian storages  left behind after their occupation of this area.\\\"[2]   Foreign observers who witnessed the events, including Russian Officers who did not desert their lines, submitted detailed reports proving the genocide to Ottoman commanders who received them as prisoners of war. What is most important is that they stated in their reports 'the  massacres did not happen by chance but were planned.'[3]  At the end of the war, the German author Dr. Weiss, his Austrian colleague Dr. Stein and his Turkish colleague Mr. Ahmet Vefik visited Trabzon, Kars, Erzurum and Batum between April 17th and May 20th 1918 to record the cruelties. Their writings not only show the scope of Armenian activities, but also reveal their goal and true nature.[4]  [1] (The Ottoman State, the Ministry of War), \\\"Islam Ahalinin Ducar Olduklari     Mezalim Hakkinda Vesaike Mustenid Malumat,\\\" (Istanbul, 1918).

Maybe I've misjudged you, Russell.  Anyone who agrees with something  I say can't be all bad.  ;-)  Seriously, I'm not sure whether I misjudged you or not, in one respect.   I still have a major problem, though, with your insistence that science  is mainly about avoiding mistakes.  And I still disagree with your  contention that nobody who doesn't use methods deemed \\\"scientific\\\"  can possibly know what's true and what's not.     Okay, so let's see if we agree on this: FIRST of all, there are degrees  of certainty.  It might be appropriate, for instance, to demand carefully  controlled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth (to the  extent that there is any such thing) the effectiveness of a certain  treatment. On the other hand, highly favorable clinical experience, even  if uncontrolled, can be adequate to justify a *preliminary* judgement that a treatment is useful.  This is often the best evidence we can hope for from investigators who do not have institutional or corporate support. In this case, it makes sense to tentatively treat claims as credible but to reserve final judgement until establishment scientists who are qualified and have the necessary resources can do more careful testing.  SECONDLY, it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of  evidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal.     I come to this dispute about what science is  not only as a mathematician but as a veteran of many arguments in sci.psychology (and occasionally in sci.med) about NLP (Neurolinguistic Programming).  Much of the work done to date by NLPers can be better categorized as informal exploration than as careful scientific research.  For years now I have been trying to get scientific and clinical psychologists to just take a look at it, to read a few of the books and watch some of the videotapes (courtesy of your local university library).  Not for the purpose of making a definitive judgement, but simply to look at the NLP methodology (especially the approach to eliciting information from subjects) and look for ideas and hypotheses which might be of scientific interest.  And most especially to be aware of the *questions* NLP suggests which might be worthy of scientific investigation.  Over and over again the response I get in sci.pychology is  \\\"If this hasn't been thoroughly validated by the accepted form of empirical research then it can't be of any interest to us.\\\"    To me, the ultimate reducio ad absurdum of the extreme \\\"There've got to be controlled studies\\\" position is an NLP technique called the Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure.  Simple phobias (as opposed to agoraphobia) may not be the world's most  important psychological disorder, but the nice thing about them is that  it doesn't take a sophisticated instrument to diagnose them or tell  when someone is cured of one.  The NLP phobia cure is a simple  visualization which requires less than 15 minutes.  (NLPers claim that it can also be used to neutralize a traumatic memory, and hence is useful in treating Post-traumatic Stress Syndrome.)  It is essentially a variation on the classic desensitization process used by behavioral therapists.  A subject only needs to be taken through the technique once (or, in the case of PTSD, once for each traumatic incident).  The process doesn't need to be repeated and the subject doesn't need to practice it over again at home.  Now to me, it seems pretty easy to test the effectiveness of this cure.  (Especially if, as NLPers claim, the success rate is extremely high.)   Take someone with a fear of heights (as I used to have).  Take them up  to a balcony on the 20th floor and observe their response.  Spend 15  minutes to have them do the simple visualization.  Send them back up to  the balcony and see if things have changed.  Check back with them in a  few weeks to see if the cure seems to be lasting.  (More long term  follow-up is certainly desirable, but from a scientific point of view  even a cure that lasts several weeks has significance.  In any case,  there are many known cases where the cure has lasted years.  To the best  of my knowledge, there is no known case where the cure has been reversed  after holding for a few weeks.)  (My own cure, incidentally, was done with a slightly different NLP technique, before I learned of the Fast  Phobia/Trauma Cure.  Ten years later now, I enjoy living on the 17th floor of my building and having a large balcony.)    The folks over in sci.psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to make this simple test.  They claim that only an elaborate outcome study will be satisfactory --- a study of the sort that NLP practitioners,  many of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice, can ill  afford to do.  (Most of them are also just plain not interested, because  the whole idea seems frivolous.  And since they're not part of the scientific establishment, they have no tangible rewards to gain  from scientific acceptance.)   The Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure is over ten years old now and the clinical  psychology establishment is still saying \\\"We don't have any way of  knowing that it's effective.\\\"    These academics themselves have the resources to do a study as elaborate  as anyone could want, of course, but they say  \\\"Why should I prove your  theory?\\\"  and  \\\"The burden of proof is on the one making the claim.\\\"   One academic in sci.psychology said that it would be completely  unscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn't  been described in a scientific journal.  (It's described in a number of  books and I've posted articles in sci.psychology describing it in as much  detail as I'm capable of.)    Actually, at least one fairly careful academic study has been done (with  favorable results), but it's apparently not acceptable because it's a doctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal.  To me, this sort of attitude does not advance science but hinders it.   This is the kind of thing I have in mind when I talk about \\\"doctrinnaire\\\"  attitudes about science.    Now maybe I have been unfair in imputing such attitudes to you, Russell.   If so, I apologize.    -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems  less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \",\"  So what should I carry if I want to comply with intelligent helmet laws?

This was very helpful to me in applying thought to the subject of the will of God.  Weatherhead broke the will of God into three distinct parts; intentional will, circumstancial will, and ultimate will.  He (Weatherhead) also refuted the last statement (above) by Michael Parkin above quite nicely.  Summarizing; _despite_ the failures of humankind, God's ultimate will is never to be defeated.  God's intentions may be interfered with, even temporarily defeated by the will of humankind, brought down by circumstance.  His ultimate will (the reconcilication of all humankind) will never be stopped.  Time after time, Weatherhead used the Cross as the best description of this process at work.  His points, paraphrased, were 1) God's intentional will was for Jesus, the Christ, to live out a full life and perform the work of the Living God.  2) The failures, sins, and deviousness of humankind frustrated God's intent for His Son.  3) Despite the circumstance, God's ultimate will was revealed in the Cross, as Jesus willingly (\\\"not my will, Lord, but yours\\\") died for the redemption of all humankind.  The Cross was utterly triumphant, overcoming even the most cruel of circumstances.   It was not the intentional will of God.  It was the circumstancial will, thus enabling the victory of the ultimate will.    Right, intentional will.  (Just like the Jewish people  We know neither the time nor the place.

The answers I received at that time allowed me to get a prototype of my project working. However, during this process I have come up with new problems.  1) There seems to be a limit of 255 characters for a DDE Topic string. Is this inherent in all DDE systems or just peculiar to MSACCESS or VB?  2) It is easy to query an Access database from VB using the DDE SQL command, (provided the above limitation is overcome by using short field and table names) but how is one meant to update a database?    a) A DDE SQL UPDATE command does not seem to work.    b) Initiating an Access macro using a DDE Execute command from VB cannot       be used because when the macro requests information from VB using a       second DDE channel the programs dead lock until time- outs occur.       (The VB to Access channel has to close before the Access to VB channel       is initiated, I guess.)    c) Access does not allow VB to DDE POKE the information.      The way I eventually managed to update a database was by sending key-    strokes from VB to Access using the SendKeys command. This technique has    the problem that Access cannot be minimised and it must always be in a    state ready to respond to the sequence of key-strokes VB sends.  Are all the above statements correct or have I made incorrect assumptions? Are there any better work arounds to the above?

The Macroscrubber from Radio Electronics removes the protection so you  souldn't have any more problems.  However, if you use the method of  copying it from one VCR to another where the second VCR doesn't react to  the protection, you will end up with a duplicate tape, including the  protection.  One thought comes to mind about your problem...  When playing the tape  for viewing, are you feeding the signal from the source VCR through an  extra device before going to the TV?  If you feed it through a second VCR  first, that is your problem.  As to other devices such as converters, I  don't know if they would react or not.  Just to be safe, you might want  to make sure that you have NOTHING between the VCR and TV.\",\"It's irritating when someone mis-labels \\\"us\\\" as \\\"fundamentalists\\\", isn't it?

This is the first in a series of regular postings aimed at new readers of the newsgroups.  Many groups of a 'controversial' nature have noticed that new readers often come up with the same questions, mis-statements or misconceptions and post them to the net.  In addition, people often request information which has been posted time and time again.  In order to try and cut down on this, the alt.atheism groups have a series of five regular postings under the following titles:     1.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Overview for New Readers    2.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Introduction to Atheism    3.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)    4.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Constructing a Logical Argument    5.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Atheist Resources  This is article number 1.  Please read numbers 2 and 3 before posting.  The others are entirely optional.  If you are new to Usenet, you may also find it helpful to read the newsgroup news.announce.newusers.  The articles titled \\\"A Primer on How to Work With the Usenet Community\\\", \\\"Answers to Frequently Asked Questions about Usenet\\\" and \\\"Hints on writing style for Usenet\\\" are particularly relevant.  Questions concerning how news works are best asked in news.newusers.questions.

These articles are free.  Truly free.  You may copy them and distribute them to anyone you wish.  However, please send any changes or corrections to the author, and please do not re-post copies of the articles to alt.atheism; it does nobody any good to have multiple versions of the same document floating around the network.                                   Finding Stuff  All of the FAQ files *should* be somewhere on your news system.  Here are some suggestions on what to do if you can't find them:  1. Check the newsgroup alt.atheism.  Look for subject lines starting with    \\\"Alt.Atheism FAQ:\\\".  2. Check the newsgroup news.answers for the same subject lines.     If you don't find anything in steps 1 or 2, your news system isn't set up    correctly, and you may wish to tell your system administrator about the    problem.  3. If you have anonymous FTP access, connect to rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27].    Go to the directory /pub/usenet/alt.atheism, and you'll find the latest    versions of the FAQ files there.     FTP is a a way of copying files between networked computers.  If you    need help in using or getting started with FTP, send e-mail to    mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with        send usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq     in the body.  4. There are other sites which also carry news.answers postings.  The article    \\\"Introduction to the news.answers newsgroup\\\" carries a list of these    sites; the article is posted regularly to news.answers.  5. If you don't have FTP, send mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu    consisting of the following lines:        send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources       send usenet/alt.atheism/faq       send usenet/alt.atheism/introduction       send usenet/alt.atheism/logic       send usenet/alt.atheism/resources  5. (Penultimate resort)  Send mail to mail-server@mantis.co.uk consisting of    the following lines:        send atheism/faq/faq.txt       send atheism/faq/logic.txt       send atheism/faq/intro.txt       send atheism/faq/resource.txt     and our poor overworked modems will try and send you a copy of the files.    There's other stuff, too; interesting commands to try are \\\"help\\\" and    \\\"send atheism/index\\\".  6. (Last resort)  Mail mathew@mantis.co.uk, or post an article to the    newsgroup asking how you can get the FAQ files.  You should only do this    if you've tried the above methods and they've failed; it's not nice to    clutter the newsgroup or people's mailboxes with requests for files.    it's better than posting without reading the FAQ, though!  For instance,    people whose email addresses get mangled in transit and who don't have     FTP will probably need assistance obtaining the FAQ files. \",\"  Do I have to be the one to say it?

Actually that is not how the pill works, but it *is* how the IUD works. The oral contraceptive pill actually *prevents* ovulation from occuring by providing negatve feedback to the pituitary gland, and thus preventing the LH surge that normally occurs at the time of ovulation.  With the IUD what happens is that fertilization may occur, but the device prevents implantation within the wall of the uterus (*not* the vagina). \",\" If you don't already know it, you should call the bank/credit union/ finance company that holds the loan on your present car and get the current payoff cost.  If you are trading in your current car on the new car, subtract the payoff amount from the trade-in the dealer is giving you.

The points (x,y,z) on a spherical surface with radius R and center (a,b,c) can be written as      (x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 + (z-c)^2 = R^2  This equation can be rewritten into the following form:       2ax + 2by + 2cz + R^2 - a^2 - b^2 -c^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2  Approximate the left hand part by   F(x,y,z) = p1.x + p2.x + p3.z + p4.1  For all datapoints, i.c. 4, determine the 4 parameters p1..p4 which minimise the average error |F(x,y,z) - x^2 - y^2 - z^2|^2.

Given about $10k in lab equipment and chemicals (which are commercially available) and given the knowledge that I have (graduating BS, Ch, 1993) I could  synthesize enough of these compounds to make a serious dent in the population of several major US cities.

In the case of chemical agents, I seriously doubt that you would even know that someone had set up a lab until after the weapons had been used.    Part of the trouble with the chemical-weapons ban treaty between the US and the USSR is that many of the precursors to chemical weapons such as GB and Sarin, etc., is that they have very valid commercial uses, and  it is very easy to divert those precursors to chemical weapons manufacture without anyone knowing about it.   \",\"Archive-name: cryptography-faq/part07 Last-modified: 1993/4/15   FAQ for sci.crypt, part 7: Digital Signatures and Hash Functions  This is the seventh of ten parts of the sci.crypt FAQ. The parts are mostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest. We don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask. Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.  The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu  as /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography  FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers every 21 days.   Contents:  * What is a one-way hash function? * What is the difference between public, private, secret, shared, etc.? * What are MD4 and MD5? * What is Snefru?   * What is a one-way hash function?    A typical one-way hash function takes a variable-length message and   produces a fixed-length hash. Given the hash it is computationally   impossible to find a message with that hash; in fact one can't   determine any usable information about a message with that hash, not   even a single bit. For some one-way hash functions it's also   computationally impossible to determine two messages which produce the   same hash.    A one-way hash function can be private or public, just like an   encryption function. Here's one application of a public one-way hash   function, like MD5 or Snefru. Most public-key signature systems are   relatively slow. To sign a long message may take longer than the user   is willing to wait. Solution: Compute the one-way hash of the message,   and sign the hash, which is short. Now anyone who wants to verify the   signature can do the same thing.    Another name for one-way hash function is message digest function.  * What is the difference between public, private, secret, shared, etc.?    There is a horrendous mishmash of terminology in the literature for a   very small set of concepts. When an algorithm depends on a key which   isn't published, we call it a private algorithm; otherwise we call it   a public algorithm. We have encryption functions E and decryption   functions D, so that D(E(M)) = M for any message M. We also have   hashing functions H and verification functions V, such that V(M,X) = 1   if and only if X = H(M).    A public-key cryptosystem has public encryption and private   decryption. Checksums, such as the application mentioned in the   previous question, have public hashing and public verification.   Digital signature functions have private hashing and public   verification: only one person can produce the hash for a message,   but everyone can verify that the hash is correct.    Obviously, when an algorithm depends on a private key, it's meant to   be unusable by anyone who doesn't have the key. There's no real   difference between a ``shared'' key and a private key: a shared key   isn't published, so it's private. If you encrypt data for a friend   rather than ``for your eyes only'', are you suddenly doing   ``shared-key encryption'' rather than private-key encryption? No.  * What are MD4 and MD5?

Good and evil are the most thought provoking polarities that come to mind.  The Bible provides us with many examples of the fragmentation of being. The warring opposites within us are a product of man's rebellion against God, which is described so vividly in the pages of the Scriptures.  Man was created with the order to become a god. Those were the words of St.  Basil in the fourth century. What he was trying to say was that God created man to be a partaker of the divine nature. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, this is called \\\"theosis,\\\" or \\\"deification.\\\"  One can also say that man was created to be whole, i.e. spirit, soul, and body operating in unison. The story of Adam and Eve is a picture of the archetypal humans before obtaining moral consciousness. Theirs was a harmonious relationship with each other, the world, and the Creator. That innocent harmony was shattered when they disobeyed God, their natural wholeness falling apart into two seemingly irreconcilable halves. Immediately, guilt and fear was manifested in their lives. They become bound to hardship, toil, and suffering.  This is symbolized in their exile from the paradisiac state.  The beast in the jungle does not possess moral consciousness. If it were to receive this self-awareness, the knowledge of good and evil, its paradisiac state would also be destroyed.  Was it the intention of the Creator to leave man in this state of innocence all the days of his existence on earth? Or was the gaining of self-awareness carefully staged by God, who did not desire that His masterpiece, mankind, be a blissful idiot?  God must have known that, for mankind to achieve any kind of moral value, he must pass through a confrontation with the opposites. There is no other way to achieve union with God.  Jesus Christ is the answer to the problem of the warring polarities. He was the perfectly integrated individual, reconciling the opposites, and making it possible for us to be integrated, i.e. to become God, not in His essence, but in His energies.  The opposites is THE Christian problem. The Apostle Paul describes it with the utmost precision in Romans 7:15-24. And he follows with the answer to his dilemma in vs 25.\",\"  It's not the picture tube. More likely the flyback. Emerson? can't admire.

Libertarians and anarchists are not alone in being uncomfortable with the use of state sponsored coercion.  The notion that coercion can be virtually eliminated in a society (or more properly that once it is eliminated on the part of the state it is no longer worth serious  consideration) is a view that is peculiar to libertarians and anarchists.    For example, does \\\"non-initiated force\\\" (coercion) include tax collection? Does it include the minimal level of regulation of commerce envisioned by Adam Smith?  Since coercion can be exercised by actors other than the state, how is the state to deal with it?  Exclusively through after the fact arbitration/legal compulsion?     Well, I must admit that the picture of libertarians as Amway participants is somewhat more reassuring than the idea of them trying to govern a  complex, conflictual, industrial society.  I'd venture to point out,  however, that if libertarians couldn't convince at least 85% of a group  of \\\"seminar participants\\\" to \\\"embrace\\\" their philosophy, their  propaganda skills need to be honed.    Frankly, however, it is no great trick to create a government for a  society in which (almost) everyone is assumed to agree about what is a proper government policy.  Once that is assumed, all sorts of annoying formalities can be dispensed with, elections, police, etc.  And as Mr. Marx said, the state will just wither away.    On the way there, however, would you like to explain how eliminating  virtually all policies that restrain private coercion in the  current society will help us to live happier lives?

I don't know if this is believeing blindly or not. I'm not sure how blindness comes into it. I do not deny reason, indeed I insist upon it, but reason only draws conclusions from evidence. If you decide in advance that your reason will act only on the evidence of the five physical senses, then you cut reason off from any possibility of reaching a conclusion outside the physical sphere (beyond the rather provocative, if inconclusive, conclusion that the physical sphere is not self explanatory).   Christians claim that they have received a different kind of evidence,  which they call faith, and which is a gift of God. That is, this evidence is the evidence of a thing which chooses to reveal or hide itself. The  evidence of the senses cannot tell you is such a ting exists. Reasoning on the evidence of the senses won't help either. But Christians do reason of the evidence of faith, and do claim that this evidence is wholly consistent with the evidence of the other senses, and indeed, that the evidence of these other senses is part of God's revelation of himself to us.  It is not necessarilly the case however that knowledge of a God must come through this route. There may be other senses than the physical ones providing evidence of non-physical realities. (There may, of course, be physical realities of a type for which we have no corresponding senses, for all we know.) These senses, if they exist, may provide valid evidence for reason to work on. And, as with all senses, these senses may be impaired in some people, that is, they may be spiritually blind. In this sense, belief in God becomes an act of sight, and it is disbelief which is blind.  Faith, as I have said, is not opposed to reason, it is simply a new source  of evidence on which reason may operate. It is clear that human beings have many systems for explaining the evidence of the physical senses, and similarly there are many systems for explaining the evidence provided by faith. Religious believers in general, and Christians in particular, use reason to help sift through the evidence to come to a clearer understanding of the evidence provided by faith. Science claims, with good reason, to be the most valid system for explaining the physical universe, and Christianity claims, also with good reason, to be the most valid system, possessed of the best evidence, for explaining Gods revelations of himself to man.  If you doubt that Christians use reason, read this newsgroup for a while and you will see rational debate aplenty.\",\"tes:  First, the only drug that could possibly be put in drug stations are marijuana  or its derivitives.

Since there has been some speculation on this news group about my own involvement in this project, I'd like to add that I was not in any way involved.  I found out about it when the FBI briefed me on Thursday evening, April 15.  Since then I have spent considerable time talking with the NSA and FBI to learn more about this, and I attended the NIST briefing at the Department of Commerce on April 16.   The document below is the result of that effort.   Dorothy Denning ---------------                       THE CLIPPER CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY                                 Dorothy Denning                                  April 19, 1993   INTRODUCTION  On April 16, the President announced a new initiative that will bring together the Federal Government and industry in a voluntary program to provide secure communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement.  At the heart of the plan is a new tamper-proof encryption chip called the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" together with a split-key approach to escrowing keys.  Two escrow agencies are used, and the key parts from both are needed to reconstruct a key.   CHIP STRUCTURE  The Clipper Chip contains a classified 64-bit block encryption algorithm called \\\"Skipjack.\\\"  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys (compared with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling (compared with 16 for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  Throughput is 16 Mbits a second.  Each chip includes the following components:     the Skipjack encryption algorithm    F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips    N, a 30-bit serial number    U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip   ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP  To see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T telephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and we both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure conversation, my security device will negotiate a session key K with the device at the other end (in general, any method of key exchange can be used).  The key K and message stream M (i.e., digitized voice) are then fed into the Clipper Chip to produce two values:     E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and     E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement block.    The law enforcement block thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U concatenated with the serial number N, all encrypted under the family key F.   CHIP PROGRAMMING AND ESCROW  All Clipper Chips are programmed inside a SCIF (secure computer information facility), which is essentially a vault.  The SCIF contains a laptop computer and equipment to program the chips.  About 300 chips are programmed during a single session.  The SCIF is located at Mikotronx.  At the beginning of a session, a trusted agent from each of the two key escrow agencies enters the vault.  Agent 1 enters an 80-bit value S1 into the laptop and agent 2 enters an 80-bit value S2. These values serve as seeds to generate keys for a sequence of serial numbers.  To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1. S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a 64-bit block R1:          R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .  Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:            R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1]          R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .  R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow agencies.  As a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are written onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part U1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third disk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent 2 takes the second disk.  The third disk is used to program the chips. After the chips are programmed, all information is discarded from the vault and the agents leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional assurance that no information is left behind.   The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the room instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2, and the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to the escrow agencies.  The escrow agencies have as yet to be determined, but they will not be the NSA, CIA, FBI, or any other law enforcement agency.  One or both may be independent from the government.   LAW ENFORCEMENT USE  When law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line, they will first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get access to the communications line.  Let us assume that the tap is in place and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with Clipper.  They will first decrypt the law enforcement block with the family key F.  This gives them E[K; U] + N.  They will then take a warrant identifying the chip serial number N to each of the key escrow agents and get back U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are XORed together to produce the unit key U, and E[K; U] is decrypted to get the session key K. Finally the message stream is decrypted.  All this will be accomplished through a special black box decoder operated by the FBI. \",\"I've been trying to get my Fujitsu M2611T 45mb hard disk (circa  1990) to share my IDE card with a new Seagate ST3283A 245mb one.

If that's too steep, you can dump Thomas and Bagwell, replacing them with Paul Sorrento and a minimum wager to save a bit over a million dollars, and still have one of the best teams in the majors.  p, Juan Guzman, 500 p, Mussina, 400 p, Castillo,    250 p, Eldred,      175 p, Rhodes, 155 p, Militello,   118 rp, Rojas, 300 rp, Beck, 250 rp, Melendez,   235 rp, Hernandez, 185 rp, Nied, 150 c, Rodriguez, 275 c, Piazza,      126 1b, Thomas, 900 1b, Bagwell,    655 2b, Knoblauch, 500 2b, Barberie, 190 3b, Gomez, 312.5 3b, Palmer, 250 ss, Listach, 350 ss, Pena, 170 lf, Gonzalez, 525 cf, Lankford, 290 rf, R.Sanders, 275 of, Plantier, 245\",\" How exactly would Ferreira accomplished this?

The Yankees were finishing 2nd to a team that was as good as the 26-28 Yankees, while the Yankees had aged some from their peak years.  Ruth and Gehrig couldn't play every position simultaneously.  IMO, given the various ages of the Braves and Reds this season, that the Braves will be closer to their peak, while the Reds have slightly passed their peak.  Also, if you're going to compare Braves and Yankees, a more appropriate comparison to the '93 Braves might be the '23 Yankees.   After falling short two years in a row in exciting World Series,  both teams won/will win the Series this year, despite the heroics of some old fart on the other team.

It may not use the exact words as quoted above but I'm sure many will agree that the same message is being issued.  Later on when I get back home I will try to find the precise section(s) but you can do the research for now (I hope).  I also realize that Yasser Arafat renounced the _Covenant_ *to the Western media only* but he has yet to inform the PNC officially and enequivocally of his exact intentions on this issue.  Therefore, as far as we are concerned the _Covenant_ still stands as the \\\"Bible\\\" (so to speak) of the mainstream Palestinian National movement!    As a staunch pro-Israel activist I can confidently say that Bnai Brith has NOT influenced my opinions on the Arab-Israeli conflict.  As I mentioned above, just a little research on the subject will lead anyone to reach a similar conclusion on the Palestinian National movement (the PLO in most cases).  BB does not properly speak for me nor many of the people around me who share my views.   What 1948 situation?  A negative situation I presume?  Is this the same \\\"situation\\\" when the Jordanian occupiers of East Jerusalem would not allow the Jews to go worship at the HOLIEST SITE IN JUDIASM?  Was this an example of Qu'ranic law being exercised?  If not, I have another suggested reading for you... get into the \\\"soc.culture.arabic\\\" newsgroup where the posters have been debating the topic \\\"Jews in the Qu'ran\\\" (and may I remind you the people doing the debating appear to be devout Muslims with some knowledge of the Qu'ran). You will find that Jews aren't really viewed positively by the Qu'ran (to put it lightly).  So how do you think Jews (or any other non-Islamic religion) will be treated by an Islamic state governed by the words of the Qu'ran?  I think the 1948-1967 \\\"situation\\\" in Jerusalem will return *at best*!  What do you think?   All I have to say to that is, once again, see s.c.a - \\\"Jews in the Qu'ran\\\" and think again.  \\\"Freedom of choice\\\" is *definitely* not an option in Qu'ranic law especially for non-Muslims and ALL women!  Remember the Gulf War?  I'm sure you saw the reports about how women had few rights in Saudi Arabia (an Islamic state).   Probably nothing!  Aside from how to break the news to his Palestinian brethren that the _Covenant_ is \\\"null and void\\\" without getting assassinated himself!   In conclusion, Ahmed, you should go to the library and find the _Palestinian National Covenant (1964)_ and read it VERY CAREFULLY.  By the way, Redpath Library DOES have it in stock because that is exactly where I found it when I was doing my research.  So enjoy the reading and I hope we will be hearing back from you soon!  - Mike  ---        MI     KE   MIK    EMIK   EMI  K        \\\"Opinions expressed above        M I   K E  M   I  K        E   M         are my own and not that        M  I K  E  MIKEM  I  KEM   I   K         of 'Big Blue'\\\"        M   I   K  E   M   IKE M  IKE  MIKE\",\"WANTED:       Refrigerator.\",\"Here are the standings after game 1 of each of the divisional semi-finals.

The \\\"whole Russian strategy\\\" is not specific to Detroit or to Devellano, who was GM before Murray.  What the previous GM also did was to trade  away several players who have gone on to do well with other teams, most notably (in my memory) Murray Craven, who had a few very good years with Philly after leaving here.  Also, it's not the volume of trades that will  necessarily improve a team, but the quality of them.  Trading Adam Oates for Bernie Federko was just plain stupid, even if Federko used to be a  great player at one time.  Most of Murray's trades have worked significantly to the Wings' advantage, with those that didn't being soured mainly by  injury to the players involved (such as Troy Crowder, who suffered back problems from which he never really recovered).

The Alps ones are usually carried by the same folks who run the Audio Amateur magazine.  \",\" Amusing, isn't it?  Seems only the SDCNs realize how much baseball is a *team* game, combining efforts from every player for the win.  Consider the Red Sox game last night.  The Sox won 4-3 in the bottom of the 13th.  Who won the game?  -Clemens pitched a strong nine (?) innings, allowing only two runs. -Ryan pitched a couple shutout innings, though he needed some excellent  defensive plays behind him to do so. -Quantrill pitched a couple of innings, gave up the go-ahead run, and  got credited with the win when the Sox scored two in the bottom of  the inning.  Looks like a team effort to me!  Yet only Quantrill got credit for the win.  How about the offense? -Dawson and Vaughn hit (I think) HRs early in the game.  Without either  one, the Sox would have lost in nine. -Quintana led off the 13th with a solid single. -Zupcic pinch-ran for Quintana, providing the speed to go from first  to third when... -Cooper ripped a *second* single in the inning. -Melvin avoided the DP, getting the run home with a sac fly.  Not much of  a help, but it was something. -Scrub Richardson then hit a double, scoring the speedy Cooper all the  way from first!  (Hill's lack of defense helped.)  Cooper and Zupcic were credited with runs, Melvin and Richardson were credited with RBIs.  But it seems to me that it was Quintana's hit that set up the whole inning!  And did Melvin really contribute as much as Richardson?  Furthermore, people seem to consider RBIs to be more significant than runs.  Did Melvin contribute more than Cooper?  Cooper provided the game-winning baserunner, and moved the tying run to third base with only one out!  Assigning credit based on Runs and RBIs is clearly ridiculous.  You can argue that OBP and SLG don't show you who came through in the clutch, but R&RBI don't do any better.  At least OBP and SLG don't *claim* to try to tell you that.

The fact is, there are *two* references to Jesus in _Antiquities of the Jews_, one of which has unquestionably at least been altered by Christians.  Origen wrote, in the third century, that Josephus did not recognize Jesus as the Messiah, while the long passage says the opposite.  There is an Arabic manuscript of _Antiquities of the Jews_ which contains a version of the passage which is much less gung-ho for Jesus and may be authentic.    There is no question that Origen, in the third century, saw a reference to Jesus in Josephus.  There are no manuscripts of _Antiquities_ which lack the references.  It is possible that it was fabricated out of whole cloth and inserted, but I don't think it's very likely--nor do I think there is a consensus in the scholarly community that this is the case. (I know G.A. Wells takes this position, but that's because he takes the very small minority view that Jesus never existed.

The story is this: I bought a car out of state, and I'm trying to get the safety inspection in Pennsylvania. The problem is that the car has  aftermarket tint on all windows except the windshield. The tint is rather weak, and you can clearly see the inside of the car through the tint.  The inspection garage said that they won't pass it unless I get a waiver from the state police. So I went to the state police - the officer told me that aftermarket tint is illegal, and I can get a waiver only for a pre-84 car or for a medical reason. I asked him to show me the section of the vehicle code that says it's illegal.  He showed it to me and the paraghaph said that you can't have tint, if you can't see the inside of the car because of the tint. When I told him that you can in fact see the inside very well, he shut the book and said \\\"It's just illegal, and in fact we can have someone give you a ticket for it right now.\\\" Well, won't argue with that...  Since the vehicle code says it's OK as long as you can see through the tint, I'd like to keep it (I'll re-read the vehicle code in the library).  I'd also like to get some sort of paper from the police that says it's OK, so I can get the inspection, and so that I won't get in trouble for the tint later on. I also wouldn't mind registering a complaint against that officer - he really pissed me off.  So does anyone have any experience getting that sort of a paper from the police, especially in Pennsylvania? Does anyone have any experience registering a complaint against an officer? I called the station  later on today, but they basically said there is no place where I could register a complaint against an officer... And if I do decide to keep the tint and get a ticket anyway, how much of a chance do I stand to succesfully appeal the ticket in court?

Questions to Israelis   Dear Josh  I appreciate the fact that you sought to answer my questions.  Having said that, I am not totally happy with your answers.  1.   You did not fully answer my question whether Israeli ID cards identify the holders as Jews or Arabs. You imply that U.S. citizens must identify themselves by RACE. Is that true ? Or are just trying to mislead the reader ? Do you know of any democratic country where people are asked to reveal their ethnical or religious identity to any public official who so requests ?  2.  The answer to the second question is evasive. There are all kinds of maps issued.  They are not equivalent to State policy. You did not respond to my question.  3.  Your answer to the third question (Israeli nuclear arsenal) is interesting. You say that Israeli 'probably' stocks nuclear weapons. What evidence have you for maintaining that ?  4.  My fourth question was answered by someone else who posted a Ma'ariv article documenting such cases. I did not ask about cases like Vanunu (everybody knew he was tried and imprisoned) but about those about whom nobody even knows that they have been tried and imprisoned.  5.  Thanks for clarifying the question concerning the legal status of the inhabitants of the occupied territories. From it I understand that there are two sets of laws in these ares, one for the occupier (civil law) and one for the occupied (military law). The law allows Israeli Arabs to settle in Hebron, it seems. If so, why doesn't it allow Hebron Arabs to settle in Israel ?  6. Your answer to the question concerning rights to return conflicts with what I was told, namely that hundreds of thousands of non-Jews who left for some reason or other the area under Israel control during the war of 1947-8, were prevented from returning for the sole reason they were not Jews. Jews who also left, for example to Europe, to avoid the clashes, were allowed to return. How can you justify such discrimination, if this is true ? Is the mere fact of a person leaving area of combat to seek refuge somewhere else a reason for stripping him of his right to live in his homeland ?  7.  Somebody answered my 7.question regarding Y. Rabin signing an order for ethnical cleansing in 1948. According to that information, Y. Rabin signed the order for the expulsion of all inhabitants of Lydda and Ramleh, about 50,000 people.  These expulsions were helped by massacres of civilians and other atrocities which remind Bosnia. I was referred to a book by Israeli journalist Benny Goodman called The Origin of the Palestinian Refugee Problem, published by Cambridge University Press. Is this book available in your library ?  8.  You maintain that there are some Israeli Arabs living in Israeli kibbutzim. I wonder how many and where. There is very little evidence available about that. As much as I know, many Arabs are working *for* kibbutzim, even for many years, but are not accepted as members. Could it be that kibbutzim do not want Arabs ?  9.  My question about the lack of civil marriage in Israel was whether it is true that the Israeli legislator intended to discourage intermarriage. You did not address this question but evaded it by saying that the 'entire religious establishment wants to keep it what way'. I am certain that if only religious communities in the U.S. would be asked, they would gladly abolish civil marriage so that people would depend upon rabbis and priests to officiate marriages. But Israel has always been ruled by a secular majority. Your answer is not satisfactory.   I would be glad to have some more input from you after these comments.\",\"[snip] [stats deleted - we've all seen them by now]  I nominate this last bit for \\\"Anti-Stathead Quote of the Week\\\".

You just gotta love the standard military tire, too, or at least the one they used to use.

just bought a select 300 and rushed home to print  some grayscale pictures for my kids, when I discovered that grayscale(and photograde) are not available if you are using an SE...even if you are running with an '030 cpu. You won't see this in the printer's docs, and the Apple rep didn't mention it to our users group either. It seems that SE ROMs won't support those \\\"features\\\". Okay, I  guess I should have somehow known that this was the case. Let the buyer beware, huh Apple?  Be that as it may, I have been thinking about the  problem and I'm puzzled. Why  can't a defencieny in the  ROM be made up for in software. I write software for a living (on unix platforms) and I don't understand the \\\"it just can't be done\\\" responses I've gotten from those I have asked so far.  Isn't Mode32, or somesuch piece of  soft- ware, just such a fix.   Anyway, I was hoping someone knowledgeable about Mac internals could set me straight: is it simply impossible for a mac SE to print grayscale, or could someone armed with enough info and a little pro- gramming experience cook something up that would supplement the ROM's capabilities?  Also, how does one know if one's mac can support the grayscale and photograde that the Select 300 is supposedly capable of? ( Short of buying the printer and trying it out like I did)  Thanks for your help.\",\" What do you mean by omnipotent here?  Do you mean by \\\"omnipotent\\\" that God should be able to do anything/everything?  This creates a self-contradictory definition of omnipotence which is effectively useless.  To be descriptive, omnipotence must mean \\\"being all-powerful\\\" and not \\\"being able to do anything/everything\\\".  Let me illustrate by analogy. Suppose the United States were the only nuclear power on earth.  Suppose further that the US military could not effectively be countered by any nation or group of nations.  The US has the power to go into any country at any time for any reason to straighten things out as the leaders of the US see fit.  The US would be militarily \\\"omnipotent\\\".  But suppose further that the US holds to a doctrine/philosophy of not interfering in the internal affairs of any nation, such as the current civil war in the former Yugoslavian states.  Technically (in this scenario) the US would have the power to  unilaterally go into Yugoslavia and straighten out the mess.  But effectively the US could not intervene without violating its own policy  of non-interference.  If the policy of non-interference were held to strongly enough, then there would never be a question that it would ever be violated.  Effectively, the US would be limited in what it could actually do, although it had the power to do \\\"whatever it wanted\\\". The US would simply \\\"never want to interfere\\\" for such an idea would be beyond the consideration of its leaders given such an inviolate non-interference policy.  God is effectively limited in the same sense.  He is all powerful, but He cannot use His power in a way that would violate the essence of what He, Himself is.  I hope this helps to clear up some of the misunderstanding concerning omnipotence.

Users of this service are able to ask questions about Epilepsy and the program searches the database and retrieves its best response.  The technology works by comparing your question against a set of questions that have been seen before.  All new questions that are not answered are recorded and used to improve the system.

In terms of laws regarding individual rights, restrictions on police searches, etc... (all closely related to crime) Canadian laws parallel England's and differ greatly from those of the United States.     Actually, they do not have \\\"roughly the same... urban economy\\\",  and extremely different ethnic composition.   However, if you account for economic and ethnic differences, the difference disappears completely: Seattle's minorities are predominatly poor, while Vancouver's are middle or upper class. The rates for whites in both cities were found to be identicle, while the rate for poor, Seattle minorities was almost three times as great as for the well-to-do minorities of Vancouver. The pattern seems to be one of poverty and race relations, not one of gun control.   That is a gross distortion: \\\"Self-defense\\\" does not mean killing the attacker. There were 21 cases of civilians killing their  attacker in self-defence. But such cases represent less that 0.5% of the crimes prevented by armed self-defence; for every case you cite, there were over 200 other cases of self-defence where the crime was prevented but the attacker was not killed. (0.5%, by the way, is the most conservative possible figure, based on the National Crime Survey's estimate of 80,000 crimes prevented by armed self-defence each year. Most other  studies on the subject put the figure at 500,000 to 600,000. Those figures would imply less than 0.08% of sucessful self-defences involve killing the attacker.)   So, more correctly, there over 4000 (possibly as many as 25,000)  cases of civilians acting in self-defence, only 21 of which resulted in the death of the attacker. This is a significant factor, in comparison to the 592 homicides. If memory serves, homicides make up approximately 1% of the violent crimes the study considered, so the fair comparison would be 40 - 250 homicides prevented and 592 homicides. Clearly, the study can not be close to accurate, since it ignored these cases of self-defence.\",\"  Since I repost this message again for the second time, I hope to hear from some folks on this topic.

Water is water, but can exist in three forms--liquid, ice and vapor. Thus it is possible for one essence to exist in three forms.  And recently, the pastor of my church drew an analogy, which I also found useful--A woman is often percieved by others in three ways, depending on their relationship to her--a mother, a wife and an employee in a business.

This was appraently attempted in the case of Vanunu and failed.  It has happened before, and there is reason to believe it still goes on.  Read this:  From Ma'ariv, February 18 (possibly 28), 1992  PUBLICATION BAN          The State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many         years there have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were         sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of         their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever         being made public.  By Baruch Me'iri  All those involved in this matter politely refused my request, one way or another: \\\"Look, the subject is too delicate.  If I comment on it, I will be implicitly admitting that it is true; If I mention a specific case, even hint at it, I might be guilty of making public something which may legally not be published\\\".  The State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many years there have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever being made public. More precisely: A court ordered publication ban was placed on the fact of their arrest, and later on their imprisonment.  In Israel of 1993, citizens are imprisoned without us, the citizens of this country, knowing anything about it.  Not knowing anything about the fact that one person or another were tried and thrown in prison, for security offenses, in complete secrecy.  In the distant past -- for example during the days of the [Lavon - YA] affair -- we heard about \\\"the third man\\\" being in prison.  But many years have passed since then, and what existed then can today no longer be found even in South American countries, or in the former Communist countries.  But it appears that this is still possible in Israel of 1993.  The Chair of the Knesset Committee on Law, the Constitution and Justice, MK David Zucker, sent a letter on this subject early this week to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice, and the Cabinet Legal Advisor.  Ma'ariv has obtained the content of the letter:  \\\"During the past several years a number of Israeli citizens have been imprisoned for various periods for security offenses.  In some of these cases a legal publication ban was imposed not only on the specifics of the crimes for which the prisoners were convicted, but even on the mere fact of their imprisonment.  In those cases, after being legally convicted, the prisoners spend their term in prison without public awareness either of the imprisonment or of the prisoner\\\", asserts MK Zucker.  On the other hand Zucker agrees in his letter that, \\\"There is absolutely no question that it is possible, and in some cases it is imperative, that a publication ban be imposed on the specifics of security offenses and the course of trials.  But even in such cases the Court must weigh carefully and deliberately the circumstances under which a trial will not be held in public.  \\\"However, one must ask whether the imposition of a publication ban on the mere fact of a person's arrest, and on the name of a person sentenced to prison, is justified and appropriate in the State of Israel.  The principle of public trial and the right of the public to know are not consistent with the disappearance of a person from public sight and his descent into the abyss of prison.\\\"  Zucker thus decided to turn to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice and the Cabinet Legal Advisor and request that they consider the question.  \\\"The State of Israel is strong enough to withstand the cost incurred by abiding by the principle of public punishment.  The State of Israel cannot be allowed to have prisoners whose detention and its cause is kept secret\\\", wrote Zucker.  The legal counsel of the Civil Rights Union, Attorney Mordechai Shiffman said that, \\\"We, as the Civil Rights Union, do not know of any cases of security prisoners, Citizens of Israel, who are imprisoned, and whose imprisonment cannot be made public.  This is a situation which, if it actually exists, is definitely unhealthy.  Just like censorship is an unhealthy matter\\\".  \\\"The Union is aware\\\", says Shiffman, \\\"of cases where notification of a suspect's arrest to family members and lawyers is withheld.  I am speaking only of several days.  I know also of cases where a detainee was not allowed to meet with an attorney -- sometimes for the whole first month of arrest.  That is done because of the great secrecy.  \\\"The suspect himself, his family, his lawyer -- or even a journalist -- can challenge the publication ban in court.  But there are cases where the family members themselves are not interested in publicity.  The journalist knows nothing of the arrest, and so almost everyone is happy...\\\"  Attorney Yossi Arnon, an official of the Bar, claims that given the laws as they exist in Israel today, a situation where the arrest of a person for security offenses is kept secret is definitely possible.  \\\"Nothing is easier.  The court orders a publication ban, and that's that.  Someone who has committed security offenses can spend long years in prison without us knowing anything about it.\\\"  -- Do you find this situation acceptable?  Attorney Arnon: \\\"Definitely not.  We live in a democratic country, and such a state of affairs is impermissible.  I am well aware that publication can be damaging -- from the standpoint of security -- but total non-publication, silence, is unacceptable. Consider the trial of Mordechai Vanunu: at least in his case we know that he was charged with aggravated espionage and sentenced to 18 years in prison.  The trial was held behind closed doors, nobody knew the details except for those who were authorized to.  It is somehow possible to understand, though not to accept, the reasons, but, as I have noted, we at least are aware of his imprisonment.\\\"  -- Why is the matter actually that serious?  Can't we trust the discretion of the court?  Attorney Arnon: \\\"The judges have no choice but to trust the presentations made to them. The judges do not have the tools to investigate.  This gives the government enormous power, power which they can misuse.\\\"  -- And what if there really is a security issue?  Attorney Arnon: \\\"I am a man of the legal system, not a security expert.  Democracy stands in opposition to security.  I believe it is possible to publicize the matter of the arrest and the charges -- without entering into detail.  We have already seen how the laws concerning publication bans can be misused, in the case of the Rachel Heller murder.  A suspect in the murder was held for many months without the matter being made public.\\\"  Attorney Shiffman, on the other hand, believes that state security can be a legitimate reason for prohibiting publication of a suspect's arrest, or of a convicted criminal's imprisonment.  \\\"A healthy situation?  Definitely not.  But I am aware of the fact that mere publication may be harmful to state security\\\".  A different opinion is expressed by attorney Uri Shtendal, former advisor for Arab affairs to Prime Ministers Levi Eshkol and Golda Meir.  \\\"Clearly, we are speaking of isolated special cases.  Such situations contrast with the principle that a judicial proceeding must be held in public. No doubt this contradicts the principle of freedom of expression.  Definitely also to the principle of individual freedom which is also harmed by the prohibition of publication.  \\\"Nevertheless\\\", adds Shtendal, \\\"the legislator allowed for the possibility of such a ban, to accommodate special cases where the damage possible as a consequence of publication is greater than that which may follow from an abridgment of the principles I've mentioned. The authority to decide such matters of publication does not rest with the Prime Minister or the security services, but with the court, which we may rest assured will authorize a publication ban only if it has been convinced of its need beyond a shadow of a doubt.\\\"  Nevertheless, attorney Shtendal agrees: \\\"As a rule, clearly such a phenomenon is undesirable. Such an extreme step must be taken only in the most extreme circumstances.\\\"\",\"I recently had to move and forgot to update my address to the Orthodox mailing list.

On the drawing you have a set of reference points whose true x,y positions are known.    Now you digitize the drawing manually (in this case, using Yaron Danon's excellent Digitize program).  That is, you use a program which converts cursor positions to x,y and saves those values when you click the mouse.  Upon digitizing you notice that the reference point values that come out of the digitizing process differ in small but significant ways from the known true values.  This is understandable because the scanned drawing is a reproduction of the original and there are successive sources of distortion such as differential expansion and contraction of paper, errors introduced in the printing process, scanner errors and what have you.  The errors are not uniform over the entire drawing, so \\\"global\\\" adjustments such as stretching/contracting uniformly over x or y, or rotating the whole drawing, are not satisfactory.  So the question is: does any kind soul know of an algorithm for removing such distortion?  In particular, if I have three sets of points   Reference(x,y) (the known true values)  DistortedReference(x,y) (the same points, with known errors)  DistortedData(x,y) (other points, with unknown errors)  what function of Reference and Distorted could I apply to DistortedData to remove the errors.  I suspect the problem could be solved by treating the distorted reference points as resulting from the projection of a \\\"bumpy\\\" 3d surface, solving for the surface and then \\\"flattening\\\" it to remove the errors in the other data points.  Any kind and informed soul out there have any ideas, or better yet, pointers to treatments of the same or similar problems?

It was looking sparse (about 40 people) until the speaker began, whereupon about 120 more people followed the loudspeakers from wherever they had been lost, and filled out the area something proud.  Mike Yacino of GOAL spoke.  One of his best throwaway lines was to remind us that all of us holders of carry permits there had been checked and certified clear of all crimes by the state; while the people in the Statehouse behind us only had to be certified clean of \\\"election fraud\\\" to hold their jobs.  Nancy Snow and Amos Hamburger were busy handing out ID buttons and sheets describing all the bills to be presented at the hearings, and telling people where to find their own representatives (and in too many cases, who they were).  Mike warned us that the committee was going to suspend its rules and discuss a bill that hadn't made it onto the official list.  It seems a delegation of students from Simon's Rock of Bard College (alma mater of Wayne Lo, who shot up the place with an SKS late last year) was being bussed in to testify for a bill to ban all sales of firearms or ammo to anyone who is not a state resident.  The hearings were originally scheduled in the (large) Gardner Auditorium at 10:30, but that had been pre-empted by the Governor's hearings on the Framingham Eight (women in prison for killing abusive husbands, and seeking release).  So we had until 1:30 to buttonhole our representatives, after which we would be squashed into an inadequate hearing room.  One of my representatives' staffers was somewhat offensively smarmy. He said, \\\"Oh, it must be gun hearings day again!  The gun lobby is always so organized every year.\\\"  I got a little pissed, and replied, \\\"I'm not from the gun lobby -- I'm from your district.\\\"  At 12:30, your second reporter arrived in time to notice a demonstration going on in front of the statehouse (where the pro-gunners weren't).  Randy Price from the TV News was there, in his mirror reflective shades, talking to one of the anti-gun types, and several Simon's Rock anti-gun \\\"close-the-loophole\\\" protestors. (Earlier, Randy had covered the GOAL rally.)  The room we had been assigned seated about 50.  Remember, there were about 160 gun owners there, plus another 20-30 students and teachers from Bard.  One of us had already reserved a seat; the other never got closer than the atrium outside -- and there was a crowd behind HIM.  A cop took up station at the entrance and prevented the rest of the crowd from coming in.  Soon after the debate started, a loudspeaker was set up outside in the hall for the benefit of everyone else.  Everyone who was there (inside and outside) got to sign up on a sheet saying what their position was on which bills.  Most of us signed up to \\\"support GOAL's position\\\" on \\\"all bills.\\\"  First, because of their time constraints, public officials got to testify.  And first up was the bill that nobody had seen (the students had some curfew, I guess).    Currently, Massachusetts law allows a non-resident to purchase long guns or ammo from a local dealer provided he complies with the laws of his own state.  Previously, the law was similar, but applied only to non-residents from states adjoining Massachusetts.  The Simon's Rock folks called the current law a \\\"loophole\\\" and wanted it closed.  Two of their reps spoke about Wayne Lo and his \\\"SKS assault rifle.\\\" The second one, Hodgekiss, a co-sponsor, had done his homework so well that he kept confusing Montana (Wayne Lo's home state) with Missouri, and became belligerent when about five gun owners in the gallery corrected him after his second muff.  Carr, from Gloucester, claimed that the new bill would put the law back the way it was, but he was lying: the new bill allows purchases by non-residents of adjoining states ONLY if they have licensing in their own state \\\"as strong as\\\" that in Massachusetts.  Since none of them do, that's that.  Some of the things these two said were really offensive.  \\\"In some of these other states, anyone can buy a gun as long as he's breathing!\\\" (Oooooo!)  \\\"We have some very, very good gun laws in Massachusetts; if only the other states would adopt the same type of laws, we wouldn't be having this situation -- but they won't.\\\"  (Naughty, naughty!)  Next up was Boston city councilman Albert \\\"Dapper\\\" O'Neill.  He was there to testify pro-gun, but in some ways he was a liability.  He's reasonably elderly and tends to wander and repeat himself, plus he's almost a caricature of a law-n-order politician.  He badmouthed the ACLU, said violent criminals should be executed, and that if he were judge, he'd give arrestees their \\\"last rights\\\" (pun intended) on the spot (at which many of the gun owners applauded, which bothered me.) He said that all the proposed gun restrictions were a step in the right direction -- for the criminals.  He said this FOUR times :-(  Two of the bills under consideration would allow police to rescind a CCW or FID, and confiscate all your guns, if someone had filed a restraining order against you.  (Note that the filing of a restraining order requires no warrant, no hearing, no evidence, and no conviction -- just an accusation.)  Senator Barrett of Reading testified in favor of it, and patronized the pro-gunners there several times by saying, \\\"I'm sure all the gun owners here will agree with me that we have to get these weapons out of the hands of people that our courts have convicted.\\\"  I haven't seen such a disgustingly disingenuous performance since Nixon whined that he wasn't a crook.  Barrett also spoke in favor of the bill making the FID card renewable every five years, instead of permanent as it is now.  The stated purpose is to remove FID cards from those who have become ineligible. \\\"Revenue has nothing to do with it.\\\"  (Yeah, right.)  Apparently, some congressmen think we're stupid enough to swallow the argument that it's preferable to process 1.6 million renewals every cycle in the vague hope of catching a recent felon than to simply take the goddamn card away from a criminal at conviction time.  As usual, hassle the law-abiding instead of the crook.  The two co-chairs of the committee were Rep. Caron and Sen. Jujuga. Jujuga didn't say much (he was a co-sponsor of both \\\"restraining order\\\" bills) but Caron struck me as a sharp guy that wouldn't let any bad logic or lies on the part of either side to go unchallenged.  (He  was a co-sponsor of one of the \\\"restraining order\\\" bills as well.)  One of the younger reps on the committee (forgot his name) was vociferously pro-gun, somewhat embarrassingly so.  His heart was in the right place, but his arguments seemed to be confined to, \\\"every year it's the same damn thing, you come in here with this crap...\\\" It's nice to have a friend on the committee, but he could have been more effective.  At about 3:00, it was clear that the hall-jam couldn't continue. Someone came out of another meeting hall and yelled at the cop because the loudspeaker was disturbing their meeting, so the loudspeaker was disconnected.  So they found a bigger hall upstairs.  One of us had to leave to catch his charter bus, and so missed the \\\"public\\\" testimony; the other got a seat this time.  Caron began by talking about how he got his FID 16 years ago, left the state, and then returned without notifying them of his address change. He complained that the state record system was not up-to-date and that his PD back in his city of birth still thought he lived there.  Great quote: \\\"If you purchase a gun today, it will not get into the state computer system until 1999.\\\"  (This was also an argument he used against the renewable FID card.)  Testimony was heard from several \\\"battered women,\\\" one of whom had been attacked by some guy in his 20's who had an FID card because he got it when he was 15 or thereabouts.  They used a lot of emotion and said how they were scared of these men.  A staffer of Attorney General Harshbarger testified in favor of this anti-gun bill, saying how 50,000 restraining orders were granted last year, and how these women needed to be protected.  Caron noted that a restraining order was granted for 10 days, and then a hearing was held to determine whether the order would be extended to a year.  He asked whether she would be satisfied if the FID were revoked at the time of this hearing rather than after the initial issuance of the FID.  She gave some long rambling circumlocution in response.  Then testimony against the bill was heard.  Mike Yacino (who looks something like Einstein) got up and made the point that restraining orders were issued on too little evidence, that judges like to issue restraining orders just to let things cool off no matter who they think is right (man or woman), and that the hearings for restraining orders are lightning sessions with little time to consider facts. Atty. Karen McNutt spoke with him a few times during his testimony.  Other pro-gunners got up to testify.  One said he had had to file a restraining order against a tenant to clear her out, and that she countered by filing one against him!  He noted that this would have allowed the state to confiscate his guns if the new bill became law. One of the junior reps noted that \\\"this is America\\\" and we have to be certain that individual rights are respected.  Senator Jujuga reiterated this, saying that \\\"people who abuse smaller people can go to Hell as far as I care, but we have to be careful about equating conviction with a restraining order.\\\"  (Point and match, Senator.)  Another pro-gunner got up and testified that he didn't know his citizenship \\\"expired every 5 years,\\\" and that a driver's license was a privilege, not a right like the right to keep and bear arms.  A third got up and said the problem was with the criminal justice system, and argued in favor of a death penalty bill and public hangings.  Senator Jujuga said he had himself tried to get a death penalty bill passed, and joking responded that he, too, favored public hangings.  The speaker then responded, \\\"I'll make you a deal.  You get me the rope, and I'll tie the noose.\\\"  Next came public testimony on the Simon's Rock bill.  A teacher testified that she had been the teacher of Wayne Lo, and that \\\"he wouldn't have been able to shoot people inside a building while he was outside\\\" without his evil gun.  She said that the \\\"loophole\\\" should be closed to prevent something like this from \\\"ever happening again\\\".  Four or five other kids testified in favor of this bill, one of spilling tears for the good legislators.  One of the students actually shot by Wayne Lo was also there.  Many of them had T shirts on, saying, \\\"As long as one person can buy a gun in anger, none of us are safe -- support gun control.\\\"  The committee was reluctant to grill or correct the kids, except for Caron, who corrected one student who had claimed that anyone could apply for an FID.  \\\"Only residents can get FID's,\\\" he said.  (How much do you want to bet that this kid had no idea he had been conned into testifying for a bill that would cut out-of-staters completely off?)  Yacino and McNutt spoke again, this time noting that the bill as written would affect both ammo AND ALL guns possessed by out-of-staters.  Karen also noted that hunters in CT, NH, and VT could be put away for a year if they wandered across the MA boundary somewhere in the woods and got challenged by game wardens.  Yacino underscored the fact that Lo COULD have gotten an FID as a resident student -- and, hell, even an CCW, as he had NO criminal or mental record.  One junior rep was upset that it would take MA residents longer to buy a gun than out-of-staters, and thought it was \\\"elitist\\\".  Another (Caron?) said that we need the protection of preventing non-residents from buying without an FID because only two other states in the union had \\\"FID-type\\\" cards, so complying with all the laws of one's home state was \\\"not enough.\\\"  One pro-gun speaker replied that this resembled a mother watching her son in a marching band and exclaiming, \\\"Everyone's out of step but Johnny!\\\"  All the Bard College people were filing out as the pro-gun testimony for this bill was made, and thus only pro-gunners were around when the other bills came under consideration.  The main bills remaining (and GOAL's position) were:  o  H.4375 and four others: Notify police chiefs so they can pull     licenses when a holder is convicted (strongly supported)  o  H.1732: Require trigger locks on all handguns sold (opposed)  o  H.962: Require trigger locks on all loaded firearms (strongly    opposed)  o  H.1350: Allow every municipality to enact their own gun laws     (opposed)  o  H.1731: Fund bullet-proof vests for municipal police (supported)  o  S.1097: State Constitutional Amendment for the RKBA (supported)  o  Several on police discretion in the issuance of FID cards (opposed)  o  Several altering non-resident license conditions (supported)  o  H.1135: Ban damn near all guns everywhere in the state (guess!)  Some of these took only 30 seconds to consider, as the remaining pro-gunners raised hands in unison either for or against them.  Mike Yacino noted that, besides the danger in screwing with a trigger lock on a loaded gun, that bill would make it illegal for a licensee to carry his concealed handgun unless it were locked.  Caron blew right through H.1350 when he saw that we opposed it. Again, he brought up the state's archaic records capability and said, \\\"This would create hundreds of different licensing systems.\\\"  The session ran late -- since it was the last scheduled hearing, it could not be adjourned until everyone who wanted to had testified.  It ended at about 6:30. -- \",\"I recently upgraded to System 7.1 and now I also upgraded my DeskWriter drivers from 2.2 to 3.1.

I guess you could do this at  each end of the slots (1 & 8) to add even more.    The 'T' connectors are simply tracks with slots on them - no electronics on it.  The only downside - your case won't close, but for a homebrew system, that may not be a problem.  Don't know about performance, though.

TRANSLATION   The Vedas deal mainly with the subject of the three modes of material nature. O Arjuna, become transcendental to these three modes. Be free from all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and safety, and be established in the self.                                    PURPORT   All material activities involve actions and reactions in the three modes of material nature. They are meant for fruitive results, which cause bondage in the material world. The Vedas deal mostly with fruitive activities to gradually elevate the general public from the field of sense gratification to a position on the transcendental plane. Arjuna, as a student and friend of Lord Krsna, is advised to raise himself to the transcendental position of Vedanta philosophy where, in the beginning, there is brahma-jijnasa, or questions on the supreme transcendence. All the living entities who are in the material world are struggling very hard for existence. For them the Lord, after creation of the material world, gave the Vedic wisdom advising how to live and get rid of the material entanglement. When the activities for sense gratification, namely the karma-kanda chapter, are finished, then the chance for spiritual realization is offered in the form of the Upanisads, which are part of different Vedas, as the Bhagavad-gita is a part of the fifth Veda, namely the Mahabharata. The Upanisads mark the beginning of transcendental life.   As long as the material body exists, there are actions and reactions in the material modes. One has to learn tolerance in the face of dualities such as happiness and distress, or cold and warmth, and by tolerating such dualities become free from anxieties regarding gain and loss. This transcendental position is achieved in full Krsna consciousness when one is fully dependent on the good will of Krsna.  Bhagavad-Gita As It is Books of A.C.

FACT SHEET                    PUBLIC ENCRYPTION MANAGEMENT  The President has approved a directive on \\\"Public Encryption Management.\\\"  The directive provides for the following:  Advanced telecommunications and commercially available encryption are part of a wave of new computer and communications technology.  Encryption products scramble information to protect the privacy of communications and data by preventing unauthorized access.  Advanced telecommunications systems use digital technology to rapidly and precisely handle a high volume of communications.  These advanced telecommunications systems are integral to the infrastructure needed to ensure economic competitiveness in the information age.  Despite its benefits, new communications technology can also frustrate lawful government electronic surveillance.  Sophisticated encryption can have this effect in the United States.  When exported abroad, it can be used to thwart foreign intelligence activities critical to our national interests.  In the past, it has been possible to preserve a government capability to conduct electronic surveillance in furtherance of legitimate law enforcement and national security interests, while at the same time protecting the privacy and civil liberties of all citizens.  As encryption technology improves, doing so will require new, innovative approaches.  In the area of communications encryption, the U. S. Government has developed a microcircuit that not only provides privacy through encryption that is substantially more robust than the current government standard, but also permits escrowing of the keys needed to unlock the encryption.  The system for the escrowing of keys will allow the government to gain access to encrypted information only with appropriate legal authorization.  To assist law enforcement and other government agencies to collect and decrypt, under legal authority, electronically transmitted information, I hereby direct the following action to be taken:  INSTALLATION OF GOVERNMENT-DEVELOPED MICROCIRCUITS  The Attorney General of the United States, or her representative, shall request manufacturers of communications hardware which incorporates encryption to install the U.S. government-developed key-escrow microcircuits in their products.  The fact of law enforcement access to the escrowed keys will not be concealed from the American public.  All appropriate steps shall be taken to ensure that any existing or future versions of the key-escrow microcircuit are made widely available to U.S. communications hardware manufacturers, consistent with the need to ensure the security of the key-escrow system.  In making this decision, I do not intend to prevent the private sector from developing, or the government from approving, other microcircuits or algorithms that are equally effective in assuring both privacy and a secure key- escrow system.  KEY-ESCROW  The Attorney General shall make all arrangements with appropriate entities to hold the keys for the key-escrow microcircuits installed in communications equipment.  In each case, the key holder must agree to strict security procedures to prevent unauthorized release of the keys.  The keys shall be released only to government agencies that have established their authority to acquire the content of those communications that have been encrypted by devices containing the microcircuits.  The Attorney General shall review for legal sufficiency the procedures by which an agency establishes its authority to acquire the content of such communications.  PROCUREMENT AND USE OF ENCRYPTION DEVICES  The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with other appropriate U.S. agencies, shall initiate a process to write standards to facilitate the procurement and use of encryption devices fitted with key-escrow microcircuits in federal communications systems that process sensitive but unclassified information.  I expect this process to proceed on a schedule that will permit promulgation of a final standard within six months of this directive. \",\"  You sonuvabitch.

This was a heresy that was condemned in the Council of Chalcedon in 451 AD.  It grew up in reaction to Nestorianism, which held that the Son and Jesus are two different people who happened to be united in the same body temporarily.  Monophysitism is held by the Copts of Egypt and Ethipoia and by the Jacobites of Syria and the Armenian Orthodox.  It believes that Jesus Christ was God (which is correct), that he was man (which is correct), that he was one person (which is correct), but that he had only one nature and one will and oen energy (which is heretical, the orthodox position is that he had two natures and two wills and two energies, both divine and human, though the wills were in perfect harmony).  That is what Mike is trying to get across, that while Jesus came in human form, Mike says He did not have a human nature or a human will.  In reality, he had both, though neither made him subject to original sin. It is interesting to note that the Monothelites were a reaction to this conflict and attempted to solve the problem by admitting two natures but not two wills or two energies.  It also was condemned, at a late council in Constantinople I believe.

First somebody was accusing him of being self-righteous and unconvincing. Now we are told that we Christians should be embarrassed by him. (As well as by Josh McDowell, about whom I have no comment, having never read his work.)  Anyone who thinks that C. S. Lewis was self-righteous ought to read his introduction to The Problem of Pain, which is his theodicy. In it, he explains that he wanted to publish the book anonymously. Why? Although he believed in the argument he was presenting, he did not want to seem to presume to tell others how brave they should be in the face of their own suffering. He did not want people to think that he was presenting himself as some kind of model of fortitude, or that he was anything other than what he considered himself to be -- \\\"a great coward.\\\"   OFM has adequately handled the question of whether we ought to be embarrassed by Lewis' liar/lunatic/lord argument (which, by the way, is part of a *much* bigger discourse.)

As all infants are in sin from the time of conception (cf Romans 5.12, Psalm 1.7), they cannot possibly merit heaven, and as purgatory is for the purging of temporal punishment and venial sins, it is impossible that origianl sin can be forgiven.  Hence, the unbaptized infants are cut off from the God against whom they, with the whole of the human race except Mary, have sinned.  Which is why Jesus said, \\\"Truly, truly I say to you, no one can enter the Kingdom of God unless he is born of water and Spirit\\\" which is the true meaning of born again (John 3.5).  Thus, as infants are in sin, it is very fair for them to be cut off from God and exlcuded from heaven.  As St. Augustine said, \\\"I did not invent original sin, which the Catholic faith holds from ancient time; but you, who deny it, without a doubt are a follower of a new heresy.\\\"  (De nuptiis, lib. 11.c.12)\",\"  I'm confused.

Adams (starowl@a2i.rahul.net)   Champaign, IL / southeast AL\",\"  This meaningless statement makes YOU look bad.  \",\" That's nothing.  When a friend of mine went shopping for a small sedan a few years ago, she brought me along as a token male so the salespeople wouldn't give her the \\\"bimbo\\\" treatment. Her first choice was a Mazda 323, and second choice was a Nissan Sentra.  We went to a Mazda dealership and described what \\\"we\\\" wanted.  We started negotiating on the price, and the salesdroid kept playing the \\\"let me run this price by the sales manager\\\".  After playing the \\\"good salesman, bad salesman\\\" game, we finally told him that if he didn't have the authority to negotiate a price, perhaps we should be speaking directly to someone who did.  He brought in the sales manager who proceeded to dick us around with every trick in the book.  (Read Remar Sutton's \\\"Don't Get Taken Every Time\\\" for a list.)  Finally, after playing a few more rounds of \\\"you'll have to work with us on this price\\\", also known as \\\"each time you come up a thousand dollars we'll come down ten\\\", the salesmanager gave a signal to his two sales cronies, stood up, and said \\\"well, we can't come down any more so I guess we can't help you\\\" and they trouped out of the room, leaving us sitting in the salesman's office all by ourselves.  Hmm. I'd read that sleazy salesmen sometimes bug their own offices so they can leave and listen in on couples discussing the sales offer, and I mentioned this aloud to my friend while we were sitting there wondering why they would leave us in the office instead of showing us to the door.  For lack of anything better to do, I picked up the phone on the desk and called another Mazda dealership, asked for a salesman, and began discussing what kind of price they would consider.  A few sentences into the conversation, Mr. Salesmanager broke into the line (!) and began telling me how rude he thought it was that I would call another dealership from \\\"his\\\" phone!  I said that since he'd announced that our business was over, he shouldn't care, and every time I tried to talk to the other sales guy the sales manager would drown out our voices with his own.  (How did he know that I was using the phone, anyway?)  Finally, I hung up and we headed out of the showroom. Sales manager and cronies come out of a little unmarked room and he begins to berate us again.  We say that we won't bother him anymore, we're going next door to the Nissan dealership.  Then comes the part I wish I could have videotaped.  As we go out the front door, the sales manager SHOUTS across the entire showroom, customers and all, \\\"Go ahead!  You DESERVE to buy a Nissan!\\\" So my friend bought a Sentra.\",\"  Ok, I was under the impression that it accepted digital input.

I will not touch another chrysler product again, no way.  I don't care how good the LH cars look good, and I will admit they look promising, but not with the support that you get.  GM isn't much better, thank god, they don't control Saturn, like they do their divisions, or it would be just another marketing ploy.    Don't get me wrong, i will be watching my car (which I do like) like a hawk for the next 4 years.  I am much more hesitant to say it (or any) car is really good, until it has proved itself to me.  But since someone else pointed out C&D as a source.  I will note, because I used to read these magazines, that Car and Driver has never had a good thing to say about most Chrysler products (Shadow for one), always were they moaning about the reguritated K-car, and engine.  Whereas Motor Trend always thought they were great cars.  No car magazine is really objective.  And although there are alot of people who don't like Consumers Reports, I will use them to reinforce my argument (I already know about the big stink with the Saturn crash tests, time will tell how good a car they are), the shadow/sundance rate much worse than average, in fact none of the chrysler's rate a better than average, I think the best one is just average.  Excluding the diamond star/mitsubishi stuff and the LH's.  You can find bad stuff about the Shadow.  Try as I might, when I researched the Saturn, I could not find anything bad about it.  There is a great deal of information about this company, just because it is a new american company and it has created quite a stir in the automotive community, for good reason.  Much more than the introduction of any new model lines of any established company.  I read an article, which had a sub-column, an I think this imprinted on me more than anything else.  Some big wig in Toyota said and I quote, \\\"We are watching them very closely.\\\"  Come on, everybody grow up, the foreign cars, especially the japanese have been kicking our butts, for good reason, the american car companies could not make a good product or support the customer the way they want these days, to set in their ways, which is one of the reasons Saturn was created.  They are still struggling because they haven't learned yet.  They have the ability, the workers are not inferior, the technology is not out of date, but their attitude is, and they are just finding this out.

Ha'aretz, 15 March 1993:  Yehoshua Matza (Likud), Chair of the Knesset Interior Committee, stated that he intends to demand that the police department make it clear to the public that anyone who wounds or kills [non-Jewish] terrorists will not be put on trial.

I applaud the enthusiam shown by the person posting <79899@cup.portal.com>  \\\"Thyagi@cup.portal.com\\\" (I read in alt.magick), but I differ with him/her in believing that at least some minimal parameters  should be agreed upon.    But if we don't limit it to *something*, the discussion degenerates into a big amorphous glob.   Other questions Thyagi proposes are:   It seems to me that these questions more properly fall into the category of \\\"general metaphysics\\\". I would prefer any misc.taoism to deal more closely with topics and works more closely associated with at least \\\"semi-orthodox\\\" Taoism: with established classic works  definitely included and works like Mantak Chia's argued about!   I think \\\"neo-Taoism\\\" should be excluded or get its own group (what I mean by this is \\\"Humpty-Dumpty Taoism\\\", in which Taoism means whatever  a poster says it means.) This \\\"alt.taoism\\\" could also be a refuge  for debates about what \\\"Taoism *REALLY* means\\\" or speculations on sexual alchemy, etc..  e.g. (from Thyagi again):  Kent gloomily predicts (quoting from Thyagi's article):   I think that discussions of this nature are not completely out of place. What's happening is that that the term \\\"Taoism\\\" is becoming completely polluted and trivialized like the words \\\"magic\\\", \\\"Alchemy\\\",  \\\"Zen,\\\" etc., by writers appropriating the word to mean whatever they  want. This is seen by the spate of new age books entitled \\\"The Tao of\\\" this, that, and everything else. (With respect to some exceptions like the books by Jou, Tsung-Hwa.)  Any other comments/ideas? I look forward to seeing them. On balance, I say let misc.taoism rip and let the chips fall where they may.

Thanks! \",\" Ben,  Since you're obviously adept enough to understand how the trackball works, the only thing short of repairing it that I can think of is a thorough cleaning of all the parts, and then checking for the proper placement of the little blue rollers. Since they aren't fixed in position on their stainless steel pins, you might try sliding them into a slightly different position. On my PowerBook 100, I can slide them almost completely out of contact with the trackball. In fact, one of the notes from sumex on fixing the trackball advocates sliding the roller so that its _edge_ contacts the ball, not the center cylindrical area.  I've done this with my PB100, and it does seem to improve the feel, but needs to be adjusted from time to time. I just popped open one of our office's PB170s, and while there isn't as much latitude for movement, one could still adjust the roller slightly. If your PB140 is the same it might help.  I would suspect the most likely culprit to be a slippery blue roller. If you can take it out, clean it with a mild soapy solution, or isopropyl  alcohol. Also, be sure the ball is grease-free.  If you drop the ball in minus the retaining ring, roll the ball and see if it is actually causing the axle to spin.   If all this still doesn't solve it, then maybe a new one is in order. :-( It could be an electrical connection, in which case replacement would be necessary. But my experience with both mice and trackballs has been that dirt has been the normal problem, not an electrical malfunction.

Randy Weaver/Kevin Harris trial update: Day 4.  Friday, April 16, 1993 was the fourth day of the trial.  Synopsis: Defense attorney Gerry Spence cross-examined agent Cooper under repeated objections from prosecutor Ronald Howen.  Spence moved for a mistrial but was denied.  The day was marked by a caustic cross-examination of Deputy Marshal Larry Cooper by defense attorney Gerry Spence.  Although Spence has not explicitly stated so, one angle of his stategy must involve destroying the credibility of agent Cooper.  Cooper is the government's only eyewitness to the death of agent Degan. Spence attacked Cooper's credibility by pointing out discrepancies between Cooper's statements last September and those made in court. Cooper conceded that, \\\"You have all these things compressed into a few seconds...It's difficult to remember what went on first.\\\"  Cooper acknowledged that he carried a \\\"9mm Colt Commando submachine gun with a silenced barrel.\\\" [I thought a Colt Commando was a revolver!] Cooper continued by stating that the federal agents had no specific plans to use the weapon when they started to kill Weaver's dog.  When Spence asked how seven cartridges could be fired by Degan's M-16 rifle when Degan was apparently dead, Cooper could not say for sure that Degan did not return fire before going down.  Spence continued by asking with how many agents (and to what extent) had Cooper discussed last August's events, Cooper responded, \\\"If you're implying that we got our story together, you're wrong, counselor.\\\"  Spence continued to advance the defense's version of the events: Namely, that a marshal had started the shooting by killing the Weaver's dog.  Cooper disagreed.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Ronald Howen repeatedly objected to Spence's virulent cross-examination of agent Cooper, arguing that the questions were repetitive and Spence was wasting time.  Howen also complained  that Spence was improperly using a cross-examination to advance the defense's version of the events.  U.S. District Judge Edward Lodge sustained many of the objections; however, both lawyers persisted until Judge Lodge had the jury leave the room and proceded to admonish both attorneys.  \\\"I'm not going to play games with either counsel.  This has been a personality problem from day 1, so start acting like professionals.\\\"  Spence told the judge that, \\\"When all the evidence is in, we'll see that ... his [agent Larry Cooper] testimony is not credible, that he was panicked and cannot remember the sequence of events.\\\"  Spence continued, \\\"We're going to find...that there is a very unlikely similarity - almost as if it had come out of a cookie cutter - between the testimony of Mr. Cooper and the other witnesses.\\\"  Spence then moved for a mistrial on the grounds that Howen's repeated objections would prevent a fair trial, \\\"We can't have a fair trial if the jury believes I'm some sort of charlatan, if the jury believes I'm bending the rules or engaging in some delaying tactic or that I'm violating court orders.\\\"  Judge Lodge called the notion that his repeated sustainings of Howen's objections had somehow prejudiced the jury was \\\"preposterous\\\" and denied the motion for a mistrial.  Lodge did tell Howen to restrict his comments when objecting.  The trial resumed with the prosecution calling FBI Special Agent Greg Rampton.  The prosecution's purpose was simply to introduce five weapons found in the cabin as evidence: However, the defense seized on the opportunity to further address Cooper's credibility.  Defense attorney Ellison Matthews (Harris' other attorney) questioned Rampton about the dog.  Rampton stated that there were no specific plans to kill the Weaver's dog without being detected.  Matthews then had Rampton read  a Septtember 15, 1992 transcript in which Rampton had said that Cooper had said that the purpose of the silenced weapon was to kill the dog without being detected, if the dog chased them. Rampton then acknowledged that he believed that Cooper had said that, but he could not remember when.  He then stated that, \\\"I did not conduct the primary interview with Deputy Cooper, but I have had conversations with him since the interview was conducted.\\\"\",\"Boy that was really humorous.

The question is how much that quality is worth to a ham in amateur service, not commercial service   Ok, great. But how often does that come up?  How good is \\\"good enough\\\", and how much is someone willing to pay for it? A good ham-quality HT is maybe $500, while a commercial quality one is maybe $2000. Is the increased reliability and performance worth 4 times the price *in amateur service*? Only the individual involved can answer that question, and each ham has to decide for him/herself.  If Motorola quality is worth 4 times the price to you, then more power to ya'. But I'm amazed that folks make that choice. For, me, given that I've got $2000 to spend, I'l pick the Yaesu ht and a nice new HF rig every time over a Motorola ht alone, no matter how good it is.  To me, ham-quality gear is \\\"good enough\\\". To each his own...  73... Mike, N4PDY\",\" After IBM had invented the DES and the NBS had advertised for proposals, but before IBM had decided to respond, I argued strenuously that they  should not; they should keep it proprietary.   The biggest proponent of proposing was Dr. Lewis Branscomb.  Dr. Branscomb was the IBM Chief Scientist and had come to IBM from NBS.  Fortunately for all of us, Dr. Branscomb understood the answer to the above question much better than I.  He realized how difficult it would be to gain acceptance for any cryptographic mechanism.  Because of the necessary complexity, publicity would not be sufficient and neither would  authority.  In fact, it has taken both of those plus more than 15  years.  We have also had independence.  The DES was solicited by NBS, invented and proposed by IBM, and vetted by NBS.  It has also been examined and vetted by experts like Adi Shamir, who are not subject to influence by any of these.  Even now, there are still people posting on this list who do not trust the DES in spite of all the time, all of the analysis, and all of the public scrutiny.  (Of course, it is just this point that NIST misses when it attempts to  gain acceptance for a novel mechanism, developed in secret, on the basis of authority alone.)  We had a long thread here about whether or not the NSA can \\\"break\\\" the DES.  That is a silly question.  At some cost and in some time they can \\\"break\\\" anything.  The important question is at what cost and in what time.  The fundamental strength of the DES and RSA are not nearly so important as what we know about their strength.  As long as we understand the cost and duration for an attacker, then we can use them in a safe way. At this point, we may never replace either because of the inability of any successor to overcome this knowledge gap.  DES and RSA are among the most significant inventions of the century and the most important inventions in the history of cryptography. We are damned lucky to have them.\",\"    On Palm Sunday at our parish, we were \\\"invited\\\" to take the role of Jesus in the Passion.  I declined to participate.  Last year at the liturgy meeting I pointed out how we crucify Christ by our sins, so therefore it is appropriate that we retain the role of the crowd, but to no avail.      As a member of a liturgy committee, I can tell you that the problem is certain people dominating, who want to try out all kinds of innovations.  The priests don't seem even to _want_ to make any decisions of their own in many cases.  I guess it's easier to \\\"try something new\\\" than it is to refuse to allow it.     At our parish on Holy Thursday, instead of the priests washing feet (\\\"Who wants to get around people's feet,\\\" according to one of our priests) the congregation was \\\"invited\\\" to come up and help wash one another's hands.     The symbolism of this action distressed me, and again I refused to participate.  I thought that if we were to have to come up with rubrics for this liturgical action (i.e. \\\"Body of Christ\\\" -- \\\"Amen\\\" for receiving Communion), that they could be \\\"I am not responsible for the blood of this man.\\\"     Also for part of the Eucharistic Prayer (\\\"Blessed are You, God of all creation...\\\") was substituted some text read by a lay couple.  The priest certainly should not have given this part of the Mass over to others, and I was so disturbed that I declined to receive Communion that night (we aren't required to anyway -- I instead offered up prayers for our priests and parish).      The quality of the Mass has not changed.  Again, if it were to be celebrated according to the rubrics set down by the Church, it would still be \\\"liturgically\\\" beautiful.  The problem comes about from people trying to be \\\"creative\\\" who are not.     I think the answer to your question on participation could be that given by Father Peter Stravinskas in answer to the question posed by the title of Thomas Day's _Why Catholics Can't Sing_.  \\\"They don't want to\\\" because of all this nonsense.     By the way, for any non-Catholics reading this, the problem does not reflect bad liturgy by the Catholic Church, but by those who are disobedient to the Church in changing it on their own \\\"authority.\\\"\",\" There is a mini-epidemic of Coccidiodes that is occurring in, I believe, the Owen's Valley/ Bishop area east of the Sierras.

It's somewhat ironic that our exposure to bigotry happens in this instance to have originated in rec.scouting, since I always understood scouting to teach tolerance and diversity.  I understand bigotry to be irrational prejudice against other people who happen to be of a different race, religion, ethnic background, sex, or other inconsequential characteristics.  All the evidence I've seen indicates that sexual orientation and lack of belief in gods are exactly such inconsequential characteristics.  Thus, pending further evidence, I conclude that those who show prejudice against such people are bigots, and organizations that exclude such people are discriminatory.\",\"  How many NuBus slots do you have?

But I can't guarantee that I'm not way off base...  The permenant swap file is read/written to by windows by talking directly to the hard disk controller card.  The controller card must use the protocal set up by western digital (or something like that). Windows creates a file called spart.par in your windows directory that points to that file.  It then uses the physical information about your disk to index to information in that file.  compressed disks are actually \\\"logical\\\" disks.  These disks have different characteristics than the actual physical disk.  Furthermore, the information on the compressed disks must be uncompressed before it is used.  (i.e it must go through the decompression program that traps disk reads at the operating system level or the BIOS level).  Because of this \\\"inbetween\\\" program, windows cannot use direct methods to read from the \\\"logical\\\" disk.  a permenant swap file is only there to \\\"reserve\\\" an area of the disk that windows can use and to block that space from DOS.  Windows would theoretically not even have to access the file from DOS to use that disk space. (I don't know if it does or doesn't...but it checks for it somewhere everytime you boot windows.)  a temporary swap file is just a normal DOS file that is accessed by windows via DOS and the BIOS.  If a disk compression program or other TSR is loaded the file access must go through DOS...TSR'S (disk compression)...and BIOS in order to be access. (i.e. NEVER USE A TEMPORARY SWAP FILE...NEVER)  more on permenent swap files...  i'm sure everyone who has an uncompressed part of their compressed hard disk has seen the message \\\"you have selected a swap file greater than the suggested size...windows will only use the size suggested...do you wan't to create this swap file anyway\\\" or something like that.  well, a friend of mine (ROBERT) called microsoft and asked them what and why. what they said is that windows checks the amount of free disk space and divides that number by 2.  Then it checks for the largest contiguous block of free disk space.  Windows then suggests the smaller of the two numbers.  They also said that under absolutely no circumstances...NONE!...will windows uses a swap file larger than the suggested size.  Well...that's what he  said!  I call bull@#$#.

I can't help but wonder what would happen if all violence against Israelis stopped.  Hopefully, violence against Arabs would stop at the same time.  If a state of non-violence could be  maintained, perhaps a state of cooperation could be achieved, i.e., greater economic opportunities for both peoples living in the \\\"territories\\\".    Of course, given the current leadership of Israel, your way may work also - but if that leadership changes, e.g., to someone with Ariel Sharon's mentality, then I would predict a considerable loss of life, i.e., no winners.

In any case, that has nothing to do with the current case.  The claim against the ADL is that it illegally obtained and disseminated information that was gathered by state and/or federal agencies in the course of their standard interaction with citizens such as myself.  By that I refer to things such as: address and phone number, vehicle registration and license information, photographs, etc.   You should ask the ADL, if you want an authoritative answer.  My guess is that they collected information on anyone who did or might engage in political criticism of Israel.  I further believe that they did this as agents of the Israeli government, or at least in agreement with them. At least some of the information collected by the ADL was passed on to Israeli officials.  In some cases it was used to influence, or attempt to influence, people's access to jobs or public forums.  These matters will be brought out as the court case unfolds, since California law entitles people to compensation if such actions can be proven.

A few points need to be clarified:  The Equipment GROUNDING conductor, Green, green with a yellow stripe, bare, or the metal sheath or pipe of SOME wiring methods, is used as a safety ground, to carry fault currents back to the circuit breaker panel, and to limit the voltage on the metal case of utilization equipment or other metal objects.  It should never (except for a few exceptions to be discussed later) carry the normal operating current of a connected load.  Some equipment has filters in the power supply which may cause some slight current flow through the grounding conductor.    Much communications or audio equipment is sensitive to noise or slight voltages on the grounding conductor, and may require special wiring of the grounding conductors to provide reliable operation  (\\\"orange\\\" outlets are often used for this, with insulated grounding conductors wired back to the panel box, and in many cases back to the service.  Anyone installing such a system should read both the section on grounding in the National Electric Code and publications on installing quiet isolated ground systems.  The code requires the insulated grounding conductors (green wires) to run with the current carrying conductors back to the panel box, and, if required, back all the way to the service entrance , where it is bonded to the service ground (water pipe or rod)  Many of these systems are installed illegally or unsafely, where they do not provide a safe ground or a quiet ground or either.   The GROUNDED conductor of a circuit, often called the NEUTRAL, which is referred to in the code as the \\\"identified\\\" conductor and is supposed to be white or natural grey.  This conductor is supposed to be connected to ground in most electrical systems at a single point, generally at the service entrance panel.  This connection is through the Main Bonding Jumper.  (In many household service panels, the main bonding jumper is actually a bonding screw which attaches the neutral busbar to the case of the panel)    The Grounded conductor (neutral) is generally a current carrying conductor.  In the case of a 120 volt circuit it is one of the two conductors completing the circuit from the panel to the load device.    Since the grounded conductor (neutral) is only connected to the grounding conductor (bare or green) at the service entrance, if the load is any distance from the service and draws any significant current, there will be a small but measurable voltage between the grounded and grounding conductors at the load, under normal operating conditions.  If you should (incorrectly) connect the grounded (neutral) conductor to the grounding conductor at the load, some of the neutral current will flow instead through the grounding conductor.  Since there will now be current flowing through the grounding conductor, it will also no longer be quite at ground potential at the load end.  If the load equipment has a metal case, which is connected to the grounding conductor through the \\\"U\\\" ground plug, the metal case is now also no longer quite at ground potential.  The difference (under normal, non short-circuit conditions) may be only a few tenths of a volt, but it could also be a volt or two.  This normally does not present a shock hazard.    HOWEVER, if you let the metal case of the grounded equipment come into contact with an independently grounded object such as a water or gas pipe, a radiator, a metal air conditioning duct or such, part of the neutral current will try to flow through this aalternate ground path.  If the contact is not solid, you will get a significant arc (a low voltage, but possibly moderate current arc) Under the wrong conditions, this arcing could start a fire.  It is possible in some cases that the sneak ground current   could also flow through a wire of inadequate size, causing it to overheat.  With the incorrect non single-point grounding of the neutral, if there is a short circuit from hot to neutral, the high short circuit current which may flow will cause a much higher voltage on the grounding conductor, which increases the possibility for shock or fire.    Also if you incorrectly multiply connect the neutral and ground, the voltage on the ground system is seen as noise bu computer or audio equipment, often causing malfunction.  I have spent some hours tracking down such shorts in technical facilities where they were inducing severe hum into equipment.  The Neutral is usually bonded to the ground at the distribution transformer as well as at the service entrance of each dwelling.  This is done primarily for lightning protection, so that induced lightning currents have a short path back to ground, and also to assure that the currents drawn by shorts to grounded objects like pipes draw enough current to trip circuit breakers or blow fuses quickly.  The bad side of this is that not all the neutral current from the dwelling goes through the neutral wire back to the transformer.  Some of it flows through the grounding electrode (water pipe, etc.) this may cause corrosion in the pipes and possibly in things like underground fuel oil tanks, and it may also cause measurable AC magnetic fields due to the large loop between the \\\"hot\\\" conductors in the service and the neutral current in the water pipe and ground.  There are those who feel these fields may be unhealthy.  (don't flame ME on this, I'm just telling you where the field comes from, not it's health effect, as far as I'm concerned, the jury is still out on this.)  Note that the bonding jumper is only installed at the main panel, NOT at any sub distribution panels.  This is one reason why it is illegal to run service entrance cable with the sheath used as a neutral to a sub panel, you must have a seperate insulated conductor for the neutral.  The sheath can be used in this application only as the groundING conductor.  If the neutral is bonded to the grounding conductor in the sub panel, say by forgetting to remove the bonding screw, all the grounding conductors of the loads on that panel will be above ground, with the possible problems listed above.  The code makes exceptions for ranges and dryers, as well as feeds from one building to another.  In the cases of the range and dryer, the neutral may be used as the equipment ground under certain conditions, instead of a seperate wire.  Every time the code is revised, these exceptions come up for review.  These exceptions were, in fact the first required safety grounds, in the days before U ground outlets and such.  The appliance manufacturers don't want to have to redesign their ranges and driers, and the contractors don't want to have to run four wire cable (with four fairly heavy, expensive wires) in place of three wire to the appliances.  No question it would be safer with seperate neutrals to the stove, but the neutral current is low for most burner settings (since most current is in the 220 volt \\\"hots\\\" except at some low settings, the wires are large gauge, and there are few reported cases of injury or damage.  So far, the exceptions have survived. In the case of feeds between buildings, it's primarily for lightning protection.  People doing wiring should be aware what is and what isn't a legal grounding conductor.  Obviously, the bare wire in \\\"romex\\\" 'with ground' is.  Anywhere there is a green wire installed, such as in a portable cord, that is a good grounding conductor.  The sheath of BX clamped in BX connectors in metal boxes is a legal grounding conductor (in the US). (BX has an aluminum band run under the steel sheath to lower the resistance of the sheath.  You can just cut this aluminum band off at the ends, you don't have to bond it to anything, it does its job by touching every turn of the BX sheath.) Conduit or EMT (thinwall tubing) is generally a legal grounding conductor, but may require a bonding locknut where it enters a box or panel, particularly for larger pipes.    \\\"Greenfield\\\" (looks like big BX, but you pull your own wires in the empty sheath after you run it) is NOT a legal grounding conductor, as it doesn't have the aluminum band to bond it, and the spiral steel has too much resistance and inductance.  You have to run a seperate green grounding conductor inside the greenfield.  \\\"Wiremold\\\" is also not a legal grounding conductor, as the paint on the boxes often prevents good contact, and the \\\"feed\\\" to the wiremold extension is often from a box in the wall that may not be well connected to the first wiremold box.  I have personally discovered cases where the entire run of wiremold and the cases of everything plugged into all the outlets on the run were \\\"hot\\\" with 120 volts (Why do I get a shock every time I touch my computer and the radiator here in the office?) because there was no ground wire in the wiremold and one of the outlets had shorted to the edge of the wiremold box.  You must run a ground wire back in the wiremold from the outlets at least to the first box in the original wiring (conduit, BX, etc.) where you can \\\"bond\\\" the wire to the box with a screw, bnding clip, or whatever.  On another issue, while you should ground the green wire/lug on GCFI outlets when ever there is a place to ground them, it is legal in the NEC to use them without a ground if no ground is available.  It is better to have the protection of the Ground fault interrupter than no protection if you don't install it.  The interrupter doesn't depend on the ground to trip.  It is desirable to connect the ground if available, because if the ground is connected, the interrupter will trip as soon as a faulty device is plugged in, whereas without the ground, it will not trip until someone or something provides a ground path.  For those questioning the legal use of ungrounded GCFI's, read in the NEC, 210-7 (d) exception. (This is the 1990 code, my '93 code is in the city, but I know the rule hasn't changed.  It might be renumbered though.)   We have only touched the surface concerning grounding ;-} , there is much more to this subject, but most of you have fallen asleep by now.

Yep, that Kevin Mitchell.  I never would have expected him in the #1 spot.  It's no accident that the first two names are 1988 only.  As with first and second base, 1988 was the year of the glove.  Average DA was 20 points higher in both leagues than any other year.  Looks good.  Too bad he's moving to short.  Highest five-year regular, though he's only had one year as good as Kevin Mitchell :->.  The other elite fielders in the league.  This is an interesting line.  His 1988 figure was slightly below average. His 1990 was pathetic, and his 1991 was the next best year by anybody.  Part of that may be his mobility.  1988 was with the Yankees.  1990 was with the Padres, who appear to have a rotten infield.  1991 was with the Twins, and judging by Leius and Gaetti, the Metrodome may be a good place to play third.  Add another to the elite fielders list.  Too fielders whose career average may overstate their value.  I don't know what happened to Caminiti -- judging by the three previous years, his low 1992 may be a fluke.  Sabo is merely average, however.  His incredible 1988 (best year ever) brings his average up a lot.  Strange last two years.  According to reputation, one of the best fielders ever at third base. But at the end, he was below average.  (Average in 1988 was .643).  Boggs has been pretty good.  I don't know what happened in 1990, but every other year he has been above average, usually by quite a bit.  Last year -- a fluke or a portent?  Why is it that the two leagues usually have defensive averages very close to one another, but very different from year to year?  Any ideas?  Brook  is declining.  Three first-time regulars, above average in 1992.  I'm not sure why Jefferies gets all the grief about his fielding.  He's never had a good year, but while at second he improved to become an average fielder, and is an average fielder at third.  Zeile, on the other hand, is a below average fielder.  Each year he's about 10 points below average.  And it's probably not just the park, since Terry Pendleton had excellent DAs in the three years before this.  Moving back to second was a good idea.  So why is Hayes supposed to be good defensively?  He's had a grand total of one year above the league DA, and was pretty bad last year.  Howard Johnson and Carney Lansford -- separated at birth.  To his credit, HoJo did have one above average year (1990).  Lansford couldn't even break the .600 mark without the help of the year of the glove.  Good hitter, but his fielding needs work.  Not a good fielder.  Both are better off at shortstop.  Two consecutive horrible years for Leo.  Camden Yards doesn't seem to have helped his fielding any.    Texas slugger debuts with not only the lowest career DA, but the lowest DA at third ever.  Congratulations, Dean. --  Dale J.

I saw it.  Lankford was hurt, although the announcer said he told Torre he  could pinch hit if they needed him to.  I wondered the same thing.  But giving Joe the benefit of the   doubt, I'd say he was thinking that Lankford is hurt enough that  he didn't trust his ability to bat effectively but he wants his  speed on the bases so pinch run him.  Alicea I was completely  confused about.  Maybe he had a good record hitting against that  particular pitcher?  I don't know.  Anybody got an idea?  Well, so far I haven't seen much to say Whiten shouldn't be playing  but it is too bad that Gilkey is the odd man out when they play   Jordan ahead of him.  That I don't quite understand.  Yup, I looked for this on the replay too.  If I'm Joe Torre, I'm  going to have a talk with Bucky after the game on that one.  He's  got Lankford at third with Todd Zeile I believe - a hot hitter -   coming up - there's no reason to risk giving Lankford the go sign   in that situation unless he was sure the ball is going to the stands.    It's his job to watch the play develop - he should have known Larkin   was there to back up a bad throw.  That seemed inexcusable in my book.    BTW, I saw Dent do the same thing last year with Zeile rounding third   and going into a sure out at home in a critical situation.  On the   replay, there's Dent waving him around.  It looks like this might be a   serious problem.  The Card's weren't good base runners at all last year   and I wonder how much of the fault lies in the base coaching.

This feature adjusts the endpoints of lines so that the displayed line looks better on low resolution devices.  The PostScript literature explains the process to some extent.  They also give an example of how to \\\"emulate\\\" strokeadjust in PostScript environments where it is absent.  The suggested emulation is to modify the coordinates of the endpoints of a line using the following formula for each coordinate:   new_coord = (round (old_coord - 0.25)) + 0.25   Doing this we end up with all coordinates ending in \\\".25\\\".

Christians are by faith \\\"citizens of the commonwealth of Israel\\\"   (Ephesians 2:11-12), and also recognise that \\\"God rules in the kingdoms of   men\\\", and therefore we should not be taking part in any of the struggles   of those nations which we are not part of due to our faith.  We are to be \\\"strangers and pilgrims\\\" amongst the nations, so we are just   passing through, and not part of any nation or any national aspirations   (this can also be applied to politics etc, but that's another story). We   are not supposed to \\\"strive\\\" or \\\"resist evil\\\" (even \\\"suffer yourselves to   be defrauded\\\") it is therefore incosistent for us to strive to assist in   preserving a state which Christ will destroy when he returns to set up   God's kingdom.  Our duty to the state.  \\\"Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar's and unto God   the things which be God's\\\" (Luke 20:25). \\\"Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power   but of God; the powers that be are ordained of God. Whosoever resisteth   the power, resisteth the ordinance of God\\\" (Rom 13:1-2). \\\"Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake; whether   it be to king as supreme... for so is the will of God that with well doing   ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men\\\" (1 Pet 2:13-15)  These scriptures make it clear that submission to the powers that be is a   divine command, but it is equally clear from Acts 5:19-29 that when any   ordinance of man runs counter to God's law, we must refuse submission to   it. The reason for this is that we are God's \\\"bond servants\\\" and His   service is our life's task. An example of the type of thing is in Col   3:22-23 where bondservants were to \\\"work heartily as unto the Lord\\\" - so   also we should work as if our boss was God - i.e. \\\"Pressed down, shaken   together, and running over\\\"... oops - a bit of a side track there...  In the contests between the nations, we are on God's side - a side that is   not fighting in the battle, but is \\\"testifying\\\" to the truth.  When we believe in God and embrace His promises, we become \\\"fellow   citizens with the Saints and of the Household of God\\\", and are no longer   interested in associations of the world. Think of this in relation to   unions etc as well. Paul tells us to \\\"lay aside every weight\\\" that we may   run \\\"the race that is set before us\\\", and if we are wise, we will discard   any association which would retard our progress - \\\"Thou therefore endure   hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. No man that warreth entangleth   himself with the affairs of this life, that he may please him who hath   chosen him to be a soldier\\\" (2 Tim 2:3-4).  One of these entanglements he warns about is \\\"be ye not unequally yoked   together with unbelievers\\\". One of the obvious applications of this is   marriage with unbelievers, but it also covers things like business   partnerships and any other position where we may form a close association   with any person or persons not believing the truth about God (in this case   the army). The principle comes from Deut 22:10 - remember that as well as   them being different animals of different strengths, one was clean and one   unclean under the law. These ideas are strongly stressed in 2 Cor 6:13-18   - I suggest you read this. The yoking also has another aspect - that of   servitude, and Jesus says \\\"take my yoke upon you\\\", so we are then yoked   with Christ and cannot be yoked with unbelievers. We have already seen   that we are bondservants of Christ, and Paul says \\\"become not ye the   bondservants of men (1 Cor 7:23 RV).  An example from the Old Testament: the question is asked in 2 Chr 19:2   \\\"Shouldest thou help the ungodly...?\\\". The situation here is a good   example of what happens when you are yoked together with unbelievers.   Jehoshaphat was lucky to escape with his life. Here are the facts: 1. He had made an affinity with Ahab, who had \\\"sold himself to work   wickedness before the Lord\\\" (1 Kings 21:25). 2. When asked by Ahab to form a military alliance, he had agreed and said   \\\"I am as thou art, my people as thy people\\\" (1 Kings 22:4) - an unequal   yoking. 3. He sttod firm in refusing the advice of the false prophets and insisted   on hearing the prophet of the Lord (trying to do the right thing), he   found that he was yoked and therefore couldn't break away from the evil   association he had made.  God says to us \\\"Come out from among them and be ye separate, and touch not   the unclean thing, and I will receive you and ye shall be my sons and   daughters\\\" (2 Cor 6:17).  This is more or less what I have found out so far - I'm still looking into   it, as I don't think I've answered all the questions raised by Alastair   yet. Heres a summary and a few things to think about:  The Christian in under command. Obedience to this command is an essential   factor in his relationship with Christ (John 15:10,14).  Total dedication to this course of action is required (Romans 12:1-2).  Disobedience compromises the close relationship between Christ and his   followers (1 Pet 2:7-8).  We are to be separated to God (Rom 6:4). This involves a master-servant   relationship (Rom 6:12,16).  No man can serve two masters (Matt 6:24,13,14).  All that is in the 'Kosmos' is lust and pride - quite opposed to Gos (1   John 2:16). Christs kingdom is not of this world (i.e. not worldly in   nature) - if it was, his servants would fight to deliver him. If Christ is   our master and he was not delivered by his servants because his kingdom   was not of this world, then his servants cannot possibly fight for another   master.  Strangers and pilgrims have no rights, and we cannot swear allegiance to   anyone but God.  The servant of the Lord must not war but be gentle to all (2 Tim 2:24) -   this does not just apply to war, but also to avoiding strife throughout   our lives. There is a war to be waged, not with man's weapons (2 Cor   10:3-4), but with God's armour (Eph6:13-20).  I'll probably post some more when I've had time to look into things a bit   further. \",\"I have an external hard drive I wish to use as startup disk. problem is, when I switch on the mac, it boots on the internal HD, but when I restart  (warm boot) the mac, it boots from the external. how do I make  it boot directly from the external ?  please email replies if possible.  thanks in advance.\",\"  RIX's files with the extension  .sci and .scf are just a RAW file with a 256 color palette.

The greatest danger of the escrow database, if it were kept on disk, would be the chance that a complete copy could somehow leak out.  You can design lots of protection, but with enough corruption a complete copy is always possible.   Storing it on paper or something very hard to copy at once may actually make sense.  Or a medium that can't be copied -- for example, something with very slow access times or which leaves a destructive trail if it is even read.  Of course then it's hard to backup.  However, I think the consequences of no backup -- the data is not there when a warrant comes -- are worse than the consequences of a secret backup.  An audit trail that reveals when data has been access, that *can't* be erased by the humans involved, is also necessary.\",\"Just my luck.

In 1974, Turkey had a democratic goverment and free press at that time.  Forget about internal news agencies, I haven't heard anything from any international source about any concentration camps with Greek Cypriot prisoners in Turkey. However, I heard Adana POW camp.  It was not secret and well  recognized POW camp.    I see,  They vanished in Turkish labor camps.  Turks have decided to acknowledge their existence first but later changed their minds releasing them.  Is that it?  What do you think happened to them?  I thought that MIA's are only the subject  of Rambo and Chuck Noris movies.  Seems that I am wrong.   You don't need to belive me.  Turkiye was never a clandestine state in its history,  It has been a respected and continuous member of UN  since the inception of UN.  No body ever questioned the UN membership of Turkey because of what had happened in 1974a and after.  Only a short  lived arms embargo was imposed unilaterally by USA to satisfy the  internal Greek loby.  I know what you would say next.  Let me answer it before wasting anytime.  Yes!  UN had a few condemning resolutions  against Turkey because of handling the Cyprus problem, especially after the 1980 coup.  Well, US and Israel had a few too.  What can I say? I am sure during Athens Junta duruing 1960-74, Greeks had their own share too.   Have you looked at the latest UN agenda for Cyprus talks mediated by Gali?  There was no issue whatsoever about any missing people among the negotiating parties.  was there? I heard many times from Denktas interviews by Turkish and International press.  He keeps saying that \\\"This was no longer an issue for peace talks.\\\"  Also, you don't want me fish for the Greek Cypriot politician's words (that Argic had posted zillion times) describing missing peoples as  a Greek-Cypriot myth.  Seems that there is a different opinions  among Greek-Cypriots as well about missing people in Turkish  custody.  [..]   I am not claiming anything.  I just told you what was given to Greek Cypriots as an answer by Turkish Goverment/Turkish Cypriots when they wanted to locate some of their own between July 15 and the final cease-fire in late August, 1974.  This answer seems to satisfy the international  community, the UN, and the Vasilu Goverment (since he did not make it an issue for the peace talks).  Also, I am not aware of any UN condemnation against Turkey about any missing Greek-Cypriot.  Are you?    BTW, do you mean that Nicos Sampson had a bloodless coup d'eta and nobody got hurt in those events?     Like I said before.  There is even a different opinion among Greek-Cypriots for this myth.

They enligthen ??? the use of S1 and S2 for keygeneration. ------------------------------------------- Date: Mon, 19 Apr 93 08:51:57 EDT From: denning@cs.cosc.georgetown.edu (Dorothy Denning) Subject: Re:  Clipper Chip  I just had another conversation with NSA to clarify some of the features of Clipper.  Please feel free to distribute this and my other messages on Clipper.  The name of the encryption algorithm is \\\"Skipjack.\\\"  Martin Hellman had written                  and the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part                 message which will then be encrypted under the system key SK                 producing                       E{ E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number;  SK}  To which I responded:          My understanding is that E[M; K] is not encrypted under SK (called the         \\\"family key\\\") and that the decrypt key corresponding to SK is held by         law enforcement.  Does anyone have first hand knowledge on this?  I was correct in that E[M; K] is not encrypted under SK.  However, Skipjack being a single-key system, there is, of course, not a separate decrypt key for the family key SK.          The unit key, also called the \\\"chip key,\\\" is generated from the         serial number N as follows.  Let N1, N2, and N3 be 64 bit blocks         derived from N, and let S1 and S2 be two 80-bit seeds used as keys.         Compute the 64-bit block                  R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1]          (Note that this is like using the DES in triple encryption mode with         two keys.)  Similarly compute blocks R2 and R3 starting with N2 and N3.         (I'm unlear about whether the keys S1 and S2 change.  The fact that         they're called seeds suggests they might.)  Then R1, R2, and R3 are         concatenated together giving 192 bits.  The first 80 bits  form K1 and         the next 80 bits form K2.  The remaining bits are discarded.  The seeds S1 and S2 do not change.   The whole process is performed on a laptop computer, and S1 and S2 are supplied by two independent people so that no one person knows both.  The same S1 and S2 are used during an entire \\\"programming session\\\" to generate keys for a stream of serial numbers.  Everything is discarded at the end (the computer could be thrown out if desired).  The serial number is 30 bits and the values N1, N2, and N3 are formed by padding the serial number with fixed 34-bit blocks (separate padding for each value).  The resulting keys K1 and K2 are output onto separate floppy disks, paired up with their serial number.  Each pair is stored in a separate file.  The floppy disks are taken away by two separate people on behalf of the two escrow agencies.

Please remark, that in posting this, I do not automatically agree with it's contents and implications. So don't swamp my mailbox :-)  I just think this is an valuable addition to the less than technical discussion that is rising here. And, no, I don't mind if you call S1 and S2 'backdoor', as I could imagine the key-generation process working without these seeds and the dependency of K1,K2 from the Serial-Number.

EDT                  Q   Why was the 10:00 a.m. postponed?                  MS. MYERS:  Just due to scheduling conflicts.  So as we  put out, the President will meet with the leaders of the national  police organizations at 2:00 p.m. in the Rose Garden, as opposed to  10:00 a.m.  The only other things on his schedule today are:  At  11:00 a.m. he'll meet with General Vessey, who, as you know, is on  his way to Vietnam to continue working on the MIA-POW issue.  At  12:30 p.m. he'll have lunch with the Vice President in the Oval  Office.  And at 2:00 p.m. he'll meet with the police organizations. Then from 3:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. he'll do his weekly photos with the  various groups.              Q   A photo op with Vessey?              MS. MYERS:  There's no coverage on the Vessey meeting.              Q   Why?              MS. MYERS:  Why?  It's a closed meeting.                Q   What about the lunch?              MS. MYERS:  The lunch?  No, there's no coverage.              Q   Is he meeting with any congress people today?              MS. MYERS:  Nothing scheduled.              Q   There are no meetings --              MS. MYERS:  There are no congressional meetings today,  no.              Q   Has the President been given any information by the  Pentagon or reached any conclusion about the validity of this report  from Hanoi?  Any instructions to Vessey on how to deal with the  Vietnamese on that subject?              MS. MYERS:  Well, clearly, the report is the first order  of business.  It's high on the agenda on something that they'll  discuss.  I think the President and General Vessey will discuss the  parameters of his visit to Vietnam today, but the President hasn't  drawn any conclusions about the report yet.  Certainly, it's  something that he wants General Vessey to talk with the Vietnamese  about first.              Q   Did the President talk with any Republican senators  yesterday about the stimulus package?              MS. MYERS:  He spoke with Senator Dole.              Q   How many times?              MS. MYERS:  I believe once during the day and once last  night.              Q   What was the outcome of that?              MS. MYERS:  They're continuing to work toward some kind  of an agreement on a jobs package.              Q   Is it your impression that Senator Dole is in any  way flexible on this?              MS. MYERS:  Well, I think we're hopeful that we're going  to get some kind of jobs package through the Senate, and we'll  continue to work with Senator Dole and others until we reach some  kind of an agreement.              Q   Did they discuss the VAT tax?              MS. MYERS:  I don't know if that came up.              Q   Can you check that?              MS. MYERS:  Sure.        Q   So what are they -- is the President offering to  scale down his program -- is that what he's trying to do, buy it down  to where Dole will sign on?              MS. MYERS:  Well, he's trying to protect as much of it  as he can.  But it's important to him to get some kind of a jobs  package through the Senate and through Congress now.  And as soon as  we reach some conclusions on that, we'll let you know.  But at the  moment, he's continuing to consult with members of Congress  including, obviously, Senator Dole.              Q   Is he talking to anybody else?              MS. MYERS:  I don't believe he talked to any other  Republicans yesterday.              Q   Is he talking to anybody today?              MS. MYERS:  I don't think anything is scheduled, but I  wouldn't rule it out.              Q   We were led to believe that the President called  Mr. Dole on the subject of Russian aid and that Bob Dole brought the  conversation around to stimulus package.  Is that correct?              MS. MYERS:  I think the President has contacted several  people on Russian aid.  I think that it was always expected that the  stimulus package or the jobs package will be part of any conversation  he would have with Senator Dole.  The primary objective of the  conversation was Russian aid.  That was the first order of business,  but it was both.              Q   In the President's mind, are they linked  politically in that if the Republicans continue to reject the  stimulus package, he thinks it will be harder to sell Russian aid to  the American people?  Has he made that argument?              MS. MYERS:  I can't talk about specifically what  arguments he might have made.  The President is obviously committed  to both.  He liked to see a jobs package to the American people  first.  But as you know, we outlined the details of additional  Russian aid last night in Tokyo.              Q   But does the President believe that the stimulus  package will make it more difficult to persuade Americans to vote for  Russian -- to accept a vote for Russian aid?              MS. MYERS:  I think that the President is going to  continue to work to pass the stimulus package, to pass a jobs  package, and we're still hopeful that we'll get some kind of jobs  package through the Congress.              Q   Is it fair to say that the President is negotiating  now with Dole?              MS. MYERS:  He's discussing options with him.              Q   On the stimulus, is it your understanding that over  the break some Democrats, themselves, have left the support that they  had earlier for the package, the stimulus package?              MS. MYERS:  I think we still have wide support in the  Senate for the jobs package.              Q   But specifically, that you've lost Democrats other  than Shelby?              MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so.  There hasn't been a  vote.              Q   What about Kohl?              Q   Kohl and Feingold?              MS. MYERS:  There hasn't been a vote yet.  And we'll  continue to work with senators to try to get a majority to try to  bring the package to a vote, because we believe that a majority of  the members of the United States Senate support the package.              Q   If you're weren't worried about Kohl and Feingold,  why did George mention Milwaukee projects the other day?              MS. MYERS:  I think George pointed out a number of  projects in a number of states that stand to be funded, or to lose  funding if this jobs package doesn't pass.              Q   No Democrats.  (Laughter.)              MS. MYERS:  I'll let you draw your own conclusions.              Q   Does he plan to talk to Dole again today or any  other Republicans again today?              MS. MYERS:  There's nothing specifically scheduled, but  again, I wouldn't rule it out.              Q   Does he plan to put out any more press releases to  any other states today?              MS. MYERS:  What we've done is we're in the process of  breaking down the benefits of the jobs package state by state.  I  think it's entirely feasible that as we sort of are able to sum those  up, we'll send out press releases to the various states that suggest  how their states would benefit from this package.              Q   Will you share those with us?              MS. MYERS:  Sure.  As we did yesterday.              Q   Do you have copies of the ones you sent --              MS. MYERS:  Yes, we made those available yesterday.  And  we certainly can continue to provide them today.              Q   Dee Dee, since yesterday's questions and subsequent  stories about the VAT, what further consideration of this issue has  been given?              MS. MYERS:  Nothing's changed since yesterday.  I think  the President commented on it this morning to say only that it was  something he knew was being considered by the task force and that he  has not made a decision on, and I don't think we have anything to add  to that.              Q   But he also said that business and labor groups are  telling him they support it.  Can you tell us --              MS. MYERS:  I think that there has been -- I'm not going  to speculate on who supports it.  I think the President said that  there has been some support among business and labor groups.  I don't  think he said he was directly contacted by them.              Q   Are we to take that to mean that the administration  has sounded out business and labor groups on this --              MS. MYERS:  I think there's been plenty of public  discourse on this over the years and even recently, but I don't think  I want to add to that.              Q   In February, though, the President said that this  was something to be considered 10 or 15 years down the road.  What  has happened between then and now to cause this administration to  change its mind?              MS. MYERS:  I think as we said yesterday, it is  something that the working groups are looking at.  They're  considering a wide variety of options on everything from funding to  specific options that will be covered by the President's health care  plan.  The President has not taken it up yet, has not made a decision  on it.  And beyond that, I don't have anything to add.              Q   You haven't answered the question.  It wasn't being  considered by anyone in the White House after the President's  comments in February, and George reaffirmed that in a briefing.              Q   And then suddenly --              Q   What happened?        MS. MYERS:  The working groups, as we have said  throughout, we instructed to consider a wide variety of options  across-the-board.  And one of the things that has been talked about  and that they are clearly considering is some kind of a value-added  tax.        Q   But the President himself took this off the table,  Dee Dee, and suddenly it reappears.  And this goes to the credibility  of this administration in a way.  What has happened in the meantime?        MS. MYERS:  The President has not looked at this, it  hasn't been presented to him, again, yet.  The working groups are  looking at it, as they're looking at a wide variety of options, and  no decisions have been made.        Q   And it raises the question of how independently the  task force is working.        MS. MYERS:  The task force was instructed to consider  all options, and they've taken that mandate seriously and they're  considering all options.        Q   But that's not the impression that the President  left in February.  The impression he left was that this was something  that was long-range, to be looked at 10, 15 years down the road.  The  clear implication of his remarks was that this was something that was  not on the table, not an option.         Q   \\\"If it changes I'll tell you.\\\"              Q   Bring him on.        Q   And you repeatedly referred to the President's  remarks, telling us that those were still in operation.              MS. MYERS:  It's changed, and we told you.  (Laughter.)              Q   But that's what Alice Rivlin's comments and Donna  Shalala comments were about.  I mean, that seemed like an  orchestrated effort because you have two independent Cabinet officers  --        MS. MYERS:  I wouldn't -- no, Alice Rivlin's not a  Cabinet member, first of all.  Second of all, it was not  orchestrated, but clearly, they both said yesterday and in the last  couple of days that it's something that's being looked at.  We  confirmed that yesterday.  And I don't have anything to add to that.        Q   Is it because he has very few options?        Q   Is this something that it will be incumbent upon  the task force to convince the President about?  In other words, has  the President himself personally ruled it out and it's now up to the  task force to convince him to put it back on the table?  Or is it, in  fact, back on the table, having been placed there by discussions with  the President?          MS. MYERS:  It is not the working group's mission at  this point to convince the President of anything.  It is their  mission to put before him his options and to explain the benefits and  the costs and the basic pros and cons of each of those options.  I  think that they will certainly present the VAT to him in that  context, and at this point he's not -- that presentation has not been  made, but it's something that he will hear and he has not made a  decision on.        Q   They will present it to him as one of his options,  though he specifically ruled it out?        MS. MYERS:  Correct.        Q   Dee Dee, is this more than a trial balloon?  Is  this a serious consideration that the working groups are giving to  this form of taxation?        MS. MYERS:  It's simply a statement of fact.  The  working groups are considering a wide variety of options on a number  of issues relating to health care reform.  One of the options that  they're looking at is the VAT.         Q   Dee Dee, when the working groups were examining  this possibility, was this on the table during the same time period  that you were telling us that it was not?        MS. MYERS:  I don't know what the specific timing of  their drafting of options is.  I don't know.        Q   Who was telling you that it was not under  consideration?        MS. MYERS:  I was referring back to the President's  comments.        Q   Have they discovered that the sin taxes won't raise  enough money to fund the core benefit package?        MS. MYERS:  No, there's no decisions that have been made  on how to pay for the health care plan.              Q   I'm asking whether the projections --              MS. MYERS:  There's a number of options depending on how  the plan is structured.  You can't decide how much the plan is going  to cost until you decide what the plan is going to look like.  And so  you can't discuss what financing options have been ruled in our out  until you know.        Q   Dee Dee, we've been told that they have a computer  models on a number of possible packages.        MS. MYERS:  Correct.          Q   The question is whether they have now determined  whether sin taxes would not produce enough money for even the barest  minimum package.  That is not a very difficult computation.        MS. MYERS:  It is a question that you know that we're  not going to answer until -- there's a number of options being  considered.  It depends on how the package is structured.  The exact  details of the package and the financing mechanisms used to pay for  them are all among the decisions that have yet to be made.                Q   And when the President has been meeting with health  care -- his health care advisors, which we are told he has been doing  --              MS. MYERS:  Correct.              Q      they have never once said to him, these are your  funding options, including the VAT?  He has never heard the word VAT  in his --              MS. MYERS:    I am not going to comment on the specific  nature of the daily -- they're not daily, but the quasi-regular  briefings.              Q   Well, you have.              MS. MYERS:  I have not, other than to say that he's not  considered the VAT.  And I think that is a true statement.              Q   No, but you said that it has not been presented to  him as an option.              MS. MYERS:  Correct.              Q   That doesn't mean he hasn't heard about it.              MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to get into the details of  what's discussed.  I think that statement stands for itself.              Q      specific, Dee Dee.  When you say he hasn't  looked at it, do you mean that he hasn't looked at it in terms of  paying for medical coverage, or hasn't looked at it in general?   Because back in Chilicothe he was very specific in defining how it  works, what the advantages are, the whole thing.  It sounds like --              MS. MYERS:  But that was -- I think in Chilicothe, if  you go back to his remarks there, it was a broader philosophical  discussion of the tax structure.  And I think the comments were  generally in reference to the overall economic plan.  But clearly,  it's something that he's thought about in the broad context.  I mean,  that was clear in Chilicothe.  What I'm saying is that in the process  of the working groups it's something that he hasn't considered yet.   It's something that the working groups will present to him among the  number of options, and that no decisions have been made.  And I'm not  going to comment any further on the details of the meetings where  health care issues are being discussed.              Q   It's your statement from this podium that no  discussion of this has taken place.  You say that no option -- that  the option has not been presented to him.              MS. MYERS:  That is correct.              Q   Do you stand by -- does the White House still stand  by George's statement in March that this will not be in the proposal?              MS. MYERS:  No decisions have been made.  We have  nothing to add to what's already been said.              Q   Let me follow up here.  Do you stand by what Rivlin  said yesterday, that if any kind of VAT were to be used or  considered, that other changes to the tax code would have to be made  so that it would be less regressive?              MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to comment any further on what  might happen if.              Q   But do you stand by the previous conversations in  February that if there were to be a VAT, I think the President said  you'd exclude food and energy --              MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to comment on the specific  structure of a decision that hasn't been made.              Q   Was the President aware prior to Donna Shalala's  comments yesterday that this was under consideration by the working  groups?              MS. MYERS:  I don't know specifically what --              Q   Could you check for us, because that's a real  important credibility question?              MS. MYERS:  Sure.              Q   Since the task force was brought together this  issue has been discussed, at the beginning and throughout, as one  fairly painless way to raise a lot of money.  Were you all kept in  the dark?  Was the Press Office kept in the dark over the past month  and a half when you've been denying that a VAT tax would be  considered that it was actually on the table over there as an option?              MS. MYERS:  I think we've said all that we have to say.   It is something the working groups are looking at.  The President has  not made a decision about it yet.  And beyond that, I have nothing to  add.              Q   Well, sorry, Dee Dee, there are still a couple of  questions that we are going to have to ask because we have a problem  with credibility here -- yours primarily.  What we're asking is, if  you all were not told at all that this thing was being considered  while you were coming out here and telling us that it was not, or if  it's a case that you were coming out here and deliberately misleading  us.              MS. MYERS:  I don't believe that anyone has ever come  out here and deliberately misled you from this podium -- ever --ever.              Q   Has anyone tried to shade it a little bit to  indicate something -- has anybody told anybody to come out --              MS. MYERS:  We're not trying to shade answers or  deliberately mislead anybody.  I've said what I have to say about  this issue.              Q   All we were trying to find out --              MS. MYERS:  I understand what you're trying to find out  and I've given you the answers, Helen.              Q   We're trying to find out what changed -- what made  it an option again.  That's the --              MS. MYERS:  The working groups were given a broad  mandate to investigate all options, and they are doing that.                Q   Yes, but it wasn't an option before.  How can you  investigate it if the President has taken it off the table?              MS. MYERS:  It is something that they're obviously  considering and the President has not made a decision on.              Q   Yes, but he took it off the table in February.              MS. MYERS:  Working groups are considering it.  They'll  present it to the President at some point and he'll make a decision.              Q   Why would they consider it if he has taken it off  the table?              MS. MYERS:  It's clearly on the table.               Q   Yes, but he took it off the table.  Did he change  his mind?              MS. MYERS:  It's back on the table, Bill.              Q   Did he change his mind?              MS. MYERS:  He said this morning that he hasn't made a  decision about it.  He obviously knows that it's on the table.  It's  something that he will look at at some and when we have a decision on  this we'll let you know.              Q   So he must have changed his mind, right?              MS. MYERS:  At some point it will be looked at.  I mean,  --              Q   Dee Dee, there's like two options -- either he  changed his mind or the working groups think they're authority  exceeds the President's.              MS. MYERS:  The working groups were given a broad  mandate to look at all options; they've done that.              Q   Are you going to put out his income tax?              MS. MYERS:  Yes, there will be something available on  his income tax probably later this afternoon.  His return will be  available.               Q   Will there be any kind of briefing to go through  it?              MS. MYERS:  No, nothing's planned.  I think someone will  be available, probably not in a briefing setting, but to walk you  through the questions.              Q   We're used to be walked line-by-line through the  presidential tax forms.              MS. MYERS:  I've seen those briefings.  (Laughter.)              Q   Could we have one?              MS. MYERS:   No, I don't think there will be any kind of  a formal briefing, but there will be somebody available to answer  your questions about it.              Q   Did they file a joint form?              MS. MYERS:  Yes.              Q   When did he file it?              MS. MYERS:  I believe it's being filed today.              Q   Dee Dee, is there going to be a backgrounder for  Miyazawa?              MS. MYERS:  No, there will be a readout after the  meeting.              Q   No backgrounder today?              MS. MYERS:  No backgrounder today.              Q   This is complicated stuff.  We need help.   (Laughter.)              MS. MYERS:  We can't give you taxes and Miyazawa all in  one day, it's too confusing.  (Laughter.)              Q   Vance and Owen have opened the doors on the use of  force in Bosnia.   They've both said that, A, they never ruled it  out, and B, it might be necessary now.  Does that influence your  thinking on whether or not to change your approach?              MS. MYERS:  There's been no change in our policy towards  Bosnia.  We have always said that we'd consider --              Q   But does that impact upon your decision?  Are they  people whose opinions would carry weight with you?              MS. MYERS:  They're people whose opinions carry weight  certainly.  I mean, the President supports the process that they've  initiated.  But there's been no change in our policy for Bosnia,  although we're considering a number of options right now.  If the  Serbs don't come back to the negotiating table, if they don't sign on  to some kind of an agreement, we will consider additional options,  which we've been saying regularly.              Q   One follow-up question then?  We cannot get a  straight answer from anyone in the administration.  Why do you not  set a deadline for the Serbs?  Can you tell us the strategic or  tactical reasons for not giving them a deadline to come to the table?              MS. MYERS:  We're continuing to put pressure on them  every day.              Q   Which doesn't work so --              MS. MYERS:  Well, we think it is having some effect.   We're going to continue to tighten sanctions.  As you know, we  support the omnibus resolution.  We expect that to come to a vote on  the 26th.                Q   You say it's having an effect -- can you give us  any documentation?              MS. MYERS:  I'd be happy to provide somebody to talk to  you about the impact of the sanctions and things like that.              Q   There's been no -- you have not been able to  provide anybody who can tell us that the sanctions have had any  effect in Bosnia.  Serbia, yes; in Bosnia, no.              MS. MYERS:  I think that they've had effect in Serbia  and we think they've had some effect in Bosnia.  And again, I'll be  happy to provide somebody to walk you through the details of that, if  you'd like.              Q   We would like to hear from someone who can show us  what the effect has been in Bosnia.  We had the briefing on all of  the terrible things that are happening in Belgrade, but we haven't  seen anything that indicates an impact on the fighting.  Can you  provide something along those lines?              MS. MYERS:  I will see what I can get you.              Q   On the extra Russian aid that Christopher announced  this morning -- where is that money coming from?              MS. MYERS:  We'll have to work with Congress on the  details of that package.              Q   So that would be new money that you would hope to  get?              MS. MYERS:    Yes, that's new money, in addition to the  $1.6 billion announced in Vancouver.  So I assume that you all have  seen the $1.8-billion package that was announced this morning in  Tokyo by Secretary Christopher.              Q   Isn't there a concern, though, about offering  something which you have to get in Congress?  I mean, that was the  concern with Vancouver; you didn't want to do that.              MS. MYERS:  The concern with Vancouver was to do  something immediately, which required money that was already approved  in the Fiscal '93 budget.  What we're looking at now is a little bit  longer-term plan to build on top of the $1.6 billion that we  announced in Vancouver.  This clearly will require congressional  approval, or some of it will anyway, and we're going to continue to  work with Congress to make that happen.              Q   To what extent has that been vetted or agreed to by  Congress?              MS. MYERS:  The President has had a number of  conversations with members and will continue to work with them as  this process moves forward.              Q   Was Christopher able to put this package out with a  fair degree of understanding that you will be able to get it through  Congress?              MS. MYERS:  It was created in consultation with  Congress.              Q   In meeting with the law enforcement officials, is  that -- does that have a set speech and a goal?  A direction?              MS. MYERS:  Yes, the President will talk about -- and  the law enforcement organizations are endorsing the President's jobs  package.  They believe particularly the summer jobs package will help  give kids something to do.              Q   Who are they?              MS. MYERS:  It's members or leadership from three  organizations:  NAPO, which is the National Association of Police  Organizations; IBPO, which is the International Brotherhood of Police  Organizations, I believe; and IUPA, which is the International Union  of Police Associations.              Q   Will the FBI chief be there?              MS. MYERS:  The FBI chief?  No.              Q   Or any other federal law enforcement officials?              MS. MYERS:  No, it will be the President and these  national law enforcement organization leaders.              Q   Does the $1.8 billion announced today include the  $400 million that's in the FY '94 budget for disarmament?              MS. MYERS:  No.  The Nunn-Lugar money is separate.              Q   So this would be the $700 million that's in the  budget already, plus another $1.1 billion?              MS. MYERS:  I believe all of this is on top of the $700  million already in the budget.              Q   Is this going to be part of the supplemental or  Fiscal '94 --              MS. MYERS:  We'll work with Congress on the exact  funding mechanism -- on exactly how this will be paid for.              Q   This $1.8 billion on top of --              MS. MYERS:  On top of $700 million -- on top of the $400  million Nunn-Lugar money we announced earlier.              Q   And this is what prompted the President to call Bob  Dole -- it was on this tranche, not on the previous money he was  calling Bob Dole?              MS. MYERS:  Correct.              Q   Is there a briefing on Miyazawa?              MS. MYERS:  There will be a readout after the meeting  with Miyazawa.  Tomorrow.              Q   Dee Dee, on a totally unrelated matter, some  Republicans who are active in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are  complaining about this new cozy relationship between the White House  and the Chamber of Commerce.  There are -- the town hall meeting the  other night, the satellite and all of this relationship. Does the White House feel that you're getting too close to these  Chambers of Commerce?              MS. MYERS:  That's an interesting charge.  (Laughter.)   After how many years of Democrats being accused of not paying any  attention to the Chambers, now there are those who would accuse us of  being too close.  I think that's interesting.  But no, we're thrilled  by the support we've received from the national Chamber and local  Chambers across the country and we'll continue to work with them on  this and other initiatives.              Q   What's the status of the President thinking about  going to this Democratic retreat?              MS. MYERS:  It's on his calendar.  I think he'll almost  certainly go.              Q   All three days?              MS. MYERS:  We haven't figured out exactly when he'll be  there yet.                Q   Is it open to coverage?              MS. MYERS:  No, I believe the whole thing is closed.              Q   Is he going to have any kind of address, statement,  anything at all on the gay rights march on the 25th?              MS. MYERS:  We're still looking at that.  We haven't  made a final decision about how we'll -- who will make a statement or  what --              Q   Any meetings scheduled with any of the leaders?              MS. MYERS:  Nothing is scheduled, but I wouldn't rule it  out.              Q   What about an AIDS czar?              MS. MYERS:  It's coming.              Q   Anything on the weekend?              Q   There's been a suggestion that he's going to this  retreat to avoid having to participate in the gay rights -- or appear  or have any involvement in the gay rights march.              MS. MYERS:  No, I think this is something he's been  discussing for a long time -- appearing at the Senate Democratic  retreat.              Q   The weekend?              MS. MYERS:  Weekend?  Don't know -- the only thing on  right now is the radio address on Saturday.              Q   Any travel plans?              MS. MYERS:  If it changes -- none right now.              Q   He's not going to be off campaigning for his  stimulus package?              MS. MYERS:  No specific plans right now.              Q   What about mid-week?  Anything likely?              MS. MYERS:  It's possible.  Yes, I think it's likely  that we'll travel next week -- certainly the weekend.              Q   Has he called Thurmond about his daughter?              MS. MYERS:  I don't know.  I'll check.              Q   Going to name a drug czar this weekend?              MS. MYERS:  This weekend?  I don't believe so.              Q   And the radio address on Saturday -- is that going  to be focused on the stimulus package?              MS. MYERS:  I'm sure it will.

Thanks \",\" I guess the San Jose Mercury news is wrong then, and if so, why is the DA  involved?   \",\"In my postings I have made a proposal for comments and discussion. Those who don't want to discuss its merits and drawbacks are not forced to do so.  However I would make anybody who incites others to harm me or harass in a personal manner, legally responsible for their deeds. I cannot accept and will not accept threats to my personal integrity and I urge anybody who opposes terror to refrain from direct or indriect threats.  PS: My proposal has nothing to do with Nazi eugenics. It has to do with the search for peace which would enable justice. I don't consider that justice is done, when non-Jews who fled or were expelled in 1948/1967 are not permitted to return to their homeland. This can at best be called pragmatism, a nice word for legitimizing the rule of the strong. It can never be called justice. And peace without justice will never be peace. It is my conviction that the situation in which a state, through the law, attempts to discourage mixed marriages (as Israel does), is not normal. Such a state resembles more Nazi Germany and South Africa than Western democracies, such as the United States, in which Jews are free to marry whom they wish and do so in the thousands. My proposal may have drawbacks but it is meant to force anybody to anything, just to compensate for a certain time mixed couples for the hardships tehy endure in a society which disapproves of intermarriage.When the day will come and Israel will become a truly civil and decmoractic society, in which the state is not concerned with the religious or ethnic affiliation of its constituency, such a Fund would not be needed any more. I don't mind if Jews wish to marry Jews and keep their traditions, why not ? But this is not the affairs of a state. Western democracy clearly separates these domains and I am certain that most American Jews enjoy this fact and would not love to live in a state termed Christian State and to have their Green cards stamped with a mark JEW.  I would ask those who are genuinely interested in an exchange of views and personal experiencces to refrain from emotional, infantile outbursts which might leed readers to infer that Jews who respect Judaism are uncivilized. Such behaviour is not good for Judaism.\",\"  How about:   The Holocaust  The Spanish Inquisition  Jonestown  (just to name a few) ?  Authorities sometimes tell people to do evil things.

As for biggest surprise, I'd say that Buchberger had higher expectations this year due to his \\\"breakthrough\\\" year (for him) last year, so he didn't really raise his game.  My suggestion would be Shjon Podein, one of the callups from Cape Breton during the year.  He was quite far down on the depth chart in the Oilers stable of prospects, but made a big impact on the team.  He has 12 goals in his 33 games and is only -1.  Those are decent numbers for a third-line player who was seemingly doomed to minor-league oblivion.  The Oilers coaching staff likens his style to John Tonelli. I think he'll be on the full-time roster next year.  As for biggest disappointment, you could name any of the players the Oilers dumped for lousy production this year (Nicholls, Gilchrist, Tikkanen) or even Shayne Corson, but Mellanby isn't far off.  --  Andrew Scott                    | andrew@idacom.hp.com HP IDACOM Telecom Division      | (403) 462-0666 ext. 253\",\"       Yeah, right.

Because his messengership is universal, he has been distinguished by  miracles that relate to almost all species of creation.     Just as the supreme aide of a renowned ruler, arriving with many gifts in a city where various people live, will be welcomed by a representative of each people who acclaims him and bids him welcome in his own language so, too, when the supreme messenger of the Monarch of Pre- and  Post-Eternity  (Ezel and Ebed  Sultani) honored the universe by coming as an envoy to the inhabitants of the earth, and brought with him the light of truth and spiritual gifts sent by the Creator of the universe and derived from the realities of the whole universe, each species of creation -from water, rocks, trees, animals and human beings to the moon, sun and stars- welcomed him and acclaimed his prophethood, each in its own language, and each bearing one of his miracles.     Now it would require a voluminous work to mention all his miracles.  As the punctilious scholars have written many volumes concerning the proofs of His prophethood, here we will briefly point out only the general category into which fall fhe miracles that are definite and accepted as accurate reports.     The evidences of the prophethood of Muhammad (SAW) fall into two main categories:        The first is called irhasat and includes the paranormal  events that happened at the time of his birth, or before his  declaration of prophethood.        The second group pertains to all the remaining evidences  of the prophethood, and contains two subdivisions:       1) Those wonders that were manifested after his departure from this world in order to confirm his prophethood, and   2) Those that he exhibited during the era of his prophethood.  The latter has also two parts:    2.1) The evidences of his prophethood that became manifest in his own personality, his inner and outer being, his moral conduct and perfection, and      2.2) The miracles that: related to substantial matters.   The last part again has two branches:    2.2.1) Those concerning the Qur'an and spirituality, and   2.2.2) Those relating to matter and creation.  This last  branch is again divided into two categories:    2.2.2.1) The first involves the paranormal happenings  that occured during his mission either to break the  stubbornness of the unbelievers, or to augment the faith of the belivers.  This category has twenty different sorts, such as the splitting of the moon, the flowing of water from the fingers, the satisfying of large numbers with a little food, and the speaking of trees, rocks and animals Each of these sons has also many instances, and thus has, in meaning, the strength of confirmation by consensus.    2.2.2.2)  As for the second category, this includes events lying in the future that occured as he had predicted upon Allah (SWT)'s instructions.  Now starting from the last category, we will summarize a list of them.(1)  (1) Unfonunately, I could not write as I had intended without choice, I wrote as my head dictated, and I could not completely conform to the order of this classification. \",\"Quoting pmetzger@snark.shearson.com (Perry E.

If you don't have an XUSERFILESEARCHPATH environment variable then set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to be the directory where the BuilderXcessory file is. You can do this using the setenv command under csh.

Speaking as an atheist (heterosexual, for what it's worth), this is one of the least attractive parts of some varieties of Christianity.  Although I'm sure it's possible to argue theologically that we shouldn't make analogies between discrimination on the basis of sex and race and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, morally the case looks unanswerable (for those outside religion): the three forms _are_ analogous; we shouldn't discriminate on the basis of sex, race or sexual orientation.  I found the moderator's FAQs on the subject instructive, and recommend everyone to read them.  There seem to be three different levels of acceptance:  1) Regard homosexual orientation as a sin (or evil, whatever) 2) Regard homosexual behaviour as a sin, but accept orientation (though presumably orientation is unfortunate) and dislike people who indulge 3) As 2, but \\\"love the sinner\\\" 4) Accept homosexuality altogether.  My experience is that 3 is the most common attitude (I imagine 1 and 2 are limited to a few fundamentalist sects).  I suppose I can go along with 3, except that I have this feeling that a 14--15 year old living in a community with this attitude, on discovering that they were more attracted to members of the same sex, would not feel the love of the community, but would rather feel the pressure not to exhibit their feelings.  I'm not saying that the community (in particular the parents) would not love the child, but I suspect the child would not feel loved.\",\"I am a PhD student.

In this case I'd say the relevant statistic would be the number of combatants (total troops) compared to total casualties from among the total civilian population in the affected geographical area.   Vietnam and Korea might make good comparisons.   Western news in general, but in particular the American \\\"mass media\\\": CBS, NBC, ABC, etc.  The general tone of the news during the whole war was one of \\\"those poor, poor Iraqis\\\" along with \\\"look how precisely this cruise missile blew this building to bits\\\".   I agree.   Perhaps so.  And maybe the atomic bomb was a mistake too.  But that's easy to say from our \\\"enlightened\\\" viewpoint here in the 90's, right?  Back then, it was *all-out* war, and Germany and Japan had to be squashed. After all, a million or more British had already died, hundreds of  thousands of French, a couple hundread thousand or so Americans, and  millions of Russians, not to mention a few million Jews, Poles, and  other people of slavic descent in German concentration camps.  All  things considered, the fire-bombings and the atomic bomb were essential (and therefore justified) in bringing the war to a quick end to avoid even greater allied losses.  I, for one, don't regret it.   Sure.  And it's the people who suffer because of them.  All the more reason to depose these \\\"entrenched political rulers operating in their own selfish interests\\\"!  Or do you mean that this applies to the allies as well??   I make no claim or effort to justify the misguided foreign policy of the West before the war.  It is evident that the West, especially America, misjudged Hussein drastically.  But once Hussein invaded Kuwait and  threatened to militarily corner a significant portion of the world's oil supply, he had to be stopped.  Sure the war could have been prevented by judicious and concerted effort on the part of the West before Hussein invaded Kuwait, but it is still *Hussein* who is responsible for his decision to invade.  And once he did so, a strong response from the West was required.   Well, it's not very \\\"loving\\\" to allow a Hussein or a Hitler to gobble up nearby countries and keep them.  Or to allow them to continue with mass slaughter of certain peoples under their dominion.  So, I'd have to say yes, stopping Hussein was the most \\\"loving\\\" thing to do for the most people involved once he set his mind on military conquest.  I mentioned it.  If we hadn't intervened, allowing Hussein to keep Kuwait, then it would have been appeasement.  It is precisely the lessons the world learned in WW2 that motivated the Western alliance to war.  Letting Hitler take Austria and Czechoslavkia did not stop WW2 from happening, and letting Hussein keep Kuwait would not have stopped an eventual Gulf War to protect Saudi Arabia.   Sure.  What was truly unfortunate was that they followed Hitler in his grandiose quest for a \\\"Thousand Year Reich\\\".  The consequences stemmed from that.  What should I say about them?  Anything in particular?    So?  It was the *policemen* on trial not Rodney King!!  And under American law they deserved a jury of *their* peers!  If there had been black officers involved, I'm sure their would have been black jurors too. This point (of allegedly racial motivations) is really shallow.   So?  It's \\\"hard to imagine\\\"?  So when has Argument from Incredulity gained acceptance from the revered author of \\\"Constructing a Logical Argument\\\"?  Can we expect another revision soon??  :)  (Just kidding.)   I have to admit that I wonder this too.  But *neither* the prosecution nor the defense is talking.  So one cannot conclude either way due to the silence of the principals.     OK.  It certainly seemed to me that there was excessive force involved. And frankly, the original \\\"not guilty\\\" verdict baffled me too.  But then I learned that the prosecution in the first case did not try to convict on a charge of excessive force or simple assault which they probably would have won, they tried to get a conviction on a charge of aggravated assault with intent to inflict serious bodily harm.  A charge, which news commentators said, was akin to attempted murder under California law.  Based on what the prosecution was asking for, it's evident that  the first jury decided that the officers were \\\"not guilty\\\".  Note,  not \\\"not guilty\\\" of doing wrong, but \\\"not guilty\\\" of aggravated assault  with the *intent* of inflicting serious bodily harm.  The seeds of the  prosecutions defeat were in their own overconfidence in obtaining a  verdict such that they went for the most extreme charge they could.  If the facts as the news commentators presented them are true, then I feel the \\\"not guilty\\\" verdict was a reasonable one.   Thanks mathew, I like the quote.  Pretty funny actually.

The point that Darren raises is a very Lutheran viewpoint.   While reason is a gift from God, it is also infected by sin. Yet we do not reject reason entirely--and neither, I think,  does Darren.  We need reason, as Darren himself has pointed out, to comprehend God's revelation of himself in the Bible. But reason alone is not sufficient to comprehend and believe the Word.  We need, first and foremost, faith.  For \\\"the sinful mind is hostile to God.  It does not submit to God's law, *nor can it do so*\\\"  (Romans 8:7).  Luther accepted Scripture as the sole means of revelation (\\\"Sola Scriptura\\\"), but accepted the necessity of the use of reason (with faith) in comprehending that revelation. Yet Luther also said, regarding baptism, \\\"But mad reason rushes forth, and, because Baptism is not dazzling like the works which we do, regards it as worthless.\\\" (Large Catechism, Fourth part, Baptism).  To make matters more complicated, Luther was the sort of theologian that many  people would describe as an `absolutist'.  I've seen him  described as a `take no prisoners' theologian.  We might conclude, given these observations, that Luther was inconsistent or mad.  And surely at least some have come to that conclusion.  But it might be useful to recall that Jesus was also called mad.  And Peter felt compelled to defend himself and the apostles against a charge of drunkenness on Pentecost.  So we as Christians ought to be careful about rejecting Luther (or others)  as mad.  Rather, we should imitate the Bereans, who examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true (Acts 17:11).  The basis for the confidence with which Luther, Peter, Paul, and many others preached the gospel was not just reason, but faith and the Holy Spirit.  This is not faith divorced from reason, but a faith that guides, informs, and uses reason.  The Spirit enables us to know the truth and to proclaim it boldly.  God does not want us to preach the message that \\\"I think that Jesus might have risen from the dead\\\" but rather \\\"I know that my redeemer lives!\\\"  (Job 19:25).  The Christian does not side with Pilate in saying \\\"What is truth?\\\" but rather follows Christ, who said, \\\"In fact, for this reason I was born, and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth.  Everyone on the side of truth listens to me\\\" (John 18:37).  We can know the truth because God has promised us that we can know the truth.  Jesus said, \\\"If you hold to my teachings, you are really my disciples.  Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free\\\" (John 8:31,32).  The Proverbs urge us \\\"Buy the truth, and do not sell it.\\\" (Pr 23:23). The Psalmist prayed \\\"Do not snatch to word of truth from my mouth\\\" (Ps 119:43).  Evidently he believed that the word of truth was in fact `in his mouth'.    Yet we do indeed appear arrogant if our claim to the truth is motivated by self-glorification.  But if we present the truth as the teachings of Scripture, revealed by the  Spirit, and not our own invention, and if we stand ready to be proved wrong on the basis of Scripture, as Luther did, then we are not arrogant, but humble.  We should humbly trust in God's promise of truth, just as we trust in his promise of forgiveness.  REXLEX> It is only because of God's own revelation that we can be  REXLEX> absolute about a thing.  Darren> But how far does that get you?  Once God's revelation stops, Darren> and your own reasoning begins, possibility for error appears.  I agree that we must make a distinction between the clear teachings of Scripture, and the products of our own reason--even when such reasoning is based on Scripture.  However I think I would draw the line of distinction more `reasonably'  :-)  and less `academically' than you would.  Darren> For example, let's suppose that our modern Bible translations Darren> include a perfect rendering of Jesus words at the Last Supper, Darren> and that Jesus said, exactly, \\\"This is my body.\\\"  Darren> We'll presume that what he said was totally without error and Darren> absolutely true.  What can we be certain of?  Not much.  Darren> At the moment he stops speaking, and people start Darren> interpreting, the possibility of error appears.  Did he mean Darren> that literally or not?  We do not have any record that he Darren> elaborated on the words.  Was he thinking of Tran- or Con- Darren> substantiation?  He didn't say.   Darren is almost at the point of making a very Lutheran statement about the Lord's supper.  The Lutheran approach is to say that if Jesus said, \\\"This is my body,\\\" then that is what we should believe.  Other interpretations are rejected simply because they are not taught in Scripture.  Recall that Jesus' words do not stand alone on this subject.  We also have Paul's words in 1 Corinthians 11:17-34,--in which he passed on to us, what he received from the Lord.  In particular he said, \\\"For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.\\\"  By these words we should believe that the bread that we eat in the Lord's Supper really is bread (as well as the Lord's body)--as our senses in fact tell us.  Does this *prove* that tran-substantiation is false?  I suppose someone could say that Paul spoke metaphorically of the Lord's body as bread, simply because that is the way the body appears when we eat it.  But this thought is found nowhere in Scripture.  So we reject it.  Thus the primary reason for rejecting tran-substantiation is not that we can prove it false, but that it is simply not found in Scripture.  [side remark] I've been told that the Lutheran doctrine on real presence is con-substantiation.  But it has been non-Lutherans who have told me this.  We tend not to use the word.  I almost think that this is used more by professors of comparative religion, who need labels to compare Catholic, Lutheran and Reformed teachings on the Lord's Supper.  But almost every church wants to call their own teaching \\\"real presence\\\" because that was the traditional teaching of  the church. [end side remark]  Darren> When Christians speak as if they believe their own reasoning Darren> can never lead them astray -- when we implicitly claim that we Darren> are infallible -- the non- Christians around us rarely believe Darren> that implicit claim.  Witnessing is hardly going to work when Darren> the person you are talking to believes that you are either too Darren> foolish to recognise your own limits, or intentionally trying Darren> to cover them up.  This is precisely why Christians should not rely on rationalizations in their witnessing.  It is far better to take the approach, \\\"I'd like to show you what Scripture says.  You decide for  yourself whether to believe it or not.\\\"  Darren> `REXLEX' suggested that people read _He is There and He is Not Darren> Silent_, by Francis Schaeffer.

Somebody else might like it, though, Darren> so don't let my opinion stop you from reading it.  Darren> If someone is interested in my opinion, I'd suggest _On Darren> Certainty_, by Ludwig Wittgenstein.  As long as we're trading references, I'd like to suggest Dr. Siegbert Becker's paperback, \\\"The Foolishness of God: The place of reason in Lutheran theology,\\\" published by Northwestern Publishing House. This book was based on Becker's doctoral thesis at the University of Chicago.\",\" Yes, I do agree with your definition.  My use of the term \\\"always\\\" is rather deceptive, I admit.      Hold it.  I said that all of scripture is true.  However, discerning exactly what Jesus, Paul and company were trying to say is not always so easy.  I don't believe that Paul was trying to say that all women should behave that way.  Rather, he was trying to say that under the circumstances at the time, the women he was speaking to would best avoid volubility and cover their heads.  This has to do with maintaining a proper witness toward others.  Remember that any number of relativistic statements can be derived from absolutes.  For instance, it is absolutely right for Christians to strive for peace.  However, this does not rule out trying to maintain world peace by resorting to violence on occasion.  (Yes, my opinion.)    Sure.  The Bible preaches absolute truths.  However, exactly what those truths are is sometimes a matter of confusion.  As I said, the Bible does preach absolute truths.  Sometimes those fundamental principles are crystal clear (at least to evangelicals).  Sometimes they are not so clear to everyone (e.g. should baptism be by full immersion or not, etc).  That is largely because sometimes, it is not explicitly spelled out whether the writers are speaking to a particular culture or to Christianity as a whole.  This is  where scholarship and the study of Biblical contexts comes in.      God revealed his Truths to the world, through His Word.  It is utterly  unavoidable, however, that some people whill come up with alternate  interpretations.  Practically anything can be misinterpreted, especially when it comes to matters of right and wrong.

In practice there is little difference in quality but more care is needed  with inkjet because smudges etc. can happen.   A cheap laser printer does not manage that sort of throughput and on top of  that how long does the _first_ sheet take to print? Inkjets are faster than  you say and in both cases the computer often has trouble keeping up with the  printer.

Paper cost is the same and both can use refills. Long term the laserprinter  will need some expensive replacement parts (consumables) and on top of that  are the amortisation costs which favour the lowest purchase cost printer.  HP inkjets understand PCL so in many cases a laserjet driver will work if the  software package has no inkjet driver.   There is one wild difference between the two printers: a laserprinter is a  page printer whilst an inkjet is a line printer. This means that a  laserprinter can rotate graphic images whilst an inkjet cannot. Few drivers  actually use this facility.

Perhaps Limbaugh has a following because The People are tired of being treated  like errant children by a self-important group of arrogant controlling myopic  people who have no understanding of how life operates outside of the \\\"oughta-be's\\\" inside their own hopelessly closed minds.     OK, let us take your word for that and work with it.  A nice specific incident.     Hmmm, \\\"Congress shall pass no law regarding an establishment of religion, nor prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\\\"  Liberal translation: \\\"the federal government (as long as it is run by Liberals) may force local school districts to include certain iconic content in Christmas displays, while prohibiting others.\\\"  I think Limbaugh has you on this one.  It seems to me that he is arguing for LESS imposition of the federal government into religion.  Nice job on the specificity of that one, too.    [Analysis of historical/modern communication media deleted]    Ah yes, it is a conspiracy of profound proportions.  Methinks that you may be a bit resentful of Mr. Limbaugh's success because you attribute it primarily to luck (how, after all, could anyone with profound differences of opinion from yourself have become successful without the operation of conspiracy or blind luck!)  Do you feel this same level of knee-jerk resentment against lottery winners, or do you congratulate them on their good fortune?     This should be great fun, since it is the Liberal movement in America that is pushing the hardest for centralized fascist control of The People and business (government/business 'partnership' indeed), and Mr. Limbaugh  is the populist nemesis of that movement.  I have read Mr. Limbaugh's book, and although it was not the most literary piece I have read in recent memory it certainly did not contain \\\"venom\\\" at all, let alone \\\"venom\\\" comparable to an individual who callously murdered millions out of racism.     A very serious tone in that oratory.     You neglect to mention that Mr. Limbaugh (have you ever listened to his show,  BTW?) continuously encourages his audience to think for themselves rather than blindly following any media icon, himself included.  You yourself mention  that he makes no bones about his show being strictly about his own opinions. He also adopts a rather satirical approach, and presumes his audience to be intelligent enough to distinguish satire from seriousness (and he says as much). This is in contrast to the average mass-media show, in which the audience is treated as society's intellectual lowest common denominator.  I am sure that Adolf Hitler was a master of satire; I am sure he was just kidding when he said that the Jews were the cause of Germany's problems and needed to be exterminated.     This is not religion, it is clearly a perverse worship of race.  Since Christ was a Jew, it seems quite unlikely that Hitler's characterization of the Aryan as \\\"the highest image of the Lord\\\" fits with Christian doctrine.     Private religious schools have a vastly better record of success than publicly funded schools.  American history is indeed primarily Judeo- Christian.  I suppose that Mr. Limbaugh pointing out facts is equivalent to Adolf Hitler worshiping the Aryan race.  I think you might be reaching just a wee bit here.     Definite suggestion that the government should control the entertainment industry here.    Just a guess here, but I don't think that Mr. Limbaugh would advocate government control of Hollywood.  You should perhaps call his radio show to confirm this.  I believe this is more a criticism of Hollywood and the depraved moral values it espouses, not an advocation of government control  of Hollywood.  90's Liberals, on the other hand, want to have complete government control  of our school systems, so that the government can teach The People at an early age the \\\"right\\\" way to view religion and morality.  I believe Mr.  Limbaugh is against this, as his satirical use of the \\\"young heads full of mush\\\" hyperbole indicates.     Pretty strong conspiracy theory insinuated here, with an implicit plea for government power to be used to break up the conspiracy.     Indication here that \\\"Elements of the Media\\\" (since career is a self-selected categorization, perhaps an inferred 'larger percentage than represented in the populace at large') has a leftist bias.  Doesn't sound too unreasonable. No insinuation that CNN should not report in an objective fashion, only that for reporters to say that they do not have any personal bias in the situation is disingenuous to megalomaniacal.  You may disagree, and it may well be exagerrated, but it is not an unreasonable  opinion; and Mr. Limbaugh goes well out of his way to make sure that his  audience knows that these are his opinions, unlike most other reporting that  purports to achieve perfect objectivity but in actuality will in some degree  or other, in a statistical sense, reflect the biases of the reporters.  Who  is being disingenuous here, Mr. Shaw or Mr. Limbaugh?  Again, you should ask Mr. Limbaugh himself, but I expect that he would oppose government control of the media.              It is indeed depressing to see such myopia and tiresome Liberal arrogance. Liberals love to play games with paradigms as a way of discrediting people who disagree with them.  Why don't you challenge conservative ideology on an intellectual level rather than engaging in ludicrous comparisons? Perhaps the underpinnings of your ideology are intellectual only in that they exist in your mind, not the real world.     Perhaps there are a few among the intellectually challenged who percieve Rush Limbaugh as a hate-monger, but in my experience he has been spreading laughter at the ludicrous self-importance of the Left, not hatred.  As to Mr. Bush, you may be correct about his fascist economic leanings. Mr. Reagan, on the other hand, did his best to reverse the fascist trend of government involvement in business.  Mr. Clinton is increasing fascism in America through \\\"business/government partnership\\\" and increased levels of taxation.  Perhaps you should not have skipped your vocabulary classes in grade school.     Hmmm.  Seems to me that Limbaugh is not in any way comparable to Hitler because he has not murdered six million Jews and many, many others out of racism.  I come from a mixed-race family, so I am quite well attuned to racism; I don't hear any coming from Rush Limbaugh.  The only place I hear  racism coming from these days and being taken seriously is from the Liberal  Left.  The Liberal Left is the movement I see trying to get America hooked on the opiates of Socialized Medicine, Socialized Transportation, Socialized Education, etc.  The Left already has America hopelessly addicted to  that Liberal drug, the Social Security Chain Letter.  It is quite clear to me that while the Hitler analogy does not really apply to either Rush  Limbaugh or William Jefferson Clinton, if one of the two is closer than  the other it is clearly the Fascist Clinton.

Did you know that the word 'Karabag' itself is a 'Turkish' name?  Before 1827, before the Russians and their 'zavalli kole' Armenians,  drove all the Turks/Muslims out, it was a Turkish majority town. Well, anyway, it is not surprising that Armenians also collaborated with the  Nazis.   \\\"Wholly opportunistic the Dashnaktzoutun have been variously   pro-Nazi, pro-Russia, pro-Soviet Armenia, pro-Arab, pro-Jewish,   as well as anti-Jewish, anti-Zionist, anti-Communist, and    anti-Soviet - whichever was expedient.\\\"[1]  [1] John Roy Carlson (Arthur Derounian), 'Cairo to Damascus,'      Alfred A. Knopf, New York, 1951, p. 438.    As a dear friend put it, the Tzeghagrons (Armenian Racial Patriots)  was the youth organization of the Dashnaktzoutun. It was based in Boston (where ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism Triangle is located) but  had followers in Armenian colonies all over the world. Literally Tzeghagron means 'to make a religion of one's race.' The architect of the Armenian Racial Patriots was Garegin Nezhdeh, a Nazi Armenian who became a key leader of collaboration with Hitler in World War II. In 1933, he had been invited to the United States by the Central Committee of the Dashnaktzoutun to inspire and organize the  American-Armenian youth. Nezhdeh succeeded in unifying many local Armenian youth groups in the Tzeghagrons. Starting with 20 chapters in the initial year, the Tzeghagrons grew to 60 chapters and became the largest and most powerful Nazi Armenian organization. Nezhdeh also provided the Tzeghagrons with a philosophy:   \\\"The Racial Religious beliefs in his racial blood as a deity.   Race above everything and before everything. Race comes first.\\\"[1]  [1] Quoted in John Roy Carlson (real name Arthur Derounian), \\\"The     Armenian Displaced Persons,\\\" in 'Armenian Affairs,' Winter,     1949-50, p. 19, footnote.   Now wait, there is more.  THE GRUESOME extent of February's killings of Azeris by Armenians in the town  of Hojali is at last emerging  in Azerbaijan - about 600 men,  women and  children dead  in the  worst outrage  of the four-year war over Nagorny Karabakh.  The figure  is drawn  from Azeri investigators,  Hojali officials and casualty lists published in the Baku press. Diplomats and aid workers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates.  The 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one of the last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full control of Nagorny Karabakh,  the subject of a new  round of negotiations in Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fighting retreat and  a massacre, but  investigators say that most  of the dead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was first suppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku. Later  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-stricken Azerbaijan's wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2,000 dead.  The State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov,  the cheif investigator of a 15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  \\\"Hojali Disaster\\\", said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum on preliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman Memmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed in the Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and more than 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700 dead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswoman of the Azeri Ministry of Defence.  FranCois Zen  Ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the International Red Cross  in Baku, said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of Agdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosque from  Hojali, most  of  them  civilians. \\\"We  did  not count  the bodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy,\\\" Mr Zen Ruffinen said. \\\"We have some idea since we gave the body bags and products to wash the dead.\\\"  Mr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the number of  dead in the  massacre. \\\"Don't  get worked up.  It will take  several months  to  get a  final  figure,\\\" the  43-year-old lawyer said at his small office.  Mr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years to reach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714 wounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist uprising in Baku in January 1990.  Those  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  power three weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly what  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70 miles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians.  Officially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, being the  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the republic's forensic department. \\\"This  is just a small percentage of the dead,\\\" said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic's chief forensic scientist. \\\"They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the chaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury our dead within 24 hours.\\\"  Of these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14 years old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 and axes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highland snows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs of deliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penises cut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov's report. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those believed to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said.  Files  from  Mr  Rasulov's  investigative  commission  are  still disorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, six policemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, the names of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. The most heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so far comes  from Towfiq  Manafov,  an Azeri  investigator  who took  a helicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  27 February.  \\\"There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to count properly: 470-500  in Hojali, 650-700 people  by the stream and the road and 85-100  visible around Nakhchivanik village,\\\" Mr Manafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter pilot.  \\\"People waved up  to us for help. We saw  three dead children and one  two-year-old alive  by  one  dead woman.  The  live one  was pulling at her arm for the mother to get up. We tried to land but Armenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had to return.\\\"  There  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  in circulation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last few months and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in Hojali at the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages taken over by Armenian forces.

Assuming that they are using civilians for cover, are they not killing SOLDIERS in THEIR country? If the buffer zone is to prevent attacks on Israel, is it not working? Why is it  further neccessary for Israeli guns to pound Lebanese villages? Why not just kill those who try to infiltrate the buffer zone? You see, there is more to the shelling of the villages.... it is called RETALIATION... \\\"GETTING BACK\\\" ...\\\"GETTING EVEN\\\". It doesn't make sense to shell the villages. The least it shows is a reckless disregard by the Israeli government for the lives of civilians.     If Israel is not willing to accept the \\\"word\\\" of others then, IMHO, it has no business wasting others' time coming to the peace talks.    No, I am not Basil. I think Basil is a very intelligent person and I respect what he writes. Basil is a person that I would gladly call a friend. He is, however, not me. Nor am I Lebanese, as some seem to suspect.    Tim, you are ignoring the fact that the Palestinians in Lebanon have been disarmed. Hezbollah remains the only independent militia. Hezbollah does not attack Israel except at a few times such as when the IDF burned up Sheikh Mosavi, his wife, and young son. Of course, if Israel would withdraw from Lebanon and stop assassinating people and shelling villages they wouldn't make the Lebanese so mad as to do that. Furthermore, with Hezbollah  subsequently disarmed, it would not be possible.   Tim, when is the last time that you recall any trouble on the Syrian border? Not lately, eh?  Israel knows very well that the Syrians are able to restrain ALL who would use territory under their control to attack Israel. While Lebanon would be better off with Syria and Israel out of its borders, the presence of Syrian troops in Lebanon has meant a sharp decrease in attacks on Israeli territory (not on Israeli troops in Lebanon, however. Please note the distinction) in the past two years.   I disagree, Basil has always seemed to me to be a cool-headed person, slow to anger (certainly more so than I). What is most important is that he is an  actual witness to things from the other end of the Israeli guns. If only the  Israeli government would remember what it was like when the roles were  reversed perhaps they would moderate their \\\"retaliation\\\".\",\"       No one says you have to read any of it Ralph..

John is saying that the batters efforts will result in 4 more wins then losses.  While you are probably correct that 400% does not mean 4 more wins then losses, it means something.  I would rather have a player who increased my teams chances of winning by 1% in each of 400 PAs then I would a player who increased my chances of winning by .5% in each of 400 PAs.  Thus, there appears to me to be an obvious positive association between John's statistic and winning games.  Thus, before you disregard this stat, it appears to me that further study must go into what sort of relationship there is.   The only problem here is an insistance that these number mean exactly how many wins the team has.  First, we are using averages over many seasons and applying them to one game.  Second, remember some players performance take away from the chance of you winning.  That is a player who gets an out gets a \\\"negative probability\\\" in most cases. Thus, I'm not sure in any given game when you add up all the numbers for a team who won that they will add up to 1 in that game.  Sometimes, they will add up to more then one sometime, less than one.  Also, the pitchers' bad performances (giving up 6 runs) may have given them a large negative percentage for that game.  Also, any batter that pulled an 0-4 night would give large negatives.       No, but really only because you have a smaller sample size.  I would think however, that the number of runs you score in the first inning would be just as good as a prediction as how many runs you score  in the last inning.  And, realize something else a closer usually comes in in a close situation, not a blow out.  It is hard to argue that any runs that a closer gives up in a game have equal importance to those given up in the first inning.  Look, a closer giving up runs often means a team will lose many games.  On, the other hand a starter who gives up runs often still leaves his team a chance to win.  The offence has many more outs to do something about.  But, I am not saying all late inning situations are equally important either.  If I am down 8 runs in the ninth, it really does not matter how many runs my pitcher gives up in the ninth.           No, but why would you assume that the teams probability of winning would be 0 before the possesion in which the free throws were made.  Look, if you are down 1 point with 5 seconds left, there is a fairly high probability that you will win the game if you are in possesion of the ball.  And, do not forget that somebody elses missed shots, turnovers, fouls, bad defense, etc. caused a \\\"negative chance\\\" that the team would win.   From reading all of the discussion on this statistic, I feel that those who critisize it to a certain extent are doing so out of an agenda. At first look this statistic valadates clutchness.  But, it really does not.  Cluthness revolves around the idea that certain players in crucial situation elevate their performance and others performance goes down.  I've never seen convincing proof that this really happens. So, if you assume there is no clutchness, then that means that except for a lot of noice, this statistic has a positive association to player performance.  There is a way to get rid of the noice if you do not believe in clutchness.  Certainly, we could find out what the average value of a home run is for example.  We may find for instance, that a home run increases your chance of winning by 15% on average while a strikeout decreases your chance of winning by 5%. I bet if this were done we would find that this statistic was just as good as other statistics we have for predicting wins and losses.  How do we evaluate relief pitchers?  Say John and Sam have the exact same pitching statistics (runs, earned runs, K's, BB's, etc.)  Both had exceptional numbers.  John, however only pitched in closer situations, while Sam was a Mop up man.  Who was more valuble to their team?  Probably John.  Who was the better  pitcher?  They were probably about the same.\",\"************************************************************ *     For Sale - Jazz Compact Discs                        * ************************************************************  I have the following CDs for sale, they are all in mint condition and are fairly hard to find.

One has a duty to have one's marriage properly recorded and witnessed.    - But there are also people who have been through a wedding ceremony   without making a genuine commitment, and therefore are not married   in God's eyes.

The refresh can be done either as a trailing phase of normal access cycle or as an individual cycle.  [other stuff deleted]  Ken Nakata\",\"  They recycled a lot of models and theme music for UFO.

For example, how about a scheme using RSA, and some hybrid of DES-CFB and another strong stream cipher (Maybe IDEA-CFB)?  This could be substantially the same as the cripple chip, except that instead of key-registration, the police could demand that you give up your secret key to them (with a court- issued warrant).  Then, they could read the last few months of wiretapped messages you've sent, and assuming you've committed no crimes, you could generate a new key pair and go about your business.  I find that I'd be willing to pay RSA for the right to use such a system, especially given the alternative.  If you were unwilling to give up your secret key, then you'd probably stay in jail (has anyone got a real legal precedent for this?).    This would allow court-issued warrants to be used to gather information on suspected criminals, but it couldn't be done in secrecy, and there would be enormously less likelihood of corruption or theft of escrowed keys.

A TTL gate has the basic structure of AND/OR/INVERT, and an inversion of a sum of a product is just exactly ONE gate delay.  The reason to find a minimal sum of products is that this matches a hardware optimization.   A positive-OR gate (such as the 9-gate solution uses) has TWO gate delays (and there's another gate delay in the second term) so that the second solution, while simpler in logic symbols, can  be expected to be something less than optimal in the real world. ECL is similar to TTL, in that it can support an OR/AND gate with the minimum delay (unlike TTL, you get both true and inverse outputs for 'free' when using ECL).   PALs are basically large programmable AND/OR/INVERT gates (with your choice of internal connections between the various sections, and perhaps some latches), so a minimum sum of products ALSO is a way to shoehorn a logic design into  a few PALs.  It's not comparably easy to design with a minimization of logic gates, but some software packages claim to allow you to do so, and will take just about any mess of gates (as a nodelist with 74xxx series logic ICs) and produce a description of a logic cell array to do the same job.

The new cryptography scheme was announced today by the White House and the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), which will implement the technical specifications of the plan.  A NIST spokesman acknowledged that the National Security Agency (NSA), the super- secret military intelligence agency, had actually developed the encryption technology around which the new initiative is built.          According to NIST, the technical specifications and the Presidential directive establishing the plan are classified.  To open the initiative to public review and debate, CPSR today filed a series of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests with key agencies, including NSA, NIST, the National Security Council and the FBI for information relating to the encryption plan.  The CPSR requests are in keeping with the spirit of the Computer Security Act, which Congress passed in 1987 in order to open the development of non-military computer security standards to public scrutiny and to limit NSA's role in the creation of such standards.          CPSR previously has questioned the role of NSA in developing the so-called \\\"digital signature standard\\\" (DSS), a communications authentication technology that NIST proposed for government-wide use in 1991.  After CPSR sued NIST in a FOIA lawsuit last year, the civilian agency disclosed for the first time that NSA had, in fact, developed that security standard. NSA is due to file papers in federal court next week justifying the classification of records concerning its creation of the DSS.          David Sobel, CPSR Legal Counsel, called the administration's apparent commitment to the privacy of electronic communications, as reflected in today's official statement,  \\\"a step in the right direction.\\\"  But he questioned the propriety of NSA's role in the process and the apparent secrecy that has thus far shielded the development process from public scrutiny.  \\\"At a time when we are moving towards the development of a new information infrastructure, it is vital that standards designed to protect personal privacy be established openly and with full public participation.  It is not appropriate for NSA -- an agency with a long tradition of secrecy and opposition to effective civilian cryptography -- to play a leading role in the development process.\\\"          CPSR is a national public-interest alliance of computer industry professionals dedicated to examining the impact of technology on society.

Thousands of Armenians were serving the German army and  Waffen-SS in Russia and Western Europe. Armenians were involved in  espionage and fifth-column activities for Hitler in the Balkans and  Arabian Peninsula. They were promised an 'independent' state under  German 'protection' in an agreement signed by the 'Armenian National  Council.' (A copy of this agreement can be found in the 'Congressional  Record,' November 1, 1945; see Document 1.) On this side of the Atlantic,  Nazi Armenians were aware of their brethrens alliance. They had often  expressed pro-Nazi sentiments until America entered the war. In summary, during World War II Armenians were carried away with the German might and cringing and fawning over the Nazis. In that zeal, the Armenian publication in Germany, Hairenik, carried statements as follows:[1]  \\\"Sometimes it is difficult to eradicate these poisonous elements (the Jews)  when they have struck deep root like a chronic disease, and when it   becomes necessary for a people (the Nazis) to eradicate them in an uncommon  method, these attempts are regarded as revolutionary.

What I see as arrogance and the problem I have  with it is not a sense of personal certainty, but a lack of respect for others who come to differing conclusions.  Clearly, this is not just  Christian vs. Non-Christian; there is a whole spectrum of belief systems within Christianity.  I do not tend to argue with others about matters of personal faith because, like aesthetics, it is not demonstable by objective means.    Choosing what to believe and rely on are important areas of personal  sovereignty.  What bothers me is when others suggest that, in these  matters of faith, their specific beliefs are not only true to them  but are absolute and should be binding on others.  It follows from this that God must give everyone the same revelation of truth, and thus  anyone who comes to a different conclusion is intentionally choosing the wrong path.  This is the arrogance I see; a lack of respect for the honest conclusions of others on matters which are between them and God. Even a personal certainty leaves room for the beliefs of others.  It is universalizing those matters of personal faith, coupled by a proud notion that one's relationship with God is superior to other's, that leads to arrogance.

(Nothing serious, just enough to keep him out of a game. :)    In most cases, the owners have very little to do with it.  They give their general managers one order when it comes to the draft...find me the best players so that our team will win the Stanley Cup.  Whether that player is in Kindersley, Saskatchewan or Chelyabinsk, Russia, if the GM believes him to be the better player, the GM should be drafting him.  Where do you get off calling the NHL THEIR league, when referring to Canadian players.  It doesn't belong to them, it belongs to the owners.  The owners can do what they want.  While a 'Canadian content' rule might be enforcable here in Canada, there is enough doubt that it would be enforcable in the US that the CFL (sorry for the football reference) didn't even TRY to push their import ratio rule on the Sacromento Goldminers.  Increasing the competition for the 'elite' positions, in most cases, would make players better anyways.  (Oh yeah, and how many Europeans play at the lower levels of professional hockey in North America?  While there are some that play in the AHL, or the IHL where that's an NHL team's primary farm club, you don't hear of many Europeans playing in the CHL, the ECHL, or on the secondary farm teams in the IHL.  (ie. the Jets do have a few Russian players in Moncton, but I don't believe there are any Europeans in Ft. Wayne.)) So with all those teams, there are plenty of positions for hockey players in North America.   I'm in favour of the NHL being the league for the premier players in the world.  I've grown up with Europeans playing on 'my' team, and some of those players were the among the best in the world.

Chris -- \",\" But the Question was later revealed to be:  What is 9 x 6?  (In the base 13 system, of course.)  \",\"Some sick part of me really liked that phrase....\",\" Perhaps we have different definitions of absolute then.  To me, an absolute is something that is constant across time, culture, situations, etc.  True in every instance possible.  Do you agree with this definition?  I think you do:   A simple example:  In the New Testament (sorry I don't have a Bible at work, and can't provide a reference), women are instructed to be silent and cover their heads in church.  Now, this is scripture.  By your definition,  this is truth and therefore absolute.    Do women in your church speak?  Do they cover their heads?  If all  scripture is absolute truth, it seems to me that women speaking in and  coming to church with bare heads should be intolerable to evangelicals.   Yet, clearly, women do speak in evangelical churches and come with bare  heads.  (At least this was the case in the evangelical churches I grew  up in.)  Evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture  to be absolute truth.  (And there are plenty of other examples.) Can you reconcile this?   I don't claim that there are *no* absolutes.  I think there are very few, though, and determining absolutes is difficult.    But you are claiming that all of Scripture is absolute.  How can you determine absolutes derived from Scripture when you can't agree how to interpret the Scripture?    It's very difficult to see how you can claim something which is based  on your own *interpretation* is absolute.  Do you deny that your own background, education, prejudices, etc. come into play when you read the  Bible, and determine how to interpret a passsage?  Do you deny that  you in fact interpret?\",\"Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, lend me your ears for but a moment,     The National Legue Eastern Division Champions will be the...

I didn't suggest that all  government regulations be subject to referenda.  So I don't follow the  comments above.   I mean that an ideology that treats all government regulation as equally undesirable and seeks to abolish all regulations is unlikely to draw support among more than a miniscule portion of the electorate.  Furthermore, I am suggesting that such a plan is not feasible in an industrial society because the weight of litigation and/or misery it would produce would effectively crush productive effort.  No, I'm not surprised.  I just think it's interesting that on one hand libertarians assume a limited government can be decreed, yet on the other posit an entire government made up of people who carry guns.  (I realize that many libertarians assume that such a government will be  counterbalanced by a fully armed citizenry, but it is worth noting that widespread civilian ownership of guns does not necessarily prevent the establishment of totalitarian government, e.g. Iraq.)  Yup, sure do.  But since I also support the constitutional requirement that the government provide for the general welfare (Article I section 8), I'm willing to justify such programs on that basis.  Well, in the first place, I don't support a \\\"socialized economic system.\\\" I think within limits that capitalism is a fine idea.  But it is not the case that \\\"any third party...is...as likely to be ignorant or corrupt as the buyer or seller.\\\"  There are multitudes of examples where such a statement is demonstrably false.  Regulation of stock market transactions that provide a reasonable basis for buyers to avoid fraud is only one example.  jsh \",\" Firstly, I would never consider trying to make a one-shot timer. Your 2F2 cap will have been designed as a RAM battery substitute, rather than for use in applications where you wish to drain the cap with a constant current. Their performance, in some respects, is more akin to batteries than to a normal cap. The other point is that big electro's are usually rated with -5%+20% tolerances, so calculating exactly what capacitance you have (particularly when considering the cold).  You should be looking at designing a micropower oscillator and divider chain, that \\\"rolls over\\\" (from zero to maximum count, or vice-versa) once every 1,209,600 seconds. If you were to use something like a 110Hz clock, you would need a divider chain of 2^27, to give an error of less than one percent in the firing times over the six week period. Of course, you could trim the 110Hz oscillator to give you exact time, but the likelyhood of the oscillator remaining exactly constant at -40 is low anyway.  I would suspect that there would be far more battrey drain in firing the solenoid than there would be in the timer circuit.  Caveat - I'm not experienced in low temperature electronics, so I can't guarantee that this (or any other) approach is the best for inhospitable conditions.

If the HGA was working,  they could slew around in near real time (Less speed of light delay).  But when they were imaging toutatis????  didn't someone have to get lucky on a guess to find the first images?     Also, I imagine S-L 1993e will be mostly a visual image.  so how will that affect the other imaging missions.  with the LGA,  there is a real tight allocation of bandwidth.

The IR source could be emitting a signature; I'm leaning toward 30 KHz square wave with 50% duty cycle.  I am considering the use of a quadrant detector from Centronic Inc. to give information to a pan/tilt head to point the sensor and thus determine the angles.  For the source I am considering wazing the heck out of an IR LED(s), possibly an Optek OP290 or Motorola MLED81.  Wazing would mean at least 1 Amp current pulses.  At this current the duty cycle of the LED drops to 10% and I would need to cycle five of them in turn to get the 50% required.

For instance, 'No one should ever deliberately inflict pain on another simply to take pleasure in his suffering' might be thought of as a plausible example.  Even in a world of sadists who all rejected it, the contention remains true, just as '5 + 7 = 12' remains correct even if there is no one left to count.  The problem for the objectivist is to determine the status of moral truths and the method by which they can be established.  If we accept that such judgements are not reports of what is but only relate to what ought to be (see naturalistic fallacy) then they cannot be proved by any facts about the nature of the world.  Nor can they be analytic, since this would involve lack of action-guiding content;  'One ought always to do the right thing' is plainly true in virtue of the vords involved but it is unhelpful as a practical guide to action (see analytic and synthetic).  At this point the objectivist may talk of 'self-evident truths', but can he deny the subjectivist's claim that self-evidence is in the mind of the beholder?  If not, what is left of the claim that some moral judgements are true?  THe subjectivist may well feel that all that remains is that there are some moral judgements with which he would wish to associate himself.  To hold a moral opinion is, he suggests, not to know something to be true but to have preferences regarding human activity.\\\"\",\"  With yet another tax being floated by the Clinton administration to pay for new ``free'' social programs, I've really begun to suspect that the Canadians, long resentful of their place in the American shadow, brainwashed an American draft dodger who fled to Canada some time between 1966 and 1968, tutored him in the ways of Canadian socialism, awarded him with smokeless marijuana cigarettes when he got the correct answers, then returned him to the states (under the control of the domineering wife assigned to his case) to attain high public office and destroy the evil individualistic and free market forces in America, thus shaping America in the Canadian image.\",\" wondering                                                       -------------  Do you mean Juan Berenguer?

(although the Internet comes close.)\",\" I don't find this a credible argument, for two reasons.  One you have supplied below: unless I care about entering the USA at any time in the future (eg. the Taiwanese backyard cloners - who BTW have been known to decap custom silicon and reproduce it on daughterboards when pirating high-profit arcade machines and the like - who wouldn't care less), I am not  going to care much about US confidentiality, am I?  Only people like the real me, who does care about travelling to various countries for business reasons, will sit up and follow laws like this, but I would contend that we're not the main threat.  I also have grave doubts whether an algorythm widely distributed in silicon could possibly be called \\\"classified.\\\"  It's like handing out military secrets to the whole world in envelopes marked \\\"don't open me.\\\"  I can imagine several credible defences which could be employed if it came to a trial.  One would be the stupidity of the government's actions.   Amusing thought: could they have employed an algorythm which is infeasable for a fast software implementation, but which is easy in custom hardware? In DES, the extensive use of permutation tables (trivial in hardware: you just swap bus lines), but relatively slow in software have had a big effect on the speed difference between hardware and software implementations of that cipher (indeed, I suspect that Lucifer's designers were well aware that it would be, and approved.)  Certain algorythms (usually parallel search algorythms) can be very slow in software, yet can fly in custom hardware. I have no proof of their employment in Clipper -- it is pure conjecture.   However, as a software implementation of this cipher is something that its  designers would have been trying to avoid at all costs, then the inclusion  of such techniques seems credible.  Hmmm... I also wonder what Intergraph thinks about the use of the name \\\"Clipper\\\" for this device. :) \",\"  How could this possibly be \\\"environmental vandalism\\\" when there is no \\\"environment\\\" to vandalize up there?

No doubt.  People are always looking for something to protest about, so it would be no surprise.   Well, look on the, er, bright side.

This description   1. ignores the role of the ballast,  2. misrepresents the heating effects in the starter.  The bimetalic strip cools down immediately after the contacts short circuit, because the neon discharge stops, and much less heat is generated from the I^2R loss in the metal as compared to the neon discharge.  The starter contacts open before the tube fires.  Actually, the tube fires as a result of the back-emf generated in the ballast because of this immediate opening of the starter's contacts.  A capacitor is connected in parallel with the contacts to prevent excessive arcing during the firing.  The neon reionizes but does not draw sufficient current to prevent firing of the tube itself.\",\"High power assault gun?  Why, you must be talking about the 155mm Howitzer.

This is a second RFD, replacing the one originally posted in January '93 (and never taken to a vote).  The proposed groups are described below:  NAME:   comp.os.ms-windows.nt.setup STATUS:  Unmoderated. PURPOSE: Discussions about setting up and installing Windows NT, and about   system and peripheral compatability issues for Windows NT.  NAME:  comp.os.ms-windows.nt.misc STATUS:  Unmoderated. PURPOSE: Miscellaneous non-programming discussions about using Windows NT,   including issues such as security, networking features, console   mode and Windows 3.1 (Win16) compatability.  RATIONALE:  Microsoft NT is the newest member of the Microsoft Windows family  of operating systems (or operating environments for those who wish  to argue about the meaning of an \\\"OS\\\").  The family ranges from  Modular Windows through Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups to  Windows NT at the high end.  To date, Microsoft has shipped over  50,000 beta copies and pre-release SDKs of Windows NT -- the  actual release is slated for May/June '93.   While Windows NT has an entirely new design internally, it shares  an application programming interface with the other members of the  Windows family; its Win32 API includes the Win16 API used in Win-  dows 3.1, and the Win32s API subset (Win32 less threads, networking  and security) can be used to create 32-bit applications for  Windows 3.1.   The user interface is also practically identical to that of Windows  3.1, with the addition of logins and a few other features.  It uses  Program Manager, File Manager and other applets, and generally pre-  sents an identical appearance to the user.  Many of the announced  Windows NT applications are ports of existing Windows 3.1 apps, and  NT also runs existing 3.1 applications.   Thus, it appears logical that Windows NT should share the following  groups with the other members of the Windows family:   comp.os.ms-windows.apps   comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.tools   comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.misc   comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.win32    The following groups are also clearly applicable to Windows NT as  well as Windows 3.1:   comp.os.ms-windows.announce   comp.os.ms-windows.advocacy    In conclusion, the only clear argument for the separation of the  Windows 3.1 and Windows NT hierarchies is different internal  structures of Windows 3.1 and Windows NT.  And yet operating  systems such as OS/2, Macintosh OS, Xenix and Coherent all have  undergone major rewrites without having been split into separate  newsgroup hierarchies.   Further, Windows 3.1 is due for a major rewrite itself in 1994 --  when the fully 32-bit, protected-mode and with-DOS-built-in next-  generation Windows, \\\"Chicago\\\", debuts next year, surely it should  remain in the same hierarchy.  And what, then, would be the jus-  tification for separating Windows NT from other Windows versions?   DISCUSSION PERIOD:  The discussion period will run from 27 April, 1992 to 18 May, 1993.    VOTING:  The CFV (Call for Votes) will be issued around 19 May, 1993, based on  the feedback received during the discussion period.  No votes will  be accepted prior to the CFV.\",\"  not a flame, just a point:  I'd be scared at 130 here, not because i feel drivers who are STUPID.

That's *your* *interpretation* of these texts.   2 Peter 1:20-21 But know this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture is a matter  of one's own interpretation, for no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.  The study notes in my Bible offer three possible meanings for verse 20. Apparantly it's not as clear to Charles Ryrie as it is to you.  2 Timothy 3:16-17 All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work.  Galations 1:11-12 For I would have you know, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man.  For I neither received it from man,  nor was I taught it, but I receieved it through a revelation of Jesus Christ.  When I read these passages, it was not immediately clear to me what every phrase meant.  I had stop and think about the possible connotations of words, what the intent of the author may have been, wonder if the translator used the correct English word to convey the  same meaning: I had to interpret.  If you want to believe that your  are not interpreting Scripture as you read, there's probably nothing  I can say to change your mind.  But I think it's naive to think that  our culture, experiences, education, do not affect everything we read.   In college, I took an entire course in Biblical interpretation.  Go to any Christian bookstore, there are scores of books on interpreting and understanding Scripture.

When graphed, these define the 'flight envelope' of that aircraft, presumably so named because the graphed line encloses (envelopes) the area on the graph that represents conditions where the aircraft doesn't fall out of the sky.  Hence, 'pushing the envelope' becomes 'operating at (or beyond) the edge of the flight (or operational) envelope'.   Note that the envelope isn't precisely known until someone actually flies the airplane in those regions -- up to that point, all there are are the theoretical predictions.  Hence, one of the things test pilots do for a living is 'push the envelope' to find out how close the correspondence between the paper airplane and the metal one is -- in essence, 'pushing back' the edges of the theoretical envelope to where the airplane actually starts to fail to fly.  Note, too, that this is done is a quite calculated and careful way; flight tests are generally carefully coreographed and just what is going to be 'pushed' and how far is precisely planned (despite occasional deviations from plans, such as the 'early' first flight of the F-16 during its high-speed taxi tests).

Numerous articles in major newspapers  (London Times) and periodicals (Newsweek) during the war, had suggested  the existence of a significant collaboration between Armenians and the  Nazis. Arthur Derounian deserves credit for being the first person to  deal with this issue extensively. Derounian's motives were twofold: his  deeply held democratic convictions gave him a sense of duty and he felt  obliged to shed light on this yet another dark chapter of Armenian history. Concurrently, Derounian embarked on what one would call 'crisis control'  or face-saving. In order to forestall any potential attacks on the larger  Armenian community in the United States, he marginalized collaboration  as deplorable but insignificant.[1]  [1] John Roy Carlson (real name Arthur Derounian), 'The Plotters,'     E.

A magazine called Mitteilungsblatt der Deutsch-Armenischen Gesselschaft  is the clearest and most definite proof of this collaboration. The   magazine was first published in Berlin in 1938 during Nazi rule of Germany  and continued publication until the end of 1944. Even the name of the  magazine, which implies a declaration of Armenian-Nazi cooperation,  is attention-getting.   This magazine, every issue of which proves the collaboration, is historically  important as documentary evidence. It is a heap of writing that should be  an admonition to world opinion and to all mankind.    In Nazi Germany, Armenians were considered to be an Aryan race and certain  political, economic, and social rights were thus granted to them. They   occupied positions in public service and were partners in Nazi practices.  The whole world of course knows what awaited those who were not considered   \\\"Aryan\\\" and what befell them.

No. RK makes radial cuts around the circumference of the cornea, up to 8 I think, and these change the curvature of the cornea through stress chages. PRK vaporizes (burns) away a thin layer from the front of the cornea making the optical axis of the eye shorter. The laser doesn't cut in PRK, it vaporizes. In RK, the eye is cut into.

The technology of cellular phones will probably be spread spectrum and quite difficult to record the crypttext without the key.  If the frequency path depends on they key, as I understand it to, it *could* be made effectively impossible to record.  Once it hits land you can record it if you have telco access.  The telco isn't supposed to give that without a warrant.  That's the rule today.  But even so, the evidence would not be admissible, I think, unless the judge so ordered.  I think that even interception of the crypttext without a warrant would be illegal.   Cops can't record today's plain cellular calls and then ask a judge, \\\"Hey, can we have permission to listen to those tapes?\\\" can they?   Yes, that is a major concern, but I think that they think they can win just by having 99.5% of the USA use this system.  They don't even have to care about the cautious .5% that's left.  They don't catch the really smart crooks anyway.   John Gotti, who would have to be retarded not to realize he was likely to be wiretapped, glibly chatted away on his tapped phone about murder plans.  That's why he's in jail now.

They like this enough that they are dropping the so called \\\"Digital Telephony\\\" proposal, according to rumours.  However the meaning of that is complex, since they still want to get at the crypttext on telco systems, and that requires a bit of work.\",\"As promised, I spoke today with the company mentioned in a Washington Times article about the Clipper chip announcement. The name of the company is Secure Communicatiions Technology (Information will be given at the end of this message on how to contact them).     Basically they are disturbed about the announcement for many reasons that we are. More specifically however, Mr. Bryen of Secure Communications brought to light many points that might interest most of the readers.     His belief is that AT&T was made known of the clipper well before the rest of the industry. This is for several reasons, several of which are:   - A company of AT&T's size could never be able to make a decision to use    the new chip on the SAME DAY it was announced.   - Months ago they proposed using their own chip for AT&T's secure telephone    devices. AT&T basically blew them off as being not interested at all.    This stuck them as strange, until now...      Also I spoke with Art Melnick, their cryptographer, he expressed several concerns over the new Clipper Chip:    - The obvious backdoor will be able to let many people decrypt the code.    - Once the key is released to authorities the security of the crypto     system is lost forever. These keys can end up in the hands of any agency     of the government.    - The fact that the escrowed keys never change means that the algorithm     is vulnerable over time to an attacker.    - The classified algorithm may hide another backdoor. But he feels that     it is probably to keep people from forging fake serial numbers, or     changing the keys themselves.    - Additionally he feels that the NSA has probably spent enough time and     money in working on a way to keep this chip from being reversed     engineered, that he feels that reverse engineering it will be very     difficult to do. He feels that they have developed a suitable technique     to protect the chip from this attack. Also he feels that the chip is     hardware encoded with the algorithm and not microcoded onto the chip.  Additonally I spoke with Mr. Melnick about their algorithm. He couldn't tell me much about their new agorithm because it hasn't been patented yet. However he told me a little:   - The algorithm will be released for public review after patents have been    granted for it. This is so the crypto community can see that it is    secure.   - The algorithm is called NEA for New Encryption Algorithm.    The details were sketchy because now it is held as a trade secret    until the patent was issued, but I was told that it will incorporate    the following:      - It will have fast encryption of data (Exact specs not given, but       Mr. Melnick stated \\\"Much faster than what an RS-232 can put out.\\\")      - It is a symmetric cipher, just like IDEA and DES.      - It will use 64 bit data blocks for encryption (like DES and IDEA).      - The key length was not given to me, but Mr. Melnick states that       it is _adujustable_ and is \\\"More than adequate for security.\\\"      - The algorithm is written in C and Assembler in software form, and       can be ported to many platforms (Unlike the the Clipper Chip which       is hardware ONLY and cannot be made into software) This I       consider a definite plus for the NEA for widespread use.      - The algorithm will accomodate public key distribution techniques       such as RSA or Diffie-Hellman. This will also be supported in the       hardware chip.      - Right now the projected cost of the NEA chip will be about 10 dollars       for each!! (Clipper will run 25 each chip [that is if it is produced       enough, which probably won't happen]).      - They currently sell a program called C-COM that uses the algorithm       and a special streaming protocol that does not divide the encrypted       data into \\\"blocks.\\\" This could prevent plaintext attacks if you know       what the block header is. This program operates at all supported       RS-232 speeds and uses the software implementation of the algorithm.      - Most importantly: IT DOES NOT HAVE A BACKDOOR!!    Right now the company is afraid that the new clipper chip will put them out of business. This is a very real possibility. So they really need help in stopping the clipper chip from becoming a standard. If you want to contact them, they can be reached at..

The problem in this case is at least as bad as that of trying to explain quantum mechanics and relativity in the terms of ordinary experience.

Getting a flushed face is due to the heart pumping the blood faster than a regular pulse.  I suspect this is related to an increase in sodium levels in the blood, since note *sodium chloride* monosodium glutamate. Both are sodium compounds. Our bodies require sodium, but like everything else, one can get too much of a good thing.   Again, this could be related to increased blood flow from increased heart rate, from the sodium in the MSG. Distended crainial arteries, essentially. One of many causes of headaches. There is no discrepency her, necessarily.    Well stomache ache and vomiting tend to be related. Again, not necessarily a discrepency. More likely a related reaction. Vomiting occurs as a response to get rid of a noxious compound an organism has eaten. If a person can't digest the stuff (entirely possible - the list of stuff people are allergic to is quite long), and lacks an enzyme to break it down, gastrointestinal distress (stomach or belly ache) would be expected.     These are respiratory reactions, and are now considered to be similar to vomitting. They are a way for the body to dispose of noxious compounds. They are adaptiove responses. Of course, it is possible some other food or environmental compound could be responsible for the symptoms. But it's important to remember that a lot opf these effets can be additive, synergystic, subtractive, etc, etc. It would be necessary to know exactly what was in a dish, and what else the person was exposed to. Respiratory does sound suspicious BUT  resopiration and heart rate are connected.  Things in the body are far from simple...very inetractive place, the vertebrate body.    People respond in a myriad of ways to the same compound. It depends upon what it is about the compound that \\\"pisses off\\\" their body. Pollen, for example, of some plants aggrivates breathing in many people, because, when inhaled, it sets of the immune system, and an histamine attack is launched. The immune system goes overboard, causing the allergic person a lot of misery. And someone with an allergy to some pollens will have trouble with some herb teas that contain pollens (Chamomile, linden, etc). Drinking the substance can perturb that person's system as much as inhaling it.    See above. And don't think that heart rate changes, and circulatory problems are not serious. They can be deadly.  and brain damage.   The area of the brain effected is the neuroendocrine system controlling the release of gonadotropin, the supra-hormone controlling the cyclical release of testosterone and estradiol, as well as somatostatin, and other steroids. Testing for effective dose would be, uh, a wee bit unethical.   poisoning.   Absolutely. But it could also be some synergystic mess from eating , say, undetected shrimp or mushrooms (to which many are allergic), plus too much alcohol, and inhaling too much diesel fumes biking home, plus, let's say, having contracted flu from one's sig. other 3 days before from drinking out of the same glass. Could be all sorts of things.  But it might be the MSG.    If noone else got sick, its likely not food poisoning. Probably stomach flu or an undetected thing the guy's allergic to.   Anyway, the human body's not a machine; people vary widely in their responses, and a lot of reactions are due to combinations of things.\",\"Is it possible to use WinQVT/Net on a machine that uses NDIS to connect to a Token Ring ?

I've misplaced the original text, but the story started with one resident calling the  cops on a gang member.  Sure enough, a few nights later, there was a  drive-by performed at the resident's house.  Except that this time, unlike in LA, the entire street came out and returned fire, putting an end to the car's occupants.  The gang packed up and left.

You seem content to underestimate the electorate; I'm willing to try to raise their consciousness.   I think we can.  HCI was founded in what, 1980?  In the mid-80's, they ran a \\\"One  Million Strong!\\\" campaign for two years before reaching this goal.   My understanding is that they \\\"reached\\\" it by the stratagem of including wide classes of people other than dues-paying members.  (I can't speak authoritatively on this -- maybe somebody else has details.)  Then they started running a \\\"Two Million Strong!\\\" campaign for a while -- but they let it slip into unannounced obscurity when it became clear that they simply were never going to reach that level of membership.  In 1964, just after the commencement of the Dodd Hearings -- the starting point of the modern gun-control movement, the NRA had a mere 625,000 members.   By 1968, barely after the first murmurs of future registration, it had  about a million.  Today, it has over three million members, making it the third largest membership organization in the country (next to AARP and AAA). And its membership is GROWING FASTER than at any previous time.  (Historical figures from Kukla's \\\"Gun Control,\\\" pp. 61 and 420.)  As you say, many of the people in the middle of this debate are bemused by their T-bones and MTV.

Both courses, Intensive Elementary Japanese and  Intensive Intermediate Japanese, are ten week, ten credit courses  each equivalent to one full year of Japanese language study.  They begin  June 7 and end August 13.  The courses meet five days per week, five hours  per day.  There is a flat rate tuition charge of $1600 per course.   Fellowships available for science and engineering students.  Contact  Steven Brener, Program Manager of the Japanese Science and Technology Management Program, at the University of Pittsburgh at the number or address below.   ALL INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS ARE ENCOURAGED TO APPLY, THIS IS NOT LIMITED TO  UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.        ####################################################################### #################   New Program Announcement   ######################## #######################################################################               JAPANESE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM  The Japanese Science and Technology Management Program (JSTMP) is a new program jointly developed by the University of Pittsbugh and Carnegie Mellon  University.  Students and professionals in the engineering and scientific  communitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June 1993 and  January 1994.   PROGRAM OBJECTIVES The program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and the  United States.  It is also designed to let scientists, engineers, and managers experience how the Japanese proceed with technological development.  This is  facilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities and laboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop long-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts.   PROGRAM DESIGN To fulfill the objectives of the program, participants will be required to  develop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and its culture.  Correspondingly, JSTMP consists of three major components:  1. TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE Several Japanese language courses will be offered, including intensive courses designed to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a relatively short time.  2. EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE A particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the cultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in  manufacturing and information technology.  Courses will be available in a  variety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology, Sociology, History, and Political Science.  Moreover, seminars and colloquiums will be conducted.  Further, a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or  research facilities in the United States will be scheduled.   3. AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAN Upon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU,  participants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe, and participate in the management of technology.  Internships in Japan will generally run for one year; however, shorter ones are possible.   FELLOWSHIPS COVERING TUITION FOR LANGUAGE AND CULTURE COURSES, AS WELL AS STIPENDS FOR LIVING EXPENSES ARE AVAILABLE.

If you want the nothings you drop in your wife's ear to remain secret and private, that is not even on the agenda for debate. Note that there is NO role for you to contain private info in this. The only reference is to information already in the hands of others. The 'unauthorized release' bit is also drawing a long bow. Most of these cases are by people who have legitimate access abusing it, and revealing, or often selling the info. These people are, of course, in this proposal, the people who will have the keys.  The criminals also use lawers, courts, the CIA, white-house officials and pens to go about their business. When will they be outlawed as well? Yeah, several of them would be a better idea than CLipper!  Them again, the protections of law and the courts have been seriously erroded over the last decade ofr so.                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ NSA   Yeah, this bit is VERY true.   Note the repeated mixing of telephone scrabeling and encryption. A demo of the above claim on an ordanary POTS would be a good nights entertainment I suspect. Note also the 'many'. not 'all', as the general tone implies.                                  ^^^^^^^^^                                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  The case record seems to indicate that what is needed is a brutal tightening of the current abuses. I have not heard, yet, of a case that was impeaded by the use of secure encryption by the men in black. The other side, abuse by law enforcers is well documented, even by govt agencies. And the phone vs other coms is blurred yet again.                                   Lets run that line twice. Not **VERY** carefully what it says. The stated purpose of the key eschrow is to make the use of Clipper compulsory. Note the word \\\"ensure\\\". As to 'protect', or 'law-abiding', I will leave to you. So to the person who asked if it included the outlawing of other encryptions, the answer in this press release is, YES.   Just as they only can wiretap now with a warrent.    Just makes sure that the illegal ones are preserved.   Where do you find many experts. Any ex KGB people looking for a contract? :-) And as a later posting asks, what of the STU-IIIs they already have. It will be very interesting to see if the military and US embasies start to use it. After all, it is secure, isn't it. The govt will answer that point by its own actions.                                                  ^^^^^^^^  Again, personal use seems to be a unaskable question.                                                    ^^^^^  Ah, so warrents are not always needed it seems.   The ITARs seem to slightly impeed this.   Note that all this wonderfull stuff will be in secret. Only the 'proper people' will be able to express an opinion, hence only the desired result will emerge.   Encryption and codes have been around for millenia. They are generaly in equilibrium with the technology of the time. The systematic study of cyphers has resulted in a swing in favor of the encrypter, AT THE MOMENT. I have no doubt that the factoring problem will fall in time. Probably fofr practical purposes by the middle of the next century.   It is a little hard to critisise a non-proposal.   Note we drop back to 'phone-mode' again. If this is a true answer, it can be rephrased as \\\" It sucks big time. Anyone who can drive the crypt work-bench will use it for light amusement before breakfast.\\\"   This link between the security of the key-eschrow, and the actual algorithm is  a real winner. Given that I have 2 secret 40 bit numbers, could someone please explain how the details of an encryption algorithm will reveal them?   Just make sure you read the CVs REAL carfully, OK.

I would say \\\"less secure, less conveniant, more expensive ( PGP is free ), less available, and more prone to being comprimised\\\" Proofs to the contarary will be welcome. Note PROOF.   They don't seem to be saying anything that makes much sense. And this proposal DOES prohibit it except in a very limited way. And, this is the one explicit reference to personal rights. It is a denial. And yes, I don't think that the Mexicans, Brazilians, and Canucks are included in Clinton et als magnanamous gesture.   The 'false tension' is false. The balance is between two repugnant points. The RIGHT to privacy is hand-waved to non-existance by putting it behind the \\\"false assessment\\\". It is assumed that the removal of the right to take what ever steps YOU deem suitable to protect YOUR privacy is non negotiable, hence is defined in the govenment language to be non-existant. If you don't agree, you must be a criminal, as only criminals don't agree with out laws. Also note the non- question. \\\"If what is here was not possible...\\\"   It indicates we know that Bush dropped the ball in squashing that nasty < insert suitable retoric > and will stamp out this disorderly, unruley outbreak of freedom and ultra-national sentiment.   This one is a real giggle. In Australia or France, they will have to reveal the keys, and the algorithm.

I will attempt to construct a facsimile of what was previously said, and  then address Kermit's offering.  John Redelfs originally wrote...    jr> I learned that a man cannot frustrate justice by repenting on his   jr> death bed because repentance is more than a feeling of remorse.  It   jr> requires faith in Christ proven by following him, by keeping his   jr> commandments.  Such cannot be accomplished on ones deathbed.  Tom Albrecht responded...    ta> So Jesus must have lied to the thief on the cross.  John Redelfs wrote back that...    jr> Paradise and salvation are not the same thing.  Salvation is better.   jr> Refer to John 14:2.  I responded to John that...    rw>    I don't see the effort to equate salvation with paradise.   rw>   rw>    Rather, I see implied the fact that only those who are saved   rw> may enter paradise.  To which Kermit wrote...  kt> Incomplete reference: kt> kt> See also the discussion: Did Jesus go into Hell in the BibleStudy group kt> for the arguments that Paradise and Hell(sheol) are places after death kt> The discussion (no LDS were involved as far as I could see) argued using kt> standard Christian argument from the Bible that pretty much support the kt> LDS position. kt> kt>    Christ went to paridise after his death and burial. kt> kt>    He taught the prisoners and freed them from Darkness. kt> kt>    When he was resurrected, he had not yet ascended to his father. kt> kt> The arguement centered around what was or wasn't the proper biblical kt> terms for those places.       I respond.       The question that was raised was not if Jesus went to infernal Paradise      before entering into heaven. No one has made a point for or against       that issue, nor have they compared the LDS position against orthodox      belief. The infernal paradise is held to be Abraham's bosom (Luke 16),       the place of the righteous dead in sheol (equivalent to hades).       The point that was raised by John was that someone could not repent      on their death bed. Tom Albrecht pointed to a Biblical example that was      contradictory to what John's position put forward. The thief on the       cross was promised by Christ to be with Him in Paradise, the abode of       the righteous dead. John's position possibly needs to be reworked.      Kermit needs to address the topic at hand.\",\"One thing is certain, though, its still too cold.  After about 40  Hell! This is WARM.

I have thought about the implications, and it is scary.    We have a whole generation of families broken up because some men have  decided that is is okay to leave their wives and children for the thrill of a younger, more attractive woman.  If we accept that it is legitimate for Jane to have divorced, how can we not accept anyone's decision to divorce because he has found someone with whom he can have a more \\\"deep, committed relationship.\\\"  Marriage is not a state of being, it is a mutual journey in life. Love is not a passive feeling, it must be actively willed.  Is it acceptable for an older executive to dump his wife of many  years who stayed home to care for the children because he can't be happy sexually unless he is with a beautiful young blonde?  The real solution for both in the couple to make a renewed effort.    Hold fast to the faith.  Has not the Lord repeatedly compared His relation to His people as a faithful and enduring husband?  We learn something very deep and very mystical when we marry and remain faithful through times of trial.  My spouse has a brain tumor that has left her partially paralyzed. If it were to resume growing (it is in remission, thanks be to God!) then perhaps the time would come when we could not have sexual relations.  That's life...the Lord would certainly not give me permission to seek someone else to satisfy my \\\"needs.\\\"    The idea that it is alright to divorce if a couple \\\"grows apart\\\" seems to me to lead to such a monstrous destruction of the meaning of marriage that I feel we must make every effort to avoid any hint of compromise.

I would go further, and say that much of the damage to the environment has been caused by the secular worldview, or by the humanist worldview, and especially by the secular humanist worldview.  This is not to say that ALL secular humanists are necessarily avid destroyers of the environment, and I am sure that there are many who are concerned about the environment. But at the time of the Renaissance and Ref ormation in Western Europe man became the centre, or the focus of culture (hence \\\"humanism\\\"). This consciousness was also secular, in the sense that it was concerned primarily with the present age, r ather than the age to come. Capitalism arose at the same time, and the power of economics became central in philosophy. This doesn't mean that economics did not exist before, simply that it began to dominate the conscious cultural values of Western European society and its offshoots. This cultural shift was, in its later stages, accompanied by industrial revolutions and the values that justified  them.  There was a fundamental cultural shift in the meaning of \\\"economics\\\" - from the Christian view of man as the economos, the steward, of creation to the secular idea of man as the slave of economic forces and powers. There were denominational differences among the new worshippers of Mammon. For some the name of the deity was \\\"the free rein of the market mechanism\\\", while for others it was \\\"the dialectical forces of history\\\". But in both the capitalist West and the socialist East the environment was sacrificed on the altar of Mammon. The situation was mitigated in the West because thos e who were concerned about the damage to the environment had more freedom to oppose what was happening and state their case.

Anybody knows compression-algorithms & -factors for voice ?  I've posted some info on CELP coding on sci.crypt.  Looks like you can squeeze speech into 4000bps if you have a fast enough computer like a sparcstation (or a Newton with the Acorn Risc Machine in it :-) )  This drops the bandwidth to so low a figure that it's feasible to run speech over tcp/ip running on top of slip down a v32bis modem.  Not only will this let us run point to point encrypted speech, it'll let us run speech internationally over the internet if no-one stops us by getting *very* heavy about regulations.  The thought of this, if the administration realised, would probably scare them shitless.  Now of course the trick is to develop and define a standard protocol for internet speech *damn fast*, allowing anyone who feels brave to inplement custom handheld hardware as well as us hacking it on our workstations.  Shouldn't be too difficult.  The CELP stuff is standardised, we use tcp/ip streams, and a protocol allowing silences to be used to catch up on any net lag, and also to avoid sending any data during silences (ie it's not wise to be synchronised real-time on each end because any net delays would add up to big voice-lags)  As for me, I'm going to press ahead on trying this stuff as soon as I get my sparc back from being loaned out and buy the necessary microphone. It'll save me a fortune in calling my friend in texas every night :) (whether encrypted or not)  You know, surely *someone* is working on this.  Who?  It's so obvious, why doesn't it exist already?

As for 'war' I am not sure how I would define it. If you just look at attacks on villages then there is no way of deciding when it started. Would you count the riots in the 20's and 30's? Violence but not war. I personally think that 'war', as opposed to civil disturbance or whatever, requires organisation, planning and some measure of regualr or semi-regular forces. Perhaps the Arab Liberation Army counts. I could easily be convinced it was so. From what I know they did not have a great deal of planning let alone organisation. The Haganah and Palmach certainly did. That is not a cause for criticism, it merely reflects the great organisation generally in the 'Zionist' camp.   Now you are being silly aren't you? In any case the war did NOT start with the invasion of the Arab Armies. You see we both agree on something. And the previous posters were wrong, no?   Again I am not sure, I doubt you want my opinion anyway, but I think war requires organisation as I said before. It needs a group to command and plan. If Fatah lauches rockets from Southern Lebanon (and are you sure you have the right group - not the Moslems again?) then that sounds like war to me. Stone throwing does not.

Does not the creator know his creation better than the creation?  Does Toyota know what's better for the Corolla than the Corolla?   Then I guess ignorance is bliss for you.

So you have no reason to lead a good life. Leading a good life is meaningless.   Why do you do such a meaningless thing?   Has the resurrection sunk in?  Jesus is alive.  Jesus is NOT dead.

Now I just try to get them off my tail.  In heavy traffic I slow down a bit, mostly so I have more buffer zone in front to balance the minimal buffer behind, but I also often find that the  jerk behind will notice traffic moving faster in other lanes, switch into one of them, and pass me - which is fine, because then I can keep a better eye on the jerk from behind, while looking ahead, rather than from in front, while splitting my attention between ahead and the mirrors.  In traffic so heavy that there is no way for the jerk to pass, I might pull over, as if to look for a street number or name, (still ignoring the jerk) just to get the jerk off my tail.    If this all sounds, well, wimpy or un-Denizenly or pessimistic, or perhaps  (for any psych types) passive-aggressive, consider that I prefer to get my adrenaline jollies from riding, rather than from yelling at jerks.    A ride can improve my whole day, while yelling at a jerk is likely (for me) to ruin my ride or my day with my own anger.  In the worst case, yelling at the jerk could ruin my life - since even a tiny jerk in a cage behind me is better armed (with the cage) than I am on a bike.   On the other hand, you might try subtly arranging to be the last vehicle to legally cross one or more intersections, leaving the jerk waiting for cross traffic (and thus off your tail), or crossing illegally (hopefully in front of the waiting police).

Keenan believes in pressuring the opposition and taking the initiative (within the limits of his system)...while Roger has a reactive hockey philosophy...which is why Messier will be able to and has played for Keenan, but thought Roger's way was a sure loser.   Roger is a great assistant coach...but considering what must be bad blood between Nielson and Messier, it would be a mistake to bring him back even in that role.\",\" And this means that the FBI will want to track the customer lists of  better encryption phones, because \\\"the only reason a person would want  one is to evade the police.\\\"  They don't have to track customer lists - they merely have to digitally listen to any phone line and eliminate any that don't have the clipper header/signature.  (No-one has said how it will be modulated - want a bet it's a non-standard and hence easily recognisable baudrate?)  Devices to scan exchanges and detect modems etc already exist.  I've seen them advertised in the trade press.  Once you eliminate crippled crypto devices and ordinary data modems, what's left is crypto worth looking more closely at.  I guess any substitute scheme will have to be v32bis or v.fast to disguise it, though then they just start looking at the data too...  Whatever happens though, the effect of this new chip will be to make private crypto stand out like a sore thumb.\",\" Look at the 4053.  This is a triple 2-to-1 transmission-gate analog multiplexer, with positive and negative power supplies (can be run from a single-ended supply as well).  With dual supplies, the logic inputs still range from ground (0 Volts) to VDD.  This is a neat (well, I think so) design for a switchable-polarity amplifier:                   +-----/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\-------+                  |                  |                  |    /--------\\\\    | INPUT -+-/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\--+----| -      |    |        |              |  opamp |----+------- OUTPUT        +-/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\--+----| +      |                  |    \\\\--------/                  | CONTROL ---------X (analog switch)                  |                  |                 ---                 GND  All resistors are equal-value.  When the analog switch is closed, the amp is inverting-gain-of-one.  With the switch open, it is non-inverting-gain-of-one.  You can clean up the circuit to trim out input offset current if this hurts the balance (this would show up as carrier feed-through).  For high frequencies, the slew-rate of the opamp might cause problems, especially if it isn't symmetrical (and it usually isn't). \",\"The difficulties of a high Isp OTV include: Long transfer times (radiation damage from VanAllen belts for both  the spacecraft and OTV Arcjets or Xenon thrusters require huge amounts of power so you have to have either nuclear power source (messy, dangerous and source of radiation damage) or BIG solar arrays (sensitive to radiation, or heavy) that make attitude control and docking a big pain.  If you go solar, you have to replace the arrays every trip, with current technology. Nuclear power sources are strongly restricted by international treaty.  Refueling (even for very high Isp like xenon) is still required and] turn out to be a pain.  You either have to develop autonomous rendezvous or long range teleoperation to do docking or    ( and refueling) .  You still can't do much plane change because the deltaV required is so high!  The Air Force continues to look at doing things this way though. I suppose they are biding their time till the technology becomes available and the problems get solved.  Not impossible in principle, but hard to do and marginally cheaper than one shot rockets, at least today.  Just a few random thoughts on high Isp OTV's. I designed one once...\",\" There's a program called \\\"Icon Frightener\\\" included with the book Stupid Windows Tricks by Bob LeVitus and Ed Tittel (Addison-Wesley, 1992).  It's freeware.  If it's not on the net anywhere, I'll happily email a copy to someone who's willing to upload it (I can't upload through our Internet firewall). \",\"I should have guessed. It's time for the annual Pittsburgh Penguins whine-a-thon. Bowman was complaning about cheap shots by the Devils in Game 1. I'm sorry, Mr. Bowman, you're a great coach, but those \\\"cheap shots\\\" were nothing compared to what's going to come. Also, I guess you were only able to notice the cheap shots made by the guys not in white. It's amazing what those black and gold colored glasses will do.   PS - Nice dive on that high stick Mario. Everyone knew it was a high stick, you could have stayed on your feet and saved your diving talent for later.\",\"Mornin' all.  I was wonderin'..... I got screenpeace (the screensaver, which I think is *very* good), and I got a problem with it... There is an option there, \\\"realize colour table\\\", and if it's switched on, some wallpapers' colours will get *ucked up with some screensavers (e.g. the \\\"flashlight\\\" one).  If I turn it off, however, it works well, and it's faster, so I have it off.  All's nice and well.  However, If I turn it off, then it will be on again next time I start windows.  All the setting are set in the win.ini file, and I *do* have \\\"save settings on exit\\\" selected.  also, I tried manually changing the setting in the win.ini file to \\\"n\\\" (for no-->realize colour table), and started windows.  It will be fine for that session, but the next session will *again* turn the option on.  I tried adding a +R (read-only) attribute to my win.ini file, and it worked, but my bitmap (wallpaper) saver didn't work then. Actually, it's the same application.  Anywya, it didn't work, since it must change the setting at the win.ini file.  so anyone out there got any answers/suggesions/comments for me?  thanks, i.a.  Mickey aka mp\",\" All very true.  I'm going on what I have read and heard from friends. Basically the Glock is great but I have heard/read that it is a lot harder to learn proper handling because of the type of safety that it has.  I was looking at a Glock .40S&W and the S&W 4006 a couple of weeks ago and the safties on the guns were very different.  The saftey on the 4006 seemed a lot more \\\"safe\\\"  (for lack of a better word) than the one on the Glock.  Of course this could also be a bad thing if you were to pull the gun on somebody.  You would spend more time fiddling around turning the safety off.  Personally I like the Glocks because they are very light and I think they look really cool (guess that's why they use them in so many movies) but I wouldn't get one as my first semi-auto because of the safety.
