Take chances.\",\" Every city and suburban police officer I've seen around the Twin Cities in the last two years has carried a semi-auto of some type (different brands though I haven't seen any Glock's).   With regard to this discussion:  We are getting dangerously far from the usual rantings of t.p.g, and close to the realm of r.g, but I'd like to put my two cents worth in.  While there's nothing wrong with a revolver (especially a  large frame S&W in .357 magnum - my favorite) there are valid advantages to semi-autos.  I suggest reading Massad Ayoob's (I know, some people can't stand him and think he's full of bull, but I think that in general his material is very valid and useful) book _The Semi Auto Pistol in Police Work_ (or something  like that).  He defines a number of ways that semi-auto's are different, and that \\\"different is good\\\".  The main advantage is not in increased firepower, but in  more accurate followup shots when you go to single action mode.  There is also a certain \\\"propriatory nature\\\" of each gun that takes some familiarity to  learn.  This may have diminished with time as more criminals become familiar with different models of semi-autos, but it was cited as stopping or at least slowing down criminals who had grabbed a police officers gun.   Yes, but this is best done with a two hand hold.  With a single hand you either pull the gun far off target to cock, or must fire double action.  The DA semi auto has the same advantages plus is always SA after the first shot.    I'm not sure if this is meant to be different from your first point.  In a DA semi-auto you can pull the trigger again to try dropping the hammer on the same round - an advantage you don't have in a revolver where the next trigger pull will always go to the next round (discussing this point now).  This is fine with a dud but what about a hangfire situation?  Granted it's very rare, but your round will now go off confined in the cylinder with no place to go.  Slingshotting the slide on a misfire takes very little time.    Actually with modern revolver designs incorporating hammer blocks this is not necessary or usually recommended.  A revolver would have to fall hard enough and at the right angle to actually break the hammer and driver the firing pin into the round to set it off.   The best speedloader users, especially those using the spring loaded speed loaders are very fast.  A problem is that ejecting the spent cases is a two handed job where dropping the expended magazine is one handed.  This means that while you can be inserting a fresh magazine as soon as the old one clears the gun, with a speed loader you have to go through more motions that will always  take more time.  You also don't have the advantage of tactical reloads (replacing a partial magazine to bring you back to full capacity - the partial magazine can still be used if needed later).     Yes, the time to recognize the problem is just as important as the time to clear it.  Really though, in either a revolver or semi-auto the odds of an actual misfire with factory ammo are awfully small.  You are more likely to get a jam in a semi-auto but even these are exceptionally rare with modern quality guns (Sigs, Glocks, et.al.).     All common semi-auto's can be carried with a round in their chamber without any safety problems.  While I put that out as a statement that I believe, I should say that this applies to all of the ones I've looked at.  For the DA semi's it's no different from the revolver situation:  The guns all have hammer or firing pin blocks.  They also have a safety.  Because there's no real advantage carrying one of these cocked and locked you have the same safety and speed of employment as a revolver, plus the advantage of SA followup shots.  I'm not familiar with SA semi-autos except for the 1911-A1.  I admit that I was initially skeptical about carrying this cocked and locked, but after examining the design, trying to defeat the safeties (gun unloaded of course), and  shooting it a lot, I see no inherent safety problems with it, especially in a thumbreak holster with the strap under the hammer.  This design also gets you more speed for an accurate first shot than a revolver.   Yeah, the infamous Glock.  I still can't figure out how it's worse than a revolver for safety.  If you don't pull the trigger it doesn't go off.  I imagine that if all your revolver shooting was done double action then you could pull the Glock trigger far enough to fire before you realized it.  In addition, if you had developed that nasty habit of keeping your finger on the trigger when holstering your gun and relying on your thumb on the hammer to remind you to take it off before you blew off your foot then you'd have problems when the hammer wasn't there.   I think this is even okay for a riot (as long as it's a small one B^)).   I have the poor man's Beretta (Taurus 99) and consider it inferior as a carry weapon to the Springfield .45 (oops, 9mm vs. 45 arguments are relegated to r.g).  You are right, though.  If you don't hit what you aim at then the shooter/gun combination has failed.  I don't ascribe failures in the the fire real fast with a wonder-nine scenario you mention to the gun.  This is a shooter failure, whether through lack of discipline or lack of training.    9mm's are becoming more popular with crooks too, though the .38 does still lead the list.  And like I said, around here semi-auto's seem the rule for the street cop.  Don't know about the State Patrol however, they may still carry the \\\"Highway Patrolman\\\".   Vincent, please don't take any of this as a flame.  Just my $0.02 (whoops, looks more like $2.00) worth.  And much of it is IMHO, but do check Ayoob's book.\",\"Got a few things I want to get rid of...

Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port         2. X terminals         3. NeXT         4. Silicon Graphics         5. IBM RS/6000  6. Other stuff      1. Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port   If you've got a proprietary computer which uses its own keyboard  (Sun, HP, DEC, etc.) then you're going to have a hard time finding  a vendor to sell you a compatible keyboard.  If your workstation  runs the X window system, you're in luck.  You can buy a cheap used  PC, hook your expensive keyboard up to it, and run a serial cable  to your workstation.  Then, run a program on the workstation to read  the serial port and generate fake X keyboard events.   The two main programs I've found to do this are KT and A2X.   a2x is a sophisticated program, capable of controlling the mouse, and  even moving among widgets on the screen.  It requires a server  extension (XTEST, DEC-XTRAP, or XTestExtension1).  To find out if your  server can do this, run 'xdpyinfo' and see if any of these strings  appear in the extensions list.  If your server doesn't have this,  you may want to investigate compiling X11R5, patchlevel 18 or later,  or bugging your vendor.   kt is a simpler program, which should work with unextended X servers.  Another program called xsendevent also exists, but I haven't seen it.   Both a2x and kt are available via anonymous ftp from soda.berkeley.edu.      2. X terminals   Also, a number of X terminals (NCD, Tektronics, to name a few) use  PC-compatible keyboards.  If you have an X terminal, you may be all  set.  Try it out with a normal PC keyboard before you go through the  trouble of buying an alternative keyboard.  Also, some X terminals add  extra buttons -- you may need to keep your original keyboard around  for the once-in-a-blue-moon that you have to hit the Setup key.      3. NeXT   NeXT had announced that new NeXT machines will use the Apple Desktop  Bus, meaning any Mac keyboard will work.  Then, they announced they  were cancelling their hardware production.  If you want any kind of  upgrade for an older NeXT, do it now!      4. Silicon Graphics   Silicon Graphics has announced that their newer machines (Indigo^2 and  beyond) will use standard PC-compatible keyboards and mice.  I don't  believe this also applies to the Power Series machines.  It's not  possible to upgrade an older SGI to use PC keyboards, except by  upgrading the entire machine.  Contact your SGI sales rep for more  details.      5. IBM RS/6000   IBM RS/6000 keyboards are actually similar to normal PC keyboards.  ||  Unfortunately, you can't just plug one in.  You need two things: a  ||  cable converter to go from the large PC keyboard connector to the   ||  smaller PS/2 style DIN-6, and a new device driver for AIX.  Believe ||  it or not, IBM wrote this device driver recently, I used it, and it ||  works.  However, they don't want me to redistribute it.  I've been  ||  told Judy Hume (512) 823-6337 is a potential contact.  If you learn ||  anything new, please send me e-mail.        ||          6. Other stuff   Some vendors here (notably: Health Care Keyboard Co. and AccuCorp)  support some odd keyboard types, and may be responsive to your  queries regarding supporting your own weird computer.  If you can  get sufficient documention about how your keyboard works (either  from the vendor, or with a storage oscilloscope), you may be in  luck.  Contact the companies for more details.

Availability: February, 1993     Price: $219     Supports: Mac only      Apple has recently announced their new split-design keyboard.  The     keyboard has one section for each hand, and the sections rotate     backward on a hinge.  The sections do not tilt upward.  The keys are     arranged in a normal QWERTY fashion.      The main foldable keyboard resembles a normal Apple Keyboard.     A separate keypad contains all the extended key functions.      The keyboard also comes with matching wrist rests, which are not     directly attachable to the keyboard.

Dragon Systems sells a number of voice recognition products.     Most (if not all) of them seem to run on PC's and compatibles     (including PS/2's and other MicroChannel boxes).  They sell you     a hardware board and software which sits in front of a number     of popular word processors and spreadsheets.      Each user `trains' the system to their voice, and there are provisions     to correct the system when it makes mistakes, on the fly.  Multiple     people can use it, but you have to load a different personality file     for each person.  You still get the use of your normal keyboard, too.     On the DragonDictate-30K you need to pause 1/10th sec between     words.  Dragon claims typical input speeds of 30-40 words per minute.     I don't have specs on the DragonWriter 1000.

Early in 1984 I took some riding lessons from my college roommate on his old Honda CB360T.  He had taken the MSF beginner's course, so I actually learned *some* of what I needed to know to ride.  I proceeded to buy a beat-up Honda CL350 for $400 and a $12 helmet and rode around wearing this and a cotton windbreaker.  Then I decided to invest in a full-face helmet (first smart move).  Sometime around then I also passed my road test.  On May 4, 1984, I got caught in a rainstorm on my way home from a 4-mile trip.  Entering the town where I lived (a rather urban suburb), I had to stop suddenly for a red light that I noticed too late, skidded the rear tire out, and was ejected face upward into the oncoming lane of traffic.  Fortunately for me the oncoming traffic was also stopped for the same red light, otherwise I might have slid under a car and been killed.  Now this is anecdotal evidence, to be sure, but I later took the Experienced Rider Course from the MSF and saw that earlier training could have helped me greatly.  In your case the need is even greater since you have nobody to help you practice even the most basic stuff as I did.  So my advice is to take the MSF beginner's course first thing.  I wouldn't even buy a bike until you've taken the course, unless you happen to pick up a real good deal and can store it someplace until you're ready to use it.   While you're waiting to take the course (it might take a few weeks in DC, as I recall there were always waiting lists in Boston), could you save up some more money to start out right?  Say $300 for riding gear, plus the cost bike, plus maybe $100 (guess) to a mechanic to make sure the machine is safe (assuming you economize by buying some old beat-up machine from a private individual), plus insurance, plus registration and licensing fees, plus the course, you're looking at maybe $600 not including the bike itself and a reserve for ongoing maintenance.   I pay about $100 insurance now (upstate NY) but it was closer to $200 in Boston (more urban) for decent insurance including substantial coverage for liability, which you want unless you plan always to be poor.  I'd guess DC is more like Boston than like a rural area, ergo more expensive.   There used to be annual buyer's guides in the usual motorcycle magazines; I found those helpful in getting an idea of what new or recent models might be available.  You could probably look through past issues to size up what used bikes might be available.  (My first bike was 13 years old when I bought it so I went on my friend's advice instead.)  Also look at the bikes that you see people riding or that are parked on the street.  I basically settled on my present bike by noticing that there were a lot of high-mileage BMW's running around and they were generally set up the way I wanted.  Nothing wrong with talking to various dealers in your area or visiting showrooms.  Dealers in the Boston area, at least when I was shopping, were very nice about letting you look around their showrooms and quoting prices for bikes that weren't the latest models (hence cheaper), although I ended up buying both bikes in private sales.\",\"I have the following items for sale:  Animation Works software for Macintosh by Gold Disk           This is a brand new shrink-wrapped copy  Microsoft Excel for Windows Ver. 4.0           Opened, but includes everything including Registration card  Video7 FastWrite VGA card. 512 video memory. 800x600 resolution.

Thanks in advance.\",\" In the Bible, there are a lot of instances where God speaks to people, where a person just \\\"came to know\\\" some piece of information, where a person walks off into the desert for \\\"40 days\\\", etc. With all of God's power He certainly can do whatever He wants when He wants it. The Bible \\\"ends\\\" with the book of Revelations. But does God's reign end there ? No. So who can say for sure that God's messages are either no longer happening or still happening ?  I can now hear the clamor for proof. 8-) With the cold response I've gotten from the past from this group, it's very hard to get the point across. I'll only go over the physical stuff so that skeptics can look at documents stored somewhere. I've cited the uncorrupted bodies of saints before. They're still there. 8-) The apparitions at Fatima, Portugal culminated in a miracle specifically granted to show God's existence. That was the spinning/descending of the sun. It was seen in several countries. That event is \\\"approved\\\" by the Pope. Currently, images of Mary in Japan, Korea, Yugoslavia, Philippines, Africa are showing tears (natural or blood). These are still under investigation by the Church. But realize that investigations take decades to finish. And if the message is Christ will come in ten days, that's a bit too late, isn't it 8-). Other events under investigation are inner locutions (\\\"coming to know\\\"), stigmata (the person exhibits Christ's wounds. And they don't heal. And doctor's don't know why). Non-believers are welcome to pore through documents, I'm sure.  This stuff is not like Koresh. Or Oral Roberts (give me $5M or God will call me home). It's free. Find out why they're happening (as we ourselves are studying why). If anybody can figure this out, tell us ! You can be of any religion. If you have the resources, go to one of the countries I mentioned. These are not \\\"members only\\\" events. God and Mary invites  everybody.  So in conclusion (finally) ... We RC's believe in the modern day manifestations of God and Mary. We are scared to death sometimes although we're told not to. There are more proofs and events. And that is why \\\"not everything is in the Bible\\\". Although in a lot of the apparitions, we are told to read the Bible.  As far as the Protestant vs. Catholics issue is concerned... In the end, God's churches will unite. I'm not sure how. I have some idea. But the point is we shouldn't worry about the \\\"versus\\\" part. Just do God's work. That's all that matters. Unity will come.  BTW, I'm just a plain person. I'm not the Pope's spokesperson. But I am RC.  -- \",\"Attention Israel Line Recipients                       Friday, April 16, 1993     Two Arabs Killed and Eight IDF Soldiers Wounded in West Bank Car Bomb Explosion   Israel Defense Forces Radio, GALEI ZAHAL, reports today that a car bomb explosion in the West Bank today killed two Palestinians and wounded eight IDF soldiers. The blast is believed to be the work of a suicide bomber. Radio reports said a car packed with butane gas exploded between two parked buses, one belonging to the IDF and the other civilian. Both busses went up in flames. The blast killed an Arab man who worked at a nearby snack bar in the Mehola settlement. An Israel Radio report stated that the other man who was killed may have been the one who set off the bomb. According to officials at the Haemek Hospital in Afula, the eight IDF soldiers injured in the blast suffered light to moderate injuries.  \",\"If you could not tell which one had MSG, why restaurants bother to use it at all?

EDT                     SECRETARY RILEY:  Good evening and welcome to all of you  in the thousands of communities around the country that are taking  part in this satellite town meeting for the month of April.              You know, today is April 13th.  In 1743, Thomas  Jefferson was born, 250 years ago.  I think that's appropriate to  mention at the beginning of this meeting because since that time he  has been, of course, a person who has been one that we've all  followed in terms of our democracy and the importance of education  here in this great country.  The success of our democracy according  to Jefferson really depends upon the success of our educational  system.              His philosophy of government, his belief in the  importance of education is also very meaningful to our special guest  here this evening.  Tonight we're so pleased to have with us  President Clinton.  He's come over from the White House to join us in  the Chamber of Commerce studios.                Mr. President, it's good to have you.  We thank you for  taking the time to visit with these communities here on the satellite  network and we welcome you here this evening.              Also we have with us Secretary of Labor Robert Reich.   And, Bob, it's certainly pleasant to have you with us this evening  also.              I have some questions for our two guests, and I'm sure  many of you do, too.  So please call us if there's something that  you'd like to ask.  The number is 1/800/368-5781 or 5782.  In  Washington, D.C. the number is 202/463-3170 or 3171.              I believe the President has a few words that he might  want to share with us.  And, Mr. President, I'll ask you to do that  at this time.  It's great to have you.              THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.              I'm glad to be here with my friends, Dick Riley and Bob  Reich -- also members of my Cabinet -- at the headquarters of the  Chamber of Commerce to support the effort that the Chamber is making,  along with its Center for Work Force Preparation, to help to examine  tonight the whole critical question of how to move our young people  from school to the work place.              I want to compliment the Chamber on all their efforts,  recognizing that without an educated work force we can't grow this  economy or remain competitive, and recognizing that we all have to  work together -- business and government, labor and educators -- to  make things happen.              This satellite town meeting is a good example of that  kind of working together.  And if you'll forgive me a little home  state pride, I want to say a special word of thanks to the Wal-Mart  Corporation, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas, for providing  several hundred of the sites for this town meeting tonight.  I  appreciate that a lot, as well as the sites that are provided for all  the rest of you.              I have tried as hard as I could to move toward  constructive change for this country.  Secretary Riley talked about  this being Thomas Jefferson's 250th birthday.  If Thomas Jefferson  believed in anything, he believed in these three things:  first, in  education; second, in real personal liberty, freedom of religion,  freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of the press; and  third, in the absolute imperative of changing as times change.                If you go to the Jefferson Memorial here in this  beautiful city, which is now bedecked with all of its wonderful  cherry blossoms, you will see Jefferson saying that we have to change  with changing times.              For us here in America, that means reducing our deficit  and increasing our investment and putting our people first so that we  can compete in the world.  We're here to talk about that tonight -- about what we can do to educate and train our people better.  Unless  we do that, none of the efforts that all the rest of us make in  government, even to bring the budget into balance, even to increase  our investment in other things which will grow jobs, will last in the  long run.              We also have to have people who can carry their load.   And in a world where the average young person will change jobs seven  or eight times in a lifetime, that begins with the education system  and continues into the work force where education must go on for a  lifetime.  It's not just important what you know, but what you can  learn.              And if I might, I'd like to close just by emphasizing  we're doing our best to try to have the most innovative partnership  between the Labor Department and the Education Department and the  private sector to build a good school-to-work transition.  And we're  trying to get off to a good start this summer with a program that  would create more than 700,000 new summer jobs, including many  thousands that have a strong education component so our young people  can be learning and working at the same time.              Dick, I think I ought to stop there.  That's a good  place we can begin, I think, the discussion.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you so much, Mr. President.              Each month we get together and talk about ways that all  citizens can work towards reaching the national education goals.  And  tonight, we'll focus on goal five, and how communities such as yours  can prepare students for this world of work.              This week, the Education Department and the Labor  Department are hosting a conference here in Washington, D.C. called  Summer Challenge, a program of work and learning, to America's youth.   The aim is to use some special funds from President Clinton's  proposed economic stimulus package to provide educationally-enriched  jobs and summer school programs for young people in disadvantaged  areas of the country.                Mr. President, let's talk a minute -- you alluded to it  somewhat -- about the  Summer Youth Challenge.  Your program calls  for more educational enrichment in the summer jobs.  And why in your  words is that so important?              THE PRESIDENT:  I think it's important for two reasons.   First of all, a lot of the young people we're trying to reach may  have had trouble adjusting to school and learning.  And while we want  them to have a good experience with a real job, we also want them to  continue to learn during the summer because we know from a lot of  research that a lot of kids that have trouble learning in school may  forget as much as 30 percent of what they learned the previous year  over the summertime.  And that is a very unproductive thing for  schools to have to take up a lot of time teaching what they already  taught before.              Secondly, we want to help these young people progress,  not only in terms of work, but in terms of learning.  We want to  abolish the artificial dividing line between what is work and what is  learning because we think that the best and most productive workers  will have to be lifetime learners.  And we think that this experience  could maybe drive that point home and prepare these young people to  succeed in school, or at work, or in college as they go on.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I think the fact that these are  disadvantaged kids -- that gap, that lag you mentioned as they go  into the next year, is really even greater.                Secretary Reich, of course, you have training programs  throughout the year.  And I wonder is you have any comment about this  educational component of training.              SECRETARY REICH:  Well, what we've learned, Mr.  Secretary, is that for many young people, whether it's for the summer  or for the year, actually on-the-job work experience combined with  education is one of the best ways of learning.  Many young people,  for example, have a lot -- they have a difficult time learning  geometry.  But when they actually are there building something or  working on something, and they can see the exact and direct  application of geometry, they understand what it's used for.  And a  lot of young people -- just that sense of connection between  education and the world of work is terribly, terribly important.   It's important during the summer, but it's important for a lot of  young people even beyond the summer.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you.                Mr. President, you've called for a youth apprenticeship  program, school-to-work transition.  And I wonder if you would tell  us a little bit about your concept of that and how you see it  developing.              THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, let's talk about why  it's important.  Most new jobs that will be created in this decade  will not require a four-year college degree, but most of them will  require some learning and skills that go well beyond what most people  get in a high school diploma.                If you look at the last 10 years, the average salaries  of young people that had at least two years of good post-high school  education was a good salary that went up over the decade.  The young  people who had less than that tended to have lower wages that did not  go up, and in many cases in real terms fell over the decade, because  they weren't productive, they weren't more valuable to their  employers.              So we think America has a big economic interest in  trying to ensure that all the young people who get out of high school  but don't go on to college make a transition to work, which includes  two years of further training either in a community college, a  vocational setting, or perhaps on the job.  And what I have done in  this budget, as you know, is to give you and Secretary Reich some  funds and some incentives to try to work in partnership with states  and with the private sector to build these programs state-by-state in  a way that would be customized essentially by the business community,  based on the needs of the economy in any given area.  It could  revolutionize long-term the quality of the American work force and  the earnings of American workers.              SECRETARY REICH:  I should add, Mr. President -- I think  you know this from your experience in Arkansas -- and many of the  people watching this program -- that the business community and  educators, labor groups are already in many of our communities, many  of our states, building a school-to-work transition program.  In  fact, there's an awful lot of ferment, a lot of excitement.  The  people watching this program probably are the ones who are most  directly involved in that.  And more power to them.  Secretary Riley  and I are going to do everything we can to build on the successes  already out there.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Bob, we're going to be talking tonight  about youth apprenticeship and tech prep, the co-op learning   career academies.  And what features all those programs that deal  with this subject -- what are some of the features that every one of  these school-to-work programs might have that   are important?              SECRETARY REICH:  Well, one thing that we've seen -- and  you and I have been working at this for a long time, and you much  longer than I -- we've seen that active involvement of the business  community is absolutely essential.  And I'm so delighted that we're  doing this in the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce.  The  Chamber of Commerce of the United States is committed to doing these  kinds of programs -- training, education, retraining -- and we've  aimed to work very closely with the Chamber.              The business community is going to be actively engaged  in developing almost an audit of the kind of jobs that are needed and  helping the educators, community colleges, technical institutions  develop curricula that are relevant for the jobs of the future.              Communities have got to come together.  I mean, this is  one of the most important things.  You've got to have all of these  players in a community come together and work together and cooperate  together.  You know, too often we have the educators over here and  the business leaders over here, labor groups over here and everybody  is talking, but they're not really working together in a common  strategy.              And the third and final ingredient I would say, Dick,  would be a commitment to excellence -- a commitment both to academic  excellence and also to skills development excellence.  This is not a  tracking program we're talking about for kids who are not going to  make it.  This is a program that every young person ought to be  eligible for.  If they want to go on beyond that to four-year  college, that's fine.  That ought to be permissible.  But we're  talking about the foundation of learning about jobs, the foundation  skills for on-the-job learning.              And again, those are the critical components.  It's  already being done.              THE PRESIDENT:  I think -- if I might just interject one  point based on my personal experience at home -- the business  community has a critical role to play, not simply in saying here are  the job skills that are needed and here's what ought to be taught,  but also in monitoring that excellence.  If you have the right sort  of partnership there, the people who are paying the taxes and who are  going to then be hiring the workers are not going to permit the  second-rate programs to survive if they have any way to shape and  influence them.  So I think that's very important.              And when we try to, if you will, fill in the blanks at  the federal level, trying to set some standards and provide some  funds, one of the things that we want to be sure and do is to make  sure that the employer has a heavy amount of influence over the  quality of these programs, because that's really what's going to  determine whether the whole thing is worthwhile.              SECRETARY RILEY:  That's great.  We've been talking, of  course, about school-to-work and also the jobs and economic recovery  program for this summer and fall.  But let's talk just a moment about  long-term school reform.  It's something especially close to me.  Mr.  President, I wonder if you would give us some of your ideas for the  communities out here on Goals 2000 legislation that I think will be  coming forth before too long.              THE PRESIDENT:  Well, as you know, back when you and I  were both governors, we spent a lot of time working on our public  schools and we tried to be very candid with our people in saying that  a lot of these things were going to take some time to materialize.                I had a hand in writing the National Education Goals  that the governors drafted, along with representatives of President  Bush's administration back in 1989.  And what we're going to try to  do this year with your leadership is to introduce legislation in  Congress that will actually define the things that the national  government ought to do to try to help the local schools and the  children of this country and the adult learners, too, meet those  goals -- making sure that when -- by 2000, people show up for school  ready to learn; that we get a 90 percent on-time high school  graduation rate; that children at the 4th, 8th, and 12th grades are  confident in the subjects they're supposed to know; that they are  second to none in math and science; that are schools are safe,  disciplined, and drug-free.  And, of course, the fifth goal --I took  them out of line to say this the last -- is that we have a system of  life-long learning in this country.              And each one of those goals there's a national role, a  state role, a school role, school district role, and a private sector  role.  And what you've attempted to do in this bill you're going to  introduce with me in the next few weeks is to define what our job is;  and then to give the rest of America a way of defining what their job  is and seeing whether we're actually meeting the standards of quality  that we need to meet.              It's very exciting.  So far as I know, nothing quite  like it has ever been done in the form of federal legislation before.   Not mandating and telling people what they have to do with their  money, but actually setting up a framework for excellence and  partnerships so that we can do our job.  I'm really excited about it.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I am, too.  And I think really  it will be an entirely new role for the federal government in terms  of its relationship with states, serving as a partner really to  support and facilitate and to help out in these education reform  efforts, all driven by high standards.  That's the point.              Bob, let me ask you one question, and then we'll get to  the telephone calls.  It's about the same subject.  We have, of  course, skills standards that are going to be part of Goals 2000, and  I wonder if you would comment on that.              SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you know, we have 75 percent of  our young people who don't graduate from college.  Very often they  don't have very many alternatives.  They do have a wonderful system  of community colleges and technical institutions, but if we had  national skill standards to which they could aspire and which  employers would understand as a national credential, many of these  young people would actually find that they were much more eligible  for jobs.              Everybody doesn't have to go to college.  Other  countries you have smaller proportions of their population going to  college, but you have a whole level of people who have certain  technical, preprofessional skills.  We can do it in this country.  If  you don't go to four-year college you're not a loser.  And we want to  develop those national skill standards.  We're going to be working  with the states, with the Education Department, with a lot of private  industry in developing those standards.  And I think they will be the  kinds of things that enable our vocational and technical and other  institutions to rally around, as well as our business community.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, that's great.  Why don't we go  ahead and go to the telephone.  We have a call, I see -- Mayor Bruce  Todd of Austin, Texas.              Q   Yes, Mr. President and Mr. Secretary Reich and  Riley, we certainly appreciate the opportunity to join you today.  We  have some dedicated professionals and volunteers here in Austin who  have heard what you have said and are very appreciative.  Let me  simply say, amen to some of the comments made already.  We agree with  much of the tone that the Clinton administration has taken, and are  very supportive.                We have been successful here in Austin of tripling our  summer employment program over the last four years.  We expect to  have over 2,000 employed this year in the summertime; perhaps as much  as 3,500 with the federal assistance.                Much of the question that we had designed you have  answered in your opening comments, so we must be thinking alike.  But  the question essentially involved what initiatives after Labor Day  would be appropriate.  We know summertime is important.  Year-round  is even more important.  And what kind of initiatives at the federal  level might be proposed to meet the needs of the youth on a year- round basis?  And perhaps more importantly, how can families and the  local community be more involved using the federal initiative? That's  something that we believe is very important to success in this  effort.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Mr. President.              THE PRESIDENT:  I think I'll give everybody a chance to  answer the question, Bruce, but let me first thank you for calling,  and thank you for all the great work that you're doing in Austin.   I've seen some of it and I've always been very impressed.                First, with regard to the summer program, we hope we can  structure it in a way that will enable us to continue the summer  program and that will move a lot of these young people back into  schools under circumstances that might allow them to do some work in  the private sector, too.  We hope that -- Secretary Reich is going to  try to set up a system where we create a lot of private sector jobs  to be matched with the public sector jobs this summer.  And we're  working on that.              Secondly, in the program that I have presented to the  Congress over the next five years, what we are attempting to do is to  build in an amount of investment that's quite substantial for job  training programs, for school-to-work programs, all of which give  heavy, heavy weight to local community input -- just the question you  asked -- but do provide some federal investment dollars, which we  hope you can put with local dollars to keep people working and being  trained on a year-round basis.              And I will say again, to echo what Secretary Reich said  a moment ago, to try to break down the barrier between what is seen  as work and what is seen as learning.  An awful lot of young people  actually have quite high IQs, but actually learn so much better when  they're doing than when they're reading or just listening.  So we  hope that the community involvement part of it will be permanent, and  we hope that if the whole budget passes -- and we do have 200 budget  cuts and more than 200, actually, in the budget -- and some revenue  raisers, and some new money for education and training, that we'll be  able to do just what you seem to want based on your question.              Bob, do you want to say anything?              SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you took most of the words out  of my mouth, Mr. President, as usual.  But let me just add one thing,  and that is that one of the most important aspects of post-high  school for a lot of young people who are not going on to college, in  addition to the school-to-work program, simply is the availability of  jobs.  And we've got to get this economy moving again, obviously.   It's terribly important to get this recovery program, to get the  economy back on track.  That's sort of the prerequisite to everything  else.  If we don't get the economy back on track -- we have -- I  think this is the 16th -- correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. President -- I  think is the 16th month we have had seven percent unemployment or  greater.  This is a jobless recovery.  A lot of those kids are going  to be getting out of school in June.  And even if we did everything  right, they would have a very, very hard time getting jobs.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you both.  Of course, Goals 2000  will be a permanent, long-term thing that will certainly reach into  next year.  It will involve, if passed -- and we certainly hope it  will be -- action plans with every state where we can be working  together to reach for the goals in a number of different ways.  And  then the state, with all the various school districts, a very  important part of that will be citizen and parent involvement.  And I  think everybody will see a great energy out there, once we get that  moving.              The next call is Dr. Harry Heinemann, New York.                Doctor?              Q   Good evening, Mr. Secretary.  It is a pleasure to  be on with you this evening.  As you may know, bridging the school  and work has been central to La Guardia's educational program since  its inception in the 1970s, and that includes the college, the two  alternative high schools that operate on our campus, and the linkages  we have forged with the local schools.  We have found this to be an  extremely effective learning strategy.              And over the years, we've come to believe that there are  several principles that are very important in bridging the school and  work.  And these include integrating theory in the classroom with  practice in the workplace, with providing all students early exposure  to careers, as well as providing opportunities for them to reflect  upon these experiences while they strengthen their skills; and  lastly, the critical role of the liberal arts, particularly in the  development of high performance competencies.                My question, then is:  How can the general education  faculty and the academic curriculum be more closely integrated with  transition to work experience?  And what mechanisms and strategies  can you suggest to achieve this integration?              SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, thank you very much.  I think --  and we'll get a response from you all on that, and very interesting  work going on there.  We're going to have three people, our next  guests on the program this evening, that will be some specialists    in that area that you're speaking, and I'll certainly pass that on to  them and we can discuss it later.              You all care to comment -- any comments you might have?              THE PRESIDENT:  I'd just like to say, if I might, one  thing.  I want to reemphasize this and I don't think I'm being as  clear about it as I'd like, although I think at least one of the  people who will be on the second panel will be able to say it more  explicitly than I.  I think this whole concept of applied academics  is very important.  And I think that we have to basically abolish  what I consider to be a very artificial distinction between what is  vocational learning and what is academic learning.              I think we should keep the liberal arts going.  I think  we should have a strong component for people who are in the  vocational program.              SECRETARY REICH:  It seems to me that we also need to  rethink our entire tracking system, because a lot of these school and  work combinations are important for mainstream students.  They're  important for all students.  It's not just a special group of  students that needs them.              Some of the experiments that I've seen around the United  States -- Dick, I'm sure you've seen them as well -- are mainstream  experiments.  They're mainstreaming all the students.  At 11th and  12th grades they're giving them a combined work and school experience  and then a transition program.  And again, the kids can either go on  to college if they want; they can go on to technical community; they  can go on to an entirely -- a large variety of possibilities and  career directions.              But we have to get away from the stigmatizing that often  goes on with young people who simply are doing job-related or work- related work within the classroom, within our schools.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you, very much.  I think that's  going to be the last call that we have time for.  Mr. President, I  think you've got to move on to another matter, and I want to thank  you and Secretary Reich for being here.

I agree completely. One thing I can't stand about the Mac interface is its shear determination to FORCE you to use the mouse(what if your mouse breaks--your whole system is down!).  I like the mouse--it is handy on some occassions such as cut and past and moving icons around, etc.  But for most work, the keyboard and hot keys are 10-20 times faster than using the mouse. Sure it is a plus to be able to do something simple if you are an inexperienced user, but how long is it before your are experienced? A month? Two? (Speaking of PCs at the moment.)  I don't think it is too much to ask that window programmers provide not only a menu/mouse interface but also look forward to those who would like to move on to hot keys and command line interfaces, which usually allows you to do more in less time IF you are experienced.

I pointed out that I did, in fact, agree that both Robert Weiss and Jim Meritt took quotes out of context.  Hence, I find it difficult to understand why Jim thinks I am a hypocrite.  Needless to say, I don't have time to reply to *every* article on t.r.m. that takes a quote out of context.    I asked Jim the following:  Jim replied by saying   But today we find four articles from Jim, one of which has the subject \\\"Silence is concurrence\\\":     Which is, of course, a complete red herring.  Taking quotes out of context isn't a crime.  I don't have time to read every article on t.r.m., and I'm certainly under no obligation to reply to them all.  Does \\\"silence is concurrence\\\" imply that Jim thinks that because I didn't respond to Weiss' articles I must condone Weiss' taking quotes out of context?  Jim doesn't want to give a direct answer to this question; read what he has written and decide for yourself.   But back to the context of my conversation with Jim.  Jim's next  gambit was to claim that he was using inductive logic when he concluded that I was being a hypocrite.  I challenged him to provide the details of that logic that led him to an incorrect conclusion. Today we find another obscure article (posting it twice didn't help make it more clear, Jim), titled \\\"Inductive Logic\\\":   More red herrings.  Could Jim mean that he has read an uncountably large number of my articles?  Could Jim mean that because I \\\"axed\\\" his articles, but not Weiss' articles, he wants to conclude inductively ... Well, I can't see where he is going with this.  But I can help him with his induction.  I've written roughly 80 articles since January.  The vast majority of them are discussions with Frank DeCenso and other inerrantists, where I take the position that they are making bad arguments.  Some are discussions with Jim Meritt where I take the position that he is making bad arguments (a straw man argument earlier, and taking quotes out of context more recently.)

Remarks by President Clinton to NCAA Division I Champion Hockey Team April 19; Q&A Following  To: National Desk  Contact: White House Office of the Press Secretary, 202-456-2100     WASHINGTON, April 19 -- Following is a transcript of remarks by President Clinton to the University of Maine \\\"Black Bears\\\" NCAA Division I hockey champions:                             The Rose Garden   9:58 A.M. EDT       THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning ladies and gentlemen.  It's an honor for me to welcome the University of Maine Black Bears, the winner of the NCAA Division I hockey national championship to the Rose Garden and the White House.  I understand from Senator Mitchell that this is the first team from the University of Maine every to win a national championship.  And we're glad to have them here.       I'm inspired not only by how the team pulled together to win the championship, but how the entire state pulled together to cheer them onto victory.       Coming from a state that is also relatively small in size, but also filled with pride and tradition and community, I can understand how the people of Maine must feel about the Black Bears. In our state people are still talking about the time we won the Orange Bowl over the number one ranked football team, and that was back in 1978.  I'm sure that 15 years from now, the people of Maine will as proud of this team as they are today.       You know, in my state football is a slightly more popular sport than hockey.  We don't have a lot of ice.  (Laughter.) But after spending three months getting banged around in this town, I can understand a little more about hockey than I did before I came here.  Hockey is a tough game.  It's a hard-hitting sport.  It does have one virtue though, there's a penalty for delay of game.  I wish we had that rule in the Senate.  (Laughter.)       In government as in hockey, leadership is important.  In the United States Senate, our team has a great captain, the Majority Leader and the senior Senator from Maine, George Mitchell; junior Senator -- Cohen looks so young, I can't imagine.  (Laughter.)  I'm actually bitter about Senator Cohen because he looks so much younger than me.       On your hockey team, the captain Jim Montgomery has done a great job.  He scored the winning goal late in the championship game, leading you to a come-from-behind victory -- something else I know a little bit about.       Sport brings out the best in individuals and in teams and in communities.  I share the pride that Senator Mitchell and Senator Cohen and Congressman Andrews and all the people of Maine must feel for the Black Bears who have shown us all how to play as a team, how to bring out the best in one another, and how to come from behind.       I think it's important, as I ask young people from around America who have achieved outstanding things in working together, to come here to the White House to be recognized and appreciated by their country, to remember that those kinds of values and those kinds of virtues need to be ingrained in all of us for all of our lives.       We now have another role model, and I'm glad to have them here today.  (Applause.)       (The President is presented with team jersey.) (Applause.)       THE PRESIDENT:  That's great.  I love it.  It's beautiful. (Applause.)       (The President is presented with an autographed stick.)       THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  That's great.  (Applause.)                               * * * * * *       Q  Mr. President, did you authorize the move on Waco this morning, sir?       THE PRESIDENT:  I was aware of it.  I think the Attorney General made the decision.  And I think I should refer all questions to her and to the FBI.       Q  Did you have any instructions for her as to how it should be executed?       THE PRESIDENT:  No, they made the tactical decisions. That was their judgment, the FBI.       Q  Is this a raid?       THE PRESIDENT:  And I will -- I want to refer you to -- talk to the Attorney General and the FBI.  I knew it was going to be done, but the decisions were entirely theirs, all the tactical decisions.       Q  What did you and Senator Mitchell talk about this morning?       Q  Any chance for that stimulus package?       THE PRESIDENT:  Senator Mitchell ought to pay my quarter.  (Laughter.)  I was in there -- (laughter).       SENATOR MITCHELL:  You have to pay that quarter.       THE PRESIDENT:  I was ready.  (Laughter.)  Senator Mitchell, he's worth a quarter any day.       Q  Any chance for your bill, sir?       THE PRESIDENT:  We talked about what was going to happen this week in the Senate and about what other meetings we're going to have for the rest of the week.  We only had about five minutes to talk.  And we agreed we'd get back together later, around noon, and talk some more.       Q  Senator Dole said over the weekend that your compromise is no compromise.       THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I know he did, but, look, Senator Dole and a lot of the other Republicans now in the Senate voted for the same kind of thing for Ronald Reagan in 1983; and our research indicates that a majority of them over time voted for a total of 28 emergency spending measures totalling over $100 billion when Reagan and Bush were President, in those administrations.  And many of those purposes were not nearly as worthy as putting the American people back to work.  I don't want to go back and revisit every one, but you   can do it.  You can look at the research there.  So this position they're taking is not credible.  We have a very tough five-year deficit reduction plan.  All these costs are covered during that time and then some.  And the very people that are saying this has all got to be paid for don't have much of a history on which to base their position.  They've got 12 years of vote for stimulus measures of this kind that had very little to with putting the American people back to work.  So I think we've got a chance to work it out, and I'm hopeful. We'll see what happens today and tomorrow.  I'm feeling pretty good about it.       THE PRESS:  Thank you                                   END       10:10 A.M.

Caviar Dreams  L.Cause \",\"A very kind soul has mailed me this reply for the bugs in CView. Since he isn't in the position to post this himself, he asked me to post it for him, but to leave his name out. So here it comes:  CView has quite a number of bugs.  The one you mention is perhaps the most annoying, but not the most dangerous.  As far as I can determine, it has to do with the temp files that CView creates.  CView gives the user no control over where it places its temp files: it just places them in its \\\"current directory\\\".  The problem you mention occurs (as far as I can tell) when it runs out of disk space for its temp files. It seems as if CView doesn't check properly for this situation.  As Cview decodes a jpeg, it seems  to write out a temp file with all the pixel data with 24 bit colour information. Then, for 8 bit displays, it does the \\\"dithering\\\", again writing another file with the 8 bit colour information.  While it is writing this second file, it also writes the data to your colour card. Then when it does the last chunk of 8 bit data, it recopies all the data from the 8 bit file to your screen again.  (It does this last \\\"recopy\\\" operation for its \\\"fit to screen\\\" feature, even when this feature is not enabled.)   The result of this process is the following:         1) If it runs out of disk space when writing the first 24 bit file, all         you ever see is as much data as it has room for, and the last bit of         data is simply repeated over and over again because CView never         realizes the disk has filled up and disk writes/reads aren't performed.       2) If it has enough room for the 24 bit data, but runs out of room for         the 8 bit data, you see almost all of the picture as it does the         dithering and writes to the screen card.         However, then when it finishes the dithering and recopies the data         from the 8 bit file to screen (for whatever reason it does this)         one again just gets a repetition of the last chunk of data for which         there was room on the disk.  This is just a guess, but probably fairly accurate.  At least the general idea is on track I think, although I have probably made errors in details about file I/O etc.  The way around this is  of course to clear up sufficient disk space.  The temp files for large JPEG's (1200x900 and bigger) can be very large (3 Meg + 1 Meg ).  On some of the largest I have needed in excess of 6 Meg free disk space.   CView has a much more serious bug: if you are trying to display a file from a floppy, and you change floppies while CView has some temp file open on the floppy, then CView in certain circumstances will write the directory (and FAT table? I can't remember) for the removed floppy onto the newly inserted floppy, thus corruptimg the new floppy in a very serious, possibly unrevcoverable way.  SO BE CAREFUL!  It is incredibly poor programming for a program to do this.  On the other hand, when choosing files in the Open Files menu, CView insists on doing a few disk reads every time one moves the hi-lighter square.  Incredibly annoying when it could do them all at once when it gets the directory info.  And really, how much effort does it take to sort a directory listing? \",\"  How many NuBus slots do you have?  Applied Engineering has something called the QuadraLink, which is a card with 4 serial ports that you get at through the comms toolbox (in addition to the built-in ones) It also comes with software for fooling applications to open an AE port when they think they open a built-in port.  They also have a more expensive card with DMA (better performance) and I _think_ they, or someone else, have a card that handles 8 ports simultaneously.  As I said, with NuBus, you're green.

This column is put together at lunch hour and after  the house quiets down at night, so data can quickly build up if  there's a lot of other stuff going on.  I've complied a lot of  information and happenings since the last column, so I'm going to  have to work to keep this one down to a readable length.  Have fun!

As published in \\\"US Industrial Outlook 1993\\\"  (which was released in January), revenues from the 1993 US space  business are currently projected to be about $4,890 M.     In contrast to previous years when US commercial space sales had  shown double digits growth rates, this year's projected results are  driven by the US satellite manufacturing industry, where sales are  projected to drop from 12 satellites worth $1,300 M in 1992 to 7  satellites worth $ 670 M in 1993.  The US Industrial Outlook also  projects U.S. commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year,  and while predicting that 1993 revenues will increase 10 percent to  $450 M, future sales will be \\\"adversely affected by the downward  revision in Department of Defense launch plans.\\\"                               Offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries,  revenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to  increase to $1,900 M, primarily driven by increased revenues from  broadcast and cable TV networks.  Similarly, remote sensing products  and sales are projected to increase to $250 M in 1993 (up 15%).

In general, not a bad  report -- with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite  manufacturing area.  There, changes of only a few satellites worth  $100 M or so apiece can substantially influence the annual  projection.  If we look forward over several years, this market  sector should retain strong sales as US firms have been very  successful in regaining international market share in the satellite  business.     Furthermore, sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in  the next revision of this data, expected to be released about mid- year.  Data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales (including  such items as GPS receivers and portable satellite terminals)  appears to be missing from the January data set.  DoC usually  publishes a listing of  \\\"Space Business Indicators\\\" in mid-year, and  the next revision of commercial space revenues should be released  then.  I expect the revised revenues should easily top $5,000 M, if  the mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the  numbers, and the year should show about a 10% overall market growth.     Looking beyond this year's data, future markets look quite  promising.  The DoC projects satellite service revenues could top  $3,000 M by 1995 if new mobile satellite services and direct  broadcasting are implemented as planned, and that mobile satellite  station sales are expected to continue to growth at 15-20 % per year  through the mid 1990's.  My numbers are somewhat more pessimistic  for near-term market growth, but I agree the trend should be for  substantial growth in US commercial space sales over at least the  next 5-10 years.  (My pessimism is due to more conservative  assumptions on market capture and growth in LEO communications and  satellite direct broadcasting services.  I don't believe all of the  current players in the yet-to-be-born LEO communications satellite  market and in the yet-to-be-proven direct broadcasting market will  be financial successes, nor that sales growth will be as explosive  as currently projected.)     It should also be noted this year's DoC data is the first  release to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research  facilities.  The $60 M shown in the Janurary data is primarily for  the Spacehab module, planned for launch in April on the Space  Shuttle, but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first  sales from the COMET orbital launch and recovery experiment module.]   2- DELTA WINS TWO KEY LAUNCH CONTRACTS    McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which builds and markets the Delta  launch vehicle has won two important launch contracts.  Motorola  Inc. announced in mid February that it had selected the Delta to  launch most of the satellites in the 66-satellite Iridium LEO  communications constellation, and in mid April, McDonnell Douglas  was awarded the USAF Medium Launch Vehicle III contract.     The launch services contract with Motorola for the Iridium  constellation launch is for at launch of least 45 Iridium  satellites.  Another 21 satellites have been contracted to be  launched by Khrunichev Enterprise in Russian on 3 Proton vehicle  launches.  These 45 satellites planned for the Delta will be  launched 5 at a time,  providing for at least 9 launches.   Additional satellites in the Iridium constellation, such as a  planned on-orbit spares, may also be launched on Delta.  Although  details of the launch services contract were reported to be  negotiation, and not yet final.     The USAF MLV contract also went to MDC, bidding a variant of  their Delta II launcher.  This contract is only initially worth $7.5  million, but establishes a set of launch options for up to 36  launches, encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002.  These  launches will deploy the next generation of the USAF's Global  Positioning System Block IIR navigation satellites, plus other  programs.  First option for to meet the USAF launch options is  expected to be exercised this year, after which the USAF is expected  to request launches of up to 6 Deltas per year for at least 6 years.   Under this contract the USAF can also request \\\"launch on demand\\\"  services from MDC for the 1996-2002 time period, with a launch to  occur within 40 days of the request.      [Commentary:  If these two contracts are fulfilled, they should  provide an excellent business base for MDC's Delta launch program  through the turn of the century.  Combined, these two contracts have  a potential for about 45 launches, worth about $2,200 M to MDC, and  sustaining a core business base of $300-400 M/year.  Other contracts  for international and commercial payloads, as well as for NASA  Medium ELV-class payloads, will add to this business base -- keeping  MDC as a viable commerical launch company.      However, it should be noted there are risk elements in these  contracts.  Motorola's Iridium LEO communications constellation has  not yet received a US Federal Communications Commission license for  operation in the U.S., nor has Motorola lined up all the financing  and financial partners for the Iridium venture.  Without these  approvals or financial backing there will be no Iridium launches.   But, hopefully, these uncertainties will be settled this year.     Similarly, the USAF MLV III program has been the target of  several Congressional actions which have slowed the production of  the GPS Block IIR satellites and deleted the funding for the MLV III  program in favor of the USAF NLS/\\\"Spacelifter\\\" program.  At this  time, while it appears the MLV III contract will be executed, future  funding for the MLV III and other USAF commercial launch contracts  is being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy  reviews.  Some opinions expressed from within the Administration and  Congress propose cancellation of all \\\"ELV upgrade\\\" programs  (including the MLV programs) in favor of the proposed \\\"Spacelifter\\\"  program.  Such opinions may have some weight in this year's budget  deliberations, particularly as DoD funds will be more difficult to  find in the shrinking US Defense budget.]    3- COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING VENTURE GETS DOC \\\"GO-AHEAD\\\"    The first commercial license to operate a remote sensing  satellite was approved in early February by the US Department of  Commerce's Office of Space Commerce.  A license was granted to  WorldView Imaging Corporation of Oakland, California to build and  operate a pair of LEO imaging satellites to provide multi-spectral  images of the Earth.     [Commentary:  There has been little data released on this venture  by WorldView and the DoC, other than the announcement of the  operating and construction license.  This was reported to be at the  request of WorldView.  Most industry speculation identifies this new  venture as a \\\"Star Wars\\\" spinoff, using SDI-type technology to  provide digital Earth sensing data, and heavily integrated into  digital GIS databases for remote sensing/GIS users.  Most probable  customers for this service include exploration geologists,  agricultural planners, and urban planners.      It is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the  1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act.  The Act, as passed last  November, provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote  sensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices.  Prior to  this act, remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to  all users at the same prices, and private remote sensing ventures  would have had to sell at the government-set Landsat data prices.     There are rumors of several other potential commercial remote  sensing ventures working their way through the system at different  stages of development.  I think the large Landsat and SPOT satellite  systems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing  data market for the next decade or so.  In contrast to these large,  government-sponsored remote sensing systems, smaller market ventures  such as WorldView and others can exploit market niches and use  innovative technology, and I believe, can find profitability on the  margin.  I predict there may be some very interesting ventures  appearing in the next year or so.]                    4- INVESTMENT FIRM CALLS GD'S SPACE BIZ \\\"STILL A GOOD INVESTMENT\\\"     Wall Street investment house Morgan Stanley thinks General  Dynamic's Space Systems Division could still be a moneymaker,  despite having failed in the last 3 Atlas launches.  In a recent  analyst's report Morgan Stanley said \\\"We are more than ever  convinced that if the company can return the Atlas to its historical  95%-plus success rate, this will become a highly profitable, cash- generating unit.\\\"  Based upon discussions with GD's corporate  management, Morgan Stanley projects that if the Atlas problems are  cleared up the unit could see $70 M in earnings per year by 1995 and  $100 M per year by 2000.  This is based upon GD's projection of  capturing about 10 Atlas launches per year on the world market.     [Commentary:  Three failures in a row of their launch system has  hurt General Dynamic's Space Systems Division.  Since GD has  restructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses,  many market pundits have been speculating GD's space business might  be next to be sold.  The Morgan Stanley report indicates GD's Space  Systems Division has some potential as a moneymaker, despite current  problems -- if they can get their act together.  Sales are projected  to be about $560 M in 1993, which will probably generate a loss of  about $25 M.  If GD can capture their projected share of the space  launch market, and if they have managed to clean up the reliability  of their Atlas launchers, then they could generate healthy profits  from those sales.  But until they demonstrate the Atlas Centaur  program is back on track, this division will continue to show  substantial losses.     In response to the sell-off rumors, in my opinion, this operation  is not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability.   To do such a takeover, the current set corporate and divisional  management would be replaced with another set from outside the firm.   In GD SSD's case, to get the division back on track, the management  team will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with  the Atlas Centaur, as well as in selling Atlas services.  This would  indicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch  operations could find such talent in-house, and be able to convince  customers to buy their launch services.  Optimally, the firm would  have substantial liquid rocket experience, and experience in  marketing space technology internationally as well.  Candidates for  this might be TRW, Rockwell, Lockheed, and Martin, and possibly  McDonnell Douglas and Boeing.  But most of those firms have cash  flow problems (MDC), have had a substantial business contraction  (Boeing and MDC), are involved with other launch firms (Lockheed),  or have taken on substantial debt (Martin).  And coming up with the  $700-1500 M purchase price for the division is a big chunk of  change for any company.]    5 - ARIANE PREDICTS DIP IN LAUNCH DEMAND    Arianespace, the operator of the Ariane launch system, is  projecting a dip in launch demand in the late 1990's.  In early  February, Arianespace released their annual market survey, which  detailed their projection of the space transportation market for the  next decade.     Over short run, Arianespace expects to retain their dominant  position and sustain a majority share of the launch market.  Of 54  international and commercial launches planned through 1995, Ariane  holds contracts for 31, General Dynamics' Atlas vehicle holds 14  contracts, McDonnell Douglas' Delta holds 7, and Great Wall's Long  March vehicle holds 2 launch contracts.     Three-quarters of future launch contracts for which Ariane can  compete are projected to come from communications satellites with  the remaining 25% split between weather, Earth observation, and  scientific satellites.  Most of the future telecommunications demand  growth is predicted to come from the Asia/Pacific region.     Arianespace expects the current market consolidation of  individual satellite operators into regional or national groups will  continue, with these groups investing in heavier satellites with  larger communications payloads carrying more transponders.  Arianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications  satellites should increase by 20 % over today's average level, to  about 3000 kg in GEO.     Demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain  strong over the next three years, but in the second half of the  decade, Arianespace predicts demand will decrease.  Arianespace  bases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder  demand and supply,  particularly as new data compression techniques  appear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing  or near-term transponders.     One of the significant possible changes in the market was  identified as the arrival of new launch vehicles, including Russian  launch systems.  But Arianespace predicts that in the long term,  investors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade  off between launch service quality and price, and that Russian and  other new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities  and service quality, and their market penetration will be minimal.     [Commentary:  Ariane releases their market surveys annually, and  I reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of CSN/STI.   Comparing the two surveys, there aren't outstanding differences in  the numbers.   The most notable change is the consideration of new  data compression techniques, reducing the demand for new physical  transponders on orbit.    I note that in contrast to some predictions, demand for space- based communications transponders appears to be remain strong. While  fiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the  established point-to-point telecommunications markets, growing  demand for telecommunications services world wide and for point-to- multipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space  transponder demand.  Fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability  service, but only from established point A to established point B.  To establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable  between the points, and while there are improved network solutions,  installing a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost  millions or billions of dollars.      For broadcast services where there is not an existing ground  network structure, satellites still offer the most cost effective  solution.  And if new services are required into a new region, it is  cheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of  thousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite  network.  This allows rapid growth of new satellite services, and  has kept demand high.  The replacement market for fiberoptics is  growing as well, since as demand grows between the points serviced,  it becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to  handle the increase in traffic.     Since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still  growing rapidly, satellite market projections remain rosy.  But  satellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes.  Current  generation satellites are now getting guarantees of at 15 years of  on-orbit service or more, in contrast to 10 years of service from  last generation's satellites.  This has cut back some of the launch  demand, as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite  launches over longer intervals.     And as last note; Arianespace didn't flag it this year, but it  looks like the space transportation market will be rather over- supplied by existing launch systems in the near term.  The annual  commercial launch demand is for about 15-20 medium sized satellites  per year.  From the supply side, Ariane is capable of launching up  to about a dozen medium sized satellites a year, Delta is capable of  about 9-12 per year, Atlas is capable of 6-12, Long March 4-8,  Japan's H-Vehicle 2-4, Russia's Proton capable of 8, and other  systems such as Zenit and Soyuz another 10-20 medium launches per  year.  That's a lot of capability for a small market.     We can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial  launches.]  6- NTSB INVESTIGATES PEGASUS LAUNCH OVER ABORTED ABORT     The 9 Feb Pegasus launch by Orbital Sciences Corporation has  spawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety  rules.  A valid abort order from a NASA range safety officer to halt  the mission was overridden and the Pegasus was launched in violation  of range safety rules.      In the last few minutes of the Pegasus launch countdown, one of  two abort command receivers aboard the Pegasus failed.  Such a failure  typically scrubs a launch,and a NASA range safety officer at  Wallops Island, VA issued a mission abort order about a minute  before the scheduled Pegasus launch.  Somehow this command was  overridden by the OSC launch team or the message was lost in the  communications channels, and the Pegasus was launched despite the  valid abort call.     Fortunately, the Pegasus functioned as expected, and the abort  command receiver was not needed.  But this incident did spark an  investigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed-to  launch constraint rules, and was not obeyed.     Leading the investigation is the National Transportation Safety  Board (NTSB) with support from NASA, OSC, and the Air Force.  This  investigation marks the first time NTSB has taken the lead on an  incident involving a space launch.  According to the NTSB, their  investigation will take about 6 months, and is primarily looking at  lines of authority, communications links and safety procedures used  in the launch.    [Commentary: This is the first time that the NTSB has led an  investigation into a space launch.  Their leadership was requested  by the Department of Commerce's Office of Commercial Space  Transportation, who had licensed the commercial launch.      At the time of writing this column, some of the initial  investigations have been concluded, and some of the results are  starting to leak out into the trade press.  Apparently, 3 or four  different communications channels were in use during the test. After  the abort destruct receiver stopped responding, the NASA test  director and range controller in the Mission Control room at Wallops  Island gave abort orders about a minute before the launch.   According to the mission rules, this should have stopped the launch.  Somehow, the OSC test conductor ordered the abort reversed, and the  NASA communicator on the net relayed that order to the B-52 carrying  the Pegasus at about 22 seconds before launch.  Differing  explainations of exactly how this happened are proposed -- with the  best set being that clear lines of communications and clear  definition of the responsibilities of the mission control team, and  understanding of the mission rules were not established before the  launch.      As we see more and more commercial launches, more of these  procedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved.    This case is interesting because it is the first time the NTSB has  been called in to investigate a commercial launch problem (as they  do with commercial aircraft problems).      I think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with  procedures and communications, and will be cleared up with issuance  of guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how  specific lines of authority should be delineated.]   7- ANOTHER PEGASUS COMPETITOR IS ANNOUNCED    Tsniimach Enterprise in Russia announced it is marketing a new  small space launch system, based upon converted ICBM components.   Two versions of the launcher are being marketed: the \\\"Aerokosmos\\\"  winged vehicle launched like the OSC Pegasus, and the \\\"Severkosmos\\\",  launched from a mobile ground transporter.  The Aerokosmos is  projected to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to  an 800 km circular orbit, and the Severkosmos to be capable of 430  kg to 200 km orbits and 225 kg to 800 km.  Also proposed to be used  with these launch systems is a LEO data relay system called  'Sineva'.  Tsniimach Enterprise is described as a ex-military  establishment, focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of  spacecraft and which has participated in the development of the  Buran shuttle system,  They are located near the NPO Energia  facility in Kaliningrad, outside of Moscow.     [Commentary: There's very little released information on this new  venture.  My suspicion is it is another Russian enterprise looking  for hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in-house  knowledge of ex-Soviet launch systems.  It adds to the list of numerous  commercial space startups announced from the ex-Soviet Union.     This one's a little different in that they are offering variants  of ex-Soviet ICBMs, but I can't identify any key customers being  targeted or substantial financial backing.]  8- GEORGIA LAUNCH SITE DROPPED FROM PLANNING    In late January, Georgia Tech Research Institute released the  results of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial  rocket launching site in Camden County, Georgia at the old Kingsland  Missile Test Launching Site on the Atlantic coast.  The preliminary  study recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch  site, stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected  low investment returns, plus environmental and other geographic  considerations.  However, the report did say the site might be ideal  for other aerospace uses, and recommended other potential uses.     [Commentary:  This should put the nails in the coffin of the  Kingsland Commercial Launch Site.  While other sites are still  proceeding with commercial launch site development plans, Kingsland  found without a key customer to act as anchor tenant, and if  substantial infrastructure had to be put in, then the expected  returns were too low to justify the cost of development.      This might point out some key discriminators in judging the  feasibility of a commercial launch site.  These include:   - Is there an identified key customer to provide core usage  sufficient to recover setup costs?   - Is there a market advantage of using the site?   - Can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site?   - Can financing be found at low enough cost to support the  investment?      Other commercial launch site ventures -- including those at  Woomera, Poker Flat, Cape York, White Sands, Alabama Off-Shore  Platform, Hawaii, and Vandenberg have to also be judged against  these criteria.  In my opinion, some of these ventures are flying  on hope and speculation, and not on sound financial grounds.]  9- SPAIN'S CAPRICORNIA LAUNCHER STILL PROCEEDING    In one of his last official acts, former President Bush  authorized space technology transfer for several joint space  ventures between US and other firms.  One of these was a proposed  use of US technology by Spain to build a small booster.  With that  regulatory impediment removed, the 3-stage Capricornia launch  vehicle will start development later this year, planning for a first  launch in the 1995/96 time period.  The Capricornia is described as  a small 3-stage all solid booster designed to put 250-500 Kg into  LEO.  Several launch sites are being examined for the system,  including 2 on the Iberian peninsula and 1 on the Canary Islands.   Originated by INTA in Spain, the project reports it has $ 30 M in  development funding, and will use technology from Argentina's Condor  launch vehicle as well as from the US.     [Commentary:  Several firms have identified a market opportunity  in providing a small launcher for the European market.  Small  payloads from European firms or organizations currently use either  Ariane piggyback launches or the US/Italian Scout launcher.   However, Ariane piggyback opportunities are limited, and the Scout  program is being phased out (accompanied by some disarray in the  Italian government and space industry regarding any follow-on  system).      This has left an apparent niche for a new European small launch  system.  Surprisingly enough, ESA has not supported development of  such a system within the current space funding structure.  Studies  have been performed by British Aerospace, Aerospatiale, Deutsche  Aerospace, and Italian organizations, but with the exception of the  Swedish/PacAstro system (reported below), I have not been able to  find any other European development work with even a rumor of  funding for hardware.     Also of interest is the linking of the Capricornia to the  Argentinian Condor launcher.  There have been some interesting  rumors surfacing out of Argentina over the past year about a space  launcher/IRBM program funded under the military junta which ruled  the country in the 1970's and early 1980's.     What is known is in Feb 1992, the Argentinian Air Force formally  transferred control of the Condor 2 missile program to the new  civilian Argentinian national space agency (Comison Nacional de  Atividades Espaciales - CNAE).  The Condor 2 program was described  as originating in 1983, expanding upon the smaller Condor 1 rocket  program in collaboration with Egypt and with support of German  firms.  The Condor 2 was also reportedly funded indirectly by Iraq  in the mid-1980's.  Fairly large solid rocket motors were built and  tested, but Argentinan development of a suitable guidance package  lagged that of the propulsion system.     It should be noted CNAE is planning to launch its first  scientific satellite in late 1994.  The US$ 9 M, 181 Kg, SAC-B  satellite will study the Earth's upper atmosphere and includes  cooperative experiments from Italy and the US. No launch vehicle has  yet been selected, but OSC's Pegasus and the Russian Burlak Air  launched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this  contract.]   10- PACASTRO SIGNS LAUNCH RESERVATION WITH SWEDISH SPACE CORP    PacAstro, a small launch firm in Herndon, Virginia announced in  late February it had received a $6 M launch reservation contract  from the Swedish Space Corp to launch a satellite on PacAstro's PA-2  launch vehicle.   This will be performed as part of the Polar  Satellite Service (PSS), a joint Norwegian Space Center/ Swedish  Space Corp. program to upgrade the Andoya Rocket Range in Norway and  offering small satellite launches into the polar regions.  According  to PacAstro, PSS is also performing an $8 M upgrade of the Andoya  launch facilities, including a new integration facility and a fully- enclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like  the PacAstro PA-2.  PacAstro has been chosen as \\\"the main  alternative rocket supplier\\\" for the small satellite launch service  to be offered by PSS from Andoya.  The date of the launch of the  Swedish satellite was not specified.     [Commentary:  PacAstro has been trying to line up customers and  funding for their launch vehicle for some time now.  The PA-2 is a  small, two stage rocket fueled by RP-1 and Liquid Oxygen.  From  PacAstro's literature, the engines designed for the PA-series  rockets are built of \\\"off the shelf\\\" components based upon the Lunar  MOdule Descent Engines built by TRW, and are capable of putting a  225 Kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit.      PacAstro is trying to arrange construction financing for its  first three PA-2 vehicles, with a first launch planned for 1995, and  2 orbital launches planned for 1996.  My records show PacAstro hired  TRW to provide marketing support and systems design,  with primary  engineering to be done by AeroAstro, a small satellite builder  closely associated with PacAstro (headquartered in the same  building).  The Swedish Space Corporation would supply engineering,  launch operations, vehicle subsystems, and marketing support.  Sumitomo Corp. of Tokyo, is a first round investor and sits on the  board of directors.      PacAstro has gotten a first round financial package of at least  $550 K  (Some sources place this of high as $1 M), but has been  searching for about a year for the additional $20-30 M needed to  design, build and launch their first set of vehicles.     The launch reservation from SSC can possibly be used to help  bring some investors on board, but by my estimate, they will need  much more than the single $6 M sale to put their venture into real  hardware.]   11- CHINA AND TAIWAN JOINT SATELLITE VENTURE REPORTED     In early March, it was reported a joint satellite communications  venture between a Taiwanese and mainland Chinese was in the works.   As reported in the Taipei press, China Development Corp. (CDC),  headquartered in Taiwam and with links to the ruling Nationalist  Party, is planning to set up a joint venture in Hong Kong with China  Great Wall Industry Corp. with the objective of launching a regional  communications satellite. CDC would cover about 10% of the satellite  system cost (US $10 M) in exchange for rights to 10% of the  satellite's communications channels.      [Commentary:  This announcement came close on the heels of the  release of Taiwanese plans for space development (released in mid  January).   In those plans, the National Space Program Office of  Taiwan will launch 3 satellites, starting with ROCSAT-1, a 400 Kg  scientific spacecraft, planned for launch in 1997.  Two additional  satellites are planned, both communications satellites.   TRW has  been helping Taiwan plan this program, budgeted at T$13.6 B (US $530  M) through 2006.      I haven't been able to establish any relationship between this  venture and those of the NSPOT, but there might be a connection.   While Taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures, the  current Taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two  separate sastellite ventures.     The reported name for the Tiawanese/Chinese system is \\\"Asiasat- 2\\\", but I don't thinks this has any relationship with the existing  Hong Kong-based \\\"Asiasat\\\" program involving Chinese, Hong Kong, and  other Asian investors, other than using it as an organizational  model.  There are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing  venture -- it could provide excellent first-hand experience to  Taiwan for a very low cost, which then can be used in later  satellite ventures.  But there are internal political issues between  Taiwanese and Chinese ventures, but putting any joint venture  through a  Hong Kong intermediary corporation might allow it to  proceed.     In any case, the East Asian satellite market is lighting up with  substantially growth projected in space services and revenues.  This  is just another indicator to add to the list.]   12- SOUTH KOREA ANNOUNCES NATIONAL MOVE INTO SPACE TECHNOLOGIES    South Korea's Trade, Industry and Resources Ministry recently  announced plans to invest US$22 B in research and development and  another US$17 B into manufacturing and research facilities for  advanced aerospace technologies.  Space technologies have been  specifically targeted as part of this program, beginning with  manufacture and launch of an advanced multi-purpose satellite by  1997.  The objective of this investment is to raise South Korea's  aerospace technology to the level of the world's top 10 countries by  2000.                                     [Commentary: South Korea has been quietly working to develop its  national aerospace industry, specifically including space  activities. I'm noting this as a flag that potential new players are  coming into the commercial space market.     As part of their national effort, 2 national telecommunications  satellites for Korea Telecom will be launched in April and Oct 1995  on Delta. Designated Koreasat 1 and 2, the platforms will provide  television and telephone service throughout the Korean Peninsula,  southwestern Japan and portions of China bordering North Korea.     South Korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on  Ariane in Aug 1992, called Uribyol-1 (Our Star) and costing about US  $8.8 M.  Uribyol-2 is planned for piggyback launch in October of  this year, again on Ariane, and will be entirely \\\"made in Korea.\\\"   Uribyol-3, projected for a 1995 launch, will be an environment- monitoring micro-satellite.     This satellite may be the precursor to a series of small Earth  observation satellites,  The KEOS (Korean Earth Observation System)  project, which has been submitted for approval to the South Korean  government, would use two or three 300-kg spacecraft equipped with  optical and microwave sensors.    South Korean press reports claim there is also a parallel  military effort to establish the capabilities for building and  launching small military satellites by 2001.  Supposedly a  government panel had been established to oversee such an effort,  funded at US $ 500 M between 1993 and 2001, in anticipation of an   expected pullout of U.S. intelligence-gathering systems from the  Korean peninsula.           In conjunction with all of these reported efforts, South Korean  is also pursuing production work either as off-sets to existing  aerospace technology contracts (for example, McDonnell Douglas is  offsetting production of some Delta parts to South Korean firms as  part of the Koreasat launch contracts), or for production of  consumer space items (among other products, South Korea exports  satellite receiver television setups to Japan, and Samsung has  announced teaming for production of OSC's Orbcomm user terminals.).      This looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies.   Considering that East Asia is currently the fastest growing sector  for commercial space services (primarily for telecommunications), a  South Korean push into space technologies may change the composition  of commercial space market there over the next decade.]   13- SPACE TECHNOLOGY INDEXES THROUGH MARCH    As announced in the last CSN/STI, each issue will give the  results of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and  investments.  The table below summarizes results to the end of  March.  The Space Technology Index did quite a bit better than the  market as a whole, as represented by the S&P 500 index.  Since 90+%  of the values included in the index are US firms, this represents a  general increase in the market value of space-related firms.  The  increase in the first quarter is more than in all of 1992 -- which  is a very promising sign, although future months may reverse this  trend. The Commercial Space Technology Index has also done quite  well, but the Pure Play portfolio -- consisting of stocks of firms  which are pure plays in space technologies -- has also surpassed its  results in all of 1993.  We'll keep an eye on these ....

Vukota is absolutely the worst puck handler in the world!! He couldn't hit a bull in the ass with a banjo!! Al must remember a few years back when Mick  scored 3 goals in one period against the Caps in a 5-3 Isles win. I was there and was astonished as was the rest of the crowd. Wake-up Al!!! Years later he's gotten worse. He's a cheap shot artist and always ends up getting stupid/senseless penalties. I think he would make a good police officier!!!  As for Pilon, he can't carry the puck out to center ice by himself. He either makes a bad pass resulting in a turnover, or he attempts to bring the puck  towards the neutral zone and skates right into an opposing skater. He can't stay on his skates with most forwards or centers. He either falls down or  committs a penalty. Call up somebody from Capital District AL!!!!!  As far as the playoffs, the Isles are as difficult to figure out as the Caps. Two good teams with talent but so inconsistent. They should meet in the first round. The Isles seem to play up to the level of their competition so they should play well against Jersey tonite. It'll probably be another tight 1-goal game as the last 20 games hve been for the Isles. I wish when the get a lead they could continue to pour it on instead of settling back into a defensive shell and letting the opposition get back in the game. Al MUST understand he can't do with this team what he did with the 80-83 Isles. maybe Al should got to. Where is Bobby Nystrom?? Clark Gilles?? John Tonelli??

Have any of you read Tony Campollo's book- liar,  ->lunatic, or the real thing?  (I might be a little off on the title, but he  ->writes the book.  Anyway he was part of an effort to destroy Christianity,  ->in the process he became a Christian himself.  Sounds like you are saying he was a part of some conspiracy.  Just what organization did he  belong to? Does it have a name?  -> The book says that Jesus was either a liar, or he was crazy ( a  ->modern day Koresh) or he was actually who he said he was.  Logic alert - artificial trifercation.  The are many other possible explainations.  Could have been that he never existed.  There have been some good points made in this group that is not  impossible  that JC is an amalgam of a number of different myths, Mithra comes to mind.  -> Some reasons why he wouldn't be a liar are as follows.  Who would  ->die for a lie?  Wouldn't people be able to tell if he was a liar?  People  ->gathered around him and kept doing it, many gathered from hearing or seeing  ->someone who was or had been healed.  Call me a fool, but I believe he did  ->heal people.     Logic alert -  argument from incredulity.  Just because it is hard for you to believe this doesn't mean that it isn't true.  Liars can be very pursuasive, just look at Koresh that you yourself site. He has followers that don't think he is a fake and they have shown that they are willing to die. By not giving up after getting shot himself, Koresh has shown that he too is will to die for what  he believes.  As far as healing goes.  If I rememer right the healing that was attributed is not consistent between the different gospels.  In one of them the healing that is done is not any more  that faith healers can pull off today.  Seems to me that the early gospels weren't that compeling, so the stories got bigger to appeal better.  -> Niether was he a lunatic.  Would more than an entire nation be drawn  ->to someone who was crazy.  Very doubtful, in fact rediculous.  For example  ->anyone who is drawn to David Koresh is obviously a fool, logical people see  ->this right away. -> Therefore since he wasn't a liar or a lunatic, he must have been the  ->real thing.     Or might not have existed, or any number of things.  That is the logical pitfall that those who use flawed logic like this fall into.  There are bifurcations (or tri, quad, etc) that are valid, because in the proceeding steps, the person shows conclusively that the alternatives are all that are  possible.  Once everyone agrees that the given set is indeed all there are, then arguments among the alternatives can be presentent, and one mostly likely to be true can be deduced by excluding all other possible alternatives.  However, if it can be shown that the set is not all inclusive, then any conclusions bases on the  incomplete set are invalid, even if the true choice is one of the original choices.  I have given at  least one valid alternative, so the conclusion that JC is the real McCoy just because he isn't one of the other two alternative is no longer valid.  -> Some other things to note.  He fulfilled loads of prophecies in  ->the psalms, Isaiah and elsewhere in 24 hrs alone.  This in his betrayal  ->and Crucifixion.  I don't have my Bible with me at this moment, next time I  ->write I will use it.  JC was a rabbi.  He knew what those prophecies were.  It wouldn't be any great shakes to make sure one does a list of actions that would fullfill prophecy.  What would be compeling is if there were a set of clear and explicit prophecies AND JC had absolutely NO knowledge of then,  yet  fullfilled them anyway.  -> I don't think most people understand what a Christian is.  It  ->is certainly not what I see a lot in churches.  Rather I think it  ->should be a way of life, and a total sacrafice of everything for God's  ->sake.  He loved us enough to die and save us so we should do the  ->same.  Hey we can't do it, God himself inspires us to turn our lives  ->over to him.  That's tuff and most people don't want to do it, to be a  ->real Christian would be something for the strong to persevere at.  But  ->just like weight lifting or guitar playing, drums, whatever it takes  ->time.  We don't rush it in one day, Christianity is your whole life.   ->It is not going to church once a week, or helping poor people once in  ->a while.  We box everything into time units.  Such as work at this  ->time, sports, Tv, social life.  God is above these boxes and should be  ->carried with us into all these boxes that we have created for  ->ourselves.    Here I agree with you.  Anyone who buys into this load of mythology should take what it says  seriously, and what it says is that it must be a total way of life.  I have very little respect for  Xians that don't.  If the myth is true, then it is true in its entirity.  The picking and choosing that I see a lot of leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

In my lifetime, your philosophy -- socialism masquerading as a liberal welfare state -- has been in ascendancy.  # No, I mean exactly what I wrote--the welfare system of the New Deal is # wholly inadequate to cope with the current state of affairs.  Absolutely.  So the response of socialists is take us even further into socialism.  # # # # # (2) Whether or not the fathers work # # # # # is not germane to single mothers. #   # # # # Very true.

And no career path # # # either--they find excuses to lay people off and hire new ones rather # # # than give raises and perks.  And why not?  It's a lot cheaper. #  # # Oddly enough, all the unskilled or semiskilled people I know manage # # to find employment almost immediately.  Maybe she needs to move to a # # cheaper part of the country, where jobs are plentiful, and the cost # # of living is lower. #  # The west side of Chicago is about as cheap as it gets--squalor city. # Tell me about all these places where it's cheap to live and jobs are # abundant--I'll pass them on.

No, it's that areas with a lot of wealthy breed socialists -- all the spoiled rich kids, feeling guilty about their wealth.

(Well, there's also my policy of never picking a Buck Rodgers' team for last)   The 1961 Angels were  1/2 game out of 7th. The Athletics and  expansion Senators finished tied for last.  The 1962 Colt 45's finshed 8th - ahead of the Cubs (the Mets were last). The 1969 Royals finshed 4th - ahead of the White Sox (the Pilots in last). The 1977 Mariners finished 6th - ahead of the Athletics(in last).  Apparently being an expansion team with a poor A's or Chicago  team around is a `good thing'   This may be an appropriate comparison. The 1929-31 Yankees finshed 2nd, 3rd and 2nd finshing  18, 16 and 13-1/2 games out of first.  In 1933,'34 and '35 they also finished second ( though they were only 7, 7 and 3 games out).

I think it is; I've heard it's not.  Lets : >say 8 bit samples.  Would *raw* data at the corresponding sampling rate : >be usable?  If not, how fancy does the compression need to be?  : As far as I know ISDN (call it Swissnet here, and it's being plugged in) it's : 8 bit 8000Hz (gives you one channel of 64kBit/sec) I guess you should not go : below a sampling rate of 6000 Hz if you want to have same quality as on an : analog-line. Anybody knows compression-algorithms & -factors for voice ?  I've posted some info on CELP coding on sci.crypt.  Looks like you can squeeze speech into 4000bps if you have a fast enough computer like a sparcstation (or a Newton with the Acorn Risc Machine in it :-) )  This drops the bandwidth to so low a figure that it's feasible to run speech over tcp/ip running on top of slip down a v32bis modem.  Not only will this let us run point to point encrypted speech, it'll let us run speech internationally over the internet if no-one stops us by getting *very* heavy about regulations.  The thought of this, if the administration realised, would probably scare them shitless.  Now of course the trick is to develop and define a standard protocol for internet speech *damn fast*, allowing anyone who feels brave to inplement custom handheld hardware as well as us hacking it on our workstations.  Shouldn't be too difficult.  The CELP stuff is standardised, we use tcp/ip streams, and a protocol allowing silences to be used to catch up on any net lag, and also to avoid sending any data during silences (ie it's not wise to be synchronised real-time on each end because any net delays would add up to big voice-lags)  As for me, I'm going to press ahead on trying this stuff as soon as I get my sparc back from being loaned out and buy the necessary microphone. It'll save me a fortune in calling my friend in texas every night :) (whether encrypted or not)  You know, surely *someone* is working on this.  Who?  It's so obvious, why doesn't it exist already?  I've only seen netphone for Suns and it didn't do the CELP compression so was restricted to ether connections.\",\"Finally a fax service to all Internet users in the continental U.S. without prepayment of any kind.

That belongs in rec.sport.baseball!!!\",\": From: shirriff@sprite.berkeley.edu (Ken Shirriff) : Message-ID: <1r24us$oeh@agate.berkeley.edu> : It seems likely to me that that a large subset of encrypted communications : would be archived to tape so they could be read if sometime in the future : probable cause arises and a warrant is obtained.  I think it is unlikely that data like this could be used in court. Currently LEAs can install wiretaps on large numbers of phones, record calls without listening to them, and then post-facto obtain warrants and listen to calls after probable cause is established.  But this strategy wouldn't get the stuff admitted in court.  (At least, not in the near term.)  In other words, near as I can tell, the thing that makes such evidence inadmissable is the interception without a warrant, not the attempt to interpret what was intercepted without a warrant.  I'd be surprised that archiving data without consent would be interpreted as anything but analogous to a wiretap by the courts.  Note that that doesn't mean I think it won't be done if technically feasible.  Just as I'm sure many wiretaps are done now without warrants, just to fish for avenues to investigate.  So in the future, start surveilance, start archiving data, trump up some probable cause, decrypt post-facto after the warrant is in hand, and the investigation gets a boost from data that, sadly, won't ever be presented to a jury.  While I'm posting...  for an interesting cautionary tale projecting this archiving scenario to extremes, read \\\"Lacey and his Friends\\\", a collection of sf stories by David Drake.  The US starts down the slippery slope by archiving *everyghing*.  But don't worry folks, it's stored in a secure repository where nobody but LEAs with warrants can get to it.  And by the way, we'll be installing cameras on all major streets.  Hey, this is nothing new, we already have cameras in banks and teller machines, don't we?  And then we'll pass laws requiring cameras covering *all* public places.  Then in some private places.  Then we'll make it a crime ever to be out of range of a camera, except in legally licensed privacy cubicles.  Only alone.  And with a thorough body search before and after.  But, see, there's still a right to privacy.  We haven't curtailed any rights, not really.  And just think how much easier it'd be to solve crimes in such a situation: just obtain a warrant, put on a VR helmet and take a walk down memory lane.  And hey, nobody'll be tracking *you* or *me*, no need to be self-conscious.  After all, if you're not doing anything illegal...  Funny, though.  While speeding and the radar detector industry became pretty much a thing of the past, somehow all this didn't elminate all crime in the story.  And somehow, politicians got exemptions on grounds of national security, and rich corporations got exemptions for their execs on grounds of industrial espionage and the preservation of competition.  And not everybody was exactly happy with the system.   I can't imagine why. \",\"Another user recently requested info about the Shadow/Sundance cars, but I haven't seen any public responses.

The above, while literaly true, is a clasic straw-man claim in the context of non-real-time circuits such as E-mail and the like.   I would modestly propose that a mandated use of ISDN would do more for commun- ications than this lot.   Normmaly DES.                                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  Note the use of the word \\\"business\\\" in the above. The whole tenor of this release seems to be establishing a ground rule that only \\\"business\\\" use is legitimate for debate. If you want the nothings you drop in your wife's ear to remain secret and private, that is not even on the agenda for debate. Note that there is NO role for you to contain private info in this. The only reference is to information already in the hands of others. The 'unauthorized release' bit is also drawing a long bow. Most of these cases are by people who have legitimate access abusing it, and revealing, or often selling the info. These people are, of course, in this proposal, the people who will have the keys.  The criminals also use lawers, courts, the CIA, white-house officials and pens to go about their business. When will they be outlawed as well? Yeah, several of them would be a better idea than CLipper!  Them again, the protections of law and the courts have been seriously erroded over the last decade ofr so.                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ NSA   Yeah, this bit is VERY true.   Note the repeated mixing of telephone scrabeling and encryption. A demo of the above claim on an ordanary POTS would be a good nights entertainment I suspect. Note also the 'many'. not 'all', as the general tone implies.                                  ^^^^^^^^^                                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  The case record seems to indicate that what is needed is a brutal tightening of the current abuses. I have not heard, yet, of a case that was impeaded by the use of secure encryption by the men in black. The other side, abuse by law enforcers is well documented, even by govt agencies. And the phone vs other coms is blurred yet again.                                   Lets run that line twice. Not **VERY** carefully what it says. The stated purpose of the key eschrow is to make the use of Clipper compulsory. Note the word \\\"ensure\\\". As to 'protect', or 'law-abiding', I will leave to you. So to the person who asked if it included the outlawing of other encryptions, the answer in this press release is, YES.   Just as they only can wiretap now with a warrent.    Just makes sure that the illegal ones are preserved.   Where do you find many experts. Any ex KGB people looking for a contract? :-) And as a later posting asks, what of the STU-IIIs they already have. It will be very interesting to see if the military and US embasies start to use it. After all, it is secure, isn't it. The govt will answer that point by its own actions.                                                  ^^^^^^^^  Again, personal use seems to be a unaskable question.                                                    ^^^^^  Ah, so warrents are not always needed it seems.   The ITARs seem to slightly impeed this.   Note that all this wonderfull stuff will be in secret. Only the 'proper people' will be able to express an opinion, hence only the desired result will emerge.   Encryption and codes have been around for millenia. They are generaly in equilibrium with the technology of the time. The systematic study of cyphers has resulted in a swing in favor of the encrypter, AT THE MOMENT. I have no doubt that the factoring problem will fall in time. Probably fofr practical purposes by the middle of the next century.   It is a little hard to critisise a non-proposal.   Note we drop back to 'phone-mode' again. If this is a true answer, it can be rephrased as \\\" It sucks big time. Anyone who can drive the crypt work-bench will use it for light amusement before breakfast.\\\"   This link between the security of the key-eschrow, and the actual algorithm is  a real winner. Given that I have 2 secret 40 bit numbers, could someone please explain how the details of an encryption algorithm will reveal them?   Just make sure you read the CVs REAL carfully, OK.   Quick, with out looking back, What name is missing from that list?   The people who agree with us and who think there is a buck in it for them.   The reverse engineering provisions of the 'Mask-work' act could be relevent here.   You don't. Not unless you are one of the 'right people'.   They missed the word secret here. He needs a grammar lesson too.   I would say \\\"less secure, less conveniant, more expensive ( PGP is free ), less available, and more prone to being comprimised\\\" Proofs to the contarary will be welcome. Note PROOF.   They don't seem to be saying anything that makes much sense. And this proposal DOES prohibit it except in a very limited way. And, this is the one explicit reference to personal rights. It is a denial. And yes, I don't think that the Mexicans, Brazilians, and Canucks are included in Clinton et als magnanamous gesture.   The 'false tension' is false. The balance is between two repugnant points. The RIGHT to privacy is hand-waved to non-existance by putting it behind the \\\"false assessment\\\". It is assumed that the removal of the right to take what ever steps YOU deem suitable to protect YOUR privacy is non negotiable, hence is defined in the govenment language to be non-existant. If you don't agree, you must be a criminal, as only criminals don't agree with out laws. Also note the non- question. \\\"If what is here was not possible...\\\"   It indicates we know that Bush dropped the ball in squashing that nasty < insert suitable retoric > and will stamp out this disorderly, unruley outbreak of freedom and ultra-national sentiment.   This one is a real giggle. In Australia or France, they will have to reveal the keys, and the algorithm. Don't think it's at the top of my list of things I must have, so the restrictions will protect me from saleks trying to sell me a bill of crock.  Any for any others using it, they must be nuts!  Good luck folks.\",\"  I tend to agree that players are not hurt by early play in the big leagues. The BRaves organization is a fertile ground to test this hypothesis, as they had little talent on their roster for some time.  Steve Avery, for example, was rushed to the majors, and he fared very poorly during his initial campaign. His subsequent pitching has not been affected by his 5+ ERA during his rookie year.  Bill James pointed out that it was relatively unusual to struggle so and then rebound.  Bob Horner was also rushed to the majors (out of Arizona State directly) had good numbers immediately.  I am not certain of the ages of people like Pete Smith, Craig McMurty, and Derek Lilliquist.  The Braves pitching staffs were so bad when they came up that they might have been rushed.  Lilliquist and Smith struggled, but it didn't hurt PS and DL may have been overhyped.  I seem to recall CM pitching well initially, though I don't have stats handy.\",\"Victoria Hotel Reserv. 2 nights $40  MID-WEEK (Sun - Thurs) Hotel reservation available for Victoria, Canada. 2 nights/3 days for $40.

I read once that the Babe made $80,000 one year and that was about as good  as it got for him.  Let's assume he made that in 1928 (I'm not sure of the figures, but I know I'm in the ballpark--pun intended). :-)  Today, assuming a 4% yearly inflation rate, which is an understatement if not accurate, his measly $80,000 salary would be worth.  FV = $80,000 x (1+4%)^(1993-1928)    = $80,000 x (1.04)^65    = just over $1,000,000.  Assuming inflation is average of around 5%.  FV = $80,000 x (1+5%)^65    = almost 2,000,000.  (I didn't crunch these numbers beforehand).  These numbers might lead one to believe that today's players are slightly  overpaid.  The Babe appears to have made then what today's average to above average players make now.  Perfectly accurate salary, year of salary, and  average inflation rate would make this analysis more accurate, but I don`t  think I'm off by much.

Any leads?  \",\"  No matter how \\\"absurd\\\" it is to suggest that a common moral system created by mankind is absolute, it is not contrary to reason to suggest that a common moral system created by mankind is sensible. In fact, for the Bible to be of any use to mankind as a moral code, it must be interpreted by mankind and a workable moral system created for everyday use.  The Jewish Talmud is the result of centuries of Biblical scholars analysing every word of the Torah to understand the morality behind it. The Children of Israel were given a very strict set of Moral, Civil, Judicial and Ceremonial Laws to follow and yet this was clearly not enough to cover every instance of moral dilemma in their Society. For a Christian, the situation is no better.  It seems to me that the only code of morality that we have from the Judeo- Christian God is that which is contained in the Bible (which we can see from the diverse opinions in the Christian newsgroups is not clear). There may well be an absolute morality defined by the Judeo-Christian God for mankind to follow but it seems that we only have a subset simply because the concept was written down by man.  This leads to the problem of defining morality for our society. If we take the divine Morality then we have a code of practice which may be interpreted in many different ways (as an example, consider the immolation of heretics in the fifteenth century and the interpretation of the Bible which allows a man to do that to another man under the precept to administer Justice). If we take an agnostic Morality then we have a code of practice that can be modified to suit society (with all the danger that this implies). Alternatively, we could take the basis of the Judeo-Christian morality and interpret/extend this to create and justify a code of morality which suits the society we live in and enables the people to live Righteously (as many Christian and Non-Christian philosophers have done).  Whatever the driving force behind the definition of morality for our society, I think the important aspect is the result.

If the (naive) market is flooded with proprietary, but weak, encryption, then truly strong  encryption will be unable to compete. Suppose the govt had a secret TV broadcast standard, and then sold TVs below cost. Private industry has a better standard, but it's not as widespread due to the govt early flooding of the market with cheap proprietary sets. Even though the industry's technology is better, the programming is being broadcast to the govt's unduplicatable standard. Who could compete?    The other flaw, of course, is that making something voluntary today ensures that it will be voluntary in the future.

The bones are said to have been loaded at Mudania on the Sea of Marmora and to be the remains of the victims of massacres in Asia Minor. In view of the rumors circulating it is expected that an inquiry will be instigated.     - - - Reference - - -  [1] _New York Times_, December 23, 1924, page 3, column 2 (bottom)     - - - - - - - - - - - -  On the 78th Commemorative Anniversary of the Turkish genocide of the Armenians, we remember those whose only crime was to be Armenian in the shadow of an  emerging Turkish proto-fascist state. In their names we demand justice.  In April 1915, the Turkish government began a systematically executed  de-population of the eastern Anatolian homeland of the Armenians through a  genocidal extermination. This genocide was to insure that Turks exclusively ruled over the geographic area today called the Republic of Turkey. The  result: 1.5 million murdered, 30 billion dollars of Armenian property stolen and plundered. This genocide ended nearly 3,000 years of Armenian civilization on those lands. Today, the Turkish government continues to scrape clean any vestige of a prior Armenian existence on those lands. Today's Turkish governmental policy is to re-write the history of the era, to manufacture distortion and generate excuses for their genocide of the Armenian people. In  the face of refutation ad nauseam, the Turkish Historical Society and cronies  shamelessly continue to deny that any such genocide occurred. This policy  merely demonstrates that in the modern era, genocide is an effective state  policy when it remains un-redressed and un-punished. A crime unpunished is a  crime encouraged. Adolf Hitler took this cue less than 25 years after the  successful genocide of the Armenians.  Turkey claims there was no systematic deportation of Armenians, yet... Armenians were removed from every city, town, and village in the whole of  Turkey! Armenians who resisted deportation and massacre are referred to as  \\\"rebels\\\".  Turkey claims there was no genocide of the Armenians, yet...Turkish population figures today show zero Armenians in eastern Turkey, the Armenian homeland.  Turkey claims Armenians were always a small minority, yet...Turkey claims  Armenians were a \\\"threat\\\".  In a final insult to the victims, the Republic of Turkey sold the bones of  approximately 100,000 murdered Armenians for profit to Europe.  Today, the Turkish government is enjoying the fruits of that genocide. The success of this genocide is hangs over the heads of Turkey's Kurdish population.  The Armenians demand recognition, reparation, return of Armenian land and property lost as a result of this genocide.

Typical posting:  Why have a newsgroup about atheism?  Why do atheists organize in groups?   What is there to discuss?  Response:  Many things are discussed here, including:  * Whether it is reasonable to feign theism in order to avoid upsetting one's   family * Prayer in schools * Discrimination against atheists * Sunday trading laws * The Satanic Child Abuse myth * Whether one should be an overt atheist or 'stay in the closet' * How religious societies prey (sic) on new college students * How to get rid of unwanted proselytizers * Whether religion is a danger to society and/or the individual * Why people become atheists  Of course, inevitably alt.atheism tends to attract evangelical Christians looking for someone to convert.  Most readers of the newsgroup don't  want to be preached to, although a few seem to derive perverse pleasure  from tearing apart particularly ill-considered or uninformed postings.  ------------------------------  Subject: Hitler was an atheist!  Typical posting:  Hitler was an atheist, and look at what he did!  Response:  Adolf Hitler was emphatically not an atheist.  As he said himself:     The folkish-minded man, in particular, has the sacred duty, each in    his own denomination, of making _people_stop_just_talking_    superficially_of_God's_will,_and_actually_fulfill_God's_will,_and_    not_let_God's_word_be_desecrated._[orig. ital.]     For God's will gave men their form, their essence, and their    abilities.  Anyone who destroys His work is declaring war on the    Lord's creation, the divine will.  Therefore, let every man be    active, each in his own denomination if you please, and let every    man take it as his first and most sacred duty to oppose anyone who    in his activity by word or deed steps outside the confines of his    religious community and tries to butt into the other.     [...]     Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will    of the Almighty Creator: _by_defending_myself_against_the_Jew,_I_am_    fighting_for_the_work_of_the_Lord._[orig. ital.]            -- Adolf Hitler, from \\\"Mein Kampf\\\", trans. Ralph Mannheim.  Of course, someone bad believing something does not make that belief wrong.  It's also entirely possible that Hitler was lying when he claimed  to believe in God.  We certainly can't conclude that he's an atheist,  though.  ------------------------------  Subject: The Bible proves it  Typical posting:  In the Bible it says that...  Response:  Most of the readers of alt.atheism feel that the Bible is of questionable accuracy, as it was written thousands of years ago by many authors who were recording oral tradition that existed many years before.  Thus, any claimed 'truth' in it is of questionable legitimacy.  This isn't to say that The Bible has no truth in it; simply that any truth must be examined before being accepted.  Many of the readers of this group also feel that because any passage is subject to \\\"interpretation\\\", any claim that a passage 'means' one thing and one thing only is not legitimate.  Note that this feeling tends to extend to other books.  It is also remarkable to many atheists that theists tend to ignore other equally plausible religious books in favour of those of their own religion.  ------------------------------  Subject: Pascal's Wager  Typical posting:  If you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing -- but if you don't believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you will go to hell. Therefore it is foolish to be an atheist.  Response:  This argument is known as Pascal's Wager.  It has several flaws.  Firstly, it does not indicate which religion to follow.  Indeed, there are many mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out there.  This is often described as the \\\"avoiding the wrong hell\\\" problem.  If a person is a follower of religion X, he may end up in religion Y's version of hell.  Secondly, the statement that \\\"If you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing\\\" is not true.  Suppose you're believing in the wrong God -- the true God might punish you for your foolishness. Consider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine in favour of prayer.  Another flaw in the argument is that it is based on the assumption that  the two possibilities are equally likely -- or at least, that they are of  comparable likelihood.  If, in fact, the possibility of there being a God  is close to zero, the argument becomes much less persuasive.  So sadly the argument is only likely to convince those who believe already.  Also, many feel that for intellectually honest people, belief is based on  evidence, with some amount of intuition.  It is not a matter of will or  cost-benefit analysis.  Formally speaking, the argument consists of four statements:    1. One does not know whether God exists.   2. Not believing in God is bad for one's eternal soul if God does      exist.   3. Believing in God is of no consequence if God does not exist.   4. Therefore it is in one's interest to believe in God.  There are two approaches to the argument.  The first is to view 1 as an assumption, and 2 as a consequence of it.  One problem with this approach, in the abstract, is that it creates information from no information.  This is considered invalid in information theory.  Statement 1 indicates one has no information about God -- but statement 2 indicates that beneficial information can be gained from the absolute lack of information about God.  This violates information entropy -- information has been extracted from no information, at no \\\"cost\\\".  The alternative approach is to claim that 1 and 2 are both assumptions.  The problem with this is that 2 is then basically an assumption which states the Christian position, and only a Christian will agree with that assumption. The argument thus collapses to \\\"If you are a Christian, it is in your interests to believe in God\\\" -- a rather vacuous tautology, and not the way Pascal intended the argument to be viewed.  The biggest reason why Pascal's wager is a failure is that if God is omniscient he will certainly know who really believes and who believes as a wager.  He will spurn the latter... assuming he actually cares at all whether people believe in him.  ------------------------------  Subject: What is Occam's Razor?  Typical posting:  People keep talking about Occam's Razor.  What is it?  Response:  William of Occam formulated a principle which has become known as Occam's  Razor.  In its original form, it said \\\"Do not multiply entities  unnecessarily.\\\"  That is, if you can explain something without supposing the existence of some entity, then do so.  Nowadays when people refer to Occam's Razor, they generally express it  more generally, for example as \\\"Take the simplest solution\\\".  The relevance to atheism is that we can look at two possible explanations  for what we see around us:  1. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, which came into being as a result of natural processes.  2. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, and  there is also a God who created the universe.  Clearly this God must be  of non-zero complexity.  Given that both explanations fit the facts, Occam's Razor might suggest  that we should take the simpler of the two -- solution number one. Unfortunately, some argue that there is a third even more simple solution:  3. There isn't an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there.   We just imagine that there is.  This third option leads us logically towards solipsism, which many people  find unacceptable.   ------------------------------  Subject: Why it's good to believe in Jesus  Typical posting:  I want to tell people about the virtues and benefits of my religion.  Response:  Preaching is not appreciated.  Feel free to talk about your religion, but please do not write postings that are on a \\\"conversion\\\" theme.  Such postings do not belong on alt.atheism and will be rejected from alt.atheism.moderated (try the newsgroup talk.religion.misc).  You would doubtless not welcome postings from atheists to your favourite newsgroup in an attempt to convert you; please do unto others as you would have them do unto you!  Often theists make their basic claims about God in the form of lengthy analogies or parables.  Be aware that atheists have heard of God and know the basic claims about him; if the sole purpose of your parable is to tell atheists that God exists and brings salvation, you may as well not post it, since it tells us nothing we have not been told before.  ------------------------------  Subject: Why I know that God exists  Typical posting:  I *know* from personal experience and prayer that God exists.  Response:  Just as many theists have personal evidence that the being they worship exists, so many atheists have personal evidence that such beings do not exist.  That evidence varies from person to person.  Furthermore, without wishing to dismiss your evidence out of hand, many people have claimed all kinds of unlikely things -- that they have been abducted by UFOs, visited by the ghost of Elvis, and so on.  ------------------------------  Subject: Einstein and \\\"God does not play dice\\\"  Typical posting:  Albert Einstein believed in God.  Do you think you're cleverer than him?  Response:  Einstein did once comment that \\\"God does not play dice [with the universe]\\\".  This quotation is commonly mentioned to show that Einstein believed in the Christian God.  Used this way, it is out of context; it refers to Einstein's refusal to accept the uncertainties indicated by quantum theory. Furthermore, Einstein's religious background was Jewish rather than Christian.  A better quotation showing what Einstein thought about God is the following: \\\"I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists, not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings.\\\"  Einstein was unable to accept Quantum Theory because of his belief in an objective, orderly reality; a reality which would not be subject to random events and which would not be dependent upon the observer.  He believed that QM was incomplete, and that a better theory would have no need for statistical interpretations.  So far no such better theory has been found, and much evidence suggests that it never will be.  A longer quote from Einstein appears in \\\"Science, Philosophy, and Religion, A Symposium\\\", published by the Conference on Science, Philosophy and Religion in Their Relation to the Democratic Way of Life, Inc., New York, 1941.  In    \\\"The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events    the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side    of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature.  For him    neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an    independent cause of natural events.  To be sure, the doctrine of a    personal God interfering with natural events could never be    *refuted* [italics his], in the real sense, by science, for this    doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific    knowledge has not yet been able to set foot.     But I am convinced that such behavior on the part of representatives    of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal.  For a doctrine    which is to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark,    will of necessity lose its effect on mankind, with incalculable harm    to human progress.  In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers    of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal    God, that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past    placed such vast power in the hands of priests.  In their labors they    will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable    of cultivating the Good, the True, and the Beautiful in humanity    itself.  This is, to be sure, a more difficult but an incomparably    more worthy task...\\\"     \\\"It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religous convictions,    a lie which is being systematically repeated.  I do not believe in a    personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly.    If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the    unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our    science can reveal it.\\\"  The latter quote is from \\\"Albert Einstein: The Human Side\\\", edited by Helen  Dukas and Banesh Hoffman, and published by Princeton University Press.   Also from the same book:    \\\"I do not believe in immortality of the individual, and I consider ethics    to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind     it.\\\"  Of course, the fact that Einstein chose not to believe in Christianity does  not in itself imply that Christianity is false.  ------------------------------  Subject: Everyone worships something  Typical posting:  Everyone worships something, whether it's money, power or God.  Response:  If that is true, everyone is a polytheist.  Theists care just as much about those things that atheists care about.  If the atheists' reactions to (for example) their families amount to worship then so do the theists'.  ------------------------------  Subject: Why there must be a causeless cause  Typical posting:  Sets of integers that have a lower bound each have a smallest member, so chains of causes must all have a first element, a causeless cause.  Response:  The set of real numbers greater than zero has a definite lower bound, but has no smallest member.  Further, even if it is true that there must be a causeless cause, that does not imply that that cause must be a conscious supernatural entity, and especially not that any such entity must match the description favoured by any particular religion.  ------------------------------  Subject: The universe is so complex it must have been designed  Typical posting:  The presence of design in the universe proves there is a God.  Surely you don't think all this appeared here just by chance?  Response:  This is known as the Argument From Design.  It is a matter of dispute whether there is any element of design in the universe. Those who believe that the complexity and diversity of living creatures on the earth is evidence of a creator are best advised to read the newsgroup talk.origins for a while.  There is insufficient space to summarize both sides of that debate here. However, the conclusion is that there is no scientific evidence in favour of so-called Scientific Creationism. Furthermore, there is much evidence, observation and theory that can explain many of the complexities of the universe and life on earth.  The origin of the Argument by Design is a feeling that the existence of something as incredibly intricate as, say, a human is so improbable that surely it can't have come about by chance; that surely there must be some  external intelligence directing things so that humans come from the chaos deliberately.  But if human intelligence is so improbable, surely the existence of a mind capable of fashioning an entire universe complete with conscious beings must be immeasurably more unlikely?  The approach used to argue in favour of the existence of a creator can be turned around and applied to the Creationist position.  This leads us to the familiar theme of \\\"If a creator created the universe, what created the creator?\\\", but with the addition of spiralling  improbability.  The only way out is to declare that the creator was not created and just \\\"is\\\" (or \\\"was\\\").  From here we might as well ask what is wrong with saying that the universe just \\\"is\\\" without introducing a creator?  Indeed Stephen Hawking, in his book \\\"A Brief History of Time\\\", explains his theory that the universe is closed and finite in extent, with no beginning or end.  The Argument From Design is often stated by analogy, in the so-called  Watchmaker Argument.  One is asked to imagine that one has found a watch on the beach.  Does one assume that it was created by a watchmaker, or that it evolved naturally?  Of course one assumes a watchmaker.  Yet like the  watch, the universe is intricate and complex; so, the argument goes, the  universe too must have a creator.  The Watchmaker analogy suffers from three particular flaws, over and above  those common to all Arguments By Design.  Firstly, a watchmaker creates  watches from pre-existing materials, whereas God is claimed to have  created the universe from nothing.  These two sorts of creation are  clearly fundamentally different, and the analogy is therefore rather weak.  Secondly, a watchmaker makes watches, but there are many other things in  the world.  If we walked further along the beach and found a nuclear  reactor, we wouldn't assume it was created by the watchmaker.  The argument  would therefore suggest a multitude of creators, each responsible for a  different part of creation.  Finally, in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that  the watch is not part of nature because it is ordered, and therefore  stands out from the randomness of nature.  Yet in the second part of the  argument, we start from the position that the universe is obviously not  random, but shows elements of order.  The Watchmaker argument is thus  internally inconsistent.  ------------------------------  Subject: Independent evidence that the Bible is true  Typical posting:  The events of the New Testament are confirmed by independent documentary evidence.  For example...  Response:  The writings of Josephus are often mentioned as independent documentary evidence.  Early versions of Josephus's work are thought not to have mentioned Jesus or James; the extant version discusses John in a non-Christian context.  Many scholars believe that the original mentioned Jesus and James in passing, but that this was expanded by Christian copyists.  Several \\\"reconstructions\\\" of the original text have been published to this effect.  Much information appears in the Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius (about 320 C.E.).  It is worthless as historical material because of the deliberate falsification of the wily Eusebius who is generally acknowledged as 'the first thoroughly dishonest historian of antiquity.' It is Eusebius who is generally given the title of authorship for this material.  Aside from the New Testament, the biographical information about Jesus is more well-documented.  For further information, please consult the Frequently Asked Questions file for the newsgroup soc.religion.christian.  ------------------------------  Subject: Godel's Incompleteness Theorem  Typical posting:  Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible for the Bible to be both true and complete.  Response:  Godel's First Incompleteness Theorem says that in any consistent formal  system which is sufficiently expressive that it can model ordinary  arithmetic, one can formulate expressions which can never be proven to be  valid or invalid ('true' or 'false') within that formal system.  (Technically speaking, the system must also be recursive; that is, there must be a decision procedure for determining whether a given string is an axiom within the formal  system.)  Essentially, all such systems can formulate what is known as a \\\"Liar  Paradox.\\\"  The classic Liar Paradox sentence in ordinary English is \\\"This  sentence is false.\\\"  Note that if a proposition is undecidable, the formal  system cannot even deduce that it is undecidable.  The logic used in theological discussions is rarely well defined, so claims that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible to prove or disprove) the existence of God are worthless in isolation.  One can trivially define a formal system in which it is possible to prove the existence of God, simply by having the existence of God stated as an axiom.  This is unlikely to be viewed by atheists as a convincing proof, however.  It may be possible to succeed in producing a formal system built on axioms that both atheists and theists agree with.  It may then be possible to show that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem holds for that system.  However, that would still not demonstrate that it is impossible to prove that God exists within the system.  Furthermore, it certainly wouldn't tell us anything about whether it is possible to prove the existence of God generally.  Note also that all of these hypothetical formal systems tell us nothing about the actual existence of God; the formal systems are just abstractions.  Another frequent claim is that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that a religious text (the Bible, the Book of Mormon or whatever) cannot be both consistent and universally applicable. Religious texts are not formal systems, so such claims are nonsense.  ------------------------------  Subject: George Bush on atheism and patriotism  Typical posting:  Did George Bush really say that atheists should not be considered citizens?  Response:  The following exchange took place at the Chicago airport between Robert I. Sherman of American Atheist Press and George Bush, on August 27 1988. Sherman is a fully accredited reporter, and was present by invitation as a member of the press corps.  The Republican presidential nominee was there to announce federal disaster relief for Illinois.  The discussion turned to the presidential primary:   RS: \\\"What will you do to win the votes of Americans who are atheists?\\\"   GB: \\\"I guess I'm pretty weak in the atheist community.  Faith in       God is important to me.\\\"   RS: \\\"Surely you recognize the equal citizenship and patriotism of       Americans who are atheists?\\\"   GB: \\\"No, I don't know that atheists should be considered as citizens,       nor should they be considered patriots.  This is one nation under       God.\\\"   RS: \\\"Do you support as a sound constitutional principle the separation       of state and church?\\\"   GB: \\\"Yes, I support the separation of church and state.  I'm just not       very high on atheists.\\\"  UPI reported on May 8, 1989, that various atheist organizations were still angry over the remarks.  The exchange appeared in the Boulder Daily Camera on Monday February 27, 1989.  It can also be found in \\\"Free Enquiry\\\" magazine, Fall 1988 issue, Volume 8, Number 4, page 16.  On October 29, 1988, Mr. Sherman had a confrontation with Ed Murnane, cochairman of the Bush-Quayle '88 Illinois campaign.  This concerned a lawsuit Mr. Sherman had filed to stop the Community Consolidated School District 21 (Chicago, Illinois) from forcing his first-grade Atheist son to pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States as \\\"one nation under God\\\" (Bush's phrase).  The following conversation took place:    RS: \\\"American Atheists filed the Pledge of Allegiance lawsuit yesterday.       Does the Bush campaign have an official response to this filing?\\\"    EM: \\\"It's bullshit.\\\"    RS: \\\"What is bullshit?\\\"    EM: \\\"Everything that American Atheists does, Rob, is bullshit.\\\"    RS: \\\"Thank you for telling me what the official position of the Bush       campaign is on this issue.\\\"   EM: \\\"You're welcome.\\\"  After Bush's election, American Atheists wrote to Bush asking him to retract his statement.  On February 21st 1989, C. Boyden Gray, Counsel to the President, replied on White House stationery that Bush substantively stood by    \\\"As you are aware, the President is a religious man who neither supports    atheism nor believes that atheism should be unnecessarily encouraged or    supported by the government.\\\"  For further information, contact American Atheist Veterans at the American Atheist Press's Cameron Road address.  ------------------------------  Subject: I know where hell is!  Typical posting:  I know where Hell is!  Hell is in Norway!  Response:  There are several towns called \\\"Hell\\\" in various countries around the world, including Norway and the USA.  Whilst this information is mildly amusing the first time one hears it, readers of alt.atheism are now  getting pretty fed up with hearing it every week.  ------------------------------  Subject: Biblical contradictions wanted  Typical posting:  Does anyone have a list of Biblical contradictions?  Response:   American Atheist Press publish an atheist's handbook detailing Biblical contradictions. See the accompanying posting on Atheist Resources for details.  There is a file containing some Biblical contradictions available from the archive-server@mantis.co.uk. See the contacts file for more information.  ------------------------------  Subject: The USA is a Christian nation  Typical posting:  Because of the religious beliefs of the founding fathers, shouldn't the United States be considered a Christian nation?  Response:  Based upon the writings of several important founding fathers, it is clear that they never intended the US to be a Christian nation.  Here are some quotes; there are many more.    \\\"What influence, in fact, have ecclesiastical establishments had on society?    In some instances they have been seen to erect a spiritual tyranny on the    ruins of the civil authority; on many instances they have been seen    upholding the thrones of political tyranny; in no instance have they been    the guardians of the liberties of the people.  Rulers who wish to subvert    the public liberty may have found an established clergy convenient    auxiliaries.

Consider what calamities that engine of grief has produced!\\\"       - John Adams, in a letter to Thomas Jefferson    \\\"History I believe furnishes no example of a priest-ridden people    maintaining a free civil government.  This marks the lowest grade of    ignorance, of which their political as well as religious leaders will    always avail themselves for their own purpose.\\\"        - Thomas Jefferson to Baron von Humboldt, 1813    \\\"I cannot conceive otherwise than that He, the Infinite Father, expects or    requires no worship or praise from us, but that He is even infinitely    above it.\\\"        - Benjamin Franklin, from \\\"Articles of Belief and Acts of Religion\\\",         Nov. 20, 1728  ------------------------------  Subject: The USA is not a Christian nation  Typical posting:  Is it true that George Washington said that the United States is not in any sense founded upon the Christian religion?  Response:  No.  The quotation often given is in fact from Article XI of the 1797 Treaty of Tripoli (8 Stat 154, Treaty Series 358):     Article 11     As the government of the United States of America is not in any sense    founded on the Christian Religion, -- as it has in itself no character of    enmity against the laws, religion or tranquility of Musselmen, -- and as    the said States never have entered into any war or act of hostility    against any Mehomitan nation, it is declared by the parties that no    pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption    of the harmony existing between the two countries.  The text may be found in the Congressional Record or in treaty collections such as Charles Bevans' \\\"Treaties and Other International Agreements of the United States of America 1776-1949\\\", vol. 11 (pp. 1070-1080).  The English text of the Treaty of Tripoli was approved by the U.S. Senate on June 7, 1797 and ratified by President John Adams on June 10, 1797.  It was recently discovered that the Arabic version of the treaty not only lacks the quotation, it lacks Article XI altogether.  The person who translated the Arabic to English was Joel Barlow, Consul General at Algiers, a close friend of Thomas Paine -- and an opponent of Christianity.  It is possible that Barlow made up Article XI, but since there is no Arabic version of that article to be found, it's hard to say.  In 1806 a new Treaty of Tripoli was ratified which no longer contained the quotation. \",\" Catcher is their weakest position, with the possible exception of second base. They have a chance to simultaneously replace their biggest offensive problem spot with a well-above-average offensive player *and* acclimate a highly promising potential star with no pressure on him to carry the team, and they want to play *Olson* and *Berryhill* instead?!   \\\"A catcher's defensive reputation will be inversely proportional to his  recent offensive level of performance.\\\"  Thus, Mickey Tettleton goes (in  the media) from being a no-hit defensive whiz to a slugging thumb-finger  in two short years.

Greg Olson is probably  considered to be a good defensive catcher precisely because he can't hit.    Aren't they the same thing?   Either that or just stupidity.   Of course.   One could make the same sort of argument in other cases.  Pete Rose, in pursuing Ty Cobb's record, was a huge gate attraction (and national media magnet).

Early stuff, Egyptian in nature. \",\" I have a question that is a slight variation on the previously mentioned examples that perhaps people could give me some pointers on (it has been a couple of years since my Con Law class in college so I hope I am not missing something obvious here...)  Basic Scenario:   I set up a bbs that uses public-key encryption and encryption of  files on disk.  The general setup is designed so that when users   connect they send a private key encrypted using the system public  key and the user's public-private keypair is used to wrap the  one-time session keys used for encrypting the files on disk.  The  result of this is that even if I reveal the system private key it  is impossible for anyone to gain access to the files stored on the  machine.  What is possible is for someone to use the revealed  system private key to entice users into revealing thier personal  private keys during the authentication sequence.  Questions:   Does the fact that the system private key does not provide any  information useful for a search give me any protection as far as  being coerced to reveal the key?  (I doubt it myself..)   It seems providing the system private key does not mean that I am  assisting in \\\"entrapment\\\" (the users would send thier key anyway  and are not being enticed into doing something they would not  otherwise do) but is there any other hook that can be used?   Would the user private-key enticement require wiretap approval?  Any answers or general musings on the subject would be appreciated...  jim\",\"The media is beating the incident at Dodger Stadium on Wednesday to death, but I haven't seen anything in rsb yet.  Gerald Perry of the Cardinals pinch hit in the eighth inning with two on and his club down by a run.  He stroked a line drive into the right field corner.  The ball cleared the three-foot high fence and went into the crowd.  Darryl, racing over from right center, got to the spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence, but he missed the ball.  A fan sitting in the front row, wearing a mitt, reached up and caught the ball.  Home run.  Now I've seen the replay several times and I have concluded that Darryl missed the ball, and that the fan's glove was essentially behind Darryl's.  Several Dodger fans with seats in the immediate vicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with Strawberry.  What cannot be disputed, however, is that the fan who caught the ball never took his eye off it;  he was oblivious to where the fielder was playing.  He was also quite exuberant as soon as he realized he had made the catch.  That exuberance disappeared immediately, however, when Strawberry went into a tirade at the man.  All reports indicate he used a lot of profanity and accused the man of interference, and therefore of costing the Dodgers a game.  Shortly afterwards other fans hurled food and beverages toward the man who made the catch.  Dodger Stadium officials started to remove him from the park, but then relented and just relocated him to another area.  In an interview after the game, Lasorda blamed the fan for the loss.  Strawberry also went into a tirade about how the fans are stupid and they don't care about  winning.  L.A. Times columnists similarly blasted the man who made the catch.  Before each Dodger game the public address announcer makes a speech wherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls that are hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any  that are in the field of play.  Was the fan wrong?  Should he have been more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility of interference?  Or was he human and just reacting?  By the way, he is a season ticket holder and on his request the Dodgers have relocated his seats to another area of the Stadium where future interference is impossible.  Others have questioned why Darryl should be so concerned with what the fan did when he has a grand total of 1 rbi through the first nine games.  I question what he was doing in right center with a left-handed pull hitter up and the game on the line.  Had he been closer to the play, he certainly would have had a much better chance of catching the ball.  But I guess the big debate continues as to what are the responsibilities of the fan.    -- The Beastmaster   \",\"Hi folks.

I don't happen to have my SAE manual handy, but oil viscosity in general _decreases_ with temperature.  The SAE numbers are based on a `typical' curve that oils used to all have, running from (say) the viscosity of a room-temperature 90-weight at 0C, down to (say) that of a room-temperature  5-weight at 20C, for a typical 40-weight oil.  Oils that are designed for operation in `normal' temperatures just have a weight specification.  Oils that are designed for operation in exceedingly cold temperatures have a `W' tacked on the end, so in winter in a cold place, you'd stick 10W in your car in the winter and 40 in it in the summer, to approximate the appropriate viscosity throughout the year.  Modern multi-viscosity oils change viscosity much less with temperature. As a result, their viscosity graphs cross over several curves.  A multi-vis specification pegs the curve at two temperatures, a `normal' operating temperature and a `cold' one (though I can't remember the numbers...).  In any event, the weights do indicate a significant difference.  Remember that your engine is temperature-regulated (by the thermostat and radiator or air fins) most of the time -- unless you overheat it or something.  Any weight of oil is better than no oil, or than very old, carbonized oil.  Thin oil won't (in general) lubricate as well at temperature, thicker oil will (like a 20W50) will lubricate better at temperature,  but not as well during startup, when most engine wear occurs.    If you're planning on making long drives, the 20W50 is probably fine (esp. in the summer) in your 10W40 car.  But if you're making short drives, stick to the 10W40.  \",\"In response to a lot of email I've gotten, I need to clarify my position.  I am not in favor of paganism.

My point was to distinguish between   (1) intentionally worshipping a pagan deity, and   (2) doing something which may once have had pagan associations, but nowadays is not understood or intended as such.

Avoid things that would plug her up.  Crohn's has no dietary restriction in general.   The feeling obout this has changed in the GI community.  The current feeling is that inflammation is not induced by food.  There is even evidence that patients deprived of food have mucosal atrophy due to lack of stimulation of intestinal growth factors.  There is now interest in providing small amounts of nasogastric feeding to patients on IV nutrition.  But I digress.   Symptoms can be drastically enhanced by food, but not inflammation.   The low residue diet is appropriate for you if you still have obstructions. Again, it is not felt that food causes inflammation.  These foods are avoided because they may get stuck.  I'd go ahead and have the fudge, though ;-)  .  Spencer makes an especially good point in having an observant and informed patient.  Would that many patients be able to tell what causes them problems.  The digestive processing idea is changing, but if a food causes problems, avoid them.  Be sure that the foods are  tested a second time to be sure the food is a real cause.

So     unless the first BIOS 'get date' call after midnight is done by     the DOS 'kernel' (which is the only part of DOS which knows how to     increment the date, the day wrap indication is normally lost. My guess is that Kevin's 'menu' system uses BIOS calls to read the clock (in order to display the time), and is hence the entity which causes the day wrap indication to get lost. Even if the 'menu' system 'notices' the day 'wrap' (which I think is indicated by a non-zero value in AL), there really isn't any particularly good way to tell DOS about it, so that DOS can update the day. The menu system 'should' use DOS calls to get the time, which would cause the DOS 'kernel' to do the BIOS call, and the wrap indicator would hence be processed properly.  Possibly, though, the 'menu' system can't easily use DOS calls for time, because DOS is not reentrant, and perhaps time incrementing ofters occur while the 'menu' system is 'inside' some other DOS call.\",\"From article <1pq6i2$a1f@news.ysu.edu>, by ak296@yfn.ysu.edu (John R.

I am  using X11R4 and Motif 1.1 currently, although I will also be  working with Open Look in the future.       What I need to do is under certain circumstances prevent the  user from switching from one window of the application to  another window.  Let's say, for example, that Window A is on top  of Window B in the window hierarchy.  Normally, if the user clicks  the mouse in Window B it will be brought to the top of the  window hierarchy and placed on top of Window A.  Under certain  circumstances if the user clicks the mouse in Window B I need to  beep and prevent Window B from being raised on top of Window  A.        From the research and testing I've done so far, it appears that  this window ordering is handled by the window manager, in this  case Motif.  I haven't found any way to override this default  processing through standard X Window functions.  I can tell  when this switching occurs through focus change and mapping  notify events, but I can't find any way to tell Motif not to make the  switch.        The temporary solution I've currently come up with is very  kludgy but it partially works.  When I detect such a window switch  in those cases when the switch is not allowed, I manually force  the formerly top window back on top with an XRaiseWindow call  and beep with the XBell function.  This provides the necessary  functionality but looks ugly when the windows switch places  twice.        Does anyone know how I can tell Motif (or preferably *any*  window manager) when I don't want the window order switch to  actually take place?  Respond either by e-mail or posting to this  newsgroup.  Cheers....

People might quibble about what \\\"intrinsically\\\" means but the reason we are sinners is because we do not behave as good as we are. The message of Christ is that each of us are not only good, but great, that we can approach perfection, albeit perhaps through a  different technique than you claim Buddhism teaches. Because we do not realize our greatness, we sin. Peter had no problem walking  on water until a little doubt crept in.  Doesn't David ask in the 8th Psalm \\\"what is man that you [God]  should care for him, but you have made him just a little lower  than the angels\\\"?  I probably exagerate in my mind what a scrawny little kid David was, just as I probably exagerate what a gigantic monster Goliath was, but David's power easily defeated Goliath's.  Remember the rich young man who comes up to Jesus and asks what he can do to enter the Kingdom, Jesus says follow the commandments. I always picture the smug look on his face as he says he's done that his whole life, probably anticipating an \\\"attaboy\\\" from the  Messiah. Instead Jesus gives him a harder task, sell everything and follow Him. Jesus is raising the bar. The desciples say how can anyone do this if it's so hard even for rich people. Jesus says anyone can do it, with God's help.  Jesus says not only can we avoid killing people, we can avoid getting angry at people. Not only can we avoid committing adultery, we can control our own desires.   I realize this was not your main point, but I wonder how other people see this.    (Please forgive any generalizations I am about to make.)  Your point about how \\\"hard\\\" other religions are is a good one, just  as your \\\"Parting Question\\\" is a tough question. I think that Muslims worship the same God as I do, we can learn from their name \\\"submission\\\". Hindus and Buddhists and Taoists, etc. claim that \\\"God\\\" is impersonal.  Is God personal or impersonal? I say yes, but if I think a little more my answer is whichever is greater. I think it is greater  to be a personal entity, with an individual consciousness, but you're right that that might be a cultural bias. If I think more I must admit that God's personal nature is as far beyond my conception as His impersonal nature is beyond the Hindu's conception. If somehow Jesus could fit into Hindu cosmology then maybe I wouldn't have a problem, though that is hard to imagine.

When he first logs on (via xdm), he has a single xterm window appear with the mwm window manager running.  In this configuration, X windows applications (particularly xdvi) work fine.  However, if he opens up a second xterm application, suddenly xdvi cannot start in either window, giving the error: Unable to load ISO 8859-1 font.     The only difference between the two xterm windows is that the initial one references a different name in the Xsession file, with prettier colours and other slight changes.  Further investigation shows that only opening a default xterm causes this behaviour, and more significant, ALL X applications can no longer load any fonts if they are invoked from the command line in either window.  If I start the xterm with a different font (using the -fn option), no problems.  It would seem that the default xterm is loading a font which somehow causes the server to lose all of its fonts.  Note: xlsfonts in either window shows all of the fonts available, so there doesn't appear to be a problem in the font directories/hash-tables.

Thus it's not necessary to show that no Christian ever suffered for believing in the Resurrection.  Rather the issue is whether those who witnessed it did.

No fun, but I must have met the minority then. And \\\"given by god\\\" refers to any action whereby a god god causes or better effects something.     Rob, I am not intimate with Jewish theology, but I understand that you are a Messianic Jew. Correct me if I am wrong, but it appears that the views of Messianic Jews on metaphysics is different to that of the majority of Jews. While Jewish theology overall is quite distinct from the Christianic god views, I have heard that it is possible for Jews to attribute evil to their god, an no-no for Christians, the Bible is still seen as effect of the interaction of some god with man.     (Deletion)   The context was metaphysics, even when the process of adapting the commandments is not transcendent, the justification of the process lie in metaphysic specualtion. I wonder how you break out of the shackles of having metaphysics in your system.     (Deletion)   Is is in a book that commands to commit genocide among other reprehensible deeds. The context is repulsive, and it is foul play, IMO, to invoke some relatively enlightened passages as an example for the content of the whole book.     (Big deletion)   No, not the interpretation of some laws, but the interpretation of the bible. As in the example that Sodom and Gomorrha mean argue with god. The whole idea that it is metaphorically and yet allows you to argue with a god (whatever that means, that alone is a theo- logic question) is proof of a theology used.       It is an important question in the light of what for instance the passage witrh Sodom and Gomorrha means. Either there is some connection between the text, the fact that it exists, and your interpretation of it, or it is purely arbitrary.. Further, the question is why is has one to carry the burden of Biblical texts when one could simply write other books that convey the message better. You might answer that one can't becuase  some peculiar Biblical information might be lost, but that holds true of every other book, and the question remains why has the Bible still a special place? Can't it be replaced somehow? Is it ok to bargain the dangerous content of the Bible against some other message that is included as well?     (Deletion)   Sorry, but there are worse systems does not say anything about if one could not have a better system.   (Deletion)   If we read two stories in the Bible, one that god commands people to kill children for being idolaters and another where god kills children directly, what is more important to resolve, the message that children are to be killed or if it has  to be done by god?     And the argument you have given is a fallacy, while it may not be important in the context you have given to find out if god is corporeal or not, it can be crucial in other questions. Religious believers resolve contradictions with that they choose one of the possibilities given in an arbitrary way, and have the advantage of being able to attribute their decision to some god.\",\"Yes, there are serveral programs which can convert font files (eq the Borland fonts) to objects consisting of spheres, cones etc.  I've used a program (forgot its name/place, but i can look for it) which converted these Borland fonts to three different raytracers.

If you want to look at non-christian sources try Alvin Toffler as the perennial optimist.  His views while blatently non christian explore where technology may be going.   This is regardless of technology.

Regards  David\",\"        Hmmm... people in the americas before the time of Christ, children who die young, etc. ?        But of course, the popular conception of hell (correct or incorrect) is something akin to eternal perpetuation of consciousness, at the very least.       I think a good number of atheists believe there is nothing beyond  bodily death, but it is simply an abuse of language to say they believe they're going to hell. They believe they're going to _die_. Understand that you've turned Hell into a verb. Using the same logic, it also follows that all animals are 'going to Hell.' Are you sure this is what you want to say? (presumably animals don't have the opportunity to get to heaven, but this still doesn't change the fact that they're going to Hell (die a final death))     I don't claim to know whether or not there is an afterlife of _some_ sort, but if Hell is as you described (final death, and not eternal perpetuation of consciousness) it will be true that there will never be a moment when I am aware of my non-existence.  (assuming I 'go to Hell' and not to Heaven) In other words, I'll never know I'm dead. Hmmm...         Ever hear people say of a loved one who was ill, and has died:  \\\"At least she's not suffering any more; She's in Heaven now.\\\" ?      Consider the following statement:  \\\"At least she's not suffering any more; She's in Hell now.\\\"      The above statement sounds odd, but according to your definition of Hell,  it would be a true statement. The person in Hell would not be suffering.  Granted, they wouldn't be *anything* (wouldn't be having any conscious experience whatsoever).       You say Hell (death) is eternal. However, this loses its meaning  to a dead person. And to me, it seems that the threat of some sort  of eternal punishment only makes sense/has force if one expects to be conscious throughout this eternity.       Many atheists believe that the thirst for an afterlife is simply the product of propaganda (\\\"Friend, do you want the FREE gift of e-ternal life?\\\" It's my understanding that the early jews did not believe in an afterlife. Can anyone back me up on this?) combined with the survival instinct all animals share. The difference is we have consciousness, and once we get the idea of eternal life drilled into our brains, we then desire a sort of super-survival.          That would depend on what Heaven is like. If God is a King, and  an eternity in heaven consists of giving thanks and praise to the King, I might opt for Hell. I read a lovely account of a missionary trying to convert Eskimos to Christianity in the book _The Illusion of Immortality_ by Corliss Lamont. The missionary started to speak about Heaven.  \\\"Are there seals in heaven? Will we be able to go hunting?\\\" asked an Eskimo. The missionary said no. The group of Eskimos then said something to the effect of, \\\"Well what good is your Heaven if there's no hunting? Scram.\\\" I highly recommend the above book (IOI) to anyone who wants an account of the other side of the immortality coin (that there is no  immortality).

Cheers, Kent\",\"WASHINGTON (UPI) -- A senior State Department official on Tuesday ruled out any softening of U.S. attitudes toward Iraq but said relations with Iran's Islamic regime could improve substantially if that government disassociates itself from international terrorism.  ``Despite the name-calling and the harsh rhetoric from across the Gulf, despite all this, we do not take a position of permanent hostility towards the Islamic Republic of Iran,'' David Mack, deputy assistant secretary for Near Eastern Affairs, said.  The primary U.S. objection is ``Iran's international behaviour'' which includes ``extending support of violence'' to disrupt the Arab Israeli peace process and its rapid build-up of dangerous weapons.  Mack said ``Iran could contribute to regional stability and peace but first it is to end the behaviour which threatens this area.''  Mack spoke at the U.S.-GCC business conference aimed at promoting Gulf-American trade. He said the ``Middle East will be an item very high on the agenda of the U.S. administration.''  The importance of the Gulf is underlined by Secretary of State Warren Christoper's visit last year to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait before anywhere else in the world, Mack said. He added that the U.S. has no long-term plan to station troops in the Gulf.  Mack also insisted that the Clinton administration will continue to pressure Iraq to ``comply with all the U.N. Security resolutions.''  ``As long as Iraq is ruled by Saddam Hussein we do not expect compliance,'' Mack told delegates. \",\" So why do I read in the papers that the Qumram texts had \\\"different versions\\\" of some OT texts.

Let's go out  to the cherry blossoms.  We'll do like the President.              Q   Is the stimulus package dead?               MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely not.                Q   Can you tell us more about the Dole talks?  You  said it was a good visit, but no compromise.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.  The President had a good talk  with Senator Dole last night.  I think that as we said before, there  were no specific compromises on either side, although it was a very  good discussion about the jobs package and about other issues as  well.  As you know, the President first called Senator Dole I believe  Tuesday night to talk about the Russian aid package.  They did not  speak -- Senator Dole called him back Wednesday morning -- when the  President was out.  Instead he spoke with Tony Lake, and at the close  of that conversation, indicated that he wanted to speak to the  President about the jobs and stimulus package.  They finally talked  about that yesterday afternoon.              At the close of that discussion they said that they  would have another talk last night, which they did, when the Senator  was up in New Hampshire.  And although there were no specific  compromises made on either side, they did say that they would  continue to have some discussions.  And that's where we are.              Q   Well, who is giving in?  Where is it standing --are  both making concessions?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know that it's at that  phase.  No compromise has been made.  As the President has said  consistently, he intends to come forward with an adjusted package.   He believes in the package, but he believes that if it's going to  take adjustments to get the minority to release it, he's willing to  make those adjustments.              Q   On the subject of a VAT --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, boy.              Q   Can we stay on this for one more minute?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sure.              Q   We have a problem with the five minutes --              Q   I know no decisions have been made, but what would  lead the health group to believe that a VAT might be necessary?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sorry, Andrea, I'm not going to go  down that road.  No decisions have been made.  As the President said  this morning, a number of groups, a number of members of Congress, a  number of other organizations have recommended that this be looked  at.  The working group is looking at it, but no decisions have been  made.              Q   To follow, have they done that directly through  him?  Have labor and business groups been in touch with the President  about it?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not to my knowledge, although  there's a lot of people who have public decisions in support of the  VAT.  But the President has not made a decision.              Q   At the meetings that he's had with his own task  force advisers, have they discussed the funding issue and what the  possible options would be?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think that that has been  presented for a decision, no.              Q   Not for a decision, but has it been discussed as an  option?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, there are a lot of levels of  briefing.  I do not believe that the VAT has been presented to the  President as, okay, this is something for you to decide on.                Q   You're not saying he didn't know it was being  considered, though, are you?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, he said it's being considered.              Q   He knew that.              Q   But has he discussed that with his advisers?   That's what I'm asking.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has said it's being  considered.  I do not know what level of discussion there has been  over the VAT.  It is something the working groups are looking at.  I  don't even know that it's --              Q   But he didn't say he was considering, did he, at  this stage?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, he is not.  I think we're  getting into something of a metaphysical debate right here.  What is  considered --               Q   Well, he is the one who said, I haven't reviewed  it.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That is true.  That is what I just  repeated.               Q   George, is there any concern here that as a result  of the definite statement he made in February and the promise that if  it were to be considered he'd let us know, and having it trickle out  the way it did, that there may now be the development of a  credibility gap on this issue and others?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think so.  I mean, it is  now public knowledge that this is being considered.              Q   Is he or you at all embarrassed about the absolute  statements that were made from this platform to the effect that it  was off the table and was not being considered, and then to have it  come out not from you people, but --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, wait a second.  It came out  from the administration.  What are you talking about?              Q   What I'm saying is, though, that the President said  he would let us know.               MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.              Q   You people then said -- you said, I believe, that  it's not going to be on the program.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  On March 25th.              Q   On March 25th.               MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Circumstances change.              Q   Well, I understand.  But we have to find that out  by rooting around in the fine print of an interview              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Rooting around -- I know you did do  a very good job there to read the USA Today article.  But this is -- (laughter) -- the Deputy Director of the OMB and the Secretary of  Health and Human Services.  I mean, that is common anytime you guys  write a story that has an unattributed quote from somebody in the  Clinton administration, the headline is -- I'll look at it right  here, and AP story -- \\\"Clinton wants more money for spying.\\\"              Q   What about his remark that if it were being  considered, he'd tell us about it?                MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  And the administration's concerned,  and he'd let you know.              Q   And did he?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.  Absolutely.  What did he say  this morning?              Q   It had to be dragged out of you here yesterday.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It didn't have to be dragged out of  me.  We had the Deputy Director of the OMB, we had the Secretary of  Health of Human Services say it was being considered.  That is his  administration.  That is his administration policy.              Q   Were these authorized trial balloons, or were they  orchestrated leaks?  I mean, what was the --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They were asked questions, they  answered the questions.              Q   You're saying here that it didn't have to be  dragged out, that you more or less made it clear yesterday you were  considering it.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely.  I was very clear.   Painfully clear.              Q   Was there a particular political strategy in making  it clear the administration is considering a new tax increase on tax  day?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, it was just this issue is being  considered.  They were asked if it was being considered; they  answered that it was being considered.              Q   George, The New York Times --              Q   Why do it yesterday?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They were asked.              Q   The New York Times reports today that Secretary  Reich and the chief economist at the Labor Department used apples and  oranges numbers in order to portray last month's unemployment figures  in a way that was supportive of the President's job stimulus bill,  but which turned out to be totally false.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if it was totally  false, but I think -- (laughter) -- the chief economist at the Labor  Department did grant that it was an inappropriate mixing, and they  say that.               Q   The question is, is the President concerned about  behavior that amounts to corrupting government data?  And what's he  doing about it, if so?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The chief economist has said that a  mistake was made, it won't happen again, and that's the end of the  matter.              Q   Isn't that the same information that goes to the  President?              Q   If I could go back to the stimulus package --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  There's two separate pieces of  information.  I think that's where the confusion was.              Q   When did you all first learn about this mistake  that was made?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I read the article this morning.              Q   And as far as you know, is the President aware of  it?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think so.              Q   And was he aware of it before he read about it in  The New York Times?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.  Not to my knowledge.              Q   Did you ever hear about it before this morning?   Anything?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I didn't.              Q   Wasn't the President given an erroneous spin on  this for his own purpose?  For his speeches, for his arguments?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well again, I'm not sure.  Both  statements are true.  What the Labor Department has granted is that  mixing them in one sentence, essentially, was misleading.  They said  it was a mistake.  They said they wouldn't do it again.              Q   Did they drop it -- is this something that you  choose to spin or make an issue of?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Whenever fewer people are out of  work, we're gratified.  But that doesn't take away from the need to  get this jobs package going.              Q   If I could go back to the stimulus package for a  minute.  You said that the President plans to come forward with an  amendment.  Is the timetable still what it was -- that the amendment  would be laid down on Monday and voted on on Tuesday, or did he, in  the conversation with Dole, talk about the possibility of putting  that off for a few more days to give more time for the discussion?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think at this point there's no  changes in the schedule at all.  I don't know that they discussed the  timing like that.              Q   Do you believe that you're closer or getting closer  this week than you were last week?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I believe that we're going  to pass a jobs package.  The President is prepared to make  adjustments in order to get that to happen.  I don't know where the  votes are on cloture at this particular time.  I don't know what's  going to happen until we have a vote.  But the President believes  deeply in this jobs package and wants to get it done.              Q   Has there been any indication that this situation  has changed?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're going to continue to work on  it.  We'll know when the votes are taken.              Q   George, last week you said that there are -- or  various people in the administration were saying that you couldn't go  through Dole, you were going to have to try and go around him because  he was immovable on this subject of a compromise, or at least the  compromise he wanted was not anything like the one that you could  accept.  This week you're talking to him.  Is that because you've  realized that the peeling off effort wasn't going to work?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's because Senator Dole wanted  to talk to the President about the stimulus package.              Q   He initiated the conversation?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.              Q   Secretary Reich this morning said that, in fact,  the President is not willing to compromise on this bill at all.  You  say he's making --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know that that's exactly  what he said.  I think he said he didn't have any indication that  there was any compromises yet or that there would be a compromise,  and the President doesn't want to compromise.  And the President  doesn't want to compromise.  But if he has to make adjustments to get  it through, he will.              Q   Officials here yesterday said that Panetta was  working on a series of adjustments that might be made public before  the actual vote.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's possible.              Q   Today?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure exactly when that will  happen, but I think that it's very possible that we'll come forward  with some sort of a different package, or Senate Democrats will come  forward with some sort of a different package in order to get it  passed.              Q   As we understood his conversations with Dole, the  first one was some discussion of this and I'll get back to you  tonight with some details or some adjustments, or whatever the phrase  is.  Did he offer him some details or some adjustments?                MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it's a question of how  detailed.  I mean, I think they had a general discussion about the  package last night, subsequent to their conversation yesterday  afternoon.  I believe that there will be follow-up discussions today  in the Senate, not necessarily between the President and Senator  Dole.  And let me just reiterate, neither side has made specific  compromises at this date.  When we have something we'll let you know.   And I'm not suggesting that Senator Dole has accepted anything that  we've talked about or that we've offered anything in a hard way.              Q   What are the follow-up discussions if not the  President and Dole?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think Senator Mitchell is going  to talk to Senator Dole.              Q   Is that a threat?  (Laughter.)              Q   Did the President say to Senator Dole, all right,  how about this number as an overall size, or did Dole say to the  President, I can go as high as this?  Did they talk numbers?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think it was a negotiation  in that respect.  It was more of a discussion about their positions.              Q   Did they discuss actual numbers?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not sure.  I know they  talked about the basic outlines of the packages.  I think they talked  about the programs they cared about.  I don't know if they got to the  level of this many x-billion dollars.               Q   Does Dole have to sign off before there is a  package?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, of course not.              Q   Did the White House have anything to do with the  protesters who showed up in New Hampshire today where Senator Dole  was speaking?  Was that in any way organized by --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not to my knowledge, no.              Q   And has the President been in touch with Senators  Kohl or Feingold?                MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think he's talked to them,  no.              Q   George, is the President considering the more  palatable fact of having a national sales tax instead of having the  haves having to continuously pay for the have-nots?  And is he going  to scrap his proposed tax on the privileged few, with the haves  having to pay for the have-nots?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes deeply that  the tax rates on upper income Americans, as he presented in his  budget, should go up.  And I think for the second half of your  question, I'll refer you to my briefing from yesterday.              Q   George, on the subject of accuracy in information,  you suggested the other day that the stimulus package included money  that would solve the water problem in Milwaukee.  Apparently that is  not true.  It's actually waste water money.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's waste water money for  Wisconsin, and some could go to Milwaukee.               Q   But it would not affect the drinking water problem  because it's waste water money, right?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It would affect the water treatment  overall.               Q   But the implication from your statement the other  day was that it would help fix this disease problem in Milwaukee now.   Would you agree that's not the case?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure of the specifics.  I  know that it goes to the overall water treatment in Wisconsin.              Q   A leftover question from this morning, which was,  when did the President find out that the task force was deliberating  on a VAT?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure exactly when.  I just  don't know.  I assume it came up over the last -- certainly between  the time that we had commented on in the past and two days ago.                Q   So sometime since March 25th?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's right.  I don't know  the exact date.              Q   George, the President this morning mentioned that  some labor and business groups are for the VAT tax.  Apparently, the  National Association of Manufacturers talks about perhaps the VAT tax  being okay if it replaces the BTU tax.  So does the President feel  that perhaps this might be in place of some other tax he's proposed,  or is this totally in addition to the other taxes he's already  proposed?                MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we've said all we have to  say about the VAT at this point.  I mean, there's just no -- this is  being considered by the health care working groups, and that is all.   The President hasn't made any further decisions beyond that.               Q   But it would be to finance health care, it wouldn't  be to replace some other tax that finances -- it wouldn't replace the  income tax, for instance?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  There have been no discussions on  that.              Q   In terms of getting a VAT tax through Congress,  Senator Dole's press release today said VAT -- on tax day.  Do you  think -- does it have a chance of getting through Congress?  Would it  have a chance?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I have no idea.               Q   Is that a consideration whether you all put it  forward?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That would become a consideration  if the President were to decide to do it.  It's not in consideration  now.              Q   You said at the beginning of the briefing that  circumstances had changed and that had caused the VAT to now be under  consideration.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, what the President referred to  this morning.  These groups came forward and said this is something  that has to be considered.              Q   Those are the circumstances that have changed?   That's the only difference between now and when he emphatically ruled  it out that groups have asked it to be considered?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's what he said.               Q   Is that true?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.              Q   Was there, in fact, some understanding that sin  taxes would not produce enough money for the health care benefits?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not going to get into the  deliberations.              Q   But, George --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  What the consideration is, as  the President said, groups came forward and said this is something  you ought to consider.  The working groups are looking at it.               Q   Is that the only thing that's changed since his  prior statement and your prior statement on the VAT?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.              Q   Can you explain how those groups -- how that  information got to him that groups wanted it?  Was it just reading  the newspaper or did groups make presentations?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the groups -- as you know,  the health care task force has met with dozens of groups.              Q   But this is the President's knowledge that these  groups had come forward.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he was referring to what  was coming to the working groups.  Obviously, there have also been  published positions in the newspapers.              Q   Have certain groups briefed him on the group's  presentations to them?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if they've briefed him  -- I mean, how detailed the briefings have been.    I know that the  working groups decided to look into this after being pressed by these  groups.              Q   What kind of arguments did the groups make that  were persuasive enough that the President would change the position  that he had enunciated previously?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know, it's just they've had  longstanding positions that this would be a good way to finance  health care.              Q   The President wasn't aware of those longstanding  positions?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He may have been at some level.   Obviously, he's been a governor for a long time and he knows the  basic arguments for and against a VAT tax.              Q   What we're trying to figure out here -- you're  telling us that the only change, the only thing that affected this  change in the President's attitude toward the VAT between February  and now --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President's attitude hasn't  necessarily changed.  I mean, he has not made a decision.              Q   I know, but the President said that it was off the  table.  So did you.  And you're saying that the only thing that's  changed is the positions of these groups, except you're also  describing them as longstanding positions.  I don't see the change.   If these groups haven't had any change in their position that's been  made to the President --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, they've made the  presentations to the health care task force.              Q   There's no relationship at all between the fact  that sin taxes that he had said -- suggested in February that he  favored will not produce enough revenue to finance --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think he ever suggested  that they would produce all the revenue.              Q   Well, he suggested that he thought that those were  appropriate ways to finance health care.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He did say that.  I don't know that  he said anything to refute that.              Q   But, in fact, has the task force discovered that  there wouldn't be enough revenue from those taxes to finance the kind  of core benefits --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't think that the task  force ever suggested that there would.              Q   George, if he advocated a VAT tax, would that break  his promise not to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for his  programs?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't comment on a hypothetical  situation.                 Q   But does that promise -- would that promise not to  raise taxes on the middle class to pay for the programs prevent him  from seeking a VAT tax?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has made no decisions  on the VAT tax.  When he does, we'll tell you and we'll explain the  implications then.              Q   Which specific groups can you cite -- business,  labor or otherwise -- whose recommendations to the health care task  force has prompted this consideration?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't have the specific.  I just  don't have that.              Q   George, can you tell us to what extend these other  alternatives, for instance, the employer tax or the sin taxes or  other financing options are also still on the table and what these  options are?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, as members of the task force  and representatives of the working groups have said, they are looking  at a wide variety of options.  I think that Ira Magaziner said that  there are 20 different options under consideration.  But I'm not  going to comment --              Q   What's the scope --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not going to comment on  them, no.              Q   What's the scope of the need?  How much are you  talking about that has to be produced by one or a combination of the  --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's what the health care task  force is looking at.              Q   Since there's not going to be any briefing on the  Miyazawa visit, two questions:  One, generally what does the  President hope to use that meeting for, but more specifically, is his  task complicated by the Japanese anger over the Vancouver note and  the remark about market access at the press conference?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The Vancouver note?              Q   Does no mean yes.              Q   Yes and no.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I don't know.  I saw the  Prime Minister's press conference where he was asked the question  about that note and he gave a very gracious and complete answer when  he was asked the question.  The questions of trade are something that  certainly will be discussed between the Prime Minister and the  President.  There is obviously a trade imbalance between Japan and  the U.S. that we want to do something about.              Q   Also in those comments the Prime Minister made he  suggested that the United States should come down heavy on him in  terms of trade.  Are you going to oblige?                MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:   I think the President will state  our views on trade very clearly and our views on the trade deficit  very clearly.  I don't necessarily want to agree with your  characterization of the Prime Minister's comments.              Q      that we need specific export targets, specific  numerical targets -- is that what he's going to discuss with  Miyazawa?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They're going to have a broad  discussion of a wide range of trade issues.  I don't want to get into  those specifics until after the meeting.              Q   Why?              Q    That's the crux of the issue, right?  Whether or  not -- does the President believe that without specific numerical  targets, it is really, as he said in his press conference, sort of  hopeless that this is going to change very much?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that we must  have pressure on Japan to turn the trade imbalance around.  I do not  want to get into the specifics of how that would be done.              Q   But does the President believe that their stimulus  package announced yesterday will rectify the imbalance?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think, first, the President wants  to get a full briefing on the stimulus package from Prime Minister  Miyazawa himself, and then he'll make the comment on it.              Q   How about the Russian aid package?  There seems to  be some confusion about how the U.S. views that, Secretary  Christopher saying -- or Bentsen saying the Japanese may need to do  more, the Japanese saying that that's not what they heard?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, we're going to continue to  work with all our allies in the G-7, and we're going to continue to  press for help for Russian reform, Russian democratic reform.  And I  think that, so far, we had a very good announcement out of Tokyo and  we're going to continue to work with our allies for bilateral  packages.              Q   Do you think the Japanese need to do more?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're going to continue to work  with all our allies to do as much as we can.              Q   Secretary Christopher was asked today on the Today  Show this morning what he thought of Margaret Thatcher's comments on  the Bosnia policy.  And he said, \\\"It's a rather emotional response.\\\"         MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Over an emotional issue.              Q   Right -- to an emotional problem.  Does the White   House condone that kind of remark?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that Secretary  Christopher's remarks speaks for itself.  The President believes also  that this is a deeply troubling situation that we're trying to find  answers for.               Q   But that specific -- \\\"rather emotional response\\\" --  specific term?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, it speaks for itself.              Q   In connection with that, doesn't it seem that with  the numbers of people who are being killed at this very moment, is it  good American policy to put off some decisions that might be made now  to help Boris Yeltsin win a referendum?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  For example?              Q   To take stronger action, to take military action --  air strikes, anything that can be done?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that what  must be done now is to push harder for sanctions.  He is also -- as  you know, the administration has been discussing lifting the arms  embargo.  He believes those are the appropriate ways to increase  pressure at this time.              Q   What is your response to the critics who would say  that the U.S. is now stymied by trying to help Boris Yeltsin retain  the presidency?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They're wrong.  We're pressing hard  for the Serbs to come to the negotiating table.  We're pressing hard  for increased sanctions, and we're talking to our allies about the  arms embargo.              Q   You were putting great store in Vance and Owen  getting people to agree to that.  Now, Vance and Owen have both said  that military force to some extent would be acceptable.  Does that  change your thinking?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Clearly, we're going to listen to  whatever people who have put so much time into a situation have to  say.  But at this point, the President is moving forward on sanctions  and talking about the arms embargo.              Q   A follow-up on a Dee Dee comment this morning.  She  said she would be able to provide some administration officials who  could document the effect the sanctions are having in Bosnia.  Are  you going to be able to do that, or do you have anything --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think that's what she said.              Q   That's exactly what she said.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think that's true.  But  what she said -- we would look into the situation of what kind of  evidence can be provided in Bosnia.  Obviously, if there are  connections between the Bosnian Serbs and the Serbs in Belgrade and  we are tightening the screws on the Serbs in Belgrade, that will have  an effect over time.  I do not know day by day, minute by minute,  what kind of help is being given between the two and what the exact  effect has been.   But, clearly, we are slowing the shipment of goods  into Belgrade.  We are having an effect on the Serbs there.  What  kind of effect that will eventually have on the Bosnian Serbs I don't  know.  But one thing I would say is if it were having no effect at  all, I don't know why they'd be fighting it so much.              Q   Are the First Lady's tax returns going to be  released?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think there's a joint tax return.   And it will be probably later today.              Q   Is the President considering signing an executive  order banning discrimination against homosexuals in the federal work  force as part of the gay rights march here next week?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think there's any proposal  for that at this time, not that I know of.              Q   It's something that the President promised during  the campaign that he would do.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I have not seen any -- I don't  think it's anything that's on his plate right now.              Q   Is he meeting with gay rights leaders at any point  on this issue?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know about on this issue.   I assume that he'll meet with representatives of the gay and lesbian  community sometime soon, as he meets with representatives of lots of  different groups and communities.              Q   Do you know if that's scheduled --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's probably going to be tomorrow.              Q   Probably going to be tomorrow?  (Laughter.)              Q   It's a good thing you asked.              Q   Who's probably going to be there?  (Laughter.)              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.              Q   How long --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.  That's all I know.              Q   Do you know if it's at 3:00 p.m. tomorrow?   (Laughter.)              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know what time it is.  I  don't even know for sure if it's going to be tomorrow.              Q   Environmental groups have asked him to make a major  speech next week of some kind.  Is that going to happen, do you know?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if they've asked, but  I think the President has always planned, as he did last year, to  give a speech on Earth Day and I expect that he will.  If it's not  exactly on Earth Day, it might be a day before or something like  that.              Q   Is he planning to sign or announce the signing of  the biodiversity treaty in connection with Earth Day?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know the specific  timing of something like that, but it's certainly something under  discussion and something we've been working on.              Q   Campaign finance reform?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're working on it.              Q   Do you think it will be next week?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not sure.              Q   The biodiversity treaty is something you're working  on?  I missed the question.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, something we're working on.   He asked if it was ready to be signed, and I said I didn't know  anything about that but it's something we've certainly been working  on.              Q   Do you know what organizations might be represented  in this meeting with the gay and lesbian groups?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't.              Q   Do you know if he is going to reconsider being out  of town on the day of the march?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's got to be at the Senate  meeting in Jamestown, and I believe he's also going to be giving a  speech to the American Association of Newspaper Publishers in Boston  on Sunday, as he did last year.              Q   Would you have told us if she had not pressed you  on the question?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  On what?              Q   On the gays.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  When we went through the  President's schedule for the day, certainly.              Q?     George, what day is the publisher's speech?  Is  that Sunday?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it's a Sunday.              Q   And Saturday he'll be in Jamestown?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.              Q   So you're just going to be in Jamestown for one  day?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, I'm not sure.  I don't know how  long the Senate thing goes.  It might go overnight.  I just don't  know.              Q   You would have made the gay meeting public, right?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm certain if we had the meeting  -- I don't know about open to the press, but we would have told you  about it.              Q   I mean, because it is, as far as I can tell, the  first time in history a President has met in the Oval Office with --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I didn't say it was going to be in  the Oval Office.  (Laughter.)  But I didn't -- I'm not say that it's  not, but I didn't say that it was.  (Laughter.)              Q      at the White House in the Bush administration  gay officials were invited to a bill signing ceremony and the White  House had to repudiate having done that.  So I just wanted to make  sure --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the President wouldn't do  anything like that.              Q   Certainly not.              Q   What marching orders did the President give to  General Vessey?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They had a very good discussion for  about half an hour today.  He wanted -- the most important thing was  he had a full accounting for American POWs and MIAs.  He will  obviously look into the circumstances surrounding this new document.   The President stressed that he wanted the fullest possible accounting  and said that only when we have that can we even consider any changes  in our policy towards Vietnam.  He'll be looking at Vietnam's  response to the questions raised by the document and he'll also look  into investigations on discrepancy cases, increased efforts on  remains, implementing trilateral investigations -- and access to  military archives.                And Ambassador Toon also briefed the President on the  activities of the joint commission and on the document.              Q   Vietnam says it's a fake.  What is the DOD analysis  at this stage?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's not completed yet, and it's  also the first thing that General Vessey will bring up with the  Vietnamese.              Q   A number of Defense officials have been saying that  they think that the 600 or so prisoners referred to are, in fact,  non-Americans that the Vietnamese had captured who they referred to  as Americans from time to time.  Do people --               MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We don't have any final  determination.  We're going to wait for the complete review; when we  have it, we'll make a judgment.              Q   I know you don't have any final determination, but  given all of the intense public interest in this, do you think that  that's a likely possibility?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I just don't want to characterize  it in any way until the review is complete.              Q   George, was there a topic scheduled for the speech  in Boston?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.               Q   Is the President going to have a press conference  tomorrow with Miyazawa?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think so, but I'm not positive.   Yes, I expect, yes.              Q   Was Toon in with Vessey?                MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.               Q   He was in on the meeting?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.              Q   What was the question?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Was Ambassador Toon in with Vessey,  and the answer is yes.               Q   Do you have any response to The Wall Street Journal  report this morning the President's distressed about some of his  press clippings and that perhaps he's distressed with you about that?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  Well, I do have a response.  I  think the article was highly misleading to the extent that it implied  that the President has had restricted access to the press.  I would  point out that he's answered 358 questions on 77 occasions, more than  any of his predecessors. I would also point out it also --              Q   How many questions?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Three hundred fifty-eight, on 77  occasions.              Q   How many were while he was jogging?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, no, that's actually a very  good question, Andrea.  And I would point out further that the  article also implied that these questions were only answered at  tightly controlled photo opportunities, which is just patently false.   He's had 13 press conferences in either the East Room, the Oval  Office or the Roosevelt Room or the Briefing Room, in addition to  questions taken at photo opportunities, and that is only the --              Q   Oval Office press conference -- when was that?               MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's answered questions in the -- East Room.  He's had five in the East Room, he's had one in the Oval  Office, he's had one in the Rose Garden, he's had one or two in the  Roosevelt Room.  And this is just to the White House, Washington  Press Corps.  In addition to that, he's had 17 interviews with local  television anchors.  He's met with the editorial board of The  Portland Oregonian.  He's had an hour-long interview with Dan Rather.  He's had interviews with local press from California, Florida and  Connecticut --              Q   Can you address the question of the attitude?  The  article implies that he doesn't --              Q   Why doesn't he like us?  (Laughter.)              Q   Did you really get blamed for that Post story?              Q   The story is that you -- are you held responsible  for it.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think I'm going to comment  about this.              Q   Are you denying that the President has shown  displeasure publicly?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I am not commenting on the  discussions between the President and myself.              Q   Did the President write that letter to Chris  Webber?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  What?              Q   The letter to the University of Michigan basketball  player?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, yes.              Q   That is an authentic letter?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.              Q   Since the President first talked about the VAT in  February, he said at the time that he thought there probably should  be exceptions made in basic necessities such as food and clothing.   Does he still hold that position given the impact it could have?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I just can't comment on a  proposal he hasn't made.              Q   George, does the President have some agenda for  this meeting with the gay leaders tomorrow?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I think it will just a  general meeting on the wide range of issues that they care about  including AIDS and other issues -- civil rights.              Q   The military issue?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm certain it will come up.              Q   Is he using this event to name the AIDS --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think so.              Q   George, what specifically is the President doing to  prepare for tomorrow's meeting with the Prime Minister Miyazawa?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's had briefing memos.  He's had  general discussions with members of the Treasury Department, the  Trade Representative and others.              Q      report yet?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if he has the report  referred to in The Times, but Ambassador Kantor was here to brief him  today.              Q   He was?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.              Q   Does he intend to use any of these instances that  --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know that the  report's been presented.  But obviously, the President will press  hard in any case where he thinks that a violation has occurred.              Q   In terms of the Wall Street Journal, the thrust was  that there's a real schism here -- a hostility.  Do you think he  feels that way?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not at all.  As I said on the  record in the article, I think the President likes reporters.  Again,  I think that the thrust of the article was still misleading.  The  thrust of the article was that in some way, some attitude which the  President may or may not have is affecting access when, in fact, he  has the most open, accessible administration than have any in recent  history.        Q   Can we come up to your office?  (Laughter.)        MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  If you're invited.                THE PRESS:  Thank you.                                   END                    1:34 P.M. EDT\",\"Forwarded from the Mars Observer Project                         MARS OBSERVER STATUS REPORT                              April 23, 1993                               10:00 AM PDT  Flight Sequence C8 is active, the Spacecraft subsystems and instrument payload performing well in Array Normal Spin and outer cruise configuration, with uplink and downlink via the High Gain Antenna; uplink at 125 bps, downlink at the 2 K Engineering data rate.  As a result of the spacecraft entering Contingency Mode on April 9, all payload instruments were automatically powered off by on-board fault protection software.  Gamma Ray Spectrometer Random Access Memory was successfully reloaded on Monday, April 19.  To prepare for Magnetometer Calibrations which were rescheduled for execution in Flight Sequence C9 on Tuesday and Wednesday of next week, a reload of Payload Data System Random Access Memory will take place this morning beginning at 10:30 AM.  Over this weekend, the Flight Team will send real-time commands to perform Differential One-Way Ranging to obtain additional data for analysis by the Navigation Team.  Radio Science Ultra Stable Oscillator testing will take place on Monday .  The Flight Sequence C9 uplink will occur on Sunday, April 25, with activation at Midnight, Monday evening April 26.  C9 has been modified to include Magnetometer Calibrations which could not be performed in C8 due to Contingency Mode entry on April 9.  These Magnetometer instrument calibrations will allow the instrument team to better characterize the spacecraft-generated magnetic field and its effect on their instrument. This information is critical to Martian magnetic field measurements which occur during approach and mapping phases. MAG Cals will require the sequence to command the spacecraft out of Array Normal Spin state and perform slew and roll maneuvers to provide the MAG team data points in varying spacecraft attitudes and orientations.\",\"Yes, it's possible... in fact, there's some gl widget code in /usr/lpp/GL somewhere...

I recently purchased a 486DX-33 machine and am having problems where the  machine will suddenly freeze or reboot.  This may happen in Windows 3.1 or DOS  5.0.  Sometimes it is after printing a document, sometimes after using the  mouse, and sometimes just when I am sitting there.  Twice when it happened, the  machine rebooted and sounded seven beeps.  I looked in the documentation and  the seven beep code meant a problem with interrupts.

Dodson    Internet: DBD@ICF.HRB.COM HRB Systems, Inc.    State College, PA  USA    16804\",\" I thought Bill James' latest book completely and totally sucked.  I bought it, but will not purchase anything of his ever again without THOROUGHLY looking at it first.  What tripe.  The book is inconsistent, and filled with selective analysis.  James claims to be looking forward, and then makes some absolutely bizarre statements of value.  Not only that, but I got the impression he probably glanced at the book for about an hour before he put his name on it.   To say I was disappointed is a grand understatement.  \",\"According to what I have read on Biblical idioms, speaking \\\"in X's name\\\" is a standard Aramaic/Hebrew legal idiom for what we today would call Power of Attorney.  A person from Jesus' culture authorized to conduct business \\\"in John's name\\\" had full authority over John's financial affairs, but was held under a solemn fiduciary obligation to work only for John's benefit and consonant with John's wishes.  It was not required for the steward to preface each business transaction with \\\"in John's name\\\"; it was sufficient to have valid power of attorney and be operating in good faith. (Note the overlap here between legal and religious definitions of \\\"faith\\\".)  With this cultural background, praying \\\"in Jesus' name\\\" does not mandate a particular verbal formula; rather it requires that the petitioner be operating faithfully and consciously within an analogous \\\"fiduciary\\\" relationship with Jesus and for the purposes of His Kingdom.  The message of \\\"praying in Jesus' name\\\" is thus closely aligned with the parable of the talents and other passages about God's delegation of Kingdom business to his stewards, both resources and responsibilities.  This idea of praying \\\"in Jesus' name\\\" is not only present but prominent in the Lord's Prayer, although the verbal forumula is absent.  The act of praying the words \\\"In Jesus' Name\\\" may be beneficial if they cause us to clarify the relationship of our requests to the advancement of God's Kingdom.  For that reason, I'm not quite ready to say that the praying the formula is without meaning.  Prayers to God for other purposes (desperation, anger, thanksgiving, etc.) don't seem to be in this category at all, whether uttered by Christian or non-Christian, whether B.C. or A.D. (that's B.C.E. or C.E. for you P.C. :-).  I don't see anything in Christ's words to contradict the idea that God deals with all prayers according to His omniscience and grace.

An episode begins with extreme tiredness followed by:   1. traveling joint pains and stiffness affecting mostly the elbows,  knees, and hips.  2. generalized muscle pains  3. tinnitus and a feeling of pressure in her ears  4. severe sweating occuring both at night and during the day  5. hemorrhaging in both eyes.

(BTW, as of a couple years ago, the most stolen bikes in Orange County and SF were 750 GSX's and Ninjas). Probably the biggest reason BMWs aren't ripped off is that most people who buy BMWs will only deal with the actual BMW dealer, or mail- order types. Most of these can have their inventory checked fairly easily by law-enforcement types, and their mark-up is usually sufficient to keep  them honest about acquiring parts.   For Harleys and rice-rockets, you've got 2 different situations. There is a HUGE aftermarket in Harley parts, so a bike can be parted out fairly easily. Ditto the non-sport Japanese bikes, but the prices on the parts for these are not as high, comparatively. For the 'rockets', anytime a bike goes down, the  plastic is usually cracked, and is expensive to replace. It's fairly easy, then, for a disreputable shop to take a fairing from a stolen bike, slap it on a bike in for repair, repaint it, and make a tidy profit. The other parts, more traceable, can be used, or discarded if they are too traceable.  Mike\",\":    Watch us soar in 1993!

Now, do you enjoy serbs coming and killing all (armed) bosnian muslims ?

Level 5?  Out of how many?  What are the different levels?  I've never    heard of this rating system.  Anyone care to clue me in?  This is a rating system used by ARPA and other organisations to measure the maturity of a `software process' i.e. the entire process by which software gets designed, written, tested, delivered, supported etc.  See `Managing the Software Process', by Watts S. Humphrey, Addison Wesley 1989. An excellent software engineering text. The 5 levels of software process maturity are:  1. Initial 2. Repeatable 3. Defined 4. Managed 5. Optimizing  The levels are approximately characterized as follows:  1. no statistically software process control. Have no statistical    basis for estimating how large software will be, how long it will    take to produce, how expensive it will be, or how reliable it will    be.  Most software production is at this level.  2. stable process with statistical controls, rigorous project    management; having done something once, can do it again. Projects    are planned in detail, and there is software configuration    management and quality assurance.  3. The process is defined and understood, implementation is    consistent. This includes things like software inspection, a    rigorous software testing framework, more configuration management,    and typically a `software engineering process group' within the    project.  4. Statistical information on the software is systematically gathered    and analysed, and the process is controlled on the basis of this    information. Software quality is measured and has goals.  5. Defects are prevented, the process is automated, software contracts    are effective and certified.\",\"Source: \\\"Men Are Like That\\\" by Leonard Ramsden Hartill.

Seemed to trigger arthritis-like problems.  Sue\",\"Golgotha the whole process of the fall of man  This was precisely my point.  From a theological bent, those who lived immediately after the flood, such as Noah, Ham, his son Cush, and his son Nimrod had a much stronger appreciation of Divine wrath.  They also had a stronger understanding of the True God.  In fact, this immediacy was a cause of hardship for some, so much so that Atlas, who is seen with heavens resting on his shoulders.  But this is not merely the physical heavens that he is lifting.  It is to put God and the strict spirituality of His law at a distance, and thus he became the \\\"Elevator of the heavens.\\\"  This \\\"god\\\" made men able to \\\"feel\\\" as if heaven were afar off and \\\"as if either the God of Heaven could not see through the dark cloud, or did not regard with displeasure the breakers of His laws.\\\"  It is interesting to see that it was that was titled \\\"Emancipator\\\" or \\\"Deliverer\\\"  or Phoroneus. It was Nimrod who invaded the patriarchal system and abridged the liberties of mankind, yet was worship for having given many benefits.  He was a deliverer all right but not as we think of Christ as a Deliverer.  One delivered from a conscious feeling of God's wrath, the other actually performed a delivery from Gods wrath and it is up to us to accept it as true.   I don't see the problem.  From the time of Adam, those who looked forward to the coming \\\"Anointed One\\\" and put their faith in the fact that it was God who was to do the provision, were accounted as righteous.  But up to the Crucifixion, their sins were only covered, not taken away.  Therefore, the dispensation of the Church views the accountability of sin the same, but see it as a completed action.  Rom's makes it clear that it has always been salvation via faith and nothing else.   I understand what you're trying to convey, but I don't think I'd lay hold of it because the scriptures do equate the eternality of the second death with the eternality of, say the Church ruling with Christ.  Jn 17 tells us what eternal life is exactly, as you are correct that it is much more than non-cessation of consciousness.     It depends upon your def of \\\"lost.\\\"  The elect were lost only in time as outside of time they had been chosen from the foundation of the world.  Existentially we were all born \\\"lost\\\", but the \\\"righteous\\\" were \\\"in Christ\\\" and therefore never *assuredly* lost.    Maybe this summer I could find time to put together a paper on it.  I simply have to buy more books for myself, and these older books are very expensive.  Either that or countless trips to the oriental museum.   Couldn't agree with you more.  Our understanding, of say eschatology, is clearly clearer than that of, say Isaiah.  But that is not what I was referring to.    No, I understand it as you have said. This was my point.   Ah!  This is it.  This is the big question.  However, I would say, again I think, that the best lie is one that has an appreciable amount of truth to it.  Look at Satan's twist of God's Word when he coerced Eve.  That is a very interesting study.   >The similarity in the midst of great variety of  Yes, that is my point.  But it is a two edged sword. For some do not want the underlying reality to be revealed.  They were not known as \\\"mystery\\\" religions for no reason.  There was the public side of them and there was the private side, that was so protected that the initiates to an oath of death if they revealed that private side.  That is why it is so hard to bring their teachings to light. The \\\"Mystery of Iniquity\\\" that we find in the Bible, correlates to this I think.  The primary object of the mysteries was to introduce privately, little by little, under the seal of secrecy and sanction of oath, what it would not have been safe to openly profess was the true religion.  Case in point today might be the Masons.  (Just a note, that they too worshipped Osiris in Egypt, who can be traced to Nimrod, the \\\"husband son.\\\")   No, I disagree with you here Gerry.  I know what you're alluding to in that the church, primarily the RCC, did endorse Aristotelian philosophy into their worldview, but I would disagree with you that it originated in Greece.  If you are a student of history, you will come to see that much of what Greece came to expound to the world as their original, was just an adulteration of that which they had taken from conquered countries.  The soul is clearly mentioned and discussed at length in the Egyptian religions. As was the unity of God and also the trinity of God.  See if you can find Wilkinson's \\\"Egyptians.\\\"  He really does a number on what the Greeks did to what they \\\"pilfered\\\" from the Egyptians.    I'm not knocking Aristotle or Plato or any other Greek thinker.

The controller is a Toshiba MFM controller, with an additional 9 pins connector.  There are 2 busses from my harddisk to this controller. One with 9 wires and another with 34 wires.  The controller has two connectors for a 9 wire-bus and one for a 34 wire bus.  Now I got a 20 MB harddisk from a friend of mine, and I wondered whether I can connect this second harddisk to the same controller (there is room for a 9 wire-bus, but not for the 34 wire bus)  How can I solve my problem, any suggestions?

All they are are fluorescent bulbs  without the phosphor, and a UV transparent bulb (special glass).  I've also seen incandescent versions that you screw into an ordinary 120VAC socket, probably not what you want.   As far as I know, near UV (as opposed to far-UV) is longwave UV (near the visible spectrum).  Longwave UV is safer as far as accidental (I hope) exposure to the eyes.  As far as fluorescent minerals go (the reason a friend has a UV lamp), some only respond to only one of short or long UV.  Hope this helps.

But yes, you've got the idea -- the reboost is done by taking the whole shuttle up.   Somebody has to build that thruster module; it's not an off-the-shelf item.  Nor is it a trivial piece of hardware, since it has to include attitude control (HST's own is not strong enough to compensate for things like thruster imbalance), guidance (there is no provision to feed gyro data from HST's own gyros to an external device), and separation (you don't want it left attached afterward, if only to avoid possible contamination after the telescope lid is opened again).  You also get to worry about whether the lid is going to open after the reboost is done and HST is inaccessible to the shuttle (the lid stays closed for the duration of all of this to prevent mirror contamination from thrusters and the like).  The original plan was to use the Orbital Maneuvering Vehicle to do the reboost.  The OMV was planned to be a sort of small space tug, well suited to precisely this sort of job.  Unfortunately, it was costing a lot to develop and the list of definitely-known applications was relatively short, so it got cancelled.\",\" Mexico City, Bogota, La Paz?   ---  An unconventional remedy that you might try for altitude sickness in the Andes is chewing coca leaves or taking teas made from coca leaves.

In your example, after accessing the modem, the mouse won't work until you reboot, because the IRQ is used by the modem.   Yes, you can change the IRQ's for com3/4, but it depends on your other hardware. com1 uses IRQ4, com2 IRQ3.

A couple of years I was involved in a low-speed getoff in which I landed on my back on the pavement.  My head (helmeted) hit the pavement with a \\\"clunk\\\", leaving a couple of dings and chips in the paint at the point of impact, but no other visible damage.  I called the helmet manufacturer and inquired about damage.  They said that the way a fiberglass shell works is to first give, then delaminate, then crack. This is the way fiberglass serves to spread the force of the impact over a wider area.  After the fiberglass has done its thing, the crushable foam liner takes care of absorbing (hopefully) the remaining impact force. They told me that the second stage of fiberglass functionality (delamination of the glass/resin layers) can occur with NO visible signs, either inside or outside of the helmet.  They suggested that I send them the helmet and they would inspect it (including X-raying).  I did so.  They sent back the helmet with a letter stating that that they could find no damage that would compromise the ability of the helmet to provide maximum protection. (I suspect that this letter would eliminate their being able to claim prior damage to the helmet in the event I were to sue them.)  The bottom line, though, is that it appears that a helmets integrity can be compromised with no visible signs.  The only way to know for sure is to send it back and have it inspected.  Note that some helmet manufacturers provide inspections services and some do not.  Another point to consider when purchasing a lid. \",\"The above does not tell the proper story of SCSI: SCSI-I: 8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}, synchronous {5MB/s max} transfer  base. SCSI-1{faster} this requires a SCSI-2 controller chip and provides  SCSI-2 {8-bit to 16-bit} speeds with SCSI-1 controlers. SCSI-2: 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst{8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit},  and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst{32-bit/wide and fast}.  16-bit SCSI can be wide or fast, it depends on how the port is designed{The Quadras will support fast SCSI but not wide when the OS SCSI manager is rewritten since the Quardas use a SCSI-1 {non-wide} port}.  The article in PC Mag 4/27/93:29 was talking about SCSI-1 {SCSI-2 uses TEN (10) devices in it native mode, outside its native mode it behaves a lot like SCSI-1 (7 devices, slower through put}  From your own figures SCSI-1 is indeed twice ESDI as the article pointed out as for \\\"20% faster then IDE\\\" that seems to be 8-bit SCSI-1 using a SCSI-2  contoler chip {The Mac Quadra uses a SCSI-2 controler chip for its SCSI-1 and gets 6MB/s through put for asynchronous {8-bit} SCSI-1, far in excess of a normal SYNCHRONOUS SCSI-1 output} 120% of 8.3 is 9.96 which is near the burst of a SCSI-1 machine with a SCSI-2 controller chip.  The PC world seems to have SCSI-1 and SCSI-2 mixed up.  Fact is SCSI-2  controler chips allow near SCSI-2 speeds through a SCSI-1 device {As shown in the Mac Quadra} which skews some of the data of SCSI-1 vs IDE or ESDI test. I agree that the article COULD have stated that the \\\"20% faster then IDE\\\" came off a SCSI-1 device with a SCSI-2 chip.  Maybe it was there and the EDITOR killed it because the article was dealing with SCSI-1 NOT SCSI-2 and he did not understand the effect of a SCSI-1 device with a SCSI-2 controller chip. SCSI-1 chips are limited to 5/MB max.  SCSI-1 devices with SCSI-2 chips {becoming common} produce up to 10Mb/s in 8-bit mode and 20MB/s in 16-bit mode {the fast version, SCSI-1 ports cannot use wide SCSI}.  Of cource the prime piece of wierdness is that SCSI-1 devices HAVE SCSI-2 chips {or more accurately the machine does}. This allows the best of BOTH worlds: high SCSI-2 speeds and cheeper SCSI-1 costs {FULL SCSI-2 hardware (port, electronic controller, etc) is VERY expensive.  It ALSO creates a logistic NIGHTMARE as to how fast SCSI-1 goes.\",\": Currently, I use a shareware program called Graphics Workshop. : What kinds of things will Hijaak do that these shareware programs : will not do?

The biggest proponent of proposing was Dr. Lewis Branscomb.  Dr. Branscomb was the IBM Chief Scientist and had come to IBM from NBS.  Fortunately for all of us, Dr. Branscomb understood the answer to the above question much better than I.  He realized how difficult it would be to gain acceptance for any cryptographic mechanism.  Because of the necessary complexity, publicity would not be sufficient and neither would  authority.  In fact, it has taken both of those plus more than 15  years.  We have also had independence.  The DES was solicited by NBS, invented and proposed by IBM, and vetted by NBS.  It has also been examined and vetted by experts like Adi Shamir, who are not subject to influence by any of these.  Even now, there are still people posting on this list who do not trust the DES in spite of all the time, all of the analysis, and all of the public scrutiny.  (Of course, it is just this point that NIST misses when it attempts to  gain acceptance for a novel mechanism, developed in secret, on the basis of authority alone.)  We had a long thread here about whether or not the NSA can \\\"break\\\" the DES.  That is a silly question.  At some cost and in some time they can \\\"break\\\" anything.  The important question is at what cost and in what time.  The fundamental strength of the DES and RSA are not nearly so important as what we know about their strength.  As long as we understand the cost and duration for an attacker, then we can use them in a safe way. At this point, we may never replace either because of the inability of any successor to overcome this knowledge gap.  DES and RSA are among the most significant inventions of the century and the most important inventions in the history of cryptography. We are damned lucky to have them.\",\" It works on xterms.

First, in February, the Russians deployed a 20-m reflector from a Progress vehicle after it had departed from the Mir Space Station.  While this \\\"Banner\\\" reflector was blank, NPO Energia was very active in reporting that future  Banner reflectors will be available to advertisers, who could use a space- based video of their logo or ad printed on the Banner in a TV commercial, as filmed from the Mir.    The second development, has been that Space Marketing Inc, the same company responsible for merchandising space on the Conestoga booster and COMET spacecraft, is now pushing the \\\"Environmental Billboard\\\".  As laid out by SMI Chief Engineer Dr Ron Humble of the University of Colorado Space Laboratory and Preston Carter of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the \\\"Environmental Billboard\\\" is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to 804x1609 meters.  Advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area, deployed by the inflatable 'frame'.    To help sell the concept, the spacecraft responsible for maintaining the billboard on orbit will carry \\\"ozone reading sensors\\\" to \\\"continuously monitor the condition of the Earth's delicate protective ozone layer,\\\" according to Mike Lawson, head of SMI. Furthermore, the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum exposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the Earth's atmosphere. According to IMI, \\\"as the biodegradable material burns, it will release ozone-building components that will literally replenish the ozone layer.\\\" The remaining spacecraft will monitor the atmosphere for another year before it, too, re-enters and burns up and \\\"adds to the ozone supply.\\\"    This would not be a cheap advertisement, costing at least several millions of dollars (exact costs were not available).  But SMI estimates that market exposure would be 3-5X that of the people who watched the SuperBowl, where a 30-second advertising 'unit' cost $600,000.  Since SMI is located in Atlanta, Georgia, it is being promoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta.    But back to Brian's questions:        See above. As for serious -- if they can get $15-20 M or so (my estimate of $5-10 for development costs and a flight unit, plus $10-15 M for a launch), then it's probably real.  They are claiming to tailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for optimum advertising impact so they probably can't piggy back upon someone else's planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated launch.  That's a $10-15 M cost they need to raise, right there.     And there will probably be some legal challenges to this as well.  Note there is one potential legal challenge to SMI on the use of launch vehicle advertising already.  While I don't think the legal challenges would win out (and yes, I am an amateur astronomer, and no, I don't really like the idea of this additional light pollution, but I know of no prohibition of it...),  the legal challenges and court fights would probably remove any positive aspects of the advertising.  I can imagine several ways to make the advertisers look like louts for doing this -- which would change positive market exposure to negative market exposure, and negate the space advertising advantage.  (Would you spend $15 M to look like an idiot?)    (And light pollution might not be too bad -- if it's in a low enough orbit, and it relies upon reflected light only, it would only be visible for a short time just after local dusk and before dawn.  For maximum market exposure, you want to have it visible just after dusk --minimizing impact on astronomy, since that's the time of worse seeing due to day/night thermal turbulence.  It might still be a problem, but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this...)     As for having real funding -- none that I can identify.  There were about 60 expressions of interest made on the Conestoga advertising opportunity, but that included curious folks and was for only a $500,000 commitment.  I haven't heard of any serious funding for this, but I'm sure they are shopping the venture around looking for some money in order to flesh out the concept some more.  But I am confident there are no firm or paying customers at this time.       And if anybody wants to cross-post this to sci.astro, please be my guest.

In other words, I think that statements like gods are or somehow interfere with this world are false or meaningless. In Ontology, one can fairly conclude that when \\\"A exist\\\" is meaningless A does not exist. Under the Pragmatic definition of truth, \\\"A exists\\\" is meaningless makes A exist even logically false.   A problem with such statements is that one can't disprove a subjective god by definition, and there might be cases where a subjective god would even make sense. The trouble with most god definitions is that they include some form of objective existence with the consequence of the gods affecting all. Believers derive from it a right to interfere with the life of others.     (Deletion)\",\"  : [ The discussion begins: why does the universe exist at all?  ]   : One of the Laws of Nature, specifying cause and effect seems to dictate  : (at least to this layman's mind) there must be a causal event.  No : reasonable alternative exists.  I would argue that causality is actually a property of spacetime;  causes precede their effects. But if you claim that there must be an answer to \\\"how\\\" did the universe (our spacetime)  emerge from  \\\"nothing\\\", science has some good candidates for an answer.  I have always wondered why Christians use the \\\"There are questions science (or atheism) cannot answer\\\" argument; I hope this is the appropriate group to ask this question.  The most popular question is the question of origins. Why does the universe exist, or anything, for that matter?  I think this question should actually be split into two parts, namely  1) Why is there existence? Why anything exists?  and  2) How did the universe emerge from nothing?  It is clear science has nothing to say about the first question. However, is it a meaningful question, after all?  I would say it isn't. Consider the following:  A die-hard skeptic being (be it human or whatever) attempts to doubt one's very existence. Since it is so easy to doubt everything else - I cannot be _sure_ the world exists, it may be my mind fooling me - can I ever be sure I exist?  However, it is only possible to exist or not to exist. (Someone insert an appropriate Shakespeare quote here ;-) )  A being that does not exist cannot doubt one's existence. A being that does exist can doubt one's existence, but this would be pointless - the being would exist anyway.  Let us return to the original question: why? A being that does not exist does not need any reasons for its non-existence. This being is not _sure_ whether anything else exists but his mind, but let us assume that the world exists independent of the mind (the objectivity postulate). The question \\\"why anything exists\\\" can be countered by demanding answer to a question \\\"why there is nothing in nothingness, or in non-existence\\\". Actually, both questions turn out to be devoid of meaning. Things that exist do, and things that don't exist don't exist. Tautology at its best.  I seriously doubt God could have an answer to this question.  Some Christians I have talked to have said that actually, God is Himself the existence. However, I see several problems with this answer. First, it inevitably leads to the conclusion that God is actually _all_ existence, good and evil, devils and angels, us and them. This is pantheism, not Christianity.  Another answer is that God is the _source_ of all existence. This sounds much better, but I am tempted to ask: Does God Himself exist, then? If God is the source of His own existence, it can only mean that He has, in terms of human time, always existed. But this is not the same as the source of all existence. This argument sounds like God does not exist, but meta-exists, and from His meta-existent perspective, He created existence. I think this is actually a nonsolution, a mere twist of words.  The best answer I have heard is that human reasoning is incapable of understanding such questions. Being an atheist myself, I do not accept such answers, since I do not have any other methods.  The second question: How did the universe emerge from nothing? belongs to the domain of science, and I, for one, do not doubt the question can be answered by its methods. Many cosmologists have suggested that it is entirely possible for universes to emerge from vacuum (this possibility has been suggested in a recent Hawking biography; see also Lizhi & Shuxian: Creation of the Universe, World Scientific, 1989). However, I think the sci groups are more appropriate for discussions like this.   : As far as I can tell, the very laws of nature demand a \\\"why\\\".  That isn't : true of something outside of nature (i.e., *super*natural).  This is not true. Science is a collection of models telling us \\\"how\\\", not why, something happens. I cannot see any good reason why the \\\"why\\\" questions would be bound only to natural things, assuming that the supernatural domain exists. If supernatural beings exist, it is as appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist.   : I believe the \\\"genetic code\\\" will be entirely deciphered in our lifetimes, : but we will not see man convert entirely inert material into self sustaining,  : reproducing life, *ever*.  (I've never been much of a prophet, though. I : can't even *picture* New York in my mind 8^] ).  I don't believe *any* : technology would be able to produce that necessary *spark* of life, despite : having all of the parts available. Just my opinion.  This opinion is also called vitalism; namely, that living systems are somehow _fundamentally_ different from inanimate systems. Do Christians in general adopt this position? What would happen when scientists announce they have created primitive life (say, small bacteria) in a lab?  There is a problem with your prophecy: artificial life has been created, although not yet in a chemical form. Computer simulations of evolution contain systems that are as much alive as any bacterium, although their code is electronic, as well as their metabolism. See a recent book  Steven Levy: Artificial life - The Quest for a New Creation. Jonathan Cape, London 1992.  Artificial chemical life is just around the corner - after all, no  spark of life has been found to be necessary; living systems do not violate any physical laws as we know them.   : You don't mind if a few of us send up a prayer on your behalf during your : research, do you?  After all, if we of Christ are deluding ourselves, you : really have nothing to worry about, eh?  Exactly. This is why I think atheists should _not_ post any evangelical atheist arguments to soc.religion groups, since people who seek to  find peace in religions must be allowed to gather together. I would normally have asked these questions in alt.atheism or talk.religion.misc, but it seems many Christians do not read these groups.

This will prevent competitors from coming out with Clipper-compatible phones which lack the government- installed \\\"back door.\\\"  The strategy Brad describes will only work as long as the only way to get compatible phones is to have ones with the government chips.

I don't believe arbitrary levels of abstraction, just for the sake of changing the API, are valuable.    Since we will be developing for the 32bit Windows NT system the memory management issues and issues particular to the Windows 3.1 API are less important.     We will probably buy another C++ class library (something like Tools.h++ or Booch components from Rational) to handle data structures and other miscellaneous stuff  (allocators etc...).  So those features are not that important for this toolkit to have.  The two that I have narrowed it down to are ZApp and Zinc, they seem to be the two toolkits that have received the most attention from the media.  I was wondering if anyone had any first-hand experience with any of these toolkits (especially ZApp and Zinc).  A couple of observations about these toolkits that seem particularly noteworthy are:  ZApp ----   Seems to have the most extensive coverage of Windows functionality and     also includes some other miscellaneous useful classes.   Has new fancy 3D-style controls available, and support for custom controls.   Has a Windows NT version (Essential)   Redirectable graphics display/output architecture (useful for printing)   Sizer class for automatically managing control layout after resize.   Seems to be the newcomer, this could be an advantage in designing a better system.   Zinc ----   Has a platform independent resource strategy.  (Not too important for me right now)   Comes with a interface builder tool   Has a Windows NT version (Essential)   Seems to have been around longer (more mature), but grew up out of a DOS version.     Had a better demo :-)  Both have source code availability options Both are lacking OLE support Neither seem to have any particular support for multimedia type stuff   Any thoughts anyone has on this would be much appreciated,  Thanks,   Brett Harper \",\"Could someone tell me how to make/find/get the best frontplate for IIvi/IIvx/C650 with internal SyQuest drive?

I limit myself to *one* 'standard serving' of alcohol if I'm going to ride. And mostly, unless the alcohol is something special (fine ale, good wine, or someone else's vsop), I usually just don't drink *any*.  But then alcohol just isn't really important to me, mainly for financial reasons...  At least one of the magazines claims to follow the aviation guideline of \\\"no alcohol whatsoever\\\" within 24hrs of riding a 'company' bike.

Specs for the 68040 can fill a 500 page book.

I'm predicting that both the 680x0 and x86 lines are reaching their ends.  New experimental processors have 64-bit data pathways and can schedule up to 8 out of 32 instructions each clock cycle.  That sort of trick can't really be done with CISC architectures.  I finally saw some details on the 586/Pentium and was not greatly impressed.  They've finally done some work on the FPU to get it up to speed, but otherwise it's only going to be a 2x speedup.  And to get that they're using two integer units, larger caches, and a branch target buffer.  Yes, I know they're talking about 100MHz processors. Big whoop.

Please post the number if you've got it!  Thanks. \",\" Gawd, I love Windows :-)   You'll probably want to delete any damaged executables and reload them fresh.  Data files should be examined and repaired.   You're not stupid.  Smartdrive caches things, and Windows also runs a swap file which may contain data also.  All of this is pretty risky stuff in a PC environment.   A reasonably accurate prediction...   Here's a brief description of how DOS stores files:  There are three pieces to a file.  The directory entry, the FAT chain, and the data area.  You can think of these as a sheet of lined notebook paper, a sheet of graph paper, and a stack of 3X5 cards.  The directory entry (notebook paper) holds the file name, actual size, and first cluster number.  It also holds some other information that's not important right now.  The File Allocation Table (FAT) chain (graph paper) tells where to find the actual data.  Each square of graph paper holds a number.  If the number is zero, the cluster associated with this box is available.  If it holds a \\\"magic\\\" number, it is either the last piece of a file or a bad (unuseable) spot on the disk.  Any other number tells which cluster contains the next section of the file.  The data area (3X5 cards) is where the actual information is stored. The data area is organized as clusters of a fixed size; storage is doled out in \\\"chunks\\\" of one cluster each.  (In your case, one cluster is 2048 bytes.)  As a cluster is filled, another is allocated.  To read a file, you first look at the directory entry to get the starting cluster number.  Now you read the data from that cluster. Next, look at the FAT entry for the cluster you just read.  This will tell you the cluster number for the next chunk of the file. Naturally, these numbers are usually sequential, but they can jump around and even go backwards.  Continue reading, one cluster at a time, as you walk this chain through the FAT, until you hit the marker which says it's the last cluster in the file.  CHKDSK is the DOS utility that checks the sanity and coherence of the directories and the FAT and can bludgeon most flaws into submission.  It doesn't have any intelligence, so you have to double-check anything it \\\"fixes\\\".  Now let's do a bit of a post-mortem:   All of these files have sizes (according to the FAT) which don't match the size reported in their directory entries.  CHKDSK /F will alter the directory entries to match the FAT size.  (In other words,   the directory entry for CVPIC.EXE may say the file is 64,877 bytes long. But CHKDSK found a FAT chain of 43 clusters attached to it.  (My numbers, obviously, are made up.))   Disk space was found which is allocated in the FAT, but is not attached to any directory entry.  CHKDSK /F gives you the option of converting these \\\"lost chains\\\" to files.  You can then examine the files (FILE0000.CHK through FILE0223.CHK) and rename or discard them.  Or, if you tell CHKDSK _not_ to convert them to files, then those clusters will simply be marked \\\"available\\\" in the FAT.    ...   These files are both referencing the _same_ data cluster.  Obviously, one of them (at least) must be wrong.  It's interesting to note that C:\\\\386SPART.PAR is your Windows swap file...  To fix this, you should copy each cross-linked file to a new name. This will \\\"fix\\\" the cross-link by giving the files unique data spaces. Now delete the cross-linked files.  Examine the copies and try to assemble them properly.  Good luck.  (Hint:  \\\"Missing pieces\\\" are likely to be found in those \\\"lost chains\\\" at the top...)   Your disk is pretty close to full.  This may be the actual cause of the problem; perhaps Windows needed to expand its swapfile by an amount which exceeded available disk space...  In any case, the short summary is that something trashed your FAT. There are utilities that can mirror your FAT and help repair damage after something like this, but you have to run them _before_ the problem occurs.  Sorry.   --  ---------------------------------------------------- Gordon S.

I have figured out  that they'll only work with DOS 2.something.            If anyone can give me some pointers on this one, I'd be most  appreciative.

Thanks.\",\"I suspect that this clipper thing could backfire on the Gov in a big hurry. I expect that products using these chips will socket them rather than soldering them, since once the keys are handed over by the escrow agencies, the chip is so much garbage, and will need to be replaced. I expect that someone will come along with a pin compatible chip that uses secure encryption -- possibly even disguised so that it's not possible to tell it from the clipper chip until you try to use the 2 backdoor keys.     If I were to manufacture such a chip, as part of my marketing strategy, I would try to subvert one or both escrow agencies either through bribes or industrial espionage -- and then publicize the fact. (doing my best not to be connected with such activities -- which would likely not be legal :-) Publicly discrediting the escrow agencies would go quite far towards creating a market for a secure alternative.    I also believe that someone will reverse engineer the clipper chip, and knowlege of the algorithm will likely be fairly widespread. Any back- doors or weaknesses would further discredit the scheme, and help grow the market demand for a secure alternative.   I believe that the company that provides such an alternative will make few friends in the LE community, but lots of money. I also believe that the government will do it's best to make such plug replacements illegal. I expect that they will see the same success in limiting the availability of such alternatives as they have seen in limiting the availability of certain illicit drugs -- ie. little to none.\",\" Actually, they won't.  What they'll tell you is that if you add up the number of suicides, murders of one drug dealer by another, legit self-defenses of a battered spouse, and so on, you'll end up with a number that is much larger than the number of self-defense killings against strangers committed in the bedroom.  (BTW - they didn't honestly count the latter either, but let's not quibble.)  They try to claim that comparison is between the costs of self-defense and the benefits, but they're wrong.  This comparison doesn't measure the costs of self-defense and it doesn't measure the benefits either.  For example, the goal is not to kill the attacker, whatever your relationship to him, but to stop him. While the number of killings may be proportional to the number of stops, it isn't equal.  Anyone who confuses that comparison with an honest evaluation is either lying or....  -andy\",\"Today's atrocity in Waco has finally impelled me to start working on something I've been thinking about for some time.  Over the last few years I have heard of one case after another of government running completely amok.  Unfortunately, most people are oblivious of the government's crimes and still think of it as their protector.  So I intend to put together what I call the \\\"American Horror File\\\": a compilation of cases where the American government has run roughshod over the rights of its citizens over the last few years, focusing especially on deaths and injuries resulting from no-knock warrants, and financial ruin to innocents resulting from civil forfeiture laws, but including any other cases for which I can find decent documentation.  I hope to make people blood-boiling, artery-bursting, red-hot enraged at their government.  The end result will probably be a book in electronic form (ASCII text and postscript files) detailing the government's crimes of recent years.  This book will be distributed at cost, and I will encourage people to post copies to BBS's, send copies on disk to friends, and print out copies and give them to neighbors.  This is a call for your help.  Any information that you can send me on how government is running amok will be greatly appreciated.  I would prefer information that is well-documented, with sources given, about specific instances of governmental abuses.  I also welcome anyone who wants to join me in collecting and researching information for this project. \",\"            101 Courageous Dr.            Leage City, TX  77573           Phone: (713) 538-6000               Good Luck!

That you have to right to express whatever you want in whatever form your little heart desires so long as you do not impinge on the rights of others.  Encrypted text/sound/video is just another form of expression of that particular text/sound/video.  Just like digitized sound is another  means of expression of sound -- streams of 100100101111 instead of continuous waveforms.  Also, it shouldn't be up to the government at all.  Encryption  _Standards_ can be decided upon by Independent Standards Orgainizations (apologies for the acronym).  One can note how well this has worked with ISO and the Metric System, SAE, etc.  Independent entities  or consortia of people/industries in that particular area are far more qualified to set standards than any One government agency. Consider for example what the Ascii character set would have looked like if it was decided by the government.  I hope this helps folks to formulate their defenses.

Instead, I wrote to Bentsen.  My letter was not exactly strongly-worded; I simply stated that the BATF approach was immoral (military-style assault, firing into a house where they knew there were kids).  Aparently, Bentsen forwarded my letter to the BATF and they responded to  me directly.  It follows the text of your reply pretty closely.  However, I intend to send another letter directly to them, in return.   This section is not in the letter that I received.

Anyone else catch ESPN's piece about prospects and the relationship between age, career length, MVPs and Hall of Fame members? It was part of their preseason special. Basically, they looked  at players that had amassed 1000 plate appearances (or ABs) by the time they were 24, and noticed some interesting things.     For starters, they found out such players comprised the majority of MVPs in the history of the game. They also found out such players represented the majority of the players in the hall of fame. The kicker, though, was that they actually did some number-crunching and found that such players' careers lasted much longer than the careers of players not in that group. They also   found that these players produced at both a greater level of performance and produced over twice the raw totals (HRs, etc) of the other players. The first group outhit the second something like .282 to .260 in raw BA, and blew away the second group in such categories as HRs, 2Bs, RBIs, etc.     It was the most impressive thing I've seen on ESPN in recent memory.

They certainly emphasised a limited role for the federal government but this was not necessarily their true position.   The Senate was less powerful than the House of Lords in the period in question. The stripping of the powers of the House of Lords did not occur until 1914 and David Llloyd George's budget. Even despite this the House of Lords has considerable power even today and is far from a rubber stamping body.     The system is meant to be slow to react, the problem is that it ended up a bit too slow.    The Presiden't veto was meant to be entirely separate. Until Bush abused it in a quite extraordinary manner it was used more in accord with the intent of being a check on unreasonable legislation. The veto was clearly regarded  as a completely last gasp measure its use was meant to be restricted to preventing the legislature interfering with the actions of the executive.\",\"That plastic bodywork is useless. That torque, and an upright riding position is better than a slightly or radically forward riding position combined with a high-rpm low torque motor.  To a cruiser-motorcyclist, chrome has some importance. To sport-bike motorcyclists chrome has very little impact on buying choice.  Unless motivated solely by price, these are the criteria each rider uses to select the vehicle of choice.   To ignore these, as well as other criteria, would be insensitive. In other words, no one motorcycle can fufill the requirements that a sport-bike rider and a cruiser rider may have.(sometimes it's hard for *any* motorcycle to fufill a person's requirements)    You're fishing for flames, Dave.

You won't see this in the printer's docs, and the Apple rep didn't mention it to our users group either. It seems that SE ROMs won't support those \\\"features\\\". Okay, I  guess I should have somehow known that this was the case. Let the buyer beware, huh Apple?  Be that as it may, I have been thinking about the  problem and I'm puzzled. Why  can't a defencieny in the  ROM be made up for in software. I write software for a living (on unix platforms) and I don't understand the \\\"it just can't be done\\\" responses I've gotten from those I have asked so far.  Isn't Mode32, or somesuch piece of  soft- ware, just such a fix.   Anyway, I was hoping someone knowledgeable about Mac internals could set me straight: is it simply impossible for a mac SE to print grayscale, or could someone armed with enough info and a little pro- gramming experience cook something up that would supplement the ROM's capabilities?  Also, how does one know if one's mac can support the grayscale and photograde that the Select 300 is supposedly capable of?

By such a back- door (in the encryption algorithm perhaps) it would be possible (for   the manufacturer) to get the keys of all chips that were programmed in  one session. This would not, btw, enable anybody else to retrieve the  keys in the same way because they'll never get a bunch of 300 (N,U)  pairs with identical S1 and S2. (Note that these have to be constant  for the whole batch by the very nature of the procedure, i.e., they  have to be typed in manually by the `random number supplying agents'!)  And I was wondering why they'll always do 300 chips in one session ...  Since the procedure described by Ms Denning imposes high costs on the  production of every chip (at least three persons for one hour each,  plus the cost of a laptop finally blown to pieces in a spectacular,  Hollywood-like bonfire; add travelling expenses, drinks and lighting,  divide the sum by 300) there won't be a larger demand -- not from the  private sector anyway.

(1/3.4)     D = S  S  c  K  W     : crater diameter in km   g  p  f  n          (1/6)     S = (g /g )      : gravity correction factor for bodies other than      g   e  t        Earth, where g = 9.8 m/s^2 and g is the surface          e        t          gravity of the target body. This scaling is          cited for lunar craters and may hold true for          other bodies.    (1/3.4)     S = (p / p )     : correction factor for target density p  ,      p   a   t           t          p  = 1.8 g/cm^3 for alluvium at the Jangle U           a          crater site, p = 2.6 g/cm^3 for average          rock on the continental shields.

An RMS velocity of V = 20 km/sec may be used for Earth-crossing     asteroids.      Under these assumptions, the body which created the Barringer Meteor     Crater in Arizona (1.13 km diameter) would have been about 40 meters in     diameter.

It also has a very extensive reference  list covering essentially all of the reference material in the  field.]       MAP PROJECTIONS AND SPHERICAL TRIGNOMETRY      Two easy-to-find sources of map projections are the \\\"Encyclopaedia     Brittanica\\\", (particularly the older volumes) and a tutorial appearing     in _Graphics Gems_ (Academic Press, 1990). The latter was written with     simplicity of exposition and suitability of digital computation in mind     (spherical trig formulae also appear, as do digitally-plotted examples).      More than you ever cared to know about map projections is in John     Snyder's USGS publication \\\"Map Projections--A Working Manual\\\", USGS     Professional Paper 1395. This contains detailed descriptions of 32     projections, with history, features, projection formulas (for both     spherical earth and ellipsoidal earth), and numerical test cases. It's a     neat book, all 382 pages worth. This one's $20.      You might also want the companion volume, by Snyder and Philip Voxland,     \\\"An Album of Map Projections\\\", USGS Professional Paper 1453. This     contains less detail on about 130 projections and variants. Formulas are     in the back, example plots in the front. $14, 250 pages.      You can order these 2 ways. The cheap, slow way is direct from USGS:     Earth Science Information Center, US Geological Survey, 507 National     Center, Reston, VA 22092. (800)-USA-MAPS. They can quote you a price and     tell you where to send your money. Expect a 6-8 week turnaround time.      A much faster way (about 1 week) is through Timely Discount Topos,     (303)-469-5022, 9769 W. 119th Drive, Suite 9, Broomfield, CO 80021. Call     them and tell them what you want. They'll quote a price, you send a     check, and then they go to USGS Customer Service Counter and pick it up     for you. Add about a $3-4 service charge, plus shipping.      A (perhaps more accessible) mapping article is:   R. Miller and F. Reddy, \\\"Mapping the World in Pascal\\\",  Byte V12 #14, December 1987   Contains Turbo Pascal procedures for five common map projections. A  demo program, CARTOG.PAS, and a small (6,000 point) coastline data  is available on CompuServe, GEnie, and many BBSs.

Convert parallax into distance using the     formula in part 6 of the FAQ, convert RA and declination to coordinates     on a unit sphere (see some of the references on planetary positions and     spherical trignometry earlier in this section for details on this), and     scale this by the distance.

The objection naturally is in the way in which you phrase it.  Easter (or Eashtar or Ishtar or Ishtarti or other spellings) is the pagan whore goddess of fertility.  Therefore, your question to me is \\\"what is the objection to celebration of the pagan whore goddess?\\\"  When phrased that way I suspect (or at least I would HOPE) that it becomes immeadiately apparent what my objection to \\\"celebrating\\\" her would be.    > It is celebration of the resurrection of Jesus.         No, you are thinking perhaps of \\\"Ressurection Sunday\\\" I think.  (Though I'm not too crazy about the word \\\"Sunday\\\", but I certainly like this phrasing much better than envoking the name of the whore goddess.)      For that matter, stay Biblical and call it Omar Rasheet (The Feast of First Fruits).  Torah commands that this be observed on the day following the Sabbath of Passover week.  (Sunday by any other name in modern parlance.)  Why is there so much objection to observing the Resurrection on the 1st day of the week on which it actually occured?  Why jump it all over the calendar the way Easter does?  Why not just go with the Sunday following Passover the way the Bible has it?  Why seek after unbiblical methods?    > I don't recall a command in Scripture for us to celebrate  > the resurrection, but it is the sole and only reason that  > we are Christians--how could we not celebrate it?         So what does this question have to do with Easter (the whore goddess)?  I am all for celebrating the Resurrection.  Just keep that whore out of the discussion.    > If it is only the name which is a problem, I suggest that if  > we are too concerned about etymology, there are a lot of  > words we are going to have to drop.  (As an aside, some  > terminally PC people here in Ottawa want dictionaries to be  > altered so that there are no negative definitions associated  > with the word _black_, so as not to offend people of colour.          Yes, I have heard of your newspapers speaking of the need to repave streets with \\\"Afro-Canadiantop\\\".  <grin> (I still think \\\"blacktop\\\" sounds better though.)    > As a short person, I hope they will also remove the definition  > \\\"curt or surly\\\" associated with my physical description.)          Fine by me.  And while we are at it, the left-handed people are both \\\"sinister\\\" and \\\"gauche\\\" so we probably will have some objections from that quarter as well.    > In Quebec French, the word for the celebration of the  > resurrection is \\\"Pa^ques\\\"--this is etymologically related  > to Pesach (Passover) and the pascal lamb.  So is the  > French Canadian (mostly Roman Catholic) celebration better  > because it uses the right name?         Yes, that sounds much better to me.  Is there anyone out there would thinks that phrasing sounds worse?    > So from this I infer that there are different rules for  > Christians of Jewish descent?  What happened to \\\"there is  > neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for  > all are one in Christ Jesus\\\"?         Read the letter to Philemon.  Now tell me, was Philemon's \\\"slave\\\" returned to him?  Were there different rules upon the slave than upon Philemon?  How about male and female?  Are there different \\\"rules\\\" that apply to them as well?  Or if there is no more \\\"male and female\\\" can Adam and Steve get married to each other in your congregation?  Yes, there are differences in form and function.  But the way we come to Salvation in Messiah remains the same no matter what our position in life.   ---------------------------------------  [I am in general not in favor of continuing this discussion, as it seems repetitive, but this particular point is one that I believe is new -- the objection is not to having a holiday but to its name.  I'd like to suggest that people think very carefully about this argument.  Words often change their meaning over time.  The days of the week are of course originally based on pagan gods.  Some Christians prefer to refer to \\\"first day\\\", \\\"second day\\\", etc.  However the majority of Christians have not been persuaded.  The question seems to be whether it makes any difference what the dictionary shows as the derivation of a word, if what people mean by it and think when they use it is different.  Indeed I'd like to suggest that postings like this could themselves be dangerous.  Suppose people in general use Easter to mean the celebration of Christ's resurrection.  Postings trying to convince them that they really mean a celebration in honor of some godess run the risk of creating exactly the situation that they claim to oppose. They are doing their best to *create* a linkage in people's minds between their celebration and the pagan goddess.  It's not clear that this is a healthy thing.\",\"The file is frite20.zip and you'll find it in the 'icons' directory at Cica.

But not all of them did, which prompted an official renaming of the disease to Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (this renaming took place in the Annals of Internal Medicine, Jan. 1988, I believe). Now it's also called Chronic Fatigue and Immune Dysfunction Syndrome (CFIDS), since it seems clear that some sort of immune disregulation is causing the probs.

This is not the same thing as saying that the syndrome may have a (at least partly) psychological cause. The disagreement among people whose thoughts are worth considering centers on just what the cause is. No one knows, but theories include: psychological stress, some sort of virus (a retrovirus, say most -- maybe one of the newly discovered herpes viruses), environmental toxins, bacteria (and, yes, candida), genes, (and/)or some combo of these.

EDT                  Q   Why was the 10:00 a.m. postponed?                  MS. MYERS:  Just due to scheduling conflicts.  So as we  put out, the President will meet with the leaders of the national  police organizations at 2:00 p.m. in the Rose Garden, as opposed to  10:00 a.m.  The only other things on his schedule today are:  At  11:00 a.m. he'll meet with General Vessey, who, as you know, is on  his way to Vietnam to continue working on the MIA-POW issue.  At  12:30 p.m. he'll have lunch with the Vice President in the Oval  Office.  And at 2:00 p.m. he'll meet with the police organizations. Then from 3:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. he'll do his weekly photos with the  various groups.              Q   A photo op with Vessey?              MS. MYERS:  There's no coverage on the Vessey meeting.              Q   Why?              MS. MYERS:  Why?  It's a closed meeting.                Q   What about the lunch?              MS. MYERS:  The lunch?  No, there's no coverage.              Q   Is he meeting with any congress people today?              MS. MYERS:  Nothing scheduled.              Q   There are no meetings --              MS. MYERS:  There are no congressional meetings today,  no.              Q   Has the President been given any information by the  Pentagon or reached any conclusion about the validity of this report  from Hanoi?  Any instructions to Vessey on how to deal with the  Vietnamese on that subject?              MS. MYERS:  Well, clearly, the report is the first order  of business.  It's high on the agenda on something that they'll  discuss.  I think the President and General Vessey will discuss the  parameters of his visit to Vietnam today, but the President hasn't  drawn any conclusions about the report yet.  Certainly, it's  something that he wants General Vessey to talk with the Vietnamese  about first.              Q   Did the President talk with any Republican senators  yesterday about the stimulus package?              MS. MYERS:  He spoke with Senator Dole.              Q   How many times?              MS. MYERS:  I believe once during the day and once last  night.              Q   What was the outcome of that?              MS. MYERS:  They're continuing to work toward some kind  of an agreement on a jobs package.              Q   Is it your impression that Senator Dole is in any  way flexible on this?              MS. MYERS:  Well, I think we're hopeful that we're going  to get some kind of jobs package through the Senate, and we'll  continue to work with Senator Dole and others until we reach some  kind of an agreement.              Q   Did they discuss the VAT tax?              MS. MYERS:  I don't know if that came up.              Q   Can you check that?              MS. MYERS:  Sure.        Q   So what are they -- is the President offering to  scale down his program -- is that what he's trying to do, buy it down  to where Dole will sign on?              MS. MYERS:  Well, he's trying to protect as much of it  as he can.  But it's important to him to get some kind of a jobs  package through the Senate and through Congress now.  And as soon as  we reach some conclusions on that, we'll let you know.  But at the  moment, he's continuing to consult with members of Congress  including, obviously, Senator Dole.              Q   Is he talking to anybody else?              MS. MYERS:  I don't believe he talked to any other  Republicans yesterday.              Q   Is he talking to anybody today?              MS. MYERS:  I don't think anything is scheduled, but I  wouldn't rule it out.              Q   We were led to believe that the President called  Mr. Dole on the subject of Russian aid and that Bob Dole brought the  conversation around to stimulus package.  Is that correct?              MS. MYERS:  I think the President has contacted several  people on Russian aid.  I think that it was always expected that the  stimulus package or the jobs package will be part of any conversation  he would have with Senator Dole.  The primary objective of the  conversation was Russian aid.  That was the first order of business,  but it was both.              Q   In the President's mind, are they linked  politically in that if the Republicans continue to reject the  stimulus package, he thinks it will be harder to sell Russian aid to  the American people?  Has he made that argument?              MS. MYERS:  I can't talk about specifically what  arguments he might have made.  The President is obviously committed  to both.  He liked to see a jobs package to the American people  first.  But as you know, we outlined the details of additional  Russian aid last night in Tokyo.              Q   But does the President believe that the stimulus  package will make it more difficult to persuade Americans to vote for  Russian -- to accept a vote for Russian aid?              MS. MYERS:  I think that the President is going to  continue to work to pass the stimulus package, to pass a jobs  package, and we're still hopeful that we'll get some kind of jobs  package through the Congress.              Q   Is it fair to say that the President is negotiating  now with Dole?              MS. MYERS:  He's discussing options with him.              Q   On the stimulus, is it your understanding that over  the break some Democrats, themselves, have left the support that they  had earlier for the package, the stimulus package?              MS. MYERS:  I think we still have wide support in the  Senate for the jobs package.              Q   But specifically, that you've lost Democrats other  than Shelby?              MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so.  There hasn't been a  vote.              Q   What about Kohl?              Q   Kohl and Feingold?              MS. MYERS:  There hasn't been a vote yet.  And we'll  continue to work with senators to try to get a majority to try to  bring the package to a vote, because we believe that a majority of  the members of the United States Senate support the package.              Q   If you're weren't worried about Kohl and Feingold,  why did George mention Milwaukee projects the other day?              MS. MYERS:  I think George pointed out a number of  projects in a number of states that stand to be funded, or to lose  funding if this jobs package doesn't pass.              Q   No Democrats.  (Laughter.)              MS. MYERS:  I'll let you draw your own conclusions.              Q   Does he plan to talk to Dole again today or any  other Republicans again today?              MS. MYERS:  There's nothing specifically scheduled, but  again, I wouldn't rule it out.              Q   Does he plan to put out any more press releases to  any other states today?              MS. MYERS:  What we've done is we're in the process of  breaking down the benefits of the jobs package state by state.  I  think it's entirely feasible that as we sort of are able to sum those  up, we'll send out press releases to the various states that suggest  how their states would benefit from this package.              Q   Will you share those with us?              MS. MYERS:  Sure.  As we did yesterday.              Q   Do you have copies of the ones you sent --              MS. MYERS:  Yes, we made those available yesterday.  And  we certainly can continue to provide them today.              Q   Dee Dee, since yesterday's questions and subsequent  stories about the VAT, what further consideration of this issue has  been given?              MS. MYERS:  Nothing's changed since yesterday.  I think  the President commented on it this morning to say only that it was  something he knew was being considered by the task force and that he  has not made a decision on, and I don't think we have anything to add  to that.              Q   But he also said that business and labor groups are  telling him they support it.  Can you tell us --              MS. MYERS:  I think that there has been -- I'm not going  to speculate on who supports it.  I think the President said that  there has been some support among business and labor groups.  I don't  think he said he was directly contacted by them.              Q   Are we to take that to mean that the administration  has sounded out business and labor groups on this --              MS. MYERS:  I think there's been plenty of public  discourse on this over the years and even recently, but I don't think  I want to add to that.              Q   In February, though, the President said that this  was something to be considered 10 or 15 years down the road.  What  has happened between then and now to cause this administration to  change its mind?              MS. MYERS:  I think as we said yesterday, it is  something that the working groups are looking at.  They're  considering a wide variety of options on everything from funding to  specific options that will be covered by the President's health care  plan.  The President has not taken it up yet, has not made a decision  on it.  And beyond that, I don't have anything to add.              Q   You haven't answered the question.  It wasn't being  considered by anyone in the White House after the President's  comments in February, and George reaffirmed that in a briefing.              Q   And then suddenly --              Q   What happened?        MS. MYERS:  The working groups, as we have said  throughout, we instructed to consider a wide variety of options  across-the-board.  And one of the things that has been talked about  and that they are clearly considering is some kind of a value-added  tax.        Q   But the President himself took this off the table,  Dee Dee, and suddenly it reappears.  And this goes to the credibility  of this administration in a way.  What has happened in the meantime?        MS. MYERS:  The President has not looked at this, it  hasn't been presented to him, again, yet.  The working groups are  looking at it, as they're looking at a wide variety of options, and  no decisions have been made.        Q   And it raises the question of how independently the  task force is working.        MS. MYERS:  The task force was instructed to consider  all options, and they've taken that mandate seriously and they're  considering all options.        Q   But that's not the impression that the President  left in February.  The impression he left was that this was something  that was long-range, to be looked at 10, 15 years down the road.  The  clear implication of his remarks was that this was something that was  not on the table, not an option.         Q   \\\"If it changes I'll tell you.\\\"              Q   Bring him on.        Q   And you repeatedly referred to the President's  remarks, telling us that those were still in operation.              MS. MYERS:  It's changed, and we told you.  (Laughter.)              Q   But that's what Alice Rivlin's comments and Donna  Shalala comments were about.  I mean, that seemed like an  orchestrated effort because you have two independent Cabinet officers  --        MS. MYERS:  I wouldn't -- no, Alice Rivlin's not a  Cabinet member, first of all.  Second of all, it was not  orchestrated, but clearly, they both said yesterday and in the last  couple of days that it's something that's being looked at.  We  confirmed that yesterday.  And I don't have anything to add to that.        Q   Is it because he has very few options?        Q   Is this something that it will be incumbent upon  the task force to convince the President about?  In other words, has  the President himself personally ruled it out and it's now up to the  task force to convince him to put it back on the table?  Or is it, in  fact, back on the table, having been placed there by discussions with  the President?          MS. MYERS:  It is not the working group's mission at  this point to convince the President of anything.  It is their  mission to put before him his options and to explain the benefits and  the costs and the basic pros and cons of each of those options.  I  think that they will certainly present the VAT to him in that  context, and at this point he's not -- that presentation has not been  made, but it's something that he will hear and he has not made a  decision on.        Q   They will present it to him as one of his options,  though he specifically ruled it out?        MS. MYERS:  Correct.        Q   Dee Dee, is this more than a trial balloon?  Is  this a serious consideration that the working groups are giving to  this form of taxation?        MS. MYERS:  It's simply a statement of fact.  The  working groups are considering a wide variety of options on a number  of issues relating to health care reform.  One of the options that  they're looking at is the VAT.         Q   Dee Dee, when the working groups were examining  this possibility, was this on the table during the same time period  that you were telling us that it was not?        MS. MYERS:  I don't know what the specific timing of  their drafting of options is.  I don't know.        Q   Who was telling you that it was not under  consideration?        MS. MYERS:  I was referring back to the President's  comments.        Q   Have they discovered that the sin taxes won't raise  enough money to fund the core benefit package?        MS. MYERS:  No, there's no decisions that have been made  on how to pay for the health care plan.              Q   I'm asking whether the projections --              MS. MYERS:  There's a number of options depending on how  the plan is structured.  You can't decide how much the plan is going  to cost until you decide what the plan is going to look like.  And so  you can't discuss what financing options have been ruled in our out  until you know.        Q   Dee Dee, we've been told that they have a computer  models on a number of possible packages.        MS. MYERS:  Correct.          Q   The question is whether they have now determined  whether sin taxes would not produce enough money for even the barest  minimum package.  That is not a very difficult computation.        MS. MYERS:  It is a question that you know that we're  not going to answer until -- there's a number of options being  considered.  It depends on how the package is structured.  The exact  details of the package and the financing mechanisms used to pay for  them are all among the decisions that have yet to be made.                Q   And when the President has been meeting with health  care -- his health care advisors, which we are told he has been doing  --              MS. MYERS:  Correct.              Q      they have never once said to him, these are your  funding options, including the VAT?  He has never heard the word VAT  in his --              MS. MYERS:    I am not going to comment on the specific  nature of the daily -- they're not daily, but the quasi-regular  briefings.              Q   Well, you have.              MS. MYERS:  I have not, other than to say that he's not  considered the VAT.  And I think that is a true statement.              Q   No, but you said that it has not been presented to  him as an option.              MS. MYERS:  Correct.              Q   That doesn't mean he hasn't heard about it.              MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to get into the details of  what's discussed.  I think that statement stands for itself.              Q      specific, Dee Dee.  When you say he hasn't  looked at it, do you mean that he hasn't looked at it in terms of  paying for medical coverage, or hasn't looked at it in general?   Because back in Chilicothe he was very specific in defining how it  works, what the advantages are, the whole thing.  It sounds like --              MS. MYERS:  But that was -- I think in Chilicothe, if  you go back to his remarks there, it was a broader philosophical  discussion of the tax structure.  And I think the comments were  generally in reference to the overall economic plan.  But clearly,  it's something that he's thought about in the broad context.  I mean,  that was clear in Chilicothe.  What I'm saying is that in the process  of the working groups it's something that he hasn't considered yet.   It's something that the working groups will present to him among the  number of options, and that no decisions have been made.  And I'm not  going to comment any further on the details of the meetings where  health care issues are being discussed.              Q   It's your statement from this podium that no  discussion of this has taken place.  You say that no option -- that  the option has not been presented to him.              MS. MYERS:  That is correct.              Q   Do you stand by -- does the White House still stand  by George's statement in March that this will not be in the proposal?              MS. MYERS:  No decisions have been made.  We have  nothing to add to what's already been said.              Q   Let me follow up here.  Do you stand by what Rivlin  said yesterday, that if any kind of VAT were to be used or  considered, that other changes to the tax code would have to be made  so that it would be less regressive?              MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to comment any further on what  might happen if.              Q   But do you stand by the previous conversations in  February that if there were to be a VAT, I think the President said  you'd exclude food and energy --              MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to comment on the specific  structure of a decision that hasn't been made.              Q   Was the President aware prior to Donna Shalala's  comments yesterday that this was under consideration by the working  groups?              MS. MYERS:  I don't know specifically what --              Q   Could you check for us, because that's a real  important credibility question?              MS. MYERS:  Sure.              Q   Since the task force was brought together this  issue has been discussed, at the beginning and throughout, as one  fairly painless way to raise a lot of money.  Were you all kept in  the dark?  Was the Press Office kept in the dark over the past month  and a half when you've been denying that a VAT tax would be  considered that it was actually on the table over there as an option?              MS. MYERS:  I think we've said all that we have to say.   It is something the working groups are looking at.  The President has  not made a decision about it yet.  And beyond that, I have nothing to  add.              Q   Well, sorry, Dee Dee, there are still a couple of  questions that we are going to have to ask because we have a problem  with credibility here -- yours primarily.  What we're asking is, if  you all were not told at all that this thing was being considered  while you were coming out here and telling us that it was not, or if  it's a case that you were coming out here and deliberately misleading  us.              MS. MYERS:  I don't believe that anyone has ever come  out here and deliberately misled you from this podium -- ever --ever.              Q   Has anyone tried to shade it a little bit to  indicate something -- has anybody told anybody to come out --              MS. MYERS:  We're not trying to shade answers or  deliberately mislead anybody.  I've said what I have to say about  this issue.              Q   All we were trying to find out --              MS. MYERS:  I understand what you're trying to find out  and I've given you the answers, Helen.              Q   We're trying to find out what changed -- what made  it an option again.  That's the --              MS. MYERS:  The working groups were given a broad  mandate to investigate all options, and they are doing that.                Q   Yes, but it wasn't an option before.  How can you  investigate it if the President has taken it off the table?              MS. MYERS:  It is something that they're obviously  considering and the President has not made a decision on.              Q   Yes, but he took it off the table in February.              MS. MYERS:  Working groups are considering it.  They'll  present it to the President at some point and he'll make a decision.              Q   Why would they consider it if he has taken it off  the table?              MS. MYERS:  It's clearly on the table.               Q   Yes, but he took it off the table.  Did he change  his mind?              MS. MYERS:  It's back on the table, Bill.              Q   Did he change his mind?              MS. MYERS:  He said this morning that he hasn't made a  decision about it.  He obviously knows that it's on the table.  It's  something that he will look at at some and when we have a decision on  this we'll let you know.              Q   So he must have changed his mind, right?              MS. MYERS:  At some point it will be looked at.  I mean,  --              Q   Dee Dee, there's like two options -- either he  changed his mind or the working groups think they're authority  exceeds the President's.              MS. MYERS:  The working groups were given a broad  mandate to look at all options; they've done that.              Q   Are you going to put out his income tax?              MS. MYERS:  Yes, there will be something available on  his income tax probably later this afternoon.  His return will be  available.               Q   Will there be any kind of briefing to go through  it?              MS. MYERS:  No, nothing's planned.  I think someone will  be available, probably not in a briefing setting, but to walk you  through the questions.              Q   We're used to be walked line-by-line through the  presidential tax forms.              MS. MYERS:  I've seen those briefings.  (Laughter.)              Q   Could we have one?              MS. MYERS:   No, I don't think there will be any kind of  a formal briefing, but there will be somebody available to answer  your questions about it.              Q   Did they file a joint form?              MS. MYERS:  Yes.              Q   When did he file it?              MS. MYERS:  I believe it's being filed today.              Q   Dee Dee, is there going to be a backgrounder for  Miyazawa?              MS. MYERS:  No, there will be a readout after the  meeting.              Q   No backgrounder today?              MS. MYERS:  No backgrounder today.              Q   This is complicated stuff.  We need help.   (Laughter.)              MS. MYERS:  We can't give you taxes and Miyazawa all in  one day, it's too confusing.  (Laughter.)              Q   Vance and Owen have opened the doors on the use of  force in Bosnia.   They've both said that, A, they never ruled it  out, and B, it might be necessary now.  Does that influence your  thinking on whether or not to change your approach?              MS. MYERS:  There's been no change in our policy towards  Bosnia.  We have always said that we'd consider --              Q   But does that impact upon your decision?  Are they  people whose opinions would carry weight with you?              MS. MYERS:  They're people whose opinions carry weight  certainly.  I mean, the President supports the process that they've  initiated.  But there's been no change in our policy for Bosnia,  although we're considering a number of options right now.  If the  Serbs don't come back to the negotiating table, if they don't sign on  to some kind of an agreement, we will consider additional options,  which we've been saying regularly.              Q   One follow-up question then?  We cannot get a  straight answer from anyone in the administration.  Why do you not  set a deadline for the Serbs?  Can you tell us the strategic or  tactical reasons for not giving them a deadline to come to the table?              MS. MYERS:  We're continuing to put pressure on them  every day.              Q   Which doesn't work so --              MS. MYERS:  Well, we think it is having some effect.   We're going to continue to tighten sanctions.  As you know, we  support the omnibus resolution.  We expect that to come to a vote on  the 26th.                Q   You say it's having an effect -- can you give us  any documentation?              MS. MYERS:  I'd be happy to provide somebody to talk to  you about the impact of the sanctions and things like that.              Q   There's been no -- you have not been able to  provide anybody who can tell us that the sanctions have had any  effect in Bosnia.  Serbia, yes; in Bosnia, no.              MS. MYERS:  I think that they've had effect in Serbia  and we think they've had some effect in Bosnia.  And again, I'll be  happy to provide somebody to walk you through the details of that, if  you'd like.              Q   We would like to hear from someone who can show us  what the effect has been in Bosnia.  We had the briefing on all of  the terrible things that are happening in Belgrade, but we haven't  seen anything that indicates an impact on the fighting.  Can you  provide something along those lines?              MS. MYERS:  I will see what I can get you.              Q   On the extra Russian aid that Christopher announced  this morning -- where is that money coming from?              MS. MYERS:  We'll have to work with Congress on the  details of that package.              Q   So that would be new money that you would hope to  get?              MS. MYERS:    Yes, that's new money, in addition to the  $1.6 billion announced in Vancouver.  So I assume that you all have  seen the $1.8-billion package that was announced this morning in  Tokyo by Secretary Christopher.              Q   Isn't there a concern, though, about offering  something which you have to get in Congress?  I mean, that was the  concern with Vancouver; you didn't want to do that.              MS. MYERS:  The concern with Vancouver was to do  something immediately, which required money that was already approved  in the Fiscal '93 budget.  What we're looking at now is a little bit  longer-term plan to build on top of the $1.6 billion that we  announced in Vancouver.  This clearly will require congressional  approval, or some of it will anyway, and we're going to continue to  work with Congress to make that happen.              Q   To what extent has that been vetted or agreed to by  Congress?              MS. MYERS:  The President has had a number of  conversations with members and will continue to work with them as  this process moves forward.              Q   Was Christopher able to put this package out with a  fair degree of understanding that you will be able to get it through  Congress?              MS. MYERS:  It was created in consultation with  Congress.              Q   In meeting with the law enforcement officials, is  that -- does that have a set speech and a goal?  A direction?              MS. MYERS:  Yes, the President will talk about -- and  the law enforcement organizations are endorsing the President's jobs  package.  They believe particularly the summer jobs package will help  give kids something to do.              Q   Who are they?              MS. MYERS:  It's members or leadership from three  organizations:  NAPO, which is the National Association of Police  Organizations; IBPO, which is the International Brotherhood of Police  Organizations, I believe; and IUPA, which is the International Union  of Police Associations.              Q   Will the FBI chief be there?              MS. MYERS:  The FBI chief?  No.              Q   Or any other federal law enforcement officials?              MS. MYERS:  No, it will be the President and these  national law enforcement organization leaders.              Q   Does the $1.8 billion announced today include the  $400 million that's in the FY '94 budget for disarmament?              MS. MYERS:  No.  The Nunn-Lugar money is separate.              Q   So this would be the $700 million that's in the  budget already, plus another $1.1 billion?              MS. MYERS:  I believe all of this is on top of the $700  million already in the budget.              Q   Is this going to be part of the supplemental or  Fiscal '94 --              MS. MYERS:  We'll work with Congress on the exact  funding mechanism -- on exactly how this will be paid for.              Q   This $1.8 billion on top of --              MS. MYERS:  On top of $700 million -- on top of the $400  million Nunn-Lugar money we announced earlier.              Q   And this is what prompted the President to call Bob  Dole -- it was on this tranche, not on the previous money he was  calling Bob Dole?              MS. MYERS:  Correct.              Q   Is there a briefing on Miyazawa?              MS. MYERS:  There will be a readout after the meeting  with Miyazawa.  Tomorrow.              Q   Dee Dee, on a totally unrelated matter, some  Republicans who are active in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are  complaining about this new cozy relationship between the White House  and the Chamber of Commerce.  There are -- the town hall meeting the  other night, the satellite and all of this relationship. Does the White House feel that you're getting too close to these  Chambers of Commerce?              MS. MYERS:  That's an interesting charge.  (Laughter.)   After how many years of Democrats being accused of not paying any  attention to the Chambers, now there are those who would accuse us of  being too close.  I think that's interesting.  But no, we're thrilled  by the support we've received from the national Chamber and local  Chambers across the country and we'll continue to work with them on  this and other initiatives.              Q   What's the status of the President thinking about  going to this Democratic retreat?              MS. MYERS:  It's on his calendar.  I think he'll almost  certainly go.              Q   All three days?              MS. MYERS:  We haven't figured out exactly when he'll be  there yet.                Q   Is it open to coverage?              MS. MYERS:  No, I believe the whole thing is closed.              Q   Is he going to have any kind of address, statement,  anything at all on the gay rights march on the 25th?              MS. MYERS:  We're still looking at that.  We haven't  made a final decision about how we'll -- who will make a statement or  what --              Q   Any meetings scheduled with any of the leaders?              MS. MYERS:  Nothing is scheduled, but I wouldn't rule it  out.              Q   What about an AIDS czar?              MS. MYERS:  It's coming.              Q   Anything on the weekend?              Q   There's been a suggestion that he's going to this  retreat to avoid having to participate in the gay rights -- or appear  or have any involvement in the gay rights march.              MS. MYERS:  No, I think this is something he's been  discussing for a long time -- appearing at the Senate Democratic  retreat.              Q   The weekend?              MS. MYERS:  Weekend?  Don't know -- the only thing on  right now is the radio address on Saturday.              Q   Any travel plans?              MS. MYERS:  If it changes -- none right now.              Q   He's not going to be off campaigning for his  stimulus package?              MS. MYERS:  No specific plans right now.              Q   What about mid-week?  Anything likely?              MS. MYERS:  It's possible.  Yes, I think it's likely  that we'll travel next week -- certainly the weekend.              Q   Has he called Thurmond about his daughter?              MS. MYERS:  I don't know.  I'll check.              Q   Going to name a drug czar this weekend?              MS. MYERS:  This weekend?  I don't believe so.              Q   And the radio address on Saturday -- is that going  to be focused on the stimulus package?              MS. MYERS:  I'm sure it will.              THE PRESS:  Thank you.\",\"   I've had the board for over a year, and it does work with Diskdoubler, but not with Autodoubler, due to a licensing problem with Stac Technologies, the owners of the board's compression technology. (I'm writing this from memory; I've lost the reference. Please correct me if I'm wrong.)  Using the board, I've had problems with file icons being lost, but it's hard to say whether it's the board's fault or something else; however, if I decompress the troubled file and recompress it without the board, the icon usually reappears. Because of the above mentioned licensing problem, the freeware expansion utility DD Expand will not decompress a board-compressed file unless you have the board installed.  Since Stac has its own product now, it seems unlikely that the holes in Autodoubler/Diskdoubler related to the board will be fixed. Which is sad, and makes me very reluctant to buy Stac's product since they're being so stinky. (But hey, that's competition.) -- \",\"If one is a vegan (a vegetarian taht eats no animal products at at i.e eggs,  milk, cheese, etc., after about 3 years of a vegan diet, you need to start  taking B12 supplements because b12 is found only in animals.)

I'm nearly contridicting myself  with the mish-mash of knowledge I've gleaned.\",\"I have a question about tires for my Guzzi. It is a '75 850-T. The tires that were on it when I just bought it are old and cracked. I do not have an owners manual for it (yet), but the tires listed in the Haynes manual are: Front, 3,50 H 18 ; Rear 4.10 H 18, and pressures recommended are 26 front and 33 rear. Oddly, the pressure for the same tire on the T-3 is listed at 29 psi instead. Anyone know the reason? As I know though, the pressure I should run at is that recommended by the manufacturer of the new tires I purchase.  The real question I have is this. The old tires that are on the bike are for the front, a Metzler Touring Special, 4.10 H 18, and for the rear an Avon Roadrunner 4.70 H 18, (120/90) H 18 as marked on each tire. Both are larger than that listed in the Haynes Manual. What does the owners manual recommend, and was it common to go up one size for this bike? Also, this will be my first motorcycle with innertubes. Any comments on the various manufacturers inner tube qualities?  The above sizes are inches (except for the additional mark on the current rear tire). What is the best metric match? The local BMW dealer thought 100/90 H 18 on the front and 120/90 H 18 on the back. He also happens to be very good at getting close to matching mail order prices.  I am thinking of going with a Metzler ME33 Laser (possibly Comp K) on the front and ME88 on the back, both in MBS variety if possible (the longer  lasting belting system). I already use the ME33 on both the Vision and FJ for the front, and like it, and I thought that with the shaft drive behavior and torque from the Guzzi that the ME88 might give more predictable back end control and sliding behavior than a ME55 might, as well as giving much better tire milage life. Any comments?  A friend told me he thought that my bike had Boranni rims which are very good, but are relatively soft and have delicate sidewalls. I do not wish to mount the tires myself this first time, so aside from warning the shop to be careful, any other comments I should make? I havn't looked at the rim to check out the make yet, if it is marked. He just told me late yesterday and I havn't had a chance to check the rim type.  On another note. I will remove the ugly (but in good shape....anyone want it?) Vetter fairing, and I will run without a windscreen for a while, but eventually I would like a simple rounded cafe' style quarter fairing for it. It could be fork/handlebar mounted. Any suggestions? Is there such a thing as a frame mounted quarter fairing of the cafe' style for this bike? How about lower bars/clip-ons for it? I would like to restore the bike into a good condition runner with a few modern updates, but while not being historically exactly accurate still have it reflect relatively well a representation of the cafe' style. (Yes I know to be picky, that period really predates this bike....it is just that this bike has such potential for _that_ look.)  -----------------------------Edward Walsh----Hewlett-Packard Company-------                              edw@boi.hp.com  Disk Memory Division, MS475                              (208)323-2174   P.O.

The difference was the amount of inside padding.  My solution was to buy a large helmet, and construct a removable liner  from a sheet of .5\\\" closed-cell foam and some satin (glued to the inside surface).  The result is a reasonably snug fit on my smallest-headed pillion with the liner in, and a comfortable fit on my largest-headed pillion with the liner out.  Everyone else gets linered or not by best fit.    -- \",\"Hello, my friends and I are running the Homewood Fantasy Baseball League (pure fantasy baseball teams). Unfortunely, we are running the league using Earl Weaver Baseball II with the Comm. Disk II and we need the stats for the 1992 season.

He is only insurance in case of extra innings or the 2nd catcher is injured during a game.     So to free up this roster spot for an extra pinch hitter or reliever, why not invoke a catcher re-substitution rule:  If the last roster catcher on a team is injured during a game, the team is permitted to substitute in his place for defensive purposes a catcher who has previously been yanked from the game.     Given this rule, a team wouldn't need 3 roster catchers.  The 3rd catcher could be playing in AAA or be a non-roster bullpen catcher.\",\": Marian CATHOLIC high school, outside of chicago: :  : 666 south ASHLAND avenue. :  Actually, Satanism is technically inverted Catholicism. \",\" To which Mark Ira Kaufman responds:  Mark, Were you one of the millions of Americans cheering the slaughter of Iraqi civilians by US forces in 1991?

Every once in a while, we run into \\\"The Black Screen of Death\\\", a phrase coined by Robert X. Cringely in a recent InfoWorld column.    Basically, sometimes when you quit Windows, the screen goes black and you get a nice little flashing cursor in the top left corner of your screen.  Also, sometimes when you exit to DOS, the same effect occurs. Cringely hints that Microsoft and/or Novell has a patch for Windows' virtual interrupt controller that  may solve this.  Neither company seems to know what I am talking about when I call them.  Has anyone else noticed this phenomenon?    Is there a fix for it?  Any response is welcome.\",\"Sorry about not mentioning platform... my original post was to mac.programmer, and then decided to post here to comp.graphics.

the    massacres there including Deir Yassen,    though with the numbers of massacred men, children and women are     greatly minimized.  As per request of Hasan:  From _The Revolt_, by Menachem Begin, Dell Publishing, NY, 1977:  [pp. 225-227]      \\\"Apart from the military aspect, there is a moral aspect to the story of Dir Yassin. At that village, whose name was publicized throughout the world, both sides suffered heavy casualties. We had four killed and nearly forty wounded. The number of casualties was nearly forty percent of the total number of the attackers. The Arab troops suffered casualties neraly three times as heavy. The fighting was thus very severe. Yet the hostile propaganda, disseminated throughout the world, deliberately ignored the fact that the civilian population of Dir Yassin was actually given a warning by us before the battle began. One of our tenders carrying a loud speaker was stationed at the entrance to the village and it exhorted in Arabic all women, children and aged to leave their houses and to take shelter on the slopes of the hill.  By giving this humane warning our fighters threw away the element of complete surprise, and thus increased their own risk in the ensuing battle. A substantial number of the inhabitants obeyed the warning and they were unhurt. A few did not leave their stone houses - perhaps because of the confusion. The fire of the enemy was murderous - to which the number of our casualties bears eloquent testimony. Our men were compelled to fight for every house; to overcome the enemy they used large numbers of hand grenades. And the civilians who had disregarded our warnings suffered inevitable casualties.      \\\"The education which we gave our soldiers throughout the years of revolt was based on the observance of the traditional laws of war. We never broke them unless the enemy first did so and thus forced us, in accordance with the accepted custom of war, to apply reprisals. I am convinced, too, that our officers and men wished to avoid a single unnecessary casualty in the Dir Yassin battle. But those who throw stones of denunciation at the conquerors of Dir Yassin [1] would do well not to don the cloak of hypocrisy [2].      \\\"In connection with the capture of Dir Yassin the Jewish Agency found it necessary to send a letter of apology to Abdullah, whom Mr. Ben Gurion, at a moment of great political emotion, called 'the wise ruler who seeks the good of his people and this country.' The 'wise ruler,' whose mercenary forces demolished Gush Etzion and flung the bodies of its heroic defenders to birds of prey, replied with feudal superciliousness. He rejected the apology and replied that the Jews were all to blame and that he did not believe in the existence of 'dissidents.' Throughout the Arab world and the world at large a wave of lying propaganda was let loose about 'Jewish attrocities.'      \\\"The enemy propaganda was designed to besmirch our name. In the result it helped us. Panic overwhelmed the Arabs of Eretz Israel. Kolonia village, which had previously repulsed every attack of the Haganah, was evacuated overnight and fell without further fighting. Beit-Iksa was also evacuated. These two places overlooked the main road; and their fall, together with the capture of Kastel by the Haganah, made it possible to keep open the road to Jerusalem. In the rest of the country, too, the Arabs began to flee in terror, even before they clashed with Jewish forces. Not what happened at Dir Yassin, but what was invented about Dir Yassin, helped to carve the way to our decisive victories on the battlefield. The legend of Dir Yassin helped us in particular in the saving of Tiberias and the conquest of Haifa.\\\"   [1] (A footnote from _The Revolt_, pp.226-7.) \\\"To counteract the loss of Dir yassin, a village of strategic importance, Arab headquarters at Ramallah broadcast a crude atrocity story, alleging a massacre by Irgun troops of women and children in the village. Certain Jewish officials, fearing the Irgun men as political rivals, seized upon this Arab gruel propaganda to smear the Irgun. An eminent Rabbi was induced to reprimand the Irgun before he had time to sift the truth. Out of evil, however, good came. This Arab propaganda spread a legend of terror amongst Arabs and Arab troops, who were seized with panic at the mention of Irgun soldiers.

That wouldn't even make a good 600 these days. Then again, I paid $2800 for it, so technology isn't the only thing that's changed. Of course I'd still rather ride the old GS across three states than any of the 600's.  I guess it's an indication of how much things have changed that a 12 second 400 didn't seem too far out of line.\",\" I find this thread on motif accelerators absoultly amazing.  If I were writing an interface to keyboard accelerators, I would have one resource called \\\"accelerators\\\" that took a translation table, period. I would also implement it so that programmer never has to do any work to get the accelerators installed.  As soon as the end-user specified one, it would be active and automatically installed.  To get multiple accelerators on a single menu item I'd do something like:   *menuItem.accelerators: #override \\\\n\\\\   Ctrl<Key>M: fire() \\\\n\\\\   Shift<Key>L: fire() \\\\n  The accelerators would work exactly like translations and you would automatically see a \\\"Ctrl M\\\" show up in your menuItem object.

If I read you right, you're saying in essence that, with a larger    economy, nations will have more discretionary funds to *waste* on a    lunar facility. That was certainly partially the case with Apollo,    but real Lunar colonies will probably require a continuing    military, scientific, or commercial reason for being rather than    just a \\\"we have the money, why not?\\\" approach.  Ah, but the whole point is that money spent on a lunar base is not wasted on the moon. It's not like they'd be using $1000 (1000R?) bills to fuel their moon-dozers. The money to fund a lunar base would be spent in the country to which the base belonged. It's a way of funding high-tech research, just like DARPA was a good excuse to fund various fields of research, under the pretense that it was crucial to the defense of the country, or like ESPRIT is a good excuse for the EC to fund research, under the pretense that it's good for pan-European cooperation.  Now maybe you think that government-funded research is a waste of money (in fact, I'm pretty sure you do), but it does count as investment spending, which does boost the economy (and just look at the size of that multiplier :->).\",\"Mark McWiggins <markmc@halcyon.com> reminds us:  MM> Also, don't forget that it's better for your health  MM> to enjoy your steak than to resent your sprouts ...

WordPerfect encryption has been shown to be very easy to break.   The method uses XOR with two repeating key streams: a typed password   and a byte-wide counter initialized to 1+<the password length>. Full   descriptions are given in Bennett [BEN87] and Bergen and Caelli   [BER91].    decrypt WordPerfect document files and I think I have a solution.    There is a software company named: Accessdata (87 East 600 South,   Orem, UT 84058), 1-800-658-5199 that has a software package that will   decrypt any WordPerfect, Lotus 1-2-3, Quatro-Pro, MS Excel and Paradox   files. The cost of the package is $185. Steep prices, but if you   think your pw key is less than 10 characters, (or 10 char) give them a   call and ask for the free demo disk. The demo disk will decrypt files   that have a 10 char or less pw key.''  * How do I break a Vigenere (repeated-key) cipher?    A repeated-key cipher, where the ciphertext is something like the   plaintext xor KEYKEYKEYKEY (and so on), is called a Vigenere cipher.   If the key is not too long and the plaintext is in English, do the   following:     1. Discover the length of the key by counting coincidences.   (See Gaines [GAI44], Sinkov [SIN66].) Trying each displacement of   the ciphertext against itself, count those bytes which are equal.    If the two ciphertext portions have used the same key, something   over 6% of the bytes will be equal. If they have used different   key, then less than 0.4% will be equal (assuming random 8-bit bytes   of key covering normal ASCII text). The smallest displacement which   indicates an equal key is the length of the repeated key.    2. Shift the text by that length and XOR it with itself. This   removes the key and leaves you with text XORed with itself. Since   English has about 1 bit of real information per byte, 2 streams of   text XORed together has 2 bits of info per 8-bit byte, providing   plenty of redundancy for choosing a unique decryption. (And in fact   one stream of text XORed with itself has just 1 bit per byte.)    If the key is short, it might be even easier to treat this as a   standard polyalphabetic substitution. All the old cryptanalysis   texts show how to break those. It's possible with those methods, in   the hands of an expert, if there's only ten times as much text as key.   See, for example, Gaines [GAI44], Sinkov [SIN66].  * How do I send encrypted mail under UNIX? [PGP, RIPEM, PEM, ...]    Here's one popular method, using the des command:      cat file | compress | des private_key | uuencode | mail    Meanwhile, there is a de jure Internet standard in the works called   PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail). It is described in RFCs 1421 through   1424. To join the PEM mailing list, contact pem-dev-request@tis.com.   There is a beta version of PEM being tested at the time of this   writing.    There are also two programs available in the public domain for encrypting   mail: PGP and RIPEM.  Both are available by FTP.  Each has its own   newsgroup: alt.security.pgp and alt.security.ripem.  Each has its own FAQ   as well.    PGP is most commonly used outside the USA since it uses the RSA algorithm   without a license and RSA's patent is valid only (or at least primarily)   in the USA.    RIPEM is most commonly used inside the USA since it uses the RSAREF which   is freely available within the USA but not available for shipment outside   the USA.    Since both programs use a secret key algorithm for encrypting the body of   the message (PGP used IDEA; RIPEM uses DES) and RSA for encrypting the   message key, they should be able to interoperate freely.  Although there   have been repeated calls for each to understand the other's formats and   algorithm choices, no interoperation is available at this time (as far as   we know).  * Is the UNIX crypt command secure?    No. See [REE84]. There is a program available called cbw (crypt   breaker's workbench) which can be used to do ciphertext-only attacks   on files encrypted with crypt. One source for CBW is [FTPCB].  * How do I use compression with encryption?    A number of people have proposed doing perfect compression followed by   some simple encryption method (e.g., XOR with a repeated key).    Unfortunately, you can only compress perfectly if you know the exact   distribution of possible inputs. For all practical purposes it's   impossible to describe ``the typical English text'' beyond coarse   characteristics such as single-letter frequencies. You can build up   more and more sophisticated models of your inputs, but if the enemy   has a slightly more accurate model, he'll be able to find some   redundancy in your compressed output.    Note that nearly all practical compression schemes, unless they   have been designed with cryptography in mind, produce output that   actually starts off with high redundancy. For example, the output of   UNIX compress begins with a well-known three-byte ``magic number''   that can serve as an entering wedge for cryptanalysis.      This is not to say that compression before encryption is inherently a   bad idea; it just has to be done very, very carefully, and by no means   removes the need for strong encryption.    Compression after encryption is silly.  * Is there an unbreakable cipher?    Yes. The one-time pad is unbreakable; see part 4. Unfortunately the   one-time pad requires secure distribution of as much key material as   plaintext.    Of course, a cryptosystem need not be utterly unbreakable to be   useful. Rather, it needs to be strong enough to resist attacks by   likely enemies for whatever length of time the data it protects is   expected to remain valid.  * What does ``random'' mean in cryptography?    Cryptographic applications demand much more out of a pseudorandom   number generator than most applications. For a source of bits to be   cryptographically random, it must be computationally impossible to   predict what the Nth random bit will be given complete knowledge of   the algorithm or hardware generating the stream and the sequence of   0th through N-1st bits, for all N up to the lifetime of the source.    A software generator (also known as pseudo-random) has the function   of expanding a truly random seed to a longer string of apparently   random bits.  This seed must be large enough not to be guessed by   the opponent.  Ideally, it should also be truly random (perhaps   generated by a hardware random number source).    Those who have Sparcstation 1 workstations could, for example,   generate random numbers using the audio input device as a source of   entropy, by not connecting anything to it.  For example,   cat /dev/audio | compress - >foo    gives a file of high entropy (not random but with much randomness in   it).  One can then encrypt that file using part of itself as a key,   for example, to convert that seed entropy into a pseudo-random   string.    When looking for hardware devices to provide this entropy, it is   important really to measure the entropy rather than just assume that   because it looks complicated to a human, it must be \\\"random\\\".  For   example, disk operation completion times sound like they might be   unpredictable (to many people) but a spinning disk is much like a   clock and its output completion times are relatively low in entropy.  * What is the unicity point (a.k.a. unicity distance)?    See [SHA49]. The unicity distance is an approximation to that amount   of ciphertext such that the sum of the real information (entropy) in   the corresponding source text and encryption key equals the number   of ciphertext bits used. Ciphertexts significantly longer than this   can be shown probably to have a unique decipherment. This is used to   back up a claim of the validity of a ciphertext-only cryptanalysis.    Ciphertexts significantly shorter than this are likely to have   multiple, equally valid decryptions and therefore to gain security   from the opponent's difficulty choosing the correct one.    Unicity distance, like all statistical or information-theoretic   measures, does not make deterministic predictions but rather gives   probabilistic results: namely, the minimum amount of ciphertext   for which it is likely that there is only a single intelligible   plaintext corresponding to the ciphertext, when all possible keys   are tried for the decryption. Working cryptologists don't normally   deal with unicity distance as such. Instead they directly determine   the likelihood of events of interest.    Let the unicity distance of a cipher be D characters. If fewer than   D ciphertext characters have been intercepted, then there is not   enough information to distinguish the real key from a set of   possible keys. DES has a unicity distance of 17.5 characters,   which is less than 3 ciphertext blocks (each block corresponds to   8 ASCII characters). This may seem alarmingly low at first, but   the unicity distance gives no indication of the computational work   required to find the key after approximately D characters have been   intercepted.    In fact, actual cryptanalysis seldom proceeds along the lines used   in discussing unicity distance. (Like other measures such as key   size, unicity distance is something that guarantees insecurity if   it's too small, but doesn't guarantee security if it's high.) Few   practical cryptosystems are absolutely impervious to analysis; all   manner of characteristics might serve as entering ``wedges'' to crack   some cipher messages. However, similar information-theoretic   considerations are occasionally useful, for example, to determine a   recommended key change interval for a particular cryptosystem.   Cryptanalysts also employ a variety of statistical and   information-theoretic tests to help guide the analysis in the most   promising directions.    Unfortunately, most literature on the application of information   statistics to cryptanalysis remains classified, even the seminal   1940 work of Alan Turing (see [KOZ84]). For some insight into the   possibilities, see [KUL68] and [GOO83].  * What is key management and why is it important?    One of the fundamental axioms of cryptography is that the enemy is in   full possession of the details of the general cryptographic system,   and lacks only the specific key data employed in the encryption. (Of   course, one would assume that the CIA does not make a habit of telling   Mossad about its cryptosystems, but Mossad probably finds out anyway.)   Repeated use of a finite amount of key provides redundancy that can   eventually facilitate cryptanalytic progress. Thus, especially in   modern communication systems where vast amounts of information are   transferred, both parties must have not only a sound cryptosystem but   also enough key material to cover the traffic.    Key management refers to the distribution, authentication, and   handling of keys.    A publicly accessible example of modern key management technology   is the STU III secure telephone unit, which for classified use   employs individual coded ``Crypto Ignition Keys'' and a central Key   Management Center operated by NSA. There is a hierarchy in that   certain CIKs are used by authorized cryptographic control   personnel to validate the issuance of individual traffic keys and   to perform installation/maintenance functions, such as the   reporting of lost CIKs.    This should give an inkling of the extent of the key management   problem. For public-key systems, there are several related issues,   many having to do with ``whom do you trust?''  * Can I use pseudo-random or chaotic numbers as a key stream?    Chaotic equations and fractals produce an apparent randomness from   relatively compact generators. Perhaps the simplest example is a   linear congruential sequence, one of the most popular types of random   number generators, where there is no obvious dependence between seeds   and outputs. Unfortunately the graph of any such sequence will, in a   high enough dimension, show up as a regular lattice. Mathematically   this lattice corresponds to structure which is notoriously easy for   cryptanalysts to exploit. More complicated generators have more   complicated structure, which is why they make interesting pictures---   but a cryptographically strong sequence will have no computable   structure at all.    See [KNU81], exercise 3.5-7; [REE77]; and [BOY89].  * What is the correct frequency list for English letters?    There are three answers to this question, each slightly deeper than   the one before. You can find the first answer in various books:   namely, a frequency list computed directly from a certain sample of   English text. Of course any such list will be ``correctly'' computed,   but exactly which list you get depends on which sample was taken.    The second answer is that the question doesn't make sense. What do   you mean by ``English letters''? The ``English language'' is not a   fixed, finite, closed object that can be exactly characterized. It   has changed over time; it is different between different authors.   Any particular message will have different statistics from those of   the language as a whole.    The third answer is that yes, no particular message is going to have   exactly the same characteristics as English in general, but for all   reasonable statistical uses these slight discrepancies won't matter.   In fact there's an entire field called ``Bayesian statistics'' (other   buzzwords are ``maximum entropy methods'' and ``maximum likelihood   estimation'') which studies questions like ``What's the chance that a   text with these letter frequencies is in English?'' and comes up with   reasonably robust answers.    So make your own list from your own samples of English text. It will   be good enough for practical work, if you use it properly.  * What is the Enigma?    ``For a project in data security we are looking for sources of   information about the German Enigma code and how it was broken by   the British during WWII.''    See [WEL82], [DEA85], [KOZ84], [HOD83], [KAH91].  * How do I shuffle cards?    Card shuffling is a special case of the permutation of an array of   values, using a random or pseudo-random function.  All possible output   permutations of this process should be equally likely.  To do this, you   need a random function (modran(x)) which will produce a uniformly   distributed random integer in the interval [0..x-1].  Given that   function, you can shuffle with the following [C] code: (assuming ARRLTH   is the length of array arr[] and swap() interchanges values at the two   addresses given)    for ( n = ARRLTH-1; n > 0 ; n-- ) swap( &arr[modran( n+1 )], &arr[n] ) ;    modran(x) can not be achieved exactly with a simple (ranno() % x) since   ranno()'s interval may not be divisible by x, although in most cases the   error will be very small.  To cover this case, one can take ranno()'s   modulus mod x, call that number y, and if ranno() returns a value less   than y, go back and get another ranno() value.   * Can I foil S/W pirates by encrypting my CD-ROM?    Someone will frequently express the desire to publish a CD-ROM with   possibly multiple pieces of software, perhaps with each encrypted   separately, and will want to use different keys for each user (perhaps   even good for only a limited period of time) in order to avoid piracy.    As far as we know, this is impossible, since there is nothing in standard   PC or workstation hardware which uniquely identifies the user at the   keyboard.  If there were such an identification, then the CD-ROM could be   encrypted with a key based in part on the one sold to the user and in   part on the unique identifier.  However, in this case the CD-ROM is one   of a kind and that defeats the intended purpose.    If the CD-ROM is to be encrypted once and then mass produced, there must   be a key (or set of keys) for that encryption produced at some stage in   the process.  That key is useable with any copy of the CD-ROM's data.   The pirate needs only to isolate that key and sell it along with the   illegal copy.   * Can you do automatic cryptanalysis of simple ciphers?

One very frequently asked question in sci.crypt is about how the VCR+ codes   work.  The following article attempts to describe it.\",\"This reminds me of the last Graham Kerr cooking show I saw.  Today he smoked meat on the stovetop in a big pot!  He used a strange technique I'd never seen before.  He took a big pot with lid, and placed a tray in it made from aluminum foil. The tray was about the size and shape of a typical coffee-table ash tray, made by crumpling a sheet of foil around the edges.  In the tray, he placed a couple spoonfuls of brown sugar, a similar quantity of brown rice (he said any rice will do), the contents of two teabags of Earl Grey tea, and a few cloves.  On top of this was placed an ordinary aluminum basket-type steamer, with two chicken breasts in it.  The lid was put on, and the whole assembly went on the stovetop at high heat for 10 or 12 minutes.  Later, he removed what looked like smoked chicken breasts.  What surprises and concerns me are:  1)  No wood chips.  Where does the smoke flavor come from?  2)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember hearing that carmel color     (obtained by caramelizing sugar -- a common coloring and flavoring     agent) had been found to be carcinogenic.  I believe they injected     it under the skin of rats, or something.  If the results were conclusive,     caramel color would not be legal in the U.S., yet it is still being     used.  Was the initial research result found to be incorrect, or what?  3)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember Earl Grey tea being implicated     as carcinogenic, because it contains oil of bergamot (an extract     from the skin of a type of citrus fruit).  Does anyone know whatever     happened with that story?  If it were carcinogenic, Earl Grey tea     could not have it as an additive, yet it apparently continues to do     so.  WRT natural wood smoke (I've smoking a duck right now, as it happens), I've noticed that a heavily-smoked food item will have an unpleasant tangy taste when eaten directly out of the smoker if the smoke has only recently stopped flowing.  I find the best taste to be had by using dry wood chips, getting lots of smoke right up at the beginning of the cooking process, then slowly barbequing for hours and hours without adding additional wood chips.  My theory is that the unpleasant tangy molecules are low-molecular weight stuff, like terpenes, and that the smoky flavor molecules are some sort of larger molecule more similar to tar.  The long barbeque time after the initial intensive smoke drives off the low-molecular weight stuff, just leaving the flavor behind.  Does anyone know if my theory is correct?  I also remember hearing that the combustion products of fat dripping on the charcoal and burning are carcinogenic.  For that reason, and because it covers the product with soot and some unpleasant tanginess, I only grill non-drippy meats like prawns directly over hot coals.  I do stuff like this duck by indirect heat.  I have a long rectangular Weber, and I put the coals at one end and the meat at the other end.  The fat drops directly on the floor below the meat, and next time I use the barbeque I make the fire in that end to burn off the fat and help ignite the coals.  And yet another reason I've heard not to smoke or barbeque meat is that smoked cured meat, like pork sausage and bacon, contains nitrosamines, which are carcinogenic.  I'm pretty sure this claim actually has some standing, don't know about the others.\",\"I was a graduate student in the early 1980s, and we had a conference on  Reaganomics where Jerry Jordan, then a member of the Council of Economic  Advisors, was a speaker.  I had the pleasure of driving him back to the  airport afterwards, and since taxes were the main topic of discussion I  thought I would ask him about the VAT.  I have favored it for these reasons  you mention, that the income base is too hazy to define, that it taxes  savings and investment, that it is likely to be more visible.  He agreed,  and reported that the CEA at that time was in favor of VAT.  So why not  propose it?  I asked.  He replied that the Reagan White House feared that  the Democrats would introduce VAT *in addition to* the income tax, rather  than in lieu.  Better not to give them any ideas, he said.

I am a picky eater and never wanted to  try chinese food, however, I finally tried some in order to please a girl I was seeing at the time.  I had never heard of Chinese restaurant syndrome.  A group of us went to the restaurant and all shared 6 different dishes.  It didn't taste great, but I decided it wasn't so bad.  We went home and went to bed early.  I woke up at 2 AM and puked my guts outs. I threw up for so long that (I'm not kidding) I pulled a muscle in my tongue.  Dry heaves and everything.  No one else got sick, and I'm not allergic to anything that I know of.    Suffice to say that I wont go into a chinese restaurant unless I am  physically threatened.  The smell of the food makes me ill (and that *is* a psycholgical reaction).  When I have been dragged in to suffer through beef and broccoli without any sauces, I insist on no MSG.   I haven't gotten sick yet. \",\"eu> Apple does not authorise sales through Mail Order.

I am also interested in this subject -- I have a son with Epilepsy and I am very active with the local association.  I posted a message like this a few months ago and received no replies, but here it is again.  Is anyone interested in participating in a mailing list on Epilepsy and seizures?  This would allow us to hold discussions and share information via electronic mail.  I already run a Listserver for two other groups, so the mechanics would be easy.  If you are interested, mail me a note.  If I get enough replies, I will make it happen and provide you with the details.  BTW, I have also started a database on Epilepsy.  This is part of my research on natural language question answering systems.  Users of this service are able to ask questions about Epilepsy and the program searches the database and retrieves its best response.  The technology works by comparing your question against a set of questions that have been seen before.  All new questions that are not answered are recorded and used to improve the system.  This database is still small and sparse, but we are adding new information.

Christopher\",\" I don't meant to defend Eric Molas- I find it somewhat annoying when someone pops up on alt.atheism to tell us all about his (usually atheistic) beliefs, so I can certainly see how Christians might be annoyed- but I'd like to point out a few things.   \\\"no meaning from God\\\" is not the same as \\\"no meaning\\\". From my (atheistic) point of view, if you want meaning in your life, you get to go and get some or make some.  No free gifts of meaning. (I never quite understood how any God can just \\\"give\\\" your life meaning, actually. If he says you exists to do or be X, that gives you a purpose if you care to accept it, but is that the same thing? But I digress...)    This would truely be a miserably existance, which I doubt Eric endures. Life can be enjoyable, so you can live it because you like it, or purposefull, so you can live it to get something done. One should endeavour to make it so, if it is not. Otherwise it would be as you say. Terrible.   Probably true. Remeber he almost certainly sees that particular joy as an illusion, and does not want it. So maybe it isn't so bad?   As an atheist, I am free to be a human person. I think, love, choose, and create.   Ah, now here we begin to diverge. I will not live forever with anyone.  (I don't think you will either, but you are welcome to your opinion on the matter.)   I tend to agree with you.  It's my opinion that (unlike drugs) religions are normal parts of human societies.  I think they have outlived their usefullness, but they are evidently quite ordinary, normal things that haven't proved lethal to humanity yet.   I have heard this claim quite a few times. Does anybody here know who first came up with the \\\"God-shaped hole\\\" business?   You might want to provide some evidence next time you make a claim like this.   I don't know Eric, but I do not think it is wise to assume he has a less joy-filled and abundant life because he holds certain beliefs.  ---    - Dan Johnson And God said \\\"Jeeze, this is dull\\\"... and it *WAS* dull.

During the season, he was probably more valuable than, say, putting Olerud out there to pitch, but yeah, he *was* valuable in getting them there. In the postseason, he sucked dirty canal water through a straw. The Jays won *in spite* of Morris much more than *because of* him.   Umm, Roger? Return with us to those halcyon days of a few postings ago, where the poster Valentine was replying to used # of WS rings as a measure of better. The concept is called \\\"context\\\", and you should really become familiar with it someday.   Unless this transaltes to \\\"Clemens hasn't gone into Lou Gorman's office with a large caliber handgun and refused to come out until he'd been traded to the Jays,\\\" I'm at a complete loss as to any possible meaning for it.   What on earth does this mean? Over their careers, Clemens has \\\"won\\\" 68% of the games he's started, Morris 58%. Per year, Clemens has averaged nearly 17 wins, Morris just under 15. Would you grant the proposition that preventing the other team from scoring increases your chances of winning  a game? If so, then consider that Clemens allows 2.8 runs/9 innings pitched. Morris allows nearly a run more per nine innings. In fact, Jack Morris has never in his career had an ERA for a single year as good as Clemens' career ERA. But I forget, in the Maynardverse there was obviously some mystical significance to Buckner missing that grounder in 1986; had Morris been on the Sox, it would have been a routine groundout, right?   Speaking of stupid, it has been patiently (and not-so-patiently) explained to you many times that attributing greatness to players based on the accomplishments of their teams makes about as much sense as claiming that a racecar has the most attractive paint job because it won the race. Your continued failure to not only understand but even to intelligently reply to any of the arguments presented leads me to the conclusion that you must have spent a few too many games in goal without a mask.   No one is crying; the Jays won, and as a team they certainly deserved to win at least the AL East. They performed well in two short series and won the World Series, and I congratulate them for it. As a Red Sox fan, I hope they keep Morris. I was happy when they picked up Stewart, and elated when they traded for Darrin Jackson. You see, unless you believe in some mystical link between Morris and the offense, you can hardly help but believe that the man was credited with so many wins last year because he got lucky. Luck runs out, just like it did in 1982 when he pitched 50-odd more innings than 1992, gave up exactly *one* earned run more than in 1992, and went 17-16.  Seriously, Roger, I'd really like to hear your explanation of the difference between the 1982 Morris and the 1992 Morris. Which one was a better pitcher, and why? Did Morris somehow \\\"learn how to win\\\" in the intervening ten years? If so, then why did he go 18-12 in 1991 with Minnesota with an ERA over half a run lower than 1992?

JPEG (pronounced \\\"jay-peg\\\") is a standardized image compression mechanism. JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, the original name of the committee that wrote the standard.  JPEG is designed for compressing either full-color or gray-scale digital images of \\\"natural\\\", real-world scenes. It does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line drawings.  JPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it handle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG respectively.  JPEG is \\\"lossy\\\", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't quite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably the fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details of light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are invisible to the eye.  A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small files if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image archives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you aren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.   [2]  Why use JPEG?  There are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store 24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.  Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a 2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the size ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)  If your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have to convert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even with a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image than to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using JPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply.  It's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file.  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.  The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet posting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel (16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have only 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as black-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed in section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably more appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.   [3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?  JPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images, GIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first things to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.  As a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or gray-scale images of \\\"realistic\\\" scenes; that means scanned photographs and similar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit display hardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)  GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors, such as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels that are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by GIF.  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without introducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form. (In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they should be avoided in JPEG files.)  JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels adjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly often in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is particularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high. If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it.  Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and subtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it. The same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).  Plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG. You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale images.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images of up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.  If you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you should convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do. (Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only applies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from a GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG can only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify converting anyway.  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself. If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be prepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not convert well.   [4]  How well does JPEG compress images?  Pretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have handy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three files are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG software described in section 6B.  File    Size in bytes  Comments  ship.ppm 1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits     or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead) ship.ppm.Z  963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress     compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note.     Other text-oriented compressors give similar results. ship.gif  240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif     Most of the savings is the result of losing color     info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)  ship.jpg95  155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)     This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,     at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs. ship.jpg75   58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)     You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this     from the original, even with both on-screen at once. ship.jpg50   38406  cjpeg -Q 50     This has slight defects; if you know what to look     for, you could tell it's been JPEGed without seeing     the original.  Still as good image quality as many     recent postings in Usenet pictures groups. ship.jpg25   25192  cjpeg -Q 25     JPEG's characteristic \\\"blockiness\\\" becomes apparent     at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).     Still, I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were     of poorer image quality than this. ship.jpg5o    6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)     Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or     indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:     the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !  In this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smaller than a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the GIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical ratio for real-world scenes.   [5]  What are good \\\"quality\\\" settings for JPEG?  Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings.  \\\"Quality 95\\\" does NOT mean \\\"keep 95% of the information\\\", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary; it's not a percentage of anything.  The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting (smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another, but here are some rules of thumb.  The default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for experimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a file two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.  If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to go down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you might need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation. The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG. The default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to 95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).  If you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are prepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is about right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as \\\"op art\\\".  (Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG software described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other JPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different quality scale.  Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just \\\"high\\\"/\\\"medium\\\"/\\\"low\\\"-style choices.)   [6]  Where can I get JPEG software?  Most of the programs described in this section are available by FTP. If you don't know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article \\\"How to find sources\\\". (If you don't have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the same article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can get it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with \\\"send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\\\" in the body.  The \\\"Anonymous FTP List FAQ\\\" may also be helpful --- it's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in the news.answers archive.  NOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple months old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.   [6A]  If you are looking for \\\"canned\\\" software, viewers, etc:  The first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one kind of system.  If you don't see what you want for your machine, check out the portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over Internet; but some commercial programs are listed too.  X Windows:  John Bradley's free XV (version 2.00 and up) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and other image formats.  It's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu or ftp.cis.upenn.edu.  The file is called 'xv-???.tar.Z' (where ??? is the version number, currently 2.21); it is located in the 'contrib' directory on export or the 'pub/xv' directory at upenn.  XV reduces all images to 8 bits internally, which means it's not a real good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you'll still get only 8-bit color).  Also, you shouldn't use XV to convert full-color images to JPEG, because they'll get color-quantized first. But XV is a fine tool for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG. CAUTION: there is a glitch in versions 2.21 and earlier: be sure to check the \\\"save at normal size\\\" checkbox when saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.  Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package, also available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z. This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The ImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped displays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the basic free JPEG software.  Both of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple image viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest release, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage, said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original. (The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4 decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next xloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said to do the right thing with 24-bit displays.   MS-DOS:  This covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.  One good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files. The current version, 2.4a, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca (129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg24a.zip.  This is a good basic viewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is not flashy, but it's functional.  Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview.  The current version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU and a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and OS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit on the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do). You may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a bit tricky; read the directions carefully!  A shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is also much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use --- more keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a little slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than screen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both are faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip. Requires a VESA graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zip or vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in VESA driver, so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains that the driver is missing.)  A second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around the net for a while, but I don't know any stable archive location for it. The current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway. The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.  The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest revision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good: it's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is poor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see a good JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.  Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can't get *any* of them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you have hi-color hardware, don't use GIF as the intermediate format; try to find a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right thing with hi-color displays.)  The Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS compilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will convert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.  Handmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF. These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in particular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietary JPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format files are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version 2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip. NOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is not readable on non-PC platforms.  Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation package, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI formats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images. A demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.1 is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch161.zip.  NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet's key archive site for PC-related programs is Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20 runs a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document refers to directory (eg) \\\"msdos/graphics\\\" at Simtel20, that really means \\\"pd1:<msdos.graphics>\\\".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should expect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several Internet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives; most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA mirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files in (eg) \\\"/pub/msdos/graphics\\\".  If you have no FTP capability, you can retrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in comp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA, consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.  Microsoft Windows:  There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images. (Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware, due to Windows' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion programs described above inside a Windows DOS window.)  The newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0 is available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip. Requires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers. But it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing...  JView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the decompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can't create new JPEG files, and it doesn't view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it's an excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip. (Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites, including wuarchive.wustl.edu.)  WinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files; it can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter. It has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and slideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow 286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version, which is roughly 25% faster.)  ColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising contender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it has no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the current version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file pub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will be appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)  DVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen mode, not in a window.  OS/2:  The following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151). Note: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator is not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip     32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4. /pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip     16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc11.zip     Image Archiver 1.01: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.     Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip     PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows     (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview84.zip     PMView 0.84: JPEG/GIF/BMP viewer.  GIF viewing very fast, JPEG viewing     fast if you have huge amounts of RAM, otherwise about the same speed     as the above programs.  Strong 24-bit display support.  Shareware, $20.  Macintosh:  Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation, which is part of the QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed. To use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running System 6.0.7 or later.  (If you're running System 6, you must also install the 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get QuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx. (As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0 in several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However, some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)  Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is not the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for details.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format. Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.  The first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images that are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can convert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big improvement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and QuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can view large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it's the only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a typical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down to fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people like this behavior, some don't.  Overall, JPEGView's user interface is very well thought out.  GIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and PICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest version is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later. GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can load and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it's faster with QuickTime.) Note: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try converting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.  JPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx. This will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing. You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.  Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF converter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this program, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.  Apple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and GIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx. Requires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it's really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime. Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display, and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an unsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not intend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called PICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash it, as it's even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much cleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that Picture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)  Storm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter. This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but it will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on older systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can't use it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a downloaded image file to 'JPEG' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.  If your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance), GIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you don't want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.  More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not all can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version 2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG plug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded JPEG file to 'JPEG' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.  Amiga:  (Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at amiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this archive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good choice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)  HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a general image manipulation tool.  It's cheap (shareware, $20) and can read several formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version is available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger than 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.  Rend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM, and GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even capturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The current version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is supposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under AmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)  Viewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.  If you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages that support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24 and Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and ImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting, effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are distributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro), from ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation software for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another well-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.  The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file AmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.  The Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many based on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks to a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without so much as notifying the authors).  Among these are \\\"AugJPEG\\\", \\\"NewAmyJPEG\\\", \\\"VJPEG\\\", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion, anything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space it's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.  Atari ST:  The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc, from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo. These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.  I have not heard of any free or shareware JPEG-capable viewer for Ataris, but surely there must be one by now?  Pointers appreciated.  Acorn Archimedes:  !ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view JPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG, although this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.  Recent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle JPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be found on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by registering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede, The Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).  There's also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write functionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image format conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not necessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST, Cambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.   Portable software for almost any system:  If none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free JPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You'll also need a viewer program. If your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a display with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa or PPM 24-bit image files.  There are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every day.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find the available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case, purchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether the product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can handle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are not and never will be compatible with anyone else's files.   [6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:  Free, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent JPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code, documentation, and some small test files is available from several places. The \\\"official\\\" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9 or 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release is jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don't forget to retrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP. If you are on a PC and don't know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may prefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on CompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip. If you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest comp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34. (If you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ article \\\"How to find sources\\\", referred to at the top of section 6.)  The free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG \\\"JFIF\\\" format and image files in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats. The core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other programs, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have tested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.  We have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use. Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products. We do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in product literature (see the README file in the distribution for details). We hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with anything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.  The Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you'd like to contribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.   [7]  What's all this hoopla about color quantization?  Most people don't have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware. Typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display 256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors.  This process is called \\\"color quantization\\\".  (This is something of a misnomer, \\\"color selection\\\" would be a better term.  We're stuck with the standard usage though.)  Clearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most images, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at the very lowest JPEG quality settings).  Since JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display on 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for *all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what comes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors. This happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a little differently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets \\\"smeared\\\" into a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to display a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image source.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.  (Incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see posted images described as \\\"256-color JPEG\\\".  This tells me that the poster (a) hasn't read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF. JPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but number of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG.)  On the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to 256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its palette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.) For purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to. This is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you're stuck with the sender's quantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image. Furthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantization algorithm, you're out of luck.  For this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware. JPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's display hardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in this area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG images you already have.  With a GIF, you're stuck forevermore with what was sent.  It's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA display, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it's also due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average GIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!  Finally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display hardware already: 15-bit \\\"hi-color\\\" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on workstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already obsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their display.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively. Thus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images in a machine-independent fashion.   [8]  How does JPEG work?  The buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine transforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy coding.  This article's long enough already, so I'm not going to say more than that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ. This is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files /pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in using the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.   [9]  What about lossless JPEG?  There's a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the final output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG algorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few implementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.  Saying \\\"-Q 100\\\" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image. What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say \\\"-sample 1x1\\\" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial JPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)  Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG algorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye, but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.  At this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG provides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees bit-for-bit accuracy.  If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the JBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG lossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with 6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a Huffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.   [10]  Why all the argument about file formats?  Strictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms; it does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations.  Since we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of official standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to \\\"do their own thing\\\", and as a result their programs aren't compatible with anybody else's.  The closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work that's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined two JPEG-based file formats:   * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a \\\"low-end\\\" format that transports     pixels and not much else.   * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is     a \\\"high-end\\\" format that will let you record just about everything you     ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is     a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,     because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different     and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It's not likely that adding JPEG to the     mix will do anything to improve this situation. Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of JPEG-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards.  I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in picture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the TIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well defined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported \\\"lowest common denominator\\\"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.  A particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTime software for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped inside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and QuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are available to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor that handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF by hand; see section 11 for details.  Another particular case is Handmade Software's programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and Image Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF format.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by HSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be used for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This applies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF format by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format files, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)   [11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?  If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read, it's likely to be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:  1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,     followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'JFIF'.  2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a     \\\"raw JPEG\\\" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---     it's worth a try, anyway.  3.  HSI files start with 'hsi1'.  You're out of luck unless you have HSI     software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they     won't decompress properly with non-HSI programs.  4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred     bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for 'JFIF').  Strip off     everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.  5.  Anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are     lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.     If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),     try stripping off everything before that.  In uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is   \\\"begin\\\" line  M_]C_X ...  whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with   \\\"begin\\\" line  M:'-I ...  If you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of downloading non-JFIF files.   [12]  What about arithmetic coding?  The JPEG spec defines two different \\\"back end\\\" modules for the final output of compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed. The choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the file-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)  Unfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the JPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi. Thus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses from these companies.  (The \\\"fair use\\\" doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best.)  At least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify the potential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not* be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.  There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future.  Stay tuned for further details.   [13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?  It would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could decompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially. Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered image loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the first time around.  The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an identical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current free JPEG software.  It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation output.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.) One of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.  In any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original quality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation. (If you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move. If you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but that's a mighty limited capability!)  The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format (PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are ready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot of compression/decompression time this way :-).   [14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?  As stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original full-color data the GIF was made from, it's far better to make a JPEG from that.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from, here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality.  The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to make sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF; that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in section 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors don't convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality will be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)  Experience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best candidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation. Don't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don't expect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created directly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through JPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file, not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).  Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color border around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts (\\\"ghost\\\" edges).  Do yourself a favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows system, XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this.)  cjpeg's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but for GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher Q setting may not be necessary.)  Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually \\\"dithered\\\" to fool your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store. If you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The trouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency color noise; and JPEG can't compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it). To get around this, you want to \\\"smooth\\\" the GIF image before compression. Smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of the compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image than you'd get without smoothing.  With the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing capability is built in.  Try \\\"-smooth 10\\\" or so when converting GIFs. Values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular fine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong smoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image, which you don't want.  If you are an image processing wizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as pnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg's built-in smoother is a LOT faster than pnmconvol...  The upshot of all this is that \\\"cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10\\\" is probably a good starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the image, you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.   ---------------------  For more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in particular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net. \",\"   I hope you realize how trivial it is to manufacture these compounds.  Given about $10k in lab equipment and chemicals (which are commercially available) and given the knowledge that I have (graduating BS, Ch, 1993) I could  synthesize enough of these compounds to make a serious dent in the population of several major US cities.

In the case of chemical agents, I seriously doubt that you would even know that someone had set up a lab until after the weapons had been used.    Part of the trouble with the chemical-weapons ban treaty between the US and the USSR is that many of the precursors to chemical weapons such as GB and Sarin, etc., is that they have very valid commercial uses, and  it is very easy to divert those precursors to chemical weapons manufacture without anyone knowing about it.   \",\"Has anyone successfully converted Interleaf graphics to CGM, or even heard of it being done????

It sounds like you're suggesting  Bill James had something to do with overhyping the kid to death. Au contraire; he was fairly critical of him after his ROY campaign, noting that he wasn't all-world as a catcher or a hitter. He called him basically average when everyone *else* in the media was predicting the next Johnny Bench or Roy Campanella.      Which reports are those?      I like Hernandez a lot, but if Piazza can catch the ball, you've gotta play him IMHO. He's a much better hitter, although Hernandez isn't a *bad* hitter. Right now, it sounds like Piazza will catch most of the time and Hernandez will be Candiotti's caddy since he can catch the knuckler. As long as they play up to their abilities, the Dodgers could have a very good catching tandem.       I think both are overrated defensively (see Nichols' Law of catcher defense), but that's something that's difficult to prove or disprove from your viewpoint or mine. About the only tangible thing we can look at is opponent's SB%, and that's clouded by how well your pitchers hold runners. Catchers ERA is a possibility, but it's subject to way too many biases.     As for them 'playing on a team that is not so much in need of another big bat', I disagree here too. About the only chink in the Braves' armor is that they're weak offensively at several positions (CF, C, 2B, SS if Belliard plays, 1B unless Bream and Hunter form another super-platoon) and very weak  defensively if Blauser plays.

The legal definition of fraud changes from one country to another in any case. The context of the discussion is morality of censorship.     You are extrapolating from the statement I made concerning a circumstance in which such an act of censorship would be permissable to the Teel case. If you had bothered to read the post instead of trying to prove how stupid you thought me you would have done rather better. The mode of argument I was using was a form of rhetoric. Argument by example, I describe a wide set of circumstances in which an action is permisable and demonstrate that they do not apply, thus the action is not permisable.  Obviously a company posting from a University adress would be squashed,  it would be contrary to the internet comercial use.   Now you are clutching at straws.

It is quite legitimate for a company to have a political or other agenda and regulate the use of its property in accordance with its policy. For example if a Microsoft employee were to post \\\"Windows NT is crap don't buy it\\\" from a Microsoft machine I would consider it reasonable for Microsoft to sack that employee. In the same way if a company decides that it has  political objectives it might wish to regulate postings in a political manner.

Your article consisted of a reference to the first ammendment, your signature and pretty well damn all else.     Are you refering to the initial hearings on an injunction or the judgments on the substantive case?  The initial hearings that the government won were judged on the not unresonable judgment that assertion by the government that the national interest might be harmed would be grounds for prior restraint. The second set of hearings on the substance judged that the government had no case and that the official secrets act could not be used to suppress information in thwe public domain already. The part that they won was over the copyright issue which is rather separate.  Here again the issue of censorship is rather different in the case that information is divulged on the understanding that it will not be communicated to third parties. The first ammendment certainly does not apply in this case as the numerous prosecutions of spies in the US proves.   The crux of the Spycatcher affair was extrateritoriality of British law. The censorship aspect of it arose as a result of the government's ludicrous attempts to prevent summary of the case in the book.     Funny I saw that as a rejection of an assertion that you had made. Of course in rejecting an assertion I have to make a contrary assertion, since this assertion is unprovable I left it at that.   So far I have not seen you demonstrate a command of the contrary opinion to your own. You are attacking my anti-censorship view because I dare to accept the validity of some pro-censorship arguments while rejecting their conclusions.  Plus I am not an absolutist.

Yup.   Nope, it's not illegal. It is, however, closely regulated. In order to  purchase and use the big rocket motors required, it is necessary to be one of the following: a) An employee of a government agency. b) An employee or student at a university doing research involving rockets. c) A member or representative of an educational organization involved in research or other uses of rockets. There are two such organizations:  The Tripoli Rocketry Association and the National Association of Rocketry. Members of either organization must demonstrate proficiency in construction and flight before they are allowed to purchase large motors on their own.  The FAA will issue a waiver of its regulations, upon request, to any  organization which can persuade them it has taken adequate precautions  to avoid conflicts with aircraft. The usual stipulations are: - Only operation up to a specified ceiling is allowed. Depending on the location, this ceiling may be from 5000 to 50000 feet AGL.  - The operator of the rocket is responsible for avoiding any aircraft within the operating radius around the launch site. - Flight into clouds or beyond visual range in haze is expressly prohibited. - The FAA will provide a NOTAM informing other users of the airspace that unmanned rocket operations are taking place at the specified place and time.  Most of the launches that are held (and there are dozens of them every year) are held in areas where air traffic is relatively light, such as over the western deserts (the Black Rock Desert north of Reno is particularly popular since it is 25 x 150 miles of *nothing to hit* on the ground).  The two rocketry associations test and approve motors for their members' use, to insure safety. Depending on motor size, the launcher setback is from 50 to 500 or more feet.   By the way, rockets under 1 lb and powered by an \\\"F\\\" motor are exempt from most Federal regulations on unmanned rockets anyway. See FAR 101, Subpart C, for details.  As for recovery...although the higher altitude rockets can reach up to 50,000 feet, most of them only get to 2,000 to 5,000 feet. The typical rocket is 2 to 6 inches in diameter, and carries a 3 to 6 foot parachute, or multiple parachutes, depending on the payload. Many rockets also carry either a small transmitter or an audio sounder--particularly at launches in the eastern US, where there are more obstructions.  Camera, telemetry transmitter, and video payloads are becoming quite common.   Why not? It's a lot of fun...check out the traffic on rec.models.rockets for information about the model (3 lb and under) and high power (everything bigger) rocket hobbies. As with all dangerous activities, the key is to practice safety. I've been flying consumer rockets ranging up to 4-5 lbs takeoff weight for 27 years, and still have all my extremities intact.   That's another thing. NO EXPLOSIVE WARHEADS OF ANY KIND ARE ALLOWED ON THESE ROCKETS. NONE! Please forgive me for shouting, but that's one of the biggest misconceptions people have about our hobby.   True. But it will not be related to the rocket hobby, unless I get  hit while crossing a road with a rocket in my hand. \",\"  Another CPR Non-Fact.

If you've got $20,000 per seat and high-end hardware, Gain Momentum might be a good choice.  It isn't compatible with HyperCard, but has a similar architecture (and *way* more functionality).  I don't have contact information, but they were recently purchased by Sybase who shouldn't be too hard to find.  If you're running News on SPARC, check out HyperLook (hyperlook@turing.com).  It uses Postscript as a scripting language which is good if you need to do lots of display oriented scripting, but not so good for non-programmers.  It was $995, last I heard.  You might also look at our product MetaCard.  We're alpha-testing direct importing of HyperCard stacks (we've even made the test release available for anonymous FTP), so we're obviously the closest in functionality.

Seems to me if you learned to differentiate between illusion and reality on your own you wouldn't need to rely on doctrines that need to be updated.

Most people suspect that they cannot trust their senses, but few take the next step to figure out that they can trust themselves.

I would just add to Phil's very infomative discussion the following caveat: the fifth amendment applies ONLY in crinial cases.  (\\\"...nor shall any person . . . be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself...\\\"). Thus if the father sued for custody of the children, the case would be civil and the defendant mother would not have fifth amendment protection. Oddly enough, her refusal to give information in a civil case can lead to criminal contempt charges (thus landing her in jail.)  The interesting part of all this is that in a murder trial, the woman CAN plead the fifth as  to the location of the child--this is routine.  A \\\"computer crime\\\"  prosecution thus would seem to be fertile ground for this kind of defense,  where a suit by a party injured by \\\"hackers\\\" would not.  If I am accused,  for example, of sending encrypted kiddie porn over the nets the fifth should  protect my key.  If I am accused of sending copyrighted material, however, it proabably will not (copyright infringement not being a \\\"crime\\\" in the technical sense.)

Zionism agrees with the basic tenet of anti-Semitism, namely that Jews cannot live with non- Jews.  The history and roots of the Holocaust go back a long way. While the industru of death and destruction did not operate before 1942, its roots were firmly placed in the 19th Century. Jewish aspirations for emancipation emerged out of the national struggles in Europe. When the hopes for liberation through bourgeois-democratic change were dashed, other alternatives for improving the lot of the Jews of Europe achieved prominence.  The socialist Bund, a mass movement with enormous following, had to contend with opposition from a new and small, almost insignificant opponent, the political Zionists.  In outline these two offered diametrically opposed options for Jews in Europe. While the Bund was suggesting joining forces with the rest of Europe's workers, the Zionists were proposing a new programme aimed at ridding Europe of its Jews by setting up some form of a Jewish state.  Historically, nothing is inevitable, all depends on the balance of forces involved in the struggle. History can be seen as an option tree: every time a certain option is chosen, other routes become barred. Because of that choice, movement backwards to the point before that choice was made is impossible. While Zionism as an option was taken by many young Jews, it remained a minority position until the first days of the 3rd Reich. The Zionist Federation of Germany (ZVfD), an organisation representing a tiny minority of German Jews, was selected by the Nazis as the body to represent the Jews of the Reich. Its was the only flag of an interantional organisation allowed to fly in Berlin, and this was the only international organisation allowed to operate during this period. From a marginal position, the leaders of the Zionist Federation were propelled to a prominence and centrality that surprised even them. All of a sudden they attained political power, power based not on representation, but from being selected as the choice of the Nazi regime for dealing with the the 'Jewish problem'. Their position in negotiating with the Nazis agreements that affected the lives of many tens of thousands of the Jews in Germany transformed them from a utopian, marginal organisation in Germany (and some other countries in Europe) into a real option to be considered by German Jews.  The best example of this was the 'Transfer Agreement' of 1934. Immediately after the Nazi takeover in 1933, Jews all over the world supported or were organising a world wide boycott of German goods. This campaign hurt the Nazi regime and the German authorities searched frantically for a way disabling the boycott. It was clear that if Jews and Jewish organisations were to pull out, the campaign would collapse.  This problem was solved by the ZVfD. A letter sent to the Nazi party as early as 21.  June 1933, outlined the degree of agreement that existed between the two organisations on the question of race, nation, and the nature of the 'Jewish problem', and it offered to collaborate with the new regime:  \\\"The realisation of Zionism could only be hurt by resentment of Jews abroad against the German development. Boycott propaganda - such as is currently being carried out against Germany in many ways - is in essence unZionist, because Zionism wants not to do battle but to convince and build.\\\"  In their eagerness to gain credence and the backing of the new regime, the Zionist organisation managed to undermine the boycott. The main public act was the signature of the \\\"Transfer Agreement\\\" with the Nazi authorities during the Zionist Congress of 1934. In essence, the agreement was designed to get Germany's Jews out of the country and into Mandate Palestine. It provided a possibility for Jews to take a sizeable part of their property out of the country, through a transfer of German goods to Palestine. This right was denied to Jews leaving to any other destination. The Zionist organisation was the acting agent, through its financial organisations. This agreement operated on a number of fronts - 'helping' Jews to leave the country, breaking the ring of the boycott, exporting German goods in large quantities to Palestine, and last but not least, enabling the regime to be seen as humane and reasonable even towards its avowed enemies, the Jews. After all, they argued, the Jews do not belong in Europe and now the Jews come and agree with them.  After news of the agreement broke, the boycott was doomed. If the Zionist Organization found it possible and necessary to deal with the Nazis, and import their goods, who could argue for a boycott ? This was not the first time that the interests of both movements were presented to the German public as complementary. Baron Von Mildenstein, the first head of the Jewish Department of the SS, later followed by Eichmann, was invited to travel to Palestine. This he did in early 1933, in the company of a Zionist leader, Kurt Tuchler. Having spent six months in Palestine, he wrote a series of favourable articles in Der STURMER describing the 'new Jew' of Zionism, a Jew Nazis could accept and understand.  This little-known episode established quite clearly the relationship during the early days of Nazism, between the new regime and the ZVfD, a relationship that was echoed later in a number of key instances, even after the nature of the Final Solution became clear. In many cases this meant a silencing of reports about the horrors of the exterminations. A book concentrating on this aspect of the Zionist reaction to the Holocaust is Post-Ugandan Zionism in the Crucible of the Holocaust, by S. B. Beth-Zvi.  In the case of the Kastner episode, around which Jim Allen's play PERDITION is based, even the normal excuse of lack of knowledge of the real nature of events does not exist. It occured near the end of the war. The USSR had advanced almost up to Germany. Italy and the African bases had been lost. The Nazis were on the run, with a number of key countries, such as Rumania, leaving the Axis. A second front was a matter of months away, as the western Allies prepared their forces. In the midst of all this we find Eichmann, the master bureaucrat of industrial murder, setting up his HZ in occupied Budapest, after the German takeover of the country in April 1944. His first act was to have a conference with the Jewish leadership, and to appoint Zionist Federation members, headed by Kastner as the agent and clearing house for all Jews and their relationship with the SS and the Nazr authorities. Why they did this is not difficult to see. As opposed to Poland, where its three and  a half million Jews lived in ghettoes and were visibly different from the rest of the Polish population, the Hungarian Jews were an integrated part of the community. The middle class was mainly Jewish, the Jews were mainly middle-class. They enjoyed freedom of travel, served in the Hungarian (fascist) army in fronline units, as officers and soldiers, their names were Hungarian - how was Eichmann to find them if they were to be exterminated ? The task was not easy, there were a million Jews in Hungary, most of them resident, the rest being refugees from other countries. Many had  heard about the fate of Jews elsewhere, and were unlikely to believe any statements by Nazi officials.  Like elsewhere, the only people who had the information and the ear of the frightened Jewish population were the Judenrat. In this case the Judenrat comprsied mainly the Zionist Federation members. Without their help the SS, with 19 officers and less than 90 men, plus a few hundred Hungarian police, could not have collected and controlled a million Jews, when they did not even know their whereabouts. Kastner and the others were left under no illusions. Eichmann told Joel Brand, one of the members of Kastner's committee, that he intended to send all Hungary's Jews to Auschwitz, before he even started the expulsions!  He told them clearly that all these Jews will die, 12,000 a day, unless certain conditions were met.  The Committee faced a simple choice - to tell the Jews of Hungary about their fate, (with neutral Rumania, where many could escape, being in most cases a few hours away) or to collaborate with the Nazis by assisting in the concentration process. What would not have been believed when coming from the SS, sounded quite plausible when coming from the mouths of the Zionist leadership. Thus it is, that most of the Hungarian Jews went quietly to their death, assured by their leadership that they were to be sent to work camps.  To be sure, there are thirty pieces of silver in this narrative of destruction: the trains of 'prominents' which Eichmann promised to Kastner - a promise he kept to the last detail. For Eichmann it was a bargain: allowing 1,680 Jews to survive, as the price paid for the silent collaboration over the death of almost a million Jews.  There was no way in which the Jews of Hungary could even be located, not to say murdered, without the full collaboration of Kastner and his few friends. No doubt the SS would hunt a few Jews here and there, but the scale of the operation would have been miniscule compared to the half million who died in Auschwitz.  It is important to realise that Kastner was not an aberration, like say Rumkovsky in Lodz. Kastner acted as a result of his strongly held Zionist convictions. His actions were a logical outcome of earlier positions. This is instanced when he exposed to the Gestapo the existence of a British cell of saboteurs, Palgi and Senesh, and persuaded them to give themselves up, so as not to disrupt his operations. At no point during his trial or elsewhere, did Kastner deny that he knew exactly what was to happen to those Jews.\",\"To: ad994@Freenet.carleton.ca  JW> 1) Where is there a book or code that will teach me how JW> to read and write pcx,dbf,and gif files?

Ville Siren's slap  shot from the blue line on power play made it 1-1, and Juha Riihijarvi  scored a nice goal in another power play when he close in front of goal  put the puck high over Aslin, 1-2 after the first period.  The Finns started the second period with really good pressure. Korpisalo  made it 1-3 with another goal from close range high over Aslin. Then,  during the Finnish pressure, Sweden turned the game around in 1:47.  Mikael Renberg worked hard behind the Finnish goal, and passed the puck to  Jan Larsson in front, who backhanded the puck low, 2-3. Rundqvist entered  the Finnish zone and passed to Ahlund, and the Finnish defense let Ahlund   skate in and take a shot that Ketterer dropped into the goal, 3-3.  Next, Roger Hansson -behind the goal- sent the puck back to the blue line  where Roger Akerstrom took a slap shot and Ketterer didn't see the puck since  there was traffic in front, 4-3.  Third period started with a nice goal by Stefan \\\"the Shadow\\\" Nilsson. Stefan  and Patrik Juhlin entered the Finnish zone, Patrik passed the puck back to  Stefan who alone with Ketterer made no mistake, 5-3.  Then, Keijo Sailynoja show started. He reduce and equalized the lead in only  21 seconds! First he scored the 5-4 goal, and after that he came in alone   with Aslin but was tripped by Aslin to get a penalty shot. Sailynoja  made a nice penalty shot, showed forehand and put in with a low backhand shot.  The Swedes seemed to head for a win when Mikael Renberg scored the 6-5 goal  late in the game on a nice power play combination. Renberg waited in the slot,  showed that he wanted the puck on the backhand side, Ahlund passed the puck  and Renberg took a turnaround shot low in Ketterer's goal's far side.  But Jari Korpisalo had other plans as he only 28 seconds later scored the  game's final goal to make it 6-6. Korpisalo took a slap shot from a narrow  angle that -maybe- Aslin should have saved.   All in all, a decent game where the defense wasn't the best.  Both teams juggled around the lines a bit in the second and third period  to try no combinations.   Renberg and Rundqvist plays well together in the Swedish team. Larsson-  Nilsson-Juhlin best line overall again, it seems to be a working WC line.  Stillman good on defense.  Some players aren't good enough for the WC though. Hakan Ahlund (faell ner  hjaelmen och jobba!), Roger Hansson, Challe Berglund, Kenny Jonsson  will likely have to leave for NHL pros.   Two-goal scorers Jari Korpisalo and Keijo Sailynoja played well in the  Finnish team. Markus Ketterer didn't have a very good game, we've seen him  a lot better, so Lindfors is probably Finland's starting goalie in the WC.  I heard that Esa Tikkanen will join the Finnish team. It would be inter-  resting to know which other pros coach Matikainen counts on for the WC.   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Starting lines:    SWEDEN     FINLAND    35.

I of course don't know the exact situation, and anti-depressants may work, but it isn't helping the ringing at all, is it?    Mine started about three years back.

It would keep me up and drive me nuts too, but nowadays, I have to plug both my ears with my fingers to check to see if they are ringing.  Usually they are, but you get so used to it, it just gets tuned out.  Yes, this is what I've read about it... not just from my own personal experience.    Millions have it, according to my physician.  You just learn to cope with it (like I mentioned earlier) by ignoring it.  It eventually becomes unconscious.

Also, it doesn't necessarily mean there is any hearing loss, either caused by it or causing it.  I had an ENT (ear/nose/throat) exam, and passed.  In fact, my hearing is quite good considering I don't take as good of care of my hearing as I should.  Her reaction is normal.

What I was asking is this:  Please show me that the most effective substance-absure recovery programs involve meetinsg peoples' spiritual needs, rather than merely attempting to fill peoples' spiritual needs as percieved by the people, A.A, S.R.C. regulars, or snoopy. This will probably involve defining \\\"spritual needs\\\" (is it not that clear) and showing that such things exist and how they can be filled.  Annother tack you might take is to say that \\\"fulfilling spiritual needs\\\" means \\\"acknowledging a \\\"higher power\\\" of some sort, then show that systems that do require this, work better than otherwise identical systems that do not. A correlation here would help you, but as you point out this might just be demonstrating swapping one crutch for annother. (however, I do feel that religion is usually a better crutch than alchohol, as it is not usually poisonous! :) )  I hope with that clarification, my question will be answerable. I actually did know about the 12 step program, its the question of what it does, rather than what it tries to do, that makes a difference to me. ---    - Dan Johnson And God said \\\"Jeeze, this is dull\\\"... and it *WAS* dull.

Assuming that the helmet/ head assembly takes the same impact, if the shell cracks in one case, then in the other the liner must be dented, or the head gets jiggled. If it's the the liner that's dented, the helmet is just as toast as if the shell were cracked, it won't absorb energy form an impact in that area.

Any suggestions, opinions about post-trace anti-aliasing would be greatly appreciated.\",\"   It's not a bad question: I don't have any refs that list this algorithm either. But thinking about it a bit, it shouldn't be too hard.  1) Take three of the points and find the plane they define as well as the circle that they lie on (you say you have this algorithm already)  2) Find the center  of this circle. The line passing through this center perpendicular to the plane of the three points passes through the center of the sphere.  3) Repeat with the unused point and two of the original points. This gives you two different lines that both pass through the sphere's origin. Their interection is the center of the sphere.  4) the radius is easy to compute, it's just the distance from the center to any of the original points.  I'll leave the math to you, but this is a workable algorithm. :-)   An alternate method would be to take pairs of points: the plane formed by the perpendicular bisector of each line segment pair also contains the center of the sphere. Three pairs will form three planes, intersecting at a point. This might be easier to implement.\",\"I don't know anything about this particular case, but *other* governments have been known to follow events on the Usenet.  For example after Tienanmien Square in Beijing the Chinese government began monitoring cyberspace.

But what's the big deal?  You shouldn't advocate illegal acts in this medium in any case.  If you are concerned about being monitored, you should use encyrption software (available in IGC's \\\"micro\\\" conference).

In an effort to make my 3.5\\\" drive  (normally b:) my a: drive, I switched the order of connections on the cable  from the serial card/floppy/ide controller. I booted up, changed the CMOS settings to reflect the a: drive as the 3.5 and the b: drive as the 5.25. The drive lights didn't come on, and there was a failure trying to read from those drives.  I switched the cables back to their original positions, and then booted-up and restored the original CMOS settings. The lights for the floppies came on during this process, and they stay on for as long as the computer is on. I see that when there is a disk in a:, the drive is spinning, yet there seems to be no disk access. MSD.EXE and Norton SI detect both drives, but when I  try to get detailed information about a: or b:, Norton SI tells me that there is no disk in the drive.  Can anyone offer any suggestions?

This is   a very good dirt bike and has been maintained perfectly.  I never had   any problems with it.    It's a four stroke, 4 valves, liquid cooled engine. It is heavier than    a 250 2 stroke but still lighter than a Honda XR600 and has a lot better    suspension (Ohlins shock, Husky fork) than the XR. For the casual or non   competitive rider, the engine is much better than any two stroke.   You can easily lug up hills and blast through trails with minimum gear   changes.

THE CLIPPER CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY                                 Dorothy Denning                             Revised, April 21, 1993   INTRODUCTION  On April 16, the President announced a new initiative that will bring together the Federal Government and industry in a voluntary program to provide secure communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement.  At the heart of the plan is a new tamper-proof encryption chip called the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" together with a split-key approach to escrowing keys.  Two escrow agencies are used, and the key parts from both are needed to reconstruct a key.   CHIP CONTENTS  The Clipper Chip contains a classified single-key 64-bit block encryption algorithm called \\\"Skipjack.\\\"  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys (compared with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling (compared with 16 for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  The algorithm takes 32 clock ticks, and in Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode runs at 12 Mbits per second.  Each chip includes the following components:     the Skipjack encryption algorithm    F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips    N, a 30-bit serial number (this length is subject to change)    U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip  The chips are programmed by Mykotronx, Inc., which calls them the \\\"MYK-78.\\\"  The silicon is supplied by VLSI Technology Inc.  They are implemented in 1 micron technology and will initially sell for about $30 each in quantities of 10,000 or more.  The price should drop as the technology is shrunk to .8 micron.   ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP  To see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T telephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and we both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure conversation, my security device will negotiate an 80-bit session key K with the device at the other end.  This key negotiation takes place without the Clipper Chip.  In general, any method of key exchange can be used such as the Diffie-Hellman public-key distribution method.  Once the session key K is established, the Clipper Chip is used to encrypt the conversation or message stream M (digitized voice).  The telephone security device feeds K and M into the chip to produce two values:     E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and     E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement field ,   which are transmitted over the telephone line.  The law enforcement field thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U concatenated with the serial number N, all encrypted under the family key F.  The law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after an authorized wiretap has been installed.  The ciphertext E[M; K] is decrypted by the receiver's device using the session key:     D[E[M; K]; K] = M .   CHIP PROGRAMMING AND ESCROW  All Clipper Chips are programmed inside a SCIF (Secure Compartmented Information Facility), which is essentially a vault.  The SCIF contains a laptop computer and equipment to program the chips.  About 300 chips are programmed during a single session.  The SCIF is located at Mykotronx.  At the beginning of a session, a trusted agent from each of the two key escrow agencies enters the vault.  Agent 1 enters a secret, random 80-bit value S1 into the laptop and agent 2 enters a secret, random 80-bit value S2. These random values serve as seeds to generate unit keys for a sequence of serial numbers.  Thus, the unit keys are a function of 160 secret, random bits, where each agent knows only 80.    To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1. S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a 64-bit block R1:          R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .  Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:            R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1]          R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .  R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow agencies.  As a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are written onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part U1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third disk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent 2 takes the second disk.  Thus each agent walks away knowing an 80-bit seed and the 80-bit key parts.  However, the agent does not know the other 80 bits used to generate the keys or the other 80-bit key parts.    The third disk is used to program the chips.  After the chips are programmed, all information is discarded from the vault and the agents leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional assurance that no information is left behind.   The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the room instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2, and the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to the escrow agencies.   The escrow agencies have as yet to be determined, but they will not be the NSA, CIA, FBI, or any other law enforcement agency.  One or both may be independent from the government.   LAW ENFORCEMENT USE  When law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line, they will first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get access to the communications line.  Let us assume that the tap is in place and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with the Clipper Chip.  The law enforcement field is first decrypted with the family key F, giving E[K; U] + N.  Documentation certifying that a tap has been authorized for the party associated with serial number N is then sent (e.g., via secure FAX) to each of the key escrow agents, who return (e.g., also via secure FAX) U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are XORed together to produce the unit key U, and E[K; U] is decrypted to get the session key K.  Finally the message stream is decrypted.  All this will be accomplished through a special black box decoder.   CAPSTONE: THE NEXT GENERATION  A successor to the Clipper Chip, called \\\"Capstone\\\" by the government and \\\"MYK-80\\\" by Mykotronx, has already been developed.  It will include the Skipjack algorithm, the Digital Signature Standard (DSS), the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA), a method of key exchange, a fast exponentiator, and a randomizer.  A prototoype will be available for testing on April 22, and the chips are expected to be ready for delivery in June or July. \",\"Archive-name: rec-autos/part4  [this article is one of a pair of articles containing commonly asked automotive questions; the other article contains questions of general consumer interest, and is broken out to facilitate crossposting to misc.consumers -- rpw]  [last change: 8 February 1993; CT now permits radar detector usage,     new tire-traction q&a -- rpw]                  Commonly Asked Questions  Radar Questions:  Q:  Where are radar detectors illegal?  A:  In the US, currently Virgina and the District of Columbia prohibit     all usage of radar detectors.  New York prohibits their use in     large trucks.  In Canada, they are illegal in Manitoba, Ontario,     Quebec, Newfoundland and PEI (Prince Edward Island).  They     are apparently are illegal through most, if not all, of Europe.     Legislation which would make them illegal is pending in many other     jurisdictions; chances of such legislation passing varies a great deal.  Q:  Where are Radar Detector Detectors used?  Do they really work?  A:  Usage is spreading rapidly; initially they were used only in Canada,     but now they are appearing in New York and Virginia.  It is unsafe     to assume that they are not in use in Connecticut and D.C.     They work by detecting a certain frequency radiated by many currently     available super Het radar detectors; some brands of detector radiate     more strongly than others, and are thus more likely to be spotted.     New radar detectors are becoming available which may not be detected     by the current generation of detector detectors.  Note that a     detector may only be spotted by one of these devices if it is turned     on.  Q:  What is VASCAR?  Is it some kind of Radar?  A:  VASCAR is nothing more than a fancy stopwatch and time-speed-distance     computer.  It depends on the operator pressing buttons as the target     vehicle passes landmarks.  No radar signals are emitted by a VASCAR     system.  Q:  What is Ka band radar?  Where is it used?  Should a radar detector be     able to handle it?   A:  Ka band has recently been made available by the FCC for use in the US     in so-called photo-radar installations.  In these installations, a     low-powered beam is aimed across the road at a 45 degree angle to the     direction of traffic, and a picture is taken of vehicles which the     radar unit determines to have been in violation of the speed limit.     Tickets are mailed to the owner of the vehicle.  Because of the low     power and the 45 degree angle, many people believe that a radar     detector cannot give reasonable warning of a Ka band radar unit,     although some manufacturers of radar detectors have added such     capability anyway.  The number of locales where photo-radar is in use     is limited, and some question the legality of such units.  Best advice:     learn what photo radar units look like, and keep track of where they     are used (or else, don't speed.)  Q:  Do radar jammers work?  Are they legal?  A:  Quick answer:  No, and Not in the USA.     Detailed answer:  Cheap radar jammers do not work well at all.     Jammers that work are expensive and usually the property of the     military.  Jammers are a major violation of the regulations of the     Federal Communications Commission of the USA.  Driving technique and Vehicle Dynamics Questions:  Q:  What are understeer and oversteer?  A:  Understeer and oversteer are terms describing the behaviour of a     car while cornering near the `limit' (limit of adhesion, that is.)     Most drivers do not normally drive hard enough for these terms to     be descriptive of the situations they encounter.  Simply put, they     tell whether the car wants to go straight in a corner (steer `less',     or `understeer') or it wants to turn more in a corner (`oversteer'.)     Understeer is commonly designed into most production cars so that     untrained drivers, inadvertantly traveling too fast, won't get into     trouble.  Understeer may also be induced by using too much throttle     in a corner.  Oversteer is designed into some more performance     oriented cars; it may be induced by lifting on the throttle (Trailing     throttle oversteer, or TTO).  In extreme cases, lifting on the throttle     may induce so much oversteer that the car reacts by fishtailing or     spinning.      Some technical details:  in a corner at speed, the tires on the car     will develop what are called `slip angles'; the slip angle is the     angular difference between the direction that the car is traveling     and the direction that the steering wheel is directing the car to     travel.  In understeer, the front wheels have a greater slip angle     than the rear wheels.  In oversteer, the rear wheels have a greater     slip angle than the front wheels.  Q: What is a rev-matched downshift?  A: When downshifting, the engine must be rotating faster in the lower gear    than it was in the higher gear.  However, during a downshift, normally    you declutch and lift your foot from the throttle, so the revs drop    rather than increase.  In rev-matched downshift, you blip the throttle    before re-engaging the clutch so that the engine will already be up to    the new speed.  This results in a much smoother and faster downshift.  Q: What does heel-and-toe mean?  A: Heel-and-toe is a technique used to do a rev-matched downshift while    braking.  This is normally challenging, because you need the right foot    for both the brake and throttle.  It is called heel-and-toe because you    use one end of the foot on the brake, and the other on the throttle to    match revs for the downshift.  In many modern cars this is a misnomer;    often you must use the ball of the foot on the brake and the right side    on the throttle.     Note that some race car drivers will skip the clutch, and just use the    left foot on the brake and the right foot on the throttle, accomplishing    the same thing.  Q: What is double-clutch downshifting?  A: While your right foot is doing the above, your left foot can do one of    three things:  nothing, declutch once, or declutch twice.  The reason for    declutching twice is to match the speeds of the two shafts in the    transmission to the speed of the engine.  This is usually coupled with    rev-matching, so that while the engine is in neutral and the clutch    engaged, the throttle is blipped and both shafts of the transmission    speed up.     The procedure is as follows:    (0) declutch    (1) move gearshift lever to neutral    (2) engage clutch    (3) match revs    (4) declutch    (5) move gearshift lever to next lower gear    (6) engage clutch     This sounds like a lot of work, but with practice it becomes natural.    The problem that double-clutching solves is normally the function of the    synchronizers within the gearbox.  In transmissions without synchros or    with very worn synchros, double-clutching makes it much easier to shift.    Basically, if you double-clutch well, you are not using the synchros at    all.  This is generally unnecessary on street cars with synchros in good    condition.  Q: What do the numbers for acceleration from 0-60, 1/4 mile, skidpad, and    slalom times in the Auto Magazines really mean?  May they be compared?  A: In short, 1) not as much as the magazines want you to believe, and    2) almost never.     In more detail:  the acceleration numbers (0-60mph and 1/4 mile times    in the US) may be vaguely compared as long as they all come from the    same source.  Testing procedures vary so much from magazine to magazine    that comparing a Road & Track number to a Car & Driver number is quite    pointless.  Keep in mind, too, that the same variation applies from    driver to driver on the street; the driver is a major (often *the*    major) part of the equation.     Skidpads vary, and even if they didn't, skidpad figures are really    only tests of the stickiness of the stock tires; they change radically    when tire compounds change.  DO NOT make any assumptions about the    comparative handling of, say, two sports sedans based on skidpad numbers.    This is not to suggest that skidpads are without value, however. Skidpads    are an excellent educational tool at driving schools.  They are simply    of limited value in the comparison of anything except tires.     Slalom times are slightly more useful; they test some small parts of the    automobile's transient response.  However, they are also heavily influenced    by the stock rubber on the car, and they do not test many corners of the    car's envelope.  They DO NOT tell you all you need to know before making    a buying decision.  For example, they don't tell you what the rear end    of the car will do on a road which suddenly goes off-camber.  When a car    has an adjustable suspension, these tests are usually done in the `sport'    setting, which may be quite unsuitable for daily driving.  The list of    caveats could go on for page after page.  Q: My buddy claims that wide tires don't make any difference, according    to his freshman physics textbook, and that you can't ever accelerate    or corner at more than 1.0G.  Does he know what he's talking about?  A: 1) in short:  he hasn't got a clue.     2) in more detail: the equations for friction used in freshman physics    textbooks presume that the surfaces are smooth,  dry and non-deformable,    none of which properly apply to tire traction except in the case of a    stone cold tire on dry pavement which is far below its proper operating    temperature.     Pavement is _never_ smooth; it is always irregular to a greater or lesser    extent.  Tires, which are not really dry and solid (as rubber is a    substance which in its natural form is liquid, and which has only been    coerced into a semblance of solidity by chemical magic), deform to match    the surface of the pavement which a vehicle is traveling over.  In a tire    at operating temperature, grip is actually generated by shear stresses    inside the deformed rubber, and not by anything even remotely resembling    friction in the freshman physics sense of the term.  The colder a tire    is relative to its operating temperature, the closer its behaviour will    be to the traditional concept of friction; if much hotter than the its    proper operating temperature, the more likely the possibility of some    part of the tire actually ``reverting'' to liquid, which is mostly like    to happen deep in the tread, causing characteristic blisters and chunking.    (This latter, though, is almost completely unlikely to happen in normal    street driving, so unless you're a competition driver or do a lot of    high speed track driving, don't worry about it.)     Because tire traction is completely out of the domain of simple friction,    it does not obey the freshman physics equation at all; thus dragsters    accelerate at more than 1.0G and race cars corner and brake at more than    1.0G.  Because simple friction does not apply, it is actually possible    for different sized contact patches to generate differing amounts of    grip.  An actual analysis of tire behavior would require techniques    such as Finite Element Analysis, due to the complexity of the mechanism.  Misc. Questions:  Q:  What does <name or acronym> stand for?  A:  Here is a list of some of the names which are commonly asked     about; be careful in soliciting the meanings of other names     as misinformation abounds on the net.  In particular, NEVER     ask in rec.humor if you want a useful result.      Saab:   Svenska Aeroplan A.

A:  No.  Porsche is a publicly held company, controlled by the Porsche and     Piech families.  Porsche has extensive business dealings with VW/Audi,     which causes some confusion.  Since currently Porsche is in some     financial difficulty, there is a possibility that Mercedes or VW may     be interested in purchasing the company in the near future, but this     is only speculation at this time.\",\"I've been a Giants season ticket holder for years and never really complained about the old ballyard place. Sure, it's been cold, the food lines were long, and the hired hands were surly, but this was all part of the Giants mystique. Or so I thought.  I went to Tuesday's game (3 - 1 Giants over the Marlins) and the 'Stick was  a much different place. Nothing short of a dome will eliminate the wind, but  everything is a lot better. The lines are a lot shorter, the bathrooms are CLEAN and have running water, and the hired hands were very polite.   The new foghorn (lights up and blows after each homerun) and the wooden fence are very nice, as are the new bleachers. The bleachers start right at the top of the fence and give a great view, and they've got beer stands at the bottome of the bleachers. The only complaint is that the electronic  old-fashioned scoreboard looks electronic - could be better.  These things should have been done a long time ago, but it took a real  businessman (ex - Safeway President Peter Magowan) to figure it out.

Simpler shading models are implemented already, f.i. in x3d (ask archie where to get the latest version). For Gouroud, a fast implementation will be possible utilizing some extension only, either MIT-SHM to do the shade in an image and fast update the window with it, or PEX/OpenGL which should be able to shade themselves. The portable 'vanilla X' way would be to shade in a normal XImage and use XPutImage(), what would be good enough to do static things as f.i. fractal landscapes or such stuff.  To speak about POVRay, the X previewer that comes with the original source package is not that good, especially in speed, protocol-friendlyness and ICCCM compliance.

If you have corrections or answers to other frequently asked questions that you would like included in this posting, send email to leech@cs.unc.edu (Jon Leech).      If you don't want to see the FAQ, add 'Frequently Asked Questions' to your KILL file for this group (if you're not reading this with a newsreader that can kill articles by subject, you're out of luck).      The FAQ volume is excessive right now and will hopefully be trimmed down by rewriting and condensing over time. The FAQ postings are available in the Ames SPACE archive in FAQ/faq<#>.      Good summaries will be accepted in place of the answers given here. The point of this is to circulate existing information, and avoid rehashing old answers. Better to build on top than start again. Nothing more depressing than rehashing old topics for the 100th time. References are provided because they give more complete information than any short generalization.      Questions fall into three basic types:      1) Where do I find some information about space?      Try your local public library first. The net is not a good place to ask     for general information. Ask INDIVIDUALS (by email) if you must. There     are other sources, use them, too. The net is a place for open ended     discussion.      2) I have an idea which would improve space flight?      Hope you aren't surprised, but 9,999 out of 10,000 have usually been     thought of before. Again, contact a direct individual source for     evaluation. NASA fields thousands of these each day.      3) Miscellanous queries.      These are addressed on a case-by-case basis in the following series of     FAQ postings.       SUGGESTIONS FOR BETTER NETIQUETTE      Read news.announce.newusers if you're on Usenet.     Minimize cross references, [Do you REALLY NEED to?]     Edit \\\"Subject:\\\" lines, especially if you're taking a tangent.     Send mail instead, avoid posting follow ups. (1 mail message worth  100 posts).     Internet mail readers: send requests to add/drop to SPACE-REQUEST  not SPACE.     Read all available articles before posting a follow-up. (Check all  references.)     Cut down attributed articles (leave only the points you're  responding to; remove signatures and headers). Summarize!     Put a return address in the body (signature) of your message (mail  or article), state your institution, etc. Don't assume the  'reply' function of mailers will work.     Use absolute dates. Post in a timely way. Don't post what everyone  will get on TV anyway.     Some editors and window systems do character count line wrapping:  keep lines under 80 characters for those using ASCII terminals  (use carriage returns).

The Woman is the Church.  Catholics have always called our Church \\\"Holy Mother Church\\\" and our \\\"Mother.\\\"  An example would be from St. Cyprian of Carthage, who wrote in 251 AD, \\\"Can anyone have God for his Father, who does not have the Church for his mother?\\\"  Hence the image of the Church as a woman, holding a Cross and a Cup, which tell of the Crucifxition of Our Lord, and of the power of His Blood (the grail legend, but also, more significantly, it shows that \\\"This is the Cup of the New Covenant in my blood, which shall be shed for you and for many.\\\" (Luke 22.20), the Cup represents the New Covenant and holds the blood of redemption).  The fact that the woman is holding both and is said to have the whole world for her seat, is that the Catholic Church is catholic, that is universal, and is found throughout the world, and the Church shows the Crucifixtion and applies the blood of redemption to all mankind by this spread of hers, thorugh which the Holy Sacrafice of the Mass, can be said and celebrated in all the nations as Malachi predicted in Malachi 1.11, \\\"From the rising of the sun to its setting, my name is great among the gentiles, and everywhere there is sacrafice, and there is offered to my Name a clean oblation, for my Name is great among the gentiles, says the Lord of hosts.\\\"  And so we acknowledge what St. Paul wrote \\\"For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you show the Lord's death until he comes.\\\" (1 Corinthians 11.26)   You are quite right about the identification of \\\"Babylon the Great, Mother of all Harlots\\\" with Rome.

Personally, I feel that the universal health insurance approach used in Canada, France and Germany -- paying to private health providers in a nominally free market not unlike America's, minus HMO's -- depends a lot on values in those societies different from the U.S.  The basic health needs for life are not viewed as market, but the insurance does allow the market to address that -- basic health care is not viewed on the level of ownership of a VCR as Americans would see it.

Their distribution is very isotropic and the intensity distribution, crudely speaking, indicates we're seeing an edge to the distribution.     Given the enormous  power,  i was just wondering,  what if they are    quantum  black holes or something  like that  fairly close by?     Why would they have to be at  galactic ranges?     Now, in the good old days before GRO data, it was thought the gamma bursters were neutron stars in the galaxy, it was expected that GRO would confirm this by either showing they were a local population (within a few hundred light years) or that they were in the galactic halo. (Mechanism was not known but several plausible ones existed) (also to be fair it was noted that the _brightest_ burster was probably in the LMC, suggesting theorists might be wrong back then...)  As the Sun is not at the center of the galaxy a halo population should show anisotropy (a local disk population is ruled out completely at this stage) - to avoid the anisotropy you have to push the halo out, the energy then gets large, the mechanism of getting NS out that far becomes questionable, and we should start to see for example the Andromeda's bursters.  The data is consistent with either a Oort cloud distribution (but only just) - but no one can think of a plausible source with the right spectrum. Or, it can be a cosmological distances (hence isotropy) and the edge is \\\"the edge of the Universe\\\" ;-) If at cosmological distances you need very high energy (to detect) and a very compact source (for spectrum), ergo a neutron star colliding with another neutron star or black hole. Even then getting the spectrum is very hard, but conceivable.   If we know anything about physics at that level, the bursters are not due to quantum black holes or cosmic strings, wrong spectrum for one thing.  The situation is further complicated by recent claims that there are two classes of sources ;-)  [in the colliding NS they'd actually probably fit relatively easily into the NS-NS and NS-BH collision scenarios respectively]     my own pet theory is that it's  Flying saucers  entering    hyperspace :-)     but the reason i am asking is that most everyone assumes  that they    are  colliding nuetron stars  or  spinning black holes,  i just wondered    if any mechanism could exist  and place them  closer in.

Thiokol provided me with samples and data on a reinforcement to solid motor grains for high accelerations.  Solid motor propellants usually have a substantial percentage of  aluminum in the mix.  For example, the Space Shuttle SRBs are 16 percent Aluminum.  The technique is to use a 'foamed aluminum' structure. The structure looks like the inverse of a set of bubbles (an I suspect some bubbling process is used to form it).  In other words, if you made a bunch of bubbles in molten aluminum, then froze it, this is what you get.  It forms a strong network of effectively aluminum wires in all directions.  The remaining solid fuel mix is infiltrated into the voids, and you get aluminum-reinforced solid propellant.  The foamed-aluminum makes up about 6 percent of the total propellant, so there is still aluminum particles in the bulk grain.  The major improvement is the higher resistance to grain cracking, which is the principal failure mode for solid propellant.

D:d :wq \",\"  Oh, yeah.  Dave Winfield--marginal player.  Guy didn't hit a lick, had negligible power, was a crap fielder and had no staying power.  Dave Winfield, now entering his (I believe) 20th big league season, is still a damn decent hitter.  Admittedly, his defense has slipped a great deal, but in his prime, he had a powerful arm and great range.  Take a look at the stats:  I don't  know where you even BEGIN to make an argument that Winfield and Kingman are similar players.  Kingman was a one-dimension power hitter--he couldn't field, he ran like an anvil, hit for a low average (though, if I remember right, his OBP wasn't THAT hideous...), and (for those who consider such things important) was a absolute-primo-dick.    Eddie Murray?  Yup, only the best 1st baseman of the 80's.  I know that MVP votes are conducted by mediots, but given that he got jobbed out of the MVP he deserved in 1983, it seems that he wasn't overrated by the media.    Lee Smith?  Hmmmm... This one's actually pretty close.  He's had a s solid, dependable career as a closer despite pitching in some nasty parks  (Wrigley, Fenway...).  I'd have to take a closer look at the stats (it's been  a while), but it seems Lee Arthur is of HOF caliber.    You do make a legitimate point about the HOF credentials of relievers, simply racking up a lot of saves doesn't mean a whole hell of a lot if you  blow a bunch, too.  Simply because Minnesota and Boston and (for a month) Atlanta used Reardon as a closer for longer than he should have been one,  the Equalizer has racked up an impressive number of saves.  No way should  HomerMan be in the HOF, IMHO.  Darrell Evans?  Nice career, actually a bit underrated (kinda like Ted Simmons, IMHO), but not a HOF'er.    Lemme ask you this.  Who the hell playing the game ISN'T marginal?    Now, wait a goddamn minute here.  Ozzie Smith absolutely REDEFINED the position of shortstop.  His defense was SO good that he's won something along the lines of 10 Gold Gloves.  Again, Gold Gloves are mediot-biased, and a  good argument could be made that Larkin deserved one or two of Ozzie's more recent awards, but usually, this is tempered by someone else in the early 80's getting the Gold Gloves Ozzie deserved earlier in his career.  Ozzie's offense, you ask?  Good OBP, great speed numbers, in a park which, for most of his career, depressed offense, admittedly, no power ('cept against Tom Niedenfuer :-|), but still, a definite asset offensively.  Yount?  3,000 hits, MVP at two different positions, uh-huh, a real stiff.  His '82 was one of the great years EVER by a player in recent memory, and probably ranks behind only the peak seasons of Wagner and Banks, as far as SS numbers go.  He's a clear HOF'er, IMHO.    Well, as far as Garvey goes, you're right.  Garvey is a \\\"mediot\\\"  candidate, pushed because of his \\\"winning attitude\\\" (a minor factor, if one at all), and his \\\"great defense\\\" (no errors, admittedly, but the range of a tree stump...).  Garvey shouldn't be in the HOF.  SkyJack?  I've said a lot of nasty things about SkyJack in the last year or so, but this is mostly in response to mediots and woofers who talk about Morris' \\\"ability to win\\\" which is nothing more than Morris' \\\"ability to pitch when Toronto to score tons of runs\\\".  At this point, Morris is an average pitcher (although from his early returns in '93, he may be damned  close to done.).  But, in all fairness, Morris was a dominant pitcher in the 80's for up-and-down Tiger teams.  While 1984 was (obviously) a great year for Detroit, the rest of the decade, the team was generally in contention, but not favorites.  Morris' career numbers are quite good, and worthy of HOF \\\"consideration\\\".    Ryan?  Of course, but be careful.  I guarantee you that someone will throw back your earlier logic about \\\"Yount and Smith being shortstops who  hung around a long time\\\".  After all, Nolan never won a Cy...  Damn, he's  just pitcher who hung around for 99 years...  His W-L record is mediocre... (Of course, Nolan's a HOF'er...)  Puck?  Probably, although he's got to play reasonably well for a few more years (10 years, even good ones, aren't enough to make the HOF, most likely).  That said, I believe Puckett WILL make the HOF, pretty much regardless of how the rest of his career turns out (barring something REALLY  tragic or sudden).  He's very popular in the media and with fans, and legitimately has been one of the best CF's in the game since he joined the league.  I've always liked the guy, and I hope he does make it.  And, in the end, I think the Puck will make it in.  But, really, it's too early to sell.   This debate comes up rather frequently on the net, and, believe it  or not, I never tire of it.  It's an interesting subject.  Here's an off the top of my head list of potential HOF'ers from each team.  I probably left a couple of guys off, so feel free to follow up.

In my computerized baseball game, I keep track of a category called \\\"stolen hits\\\", defined as a play made that \\\"an average fielder would not make with average effort.\\\"  Using the 1992 Defensive Averages posted by Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), I've figured out some defensive stats for the second basemen. Hits Stolen have been redefined as \\\"Plays Kurt Stillwell would not have made.\\\"  OK, I realize that's unfair.  Kurt's probably the victim of pitching staff, fluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let's put it this way:  If we replaced every second baseman in the NL with someone with Kurt's 57.6% out making ability, how many extra hits would go by?  To try and correlate it to reality a little more, I've calculated Net Hits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league average fielder would make.  By the same method I've calculated Net Double Plays, and Net Extra Bases (doubles and triples let by).  Finally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or DCON :->.  Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player. I add this number to OPS to get DOPS (Defense + Onbase Plus Slug), which should represent the player's total contribution to the team.  So don't take it too seriously.  The formula for DCON appears at the end of this article.

Basically, it's designed to be added into the OPS, with the idea that \\\"a run prevented is as important as a run scored\\\". The extra outs are factored into OBP, while the extra bases removed are  factored into SLG.  That's why I used PA and AB as the divisors.

I'll accept it (reluctantly) from mobs in Pakistan, but not from you.  What is presented in the fictional dream of a demented character cannot by the wildest stretch of the imagination be considered a reflection on the actual Mohammad.  What's worse, the novel doesn't present the Mahound/Mohammed character in any worse light than secular histories of Islam; in particular, there is no \\\"lewd\\\" misrepresentation of his life or that of his wives.   Don't hold back; he's considered an apostate and a blasphemer. However, it's not for his writing in _The Satanic Verses_, but for what people have accepted as a propagandistic version of what is contained in that book.  I have yet to find *one single muslim* who has convinced me that they have read the book.  Some have initially claimed to have done so, but none has shown more knowledge of the book than a superficial Newsweek story might impart, and all have made factual misstatements about events in the book.   I'll keep an eye out for it.  I have a counter-proposal: I suggest that you see the Viking hardcover by Salman Rushdie called _The Satanic Verses_.

EDT              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As you know, the President is soon  to be on his way, on Amtrack to Camden Yards.  He'll be throwing out  the first pitch.              Q   It's MARC, the Maryland Area Transit, it's not  Amtrack.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, it's not Amtrack?  Well, he's  going from Union Station, you're right.  Excuse me.              Q   George, what exactly are you prepared to do to  break the logjam with  ??? Senate?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, there are  discussions between Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole this morning,  and I think that the President is going to continue to make the point  that he believes that our investment package, our jobs package needs  to be passed as quickly as possible.  We need this investment for  summer jobs, for immunization, for highway construction, for the  important programs that will put people back to work right away this  summer.  And the President continues to believe his program should be  passed.              Q   Will he compromise, that's the question?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, the discussions  are going on this morning in the Senate betwen Senator Mitchell and  Senator Dole, let's see what they come up with.  But the President  believes his jobs program should go forward.              Q   George, would the President be willing to accept $8  billion for one year, which apparently appears to be the compromise  being offered by --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I don't know what is being  offered by either side.  The Senate discussions are going on right  now, let's see what happens today.              Q   Would he go that far -- no matter what the  Republicans have offered so far, would he go that far, $8 billion per  year?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that his  program should be passed at this time.  Clearly, we're going to be  willing to listen to what the Senators might or might not be able to  come up with, but I'm not going to get into figures right now.  Let's  see what happens.              Q   It's reasonable to assume, isn't it, from what has  happened so far that a compromise is going to be necessary in order  to get a vote?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the Republicans seem more  intrested in stopping progress on the President's jobs bill, than in  doing something to create --  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the  Republicans seem more interested in stopping progress on the  President's jobs bill than in doing something to create real action,  real jobs this summer for the American people.  I think there's no  question about that.  There's been some frustration of legislative  activity over the last few days.              Q   So, you'll need to compromise to get your package  through?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We'll see what happens with the  conversations between Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole this morning.              Q      prepared to compromise --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President's prepared to listen  to what Senator Mitchell has to say this morning after his meeting  with Senator Dole.               Q   Does he feel that he has been defeated in his --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not in the least.  In fact, he's  been very successful so far in the beginning of his term.              Q   How?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He passed his budget in record  time, in six weeks, and it's a budget which reduces the deficit by  $500 billion over five years.  And it's a budget which provides for  important investments in our future.  Right now we've also had strong  passage of his jobs program through the House.  Simply because a  minority of Republicans in the Senate choose to perpetuate gridlock  and hold up action on the President's jobs program is not a sign that  he is not succeeding overall.              Q   He can't beat this, can he?              Q   The fact is they can do that?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the Republicans can stop  action.  There's no question about that.              Q   What are you going to do about it?              Q   George, what do you know about these alleged notes  taken by Boris Yeltsin during one of the meetings in which it appears  that the President told Boris Yeltsin not to trust the Japanese; that  when they say yes they mean no?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's a complete  misreading of what happened at the meeting.  The context of the  conversation was that President Clinton was actually reassuring  President Yeltsin at the time about his conversations with Prime  Minister Miyazawa over the Kuril Islands and the Prime Minister's  belief that Japan would play a constructive role in the G-7 process.   I mean this was a casual comment about Japanese courtesy and  etiquette but overall it was in the context of a conversation where  he was reassuring President Yeltsin that he believed the Japanese  were serious about their commitment to the G-7 process.              Q    Are you saying that the President said that when  the Japanese say yes they mean no?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's not -- I don't know the  exact words and there was a much longer discussion about he did say  something along the lines that he believes that on this issue Prime  Minister Miyazawa intends to really go forward with the G-7 process.              Q   Have there been any attempts to explain this to the  Japanese because apparently the Japanese press has picked this up and  there appears to be --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I've seen the reports in the  Japanese press and it actually does put the situation in context.  It  does talk about the Japanese -- understanding the Japanese points of  view.  I don't think it's going to be a problem.  I believe that  there may have been some diplomatic context just to clear things up  but I'm not positive.              Q   George, was the specific comment that was made  specific to the Kuril Island situation or was it a general  observation on Japanese etiquette?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The discussion was about --              Q   The specific comment is what I'm asking about that  has alleged to have been translated from the Russian notes, \\\"when the  Japanese say yes they mean no.\\\"              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, it was a combination.  I mean  I don't think that's the whole sentence.  I think that the specific  comment was a broad, general observation followed up by a specific  finish to the sentence where he said in this case he believes that  Prime Minister Miyazawa means to keep the commitment.              Q   Was he saying it facetiously first?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it was just a casual  observation.              Q   And then you say diplomatic contacts were made to  clear it up.  Has the President sent a message?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, I don't think the President  spoke; I believe that Secretary Christopher has made some calls but  I'm not sure exactly how many.              Q   Well, this obviously is a bigger deal than you're  making it out to be if Christopher has had to make some calls.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, no.  It was just that we got  the reports in Vancouver and the Secretary wanted to make sure that  it was understood and make sure there was absolutely no        MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- reports in Vancouver, and the  Secretary wanted to make sure that it was understood, and make sure  there is absolutely no misunderstanding, and I don't believe there is  on.              Q   What is our position about the Japanese?  That they  may have to say one thing, but actualy mean another?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  The position on the Japanese  is as the President stated to President Yeltsin throughout the two  days.  He said that he had had a good conversation with Prime  Minister Miazawa prior to the Summit.  He reiterated the U.S.  position, the long-standing support for the Japanese position on the  Kuril Islands, but also reiterated Prime Minister Miazawa's  commitment to move forward on the G-7 process and to play a  constructive role.  And I think President Yeltsin was very glad to  hear that.              Q   After listening to Secretary Christopher on Iraq  for the last few days, I'm a little confused.  What is the U.S.  policy?  Do you want to see Saddam Hussein overturned?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's the same policy that Secretary  Christopher has reiterated, and all of the U.S officials have  reiterated.  We expect full and complete and unequivocal compliance  with all U.N. resolutions.  Right now we do not have that compliance.              Q      throwing it out further that if Iraq complies,  Saddam can't stay in office?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.  I think that that's -- our  judgment is that it is not possible for Saddam Hussein to comply with  the resolutions and stay in power.  But the important point is that  we expect compliance by Iraq with all U.N. resolutions, and we will  continue to demand it.              Q   And are you concerned the Iran will become the  dominant power in the area --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Secretary Christopher has also  spoken to Iran over the last several days, and he says we also expect  full Iranian compliance with all international norms, and stopping  support of terrorism.              Q   That's a very glib statement that he won't stay in  power if he complies with U.N. resolutions.  On what logic do you  base that?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right now Saddam Hussein is not  complying with the U.N. resolutions at all.  He is not respecting the  rights of his people, as is required by the U.N. resolution.  He is  not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding inspections.   He is not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding  armaments.              Q   Well, when do you think that if he did comply he  would be out of power?        MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, right now his power rests on  the repression of his people.  If he stopped doing that it would make  it more difficult for him to stay in power.              Q   George, back on the stimulus package, why is it  that you and the President accuse the Republicans of playing pure  politics and perpetuating gridlock?  Why is it that -- what evidence  do you have that they just don't have a genuine idealogical  difference with you that's in good faith?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the fact that several times  in the past the Republicans, many of the ones who are now leading the  fight for the filibuster, have supported the very funding they now  seek to stop, most especially, the highway funding.                Q   George, in regards to that, some of the moderate  Republicans said that the White House erred by not being more open to  them during the -- while the plan was put together, that they had  one, sort of, proforma meeting between the White House and the Senate  Republicans, and that was it.  Does the Administration look back and  thinks perhaps it could have done a better job of working with some - -              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I'm not sure that it's true  that there was only one meeting.  I mean, the President met with the  Republican leadership on at least two occasions before the  introduction of his package.  He met with the entire Senate  Republican Caucus also for lunch, and went up there.  We are  continually in contact with as many Republicans as we can find who  have an interest in the President's package.  We are interested in  what they have to say, as well.  But we believe that this program is  important, and we're going to continue to fight for it.              Q      your all or nothing, do it with the Democrats  alone strategy, did you maybe miscalculate the ability to get it  through?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean, I think that there is  no question that under the Senate rules a determined minority can  frustrate activity.  I mean, there is just no question about that.   You only need 40 plus one to keep going.  40 plus one to keep going  and to stop any action, and that's what the Republicans are doing.              Q      going to rethink the way you attempt to get  other things passed as you go through this process for the rest of  the summer?              Q      work with Republicans and try to woo some  Republicans into your camp?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we're going to continue to  look for the support of Republicans whenever we can get it on the  President's intiatives?              Q   But on this one -- how are you going to do it  differently than you did it on this one because on this one you  really did stiff the Republicans from the beginning and made it clear  that it was a Democratic majority that would get this through and  could get it through and you really didn't need Republican votes?   Are you going to take a different tack when you have to go for  particular votes?  When you have to go through --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't see into the future and  understand every possible turn in the legislative road.  Clearly the  President's going to continue to reach out when he can.              Q   You don't have any regrets then about the way you  have handled it up to now and you don't plan any changes in your  approach in dealing with the Republicans in Congress based on this  experience?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Obviously the President would like  his package passed as quickly as possible and he's going to continue  to press for that.  We will continue to reach out to Republicans,  there's not question about that.  And we'll continue to reason with  them and try and find appropriate avenues for cooperation.  In this  case the Republicans have chosen to unify around a filibuster, around  a plan to frustrate action not a plan to move forward.              Q   They're being denied any other legislative means of  putting their proposals forward.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think they're being --              Q      any ideas.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think their amendments are being  defeated; I don't know that they're being denied.              Q      to present them.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's not exactly true.  I mean  they get the votes --              Q      that theirs can be passed though by the  parliamentary rules under which they're playing.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Unless they get a majority in  support all the way around, no, that's not exactly true.              Q   George, one more on Iraq.  Is the administration  backing any of the Iraqi opposition?  Grooming any new leadership?              Q      backing any of the Iraqi -- leadership?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, I -- again, we're pressing for  Iraqi compliance.  I don't know if we can get into the business of  grooming leadership.  I believe there have been some contacts, at  some levels, with Iraqi opposition groups.  I don't know  about  anything recently.              Q      Jesse Jackson, who, of course, is not the  President's best friend, has, however, been told that there is to be  some kind of town meeting, or some kind of involvement by the  President, pre-empted the ball game -- Los Angeles.  Will he consider  something like that, or any other kind of intervention there?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, the President  appointed Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, about 10 days ago, to be a  special envoy to California, and coordiante cabinet activities around  the California economic situation, including the situation in Los  Angeles.                I believe there will also be visits out to Los Angeles  by the Education -- or have been visits by the Education Secretary,  Mr. Riley.  I believe that Transportation Secretary Pena and HUD  Secretary Cisneros are also going out.  And there may be other visits  by Cabinet officials over the next several days and weeks.  I  wouldn't rule out the possibility of a visit by President Clinton to  California.  Obviously, he is following the situation closely, and is  concerned about making sure that we make the right long term policy  decisions that will help create the kind of economic opportunities  which help prevent disturbances.  But we're going to continue to  watch it.              Q   George, as a follow-up, Reverend Jackson is also  supposed to be outside the ball park today, in Baltimore, with a  group of supporters protesting the lack of minorities in baseball  management.  Does the President have a position on that?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has received  correspondence from Reverend Jackson.  I know that Reverend Jackson  has also spoken with the White House Chief of Staff, Mack McLarty.   He clearly raises serious questions.  There has been some progress in  baseball over the last several years, but still not enough.  But the  President intends to continue to go to the ball game.              Q   Is he going to say anything about it today, or see  Reverend Jackson while he's out there?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if he is going to see  them, but as I said, the President believes that Reverend Jackson has  raised some serious questions, and it's something that, as I said,  even though there has been progress, it's clearly not enough.              Q   Did Reverend Jackson ask him not to go to the ball  game?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure about that.  I believe  the characterization the Reverend Jackson is talking about is an  informational pickett.  I don't know that he asked him not to go to  the ball game, but he sent a long, detailed, formal letter outlining  his concerns with the situation in major league baseball and the  President read it.              Q   George, the Orioles are playing the Rangers, the  managing partner of the Rangers is George W. Bush.  Is he going to be  there, and is he going to meet with the President?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.              Q   What is the Mubarak schedule?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I know that President Mubarak is  coming tomorrow morning for a working meeting, they will have a  lunch, and I believe that he is having dinner tonight with Vice  President Gore.              Q   And joint statements tomorrow --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe so, yes.  At the end,  yes.              Q   Is there evidence, George, that the Egyptians did  warn the U.S. about a potential terrorist bombing -- terrorist  activities?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As reported in The New York Times,  I mean, I think that President Mubarak did say that there has been  general conversations with the Egyptians, as there have been for a  long period of time.  We do have general intelligence sharing, I  mean.  But President Mubarak was very careful to point out that there  was no specific information on this visit that was passed forward.   The President will continue to investigate the situation, but he also  reiterates his belief that we cannot tolerate terrorism of any kind.              Q   George, he did make specific -- or the Egyptians,  apparently, did issue specific warnings about this individual who,  forgive me --this individual who, forgive me the name escapes me at  the moment, and said the Egyptians were more or less rebuffed in  their attempts to get some kind of action.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know if I would  agree with your characterization of the Mubarak interview.  He did  say that they gave general warnings about the possibility of a  network in the United States and upon which we took appropriate  action.  But there was no specific information on this specific  operation at all.              Q   So, the White House doesn't feel that any of the  law enforcement agencies whether it be the CIA or FBI who would have  received this kind of information was lax or derelict in its duty in  not pursuing some kind of --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, not at all.              Q   What's next with Serbia?  It got only a passing  mention in the news conference yesterday --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  You didn't get to ask your  question.              Q   Yes, exactly.  Was there any agreement on concerted  action between the two countries?  And even if there wasn't, what  does the U.S. do next?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the U.S. is clearly going  to move forward in the U.N. today continuing discussions with our  allies on a sanctions resolution and we'll continue to look for ways  to press the Serbians to come to the negotiating table and sign an  agreement.              Q   George, why do you think sanctions is still an  option?  I mean the Serbians make it clear that at least the  leadership is surviving just fine and they feel like they can wait  you out and even the administration officials we had in the other day  said there's no evidence that they're going to have an effect any  time soon.  The Bosnian Serbs have said no to the peace plan.  When  does no mean no and you have to do something different?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean we are doing something  different.  We're moving forward on further sanctions through the  U.N. and those discussions will continue.  We're going to continue to  try and tighten the noose on Serbia, and I think that every  opportunity we have to do that will have an effect over time.              Q   Are we looking again at lifting the arms embargo?  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has said that this is something  that is under consideration.              Q   George, do you have any more on Hugh Rodham's  condition, how he's doing?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As far as I know nothing's changed.              Q   George, -- week after Mr. Mubarak?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's a little unclear.  I think  we'll be able to get you more either tonight or tomorrow morning  after the Mubarak visit.              Q   Is he going somewhere for Easter?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not that I know of.              Q   What more can you tell us about the additional aid  to Russia that the President plans to ask Congress about?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's going to be consulting with  the Congress and with our G-7 partners over the next couple of weeks.   I know that he spoke last evening with Congressman Gephardt and their  delegation before the -- the congressional delegation meets with the  Russians this week and those consultations will continue over the  next several weeks.              Q   Do you expect that package to be of the magnitude  of the one announced Sunday?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not going to discuss the  magnitude.              Q   How about the list of Cold War restrictions, where  do you stand on that --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As the President said yesterday,  he's going to be looking for that list from the Congress this week  and reviewing it.  He believes -- he's going to try and get it this  week and he's going to review the list, and we're going to take a  hard look at it.              Q   But they're making it up?  I mean it's no White  House involvement, Congress is compiling this list?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he's going to talk to the  congressional leaders about compiling the list but I'm certain we'll  be able to get our own researchers working as well.              Q   George, isn't lifting the arms embargo more of a  probability than a possibility?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's something that's under  discussion.              Q   Secretary Christopher has said that it's a matter  of time and -- for months before that happens.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, all I can say is that it's  something that the President is reviewing.  Right now we're working  with our allies in the U.N on a sanctions resolution, and we'll  continue to review other matters.              Q   George, can you tell us anything about the schedule  this week?  Any travel?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They just asked about that.  I  don't have anything more beyond tomorrow's visit with Mubarak right  now.              Q   Are there consultations, George, with any Jewish  American organizations concerning Jackson-Vanick?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As you know the National Conference  of Soviet Jewry has a list of, I believe,        MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- as you know, the National  Conference of Soviet Jewry has a list of, I believe, 200 Refuseniks.   We'll certainly take a look at that and continue appropriate  discussions.              Thanks. \",\"I have two questions:  1) I have been having troubles with my Wordperfect for Windows.

The first period started with a give away from a Canadian defenseman and  Rundqvist came in alone on Ranford but couldn't put the puck over a sliding  Ranford. Later on, Kevin Dineen had a great opportunity but Soderstrom   played very well too. Stefan Nilsson had a couple of great dekes and set up  Jan Larsson but again Ranford came up big. Period ended scoreless but the edge  to Sweden in creating more opportunities.  Second period action saw Tommy Soderstrom making a GREAT save. Mark Recchi  made a backhanded cross ice pass to Lindros, Eric one timed the puck but  Soderstrom was there to make a glove hand save. At the 7-minute mark, Canada  started applying pressure on the Swedes. Sanderson-Dineen-Brind'Amour worked  hard and kept the puck in the Swedes' zone. Dineen gave the puck to Sanderson  who skated around a screened Swedish defenseman, came in on Soderstrom and  made a wrist shot that went it by Soderstrom's far post, 1-0 Canada.  The Swedes picked up their game after that, and Peter Forsberg had a shot  that hit Ranford's post (the inside), went parallel to the goal line and out.  Then Gartner got a penalty and the Swedes a power play. Jan Larsson took  a shot from the slot, Ranford gave a rebound to Larsson who saw Juhlin by  the far post, passed the puck and Ranford was beat, 1-1.  Third period started as the other periods, Swedes having most of the pressure  but the Canadians always dangerous once they were close to the Swede goal.  At 5:54, Canada created some great chances and Arto Blomsten was forced to  cover the puck in the Swede goal crease since Soderstrom lost sight of it.  That resulted in a penalty shot, since a defenseman can't cover the puck in   the goal crease. Geoff Sanderson took the penalty shot (his first ever, he  explained afterwards), and he put it low on Soderstrom's stick side, close  to the post. Excellent penalty shot to give Canada a go ahead goal.  Canada increased the lead on a very suspect offside, Gartner volleyed a  bouncing puck past Soderstrom to make it 3-1. The Swedes ran out of gas  then and couldn't produce as good scoring chances as they had for 2,5 periods.  The 4-1 goal came with only 1 second left, Rod Brind'Amour scoring on a  rebound from Soderstrom, where the Swedish defense already had their minds  in the dressing room.   A very good game (the best in the WC so far?), with both goalies playing  great. Soderstrom best player in Sweden, but Ranford even played better  than Soderstrom, that tells you something about Ranford. Probably the best  goalie in the world, were some comments after the game.  Canada played a very disciplined defense, Ranford pointed out that it is  easy to play well with a good defense. Lindros played A LOT and played well,  Sanderson naturally game hero with two goals.   The Forsberg-Naslund-Bergqvist line Sweden's best along with Larsson-Juhlin-  Nilsson. Swedish defense played well, 197 cm 104 kg Peter Popovic had the  task of neutralizing 192 cm 107 kg Eric Lindros, and managed this very well.  Ranger defenseman Peter Andersson finally got to go to the WC, and considering  that he landed in Germany just a few hours before the game, he played very  well. Swedish coach Curt Lundmark was irritated after the game, partly because  of the Swedes inability to score, and partly because of the linesman's mistake  on the 1-3 goal.

But we know enough about the physics of the situation to do some calculations. There are in fact three effects contributing to leaning the bike over to begin a turn.   1. Gyro effect causing a torque which twists the bike over.   2. Contact patch having shifted to one side, causing bike to fall over.   3. Contact patch being accelerated to the side, causing a  torque which twists the bike over.  Take an average bike/rider, average bike wheel, and at speeds of 5, 15, and 50 mph (say) calculate how much twist of the bars would be needed to produce (say) 20 degrees of lean in (say) 2 seconds by each effect alone. My guess is that at slow speeds 2 is dominant, and at high speeds 3 is dominant, and at all speeds 1 contributes not far off bugger all, relatively speaking.

Just after I completed my 4th set of deep squats.  Today was my weight training day and I was just beginning my routine.  All of a sudden at the end of the 4th set my arm felt like it had gone to sleep.  It was cold, turned pale, and lost 60% of its strength.  The weight I used for squats wasn't that heavy, I was working hard but not at 100% effort.  I waited for a few  minutes, trying to shake the arm back to life and then continued with chest exercises (flyes) with lighter dumbells than I normally use.  But I dropped the left dumbell during the first set, and experienced continued arm weakness into the second.  So I quit training and decided not to do my usual hour on the ski machine either.  I'll take it easy for the rest of the day.  My arm is *still* somewhat numb and significantly weaker than normal -- my hand still tingles a bit down to the thumb. Color has returned to normal and it is no longer cold.   Horrid thoughts of chunks of plaque blocking a major artery course through my brain.

The Branch Davidian group (led by Koresh) is actually one of two off-shoots  of a group known as the Shephard's Rod.  The Shephard's Rod (now  defunct as far as I know)broke off from the SDA Church in the 30's.  The Shephard's Rod broke away from the SDA Church because they felt that the  SDA Church was becoming weak and falling into apostacy.  They felt that they  were the remnant spoken about in Revelation.  About the Koresh group, Koresh gained control of it in 1987 or 1988.  Once  in control, he made himself the center of it. He proclaimed himself as  Christ.  Koresh himself came from an SDA background. He was excommunicated as a young  adult by the local congregation for trying to exert too much control over  the youth in the church.  After this, he joined the Branch Davidians.  They were/are a survivalist cult. This is why they had the stockpile of  weapons, food, a bomb shelter, etc.  They had no intent of raiding the US  government or anything. They were preparing for Armaggedon and were  putting themselves in a self defense position.    In my opinion, if the ATF and the FBI had left well enough alone, we wouldn' t have the blood of 20+ children crying out from the ashes in Waco.  If you want to know about The Shephard's Rod, you might want to visit the  local SDA church and talk to some of the older people.  They could give you  some insight into where Koresh got his theology.\",\"Living things maintain small electric fields to (1) enhance certain chemical reactions, (2) promote communication of states with in a cell, (3) communicate between cells (of which the nervous system is a specialized example), and perhaps other uses.

Special photographic techniques such as applying external fields in Kirillian photography interact with these fields or the resistances caused by these fields to make interesting pictures. Perhaps such pictures will be diagonistic of disease problems in organisms when better understood. Perhaps not.

He was on USA when I first got hooked on Hockey back in 1980 or so.  No, he wasn't always spot on top of the play, and he wasn't overly cute, but those pipes!  That lusty, barrel chested, voice! No pipsqueak was he (unlike some fellas we know!)  I rode into hockey mania on the coattails of Gretzky and the Boys on the Bus.  My first Finals saw the Islanders sweep them.  But I'll never forget the night, a year later, when the Oilers closed it out at home in the pandemonium, the smoke from a million sparklers, the long empty-net goal near the end, and Dan Kelly letting the crowd's reaction tell the story for a few long seconds, then that voice barking through the din \\\"Dave Lumley ... sews it up for Edmonton!\\\"  It sounds stupid, but that early (for me) hockey memory will always bring a thrill.  Since then I've grown a lot more jaded about the game, but I was really saddened by Dan Kelly's passing.  He was one of the good guys.\",\"I'm a biker and a dog-lover.  First and foremost, I want to mention some common sense.  If it's a choice between injuring/killing a dog or getting yourself injured/killed, there is only one rational decision.  Only the most insane animal rights kook would put the dog first.  Second, it's useful to learn how to read a dog's body language.  How you react to a dog who is chasing you because he thinks it's a game (and that you're playing with him) is completely different from how you react to a dog which has hostile intent.  Third, it's useful to learn how to present yourself to a dog.  Dogs are social beasts, and recognize a domination/submission hierarchy.  To a dog, there are two types of fellow-creatures; that which he dominates, and that which dominate him.  You need to unambiguously represent yourself as being of the latter class.  You are God: you are easily angered and your anger is terrible. But God is also amused by one who properly submits to His dominance, and may even on rare occasions dispense a kind word, a kind word, or even (oh joy oh rapture unforeseen) A Dog Bisquit!  Now, how does that all relate to biking?  Well, first, it's a good idea to assume that most dogs who chase motorcycles do so because they think it's a game, and not out of overt hostility.  The MSF suggestion is a very good one; when you see the dog coming, slow down so he determines a particular place of interception.  Just before you (and he) reach that spot, punch the throttle so that when he reaches it you're already long gone.  Dogs take a few seconds to react to new input, and definitely cannot comprehend the acceleration that a motorcycle is capable of.  With a hostile dog, or one which you repeatedly encounter, stronger measures may be necessary.  This is the face off.  First -- and there is very important -- make sure you NEVER face off a dog on his territory.  Face him off on the road, not on his driveway.  If necessary, have a large stick, rolled up newspaper, etc. (something the beast will understand is something that will hurt him).  Stand your ground, then slowly advance.  Your mental attitude is that you are VERY ANGRY and are going to dispense TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT.  The larger the dog, the greater your anger.  Dogs will pick up anger, just as they can pick up fear.  And, since you and he are not on his home territory, it may suddenly dawn on the dog that perhaps he is on your territory, and that you are prepared to fight to the death.  Most dogs will decide that it is a good idea to retreat to their own territory where there is at least a home advantage.  They'll also observe that you are satisfied by that retreat (gesture of submission) and thus they have escaped punishment.\",\" A professor of mine once said \\\"The difference between a Computer Engineer and a Computer Scientist is about $5000\\\" meaning the Engineer makes $5000 more than the CS.

The released information says that any protocol may be used (e.g., DH). From a theoretical point of view, this is probably true. However, from a practical point of view, those chips must have some kind of key exchange protocol built-in. What if it is good old RSA?

Another consideration is any street celebrations over the two convictions on the excessive force charges (Koons for incompetance, and Powell for overreacting --- both guilty as heck even from the view of NYPD cops interviewed) that might get out of hand. )-;  Also, some elements may take the acquittals as an excuse to challenge the cops (a dumb move, obviously).

I have a fourteen year old daugter who experienced a seizure on November 3, 1992 at 6:45AM after eating Kellog's Frosted Flakes.  She is perfectly healthy, had never experienced anything like this before, and there is no history of seizures in either side of the family.  All the tests (EEG, MRI, EKG) came out negative so the decision was made to do nothing and just wait to see if it happened again.  Well, we were going along fine and the other morning, April 5, she had a bowl of another Kellog's frosted kind of cereal, Fruit Loops (I am embarrassed to admit that I even bought that junk but every once in a while...) So I pour it in her bowl and think \\\"Oh, oh, this is the same kind of junk she was eating when she had that seizure.\\\"  Ten  minutes later she had a full blown seizures. This was her first exposure to a sugar coated cereal since the last seizure.  When I mentioned what she ate the first time as a possible reason for the seizure the neurologist basically negated that as an idea.  Now after this second episode, so similar in nature to the first, even he is scratching his head.  Once again her EEG looks normal which I understand can happen even when a person has a seizure.  Once again we are waiting. I have been thinking that it would be good to get to as large a group as possible to see if anyone has any experience with this kind of thing.  I know that members of the medical community are sometimes loathe to admit the importance that diet and foods play in our general health and well-being.  Anyway, as you can guess, I am worried sick about this, and would appreciate any ideas anyone out there has.  Sorry to be so wordy but I wanted to really get across what is going on here.  Thanks.       \",\"Has anyone heard what game ESPN is showing tonight.  They said they will show whatever game means the most playoff-wise. I would assume this would be the Blues-Tampa game or the Minnesota-Red Wings game...  Anyone heard for sure??? \",\" Well, had you been a bit less exuberant in both the tone and substance of your predictions, the responses would probably have been a bit more measured. Be that as it may....  Clemens is always in this form, and Viola isn't really performing beyond what might reasonably have been expected. How do you know that the Sox are responding to them, and not to Al Bumbry, Hobson, or (my most likely suspect) new hitting coach Mike Easler? I certainly am more likely to give Easler credit for Mo Vaughhn's hot start than Clemens or Viola.  This was the optimistic scenario, but not unreasonably so. He hasn't shown much power yet, though.  How can you tell that Dawson is providing the leadership? Perhaps it's Calderon? Perhaps it's Clemens and Viola? Maybe Hobson is finally showing those people skills he was supposed to have when they hired him. Or maybe it's all a myth. And Dawson has been hitting reasonably well, but not as well as Greenwell, Vaughn, Cooper, or Fletcher.  In three games. Why don't we look at this one again in, say, July?  A bit better than could reasonably have been expected. But don't forget that Zupcic looked like Wade Boggs lite for about 75 AB's last year. Beware of small sample sizes. Still, if Fletcher hits as well as he did last year he'd be a great improvement over any Sox leadoff hitter from last year. Be aware that his career numbers seem to indicate that he puts up good numbers as long as he doesn't have to make more than 300 AB or so in a year.  Ummm...sorry, no. I can buy the \\\"in the field\\\" part, and I think he'll be better at the plate than the 1992 Boggs, but in general Cooper, while he'll be a pretty good hitter, couldn't carry Boggs' jockstrap. With a little luck, he could be the fourth or fifth best 3B in the AL (Martinez, Boggs, Ventura, and Palmer will all be better).   See, here is where you make that quick left turn off into the aether. .500 is plausible, third is not unlikely, but phrases like \\\"could run away with the division\\\" are likely to get you a visit from the men in the white coats. It's not really clear that their staff is better than last year. If Russell does well, Darwin doesn't go on the DL, and Hesketh doesn't pitch just barely well enough to avoid losing his spot in the rotation, they could be better. On the other hand, if Hesketh pitches miserably and they're too stupid to move him to the pen and bring up Conroy or somebody, Fossas continues to pitch dismally but they keep giving him innings becasue he's a lefty, and Russell explodes they could be pretty bad.

The name of the company is Secure Communicatiions Technology (Information will be given at the end of this message on how to contact them).     Basically they are disturbed about the announcement for many reasons that we are. More specifically however, Mr. Bryen of Secure Communications brought to light many points that might interest most of the readers.     His belief is that AT&T was made known of the clipper well before the rest of the industry. This is for several reasons, several of which are:   - A company of AT&T's size could never be able to make a decision to use    the new chip on the SAME DAY it was announced.   - Months ago they proposed using their own chip for AT&T's secure telephone    devices. AT&T basically blew them off as being not interested at all.    This stuck them as strange, until now...      Also I spoke with Art Melnick, their cryptographer, he expressed several concerns over the new Clipper Chip:    - The obvious backdoor will be able to let many people decrypt the code.    - Once the key is released to authorities the security of the crypto     system is lost forever. These keys can end up in the hands of any agency     of the government.    - The fact that the escrowed keys never change means that the algorithm     is vulnerable over time to an attacker.    - The classified algorithm may hide another backdoor. But he feels that     it is probably to keep people from forging fake serial numbers, or     changing the keys themselves.    - Additionally he feels that the NSA has probably spent enough time and     money in working on a way to keep this chip from being reversed     engineered, that he feels that reverse engineering it will be very     difficult to do. He feels that they have developed a suitable technique     to protect the chip from this attack. Also he feels that the chip is     hardware encoded with the algorithm and not microcoded onto the chip.  Additonally I spoke with Mr. Melnick about their algorithm. He couldn't tell me much about their new agorithm because it hasn't been patented yet. However he told me a little:   - The algorithm will be released for public review after patents have been    granted for it. This is so the crypto community can see that it is    secure.   - The algorithm is called NEA for New Encryption Algorithm.    The details were sketchy because now it is held as a trade secret    until the patent was issued, but I was told that it will incorporate    the following:      - It will have fast encryption of data (Exact specs not given, but       Mr. Melnick stated \\\"Much faster than what an RS-232 can put out.\\\")      - It is a symmetric cipher, just like IDEA and DES.      - It will use 64 bit data blocks for encryption (like DES and IDEA).      - The key length was not given to me, but Mr. Melnick states that       it is _adujustable_ and is \\\"More than adequate for security.\\\"      - The algorithm is written in C and Assembler in software form, and       can be ported to many platforms (Unlike the the Clipper Chip which       is hardware ONLY and cannot be made into software) This I       consider a definite plus for the NEA for widespread use.      - The algorithm will accomodate public key distribution techniques       such as RSA or Diffie-Hellman. This will also be supported in the       hardware chip.      - Right now the projected cost of the NEA chip will be about 10 dollars       for each!! (Clipper will run 25 each chip [that is if it is produced       enough, which probably won't happen]).      - They currently sell a program called C-COM that uses the algorithm       and a special streaming protocol that does not divide the encrypted       data into \\\"blocks.\\\" This could prevent plaintext attacks if you know       what the block header is. This program operates at all supported       RS-232 speeds and uses the software implementation of the algorithm.      - Most importantly: IT DOES NOT HAVE A BACKDOOR!!    Right now the company is afraid that the new clipper chip will put them out of business. This is a very real possibility. So they really need help in stopping the clipper chip from becoming a standard. If you want to contact them, they can be reached at..

HC4066 is spec'd at something like -3dB @ 200MHz into  50 ohms. The more complex types are generally a little slower and more  resistive.  Plain 4000 series are not so good at handling 5v logic.  Remember that the output load is seen by the input device.\",\" I don't find this a credible argument, for two reasons.  One you have supplied below: unless I care about entering the USA at any time in the future (eg. the Taiwanese backyard cloners - who BTW have been known to decap custom silicon and reproduce it on daughterboards when pirating high-profit arcade machines and the like - who wouldn't care less), I am not  going to care much about US confidentiality, am I?  Only people like the real me, who does care about travelling to various countries for business reasons, will sit up and follow laws like this, but I would contend that we're not the main threat.  I also have grave doubts whether an algorythm widely distributed in silicon could possibly be called \\\"classified.\\\"  It's like handing out military secrets to the whole world in envelopes marked \\\"don't open me.\\\"  I can imagine several credible defences which could be employed if it came to a trial.  One would be the stupidity of the government's actions.   Amusing thought: could they have employed an algorythm which is infeasable for a fast software implementation, but which is easy in custom hardware? In DES, the extensive use of permutation tables (trivial in hardware: you just swap bus lines), but relatively slow in software have had a big effect on the speed difference between hardware and software implementations of that cipher (indeed, I suspect that Lucifer's designers were well aware that it would be, and approved.)  Certain algorythms (usually parallel search algorythms) can be very slow in software, yet can fly in custom hardware. I have no proof of their employment in Clipper -- it is pure conjecture.   However, as a software implementation of this cipher is something that its  designers would have been trying to avoid at all costs, then the inclusion  of such techniques seems credible.  Hmmm... I also wonder what Intergraph thinks about the use of the name \\\"Clipper\\\" for this device. :) \",\": >>My friend recently purchased a LC III and he wants to know if there is : >>such a demon called NuBus adapter for his PDS slot?   : > The LC family of Macs can only : > use PDS cards.

At least, Marvin's friend has not been able to : locate one and neither have I.  What is the fundamental reason for : this?  I think that there do exist NuBus expansion cages (I'm sure I've seen them advertised occassionally), but I think that the main problem is that they cost much more than the difference in price between say a LC and IIvx so unless you need lots of NuBus slots its not worth the bother.  (Of course, it may be that these extra boxes are so expensive because no one buys them because they are so expensive...)  NuBus technology isn't a special Apple Proprietry thing (I have this sneaky feeling that it is licensed from Texas Instruments???) so there is no problem building an expansion box.  The difference between NuBus and PDS is that NuBus is a clever interface with lots of neat toys built in to make sure that lots of cards can work together on the same computer. PDS (processor direct slot) is just that: here are all the connections to the processor. You can do anything with this and it is as quick as it can be, but there's no cooperation. You may be able to get double PDS slot adaptors but you try plugging 2 video cards in, and just watch them conflict! Of course, the extra  electronics in a NuBus slot makes it appreciably more expensive, so guess why Apple doesn't put it in it's cheaper machines?  So, yah pays yer money and yah takes yah choice.\",\"     The problem is, your use of the word \\\"objective\\\" along with \\\"values.\\\" Both definitions three and four are inherently subjective, that is they are particular to a given individual, or personal. You see, what one person may see as worthwhile, another may see as worthless.   Again, your form of measurement in this sentence, that being of \\\"worth\\\" is subjective.     When I find that my usage of a word is different than the usage of that word given by another person, I try to find a standard against which to judge that usage. In most cases, the dictionary is the standard I use. Here is a definiton of objective:  objective ADJ. 1. Of or having to do with a material object as  distinguished from a mental concept. 2. Having actual existance. 3.a. Unenfluenced by emotion or personal prejudice. b. Based on observable phenomenon.  By this definition, science does not have an objective worth, since the phrase \\\"objective worth\\\" is an oxymoron. However you asked something a  little differently this time, you asked for an objective basis for a notion. The fact that the use of science as an intellectual tool is responsible for changes in our world (the changes are material, and thus \\\"objective\\\") would provide an objective _basis_ for an argument. However, the conclusion arrived at from that argument (that science is  \\\"good\\\") is subjective.  I think that the problem here is one of word usage. Take a little time and read the definitions of these words: objective, subjective, worth, value, morality, good, evil. I believe that if you think about the  meaning of them for a while, you will have to conclude that there is no such thing as an objective morality. \",\"Does anybody else think that WS stats should become part of a player's career stats?

I really hope Baines can provide the RF support the O's need. Orsulak was decent but I had hoped that Chito Martinez could learn defense better and play like he did in '91.

No one has made a point for or against       that issue, nor have they compared the LDS position against orthodox      belief. The infernal paradise is held to be Abraham's bosom (Luke 16),       the place of the righteous dead in sheol (equivalent to hades).       The point that was raised by John was that someone could not repent      on their death bed.

My daughter's Christian school sends home a weekly update on school related topics. This week they sent something *very* interesting. It was an article written by the leader of a national (US) Christian school organization about a trip he recently made to Jerusalem. While there, he was introduced to one of the rabbis who is working on a project to rebuild the Temple at Jerusalem. The article included photos of the many furnishings that have already been made in preparation for furnishing the rebuilt temple according to the specifications given in the Bible.   What was even more striking is the fact that the plans for the temple are complete and the group is only awaiting permission from the Israeli government before beginning the building. The other startling fact is the very recent archeological discovery that the original site of the temple is unoccupied and available for building. Previously it has been thought that the original site was underneath what is now a mosque, making rebuilding impossible without sparking a holy war.   Now it appears that nothing stands in the way of rebuilding and resuming sacrifices, as the Scriptures indicate will happen in the last days. Although the Israeli government will give the permission to start, I think it is the hand of God holding the project until He is ready to let it happen. Brothers and sisters, the time is at hand.

Lots of room inside and even with the smaller engine it has enough power for me.  The only problem I found was a small selection on the dealer's lots. They are hot sellers around here.\",\" I must admit that this point has been running through my mind for most of the discussion: one the dice are out there, it won't be long before someone decaps it and, after a bit of work, has full details of the Clipper algorythm.  This isn't trivial to do, but then again, it is not impossibly difficult either.  Any half way decent VLSI design student should be able to take a photograph of a technology s/he is familiar with, and given a description of the input, output, control and supply lines, figure out  the function of various subsystems on the die.  Indeed, this is not an uncommon exercise performed during training (because it makes you think about design decisions made by other designers.  I could speculate that these chips are going to be manufactured using \\\"tamperproof\\\" carriers (unlikely - such techniques are *very* expensive and this thing is supposed to be relatively cheap to produce), or that there will be some legal or legislative framework to prevent publication of the algorythm (unlikely - please correct me if I am wrong but aren't these supposed to be sold internationally?).  I suppose that the most likely reason the algorythm is remaining secret for the moment is that some idiot bureaucrat, untrammeled by the realities of the situation, decided that \\\"well, we should keep it a secret because it is supposed to be secret, isn't it?\\\"  Just some random thoughts... \",\"IRWIN suggests the use of pre-formatted tapes for their tape drives, as you often can't successfully format a tape and need  bulk-erase it before you can format it again.

Feng\",\" Many X servers supporting graphics accelerators do not allow the creation of pixmaps exeeding the size of the screen.  One workaround is to create several smaller pixmaps and add the results. \",\" You're obviously not referring to any of the three above-quoted individuals, because barnacles don't each send $20 to the crew of the ship to keep it moving.  \\\"Get the organization to act on it\\\" is easy to say, but says little about what one really can and should do.  What the organization actually will do is largely determined by the president and directors, as far as I can see.  That's what makes it so important to vote in an election of officers.  It does strike me that the BMWMOA is a lot less politically active (in the state and national arenas, not infighting) than other M/C organizations.  Should we change this?  Or just join the other groups that already are in politics?  (Incidentally, the political hazards to motorcycle riders in the US at the moment don't compare to the problems of some other groups like gun owners.  Just try to take up target pistol shooting in the Northeast or California, and I bet you'll wish you only had to worry about wearing a helmet.  (Why does every thread on rec.moto eventually come around to guns?))\",\" In certain Apple 13\\\" RGB monitors there has been a problem with  the HIGH VOLTAGE CAPASITOR.

You're missing a central teaching of Christianity - man is inherently sinful.  We are saved through faith by grace.  Knowing that, believing that, does not make us without sin.  Furthermore, not all who consider themselves \\\"christians\\\" are (even those who manage to head their own \\\"churches\\\").  \\\"Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.\\\" - Matt. 7:21.   Again, what historical documents do you trust?  Do you think Hannibal crossed the Alps?  How do you know?  How do you know for sure?  What historical documents have stood the scrutiny and the attempts to dis- credit it as well as the Bible has?   Well, it's really a shame you feel this way.  No one can browbeat you into believing, and those who try will probably only succeed in driving you further away.  You need to ask yourself some difficult questions: 1) is there an afterlife, and if so, does man require salvation to attain it.  If the answer is yes, the next question is 2) how does man attain this salvation - can he do it on his own as the eastern religions and certain modern offshoots like the \\\"new age movement\\\" teach or does he require God's help?  3) If the latter, in what form does - indeed, in what form can such help come?  Needless to say, this discussion could take a lifetime, and for some people it did comprise their life's writings, so I am hardly in a position to offer the answers here - merely pointers to what to ask.  Few, of us manage to have an unshaken faith our entire lives (certainly not me). The spritual life is a difficult journey (if you've never read \\\"A Pilgrim's Progress,\\\" I highly recommend this greatest allegory of the english language).   Now I see by your close that one possible source of trouble for you may be a conflict between your politcal beliefs and your religious upbringing.  You wrote that \\\"I (in my own faith) accept and live my life by many if not most of the teachings of christ\\\".  Well, Christ referred to God as \\\"My Father\\\", not \\\"My Mother\\\", and while the \\\"maleness\\\" of God is not the same as the maleness of those of us humans who possess a Y chromosome, it does not honor God to refer to Him as female purely to be trendy, non-discriminatory, or politically correct.  This in no way disparages women (nor is it my intent to do so by my use of the male pronoun to refer to both men and women -  english just does not have a decent neuter set of pronouns).  After all, God chose a woman as his only human partner in bringing Christ into the human population.  Well, I'm not about to launch into a detailed discussion of the role of women in Christianity at 1am with only 6 hours of sleep in the last 63, and for that reason I also apologize for any shortcomings in this article.  I just happened across yours and felt moved to reply.  I hope I may have given you, and anyone else who finds himself in a similar frame of mind, something to contemplate.\",\"From: Center for Policy Research <cpr> Subject: Desertification of the Negev   The desertification of the arid Negev ------------------------------------- by Moise Saltiel, I&P March 1990  I.

The Negev in the Year 2000  Just after the creation of the State of Israel, the phrase \\\"the Jewish pioneers will make the desert bloom\\\" was trumpeted throughout the Western world. After the Six Day War in 1967, David Ben-Gurion declared in a letter to Charles de Gaulle: \\\"It's by our pioneering creation that we have transformed a poor and arid land into a fertile land, created built-up areas, towns and villages in abandoned desert areas\\\".  Contrary to Ben-Gurion's assertion, it must be affirmed that during the 26 years of the British mandate over Palestine and for centuries previous, a productive human presence was to be found in all parts of the Negev desert - in the very arid hills and valleys of the southern Negev as well as in the more fertile north. These were the Bedouin Arabs.  The real desertification of the Negev, mainly in the southern part, occurred after Israel's dispossession of the Bedouin's cultivated lands and pastures. Nowadays, the majority of the 12,800 square-kilometer Negev, which represents 62 percent of the State of Israel (pre-1967 borders), has been desertified beyond recognition. The main new occupiers of the formerly Bedouin Negev are the Israeli army; the Nature Reserves Authority, whose chief role is to prevent Bedouin from roaming their former pasture lands; and vast industrial zones, including nuclear reactors and dumping grounds for chemical, nuclear and other wastes. Israeli Jews in the Negev today cultivate less than half the surface area cultivated by the Bedouin before 1948, and there is no Jewish pastoral activity.  I. Agricultural and pastoral activities of the Negev Bedouin before and after 1948 -------------------------------------------------- In 1942, according to British mandatory statistics, the Beersheba sub-district (which corresponds more or less to Israel's Negev, or Southern, district) had 52,000 inhabitants, almost all Bedouin Arabs, who held 11,500 camels, 6,000 cows and oxen, 42,000 sheep and 22,000 goats.  The majority of the Bedouin lived a more or less sedentary life in the north, where precipitation ranged between 200 and 350 mm per year. In 1944 they cultivated about 200,000 hectares of the Beersheba district - i.e. 16 percent of its total area and *more than double the area cultivated by the Negev's Jewish settlers after 40 years of \\\"making the desert bloom\\\"*  The Bedouin had a very low crop yield - 350 to 400 kilograms of barley per hectare during rainy years - and their farming techniques were primitive, but production was based solely on animal and human labor. It must also be underscored that animal production, although low, was based entirely on pasturing. Production increased considerably during the rainy years and diminished significantly during drought years. All Bedouin pasture animals - goats, camels and sheep - had the ability to gain weight quickly over the relatively rainy winters and to withstand many waterless days during the hot summers. These animals were the result of a centuries-old process of natural selection in harsh local conditions.  After the creation of the State of Israel, 80 percent of the Negev Bedouin were expelled to the Sinai or to Southern Jordan. The 10,000 who were allowed to remain were confined to a territory of 40,000 hectares in a region were annual mean precipiation was 150 mm - a quantity low enough to ensure a crop failure two years out of three. The rare water wells in the south and central Negev, spring of life in the desert, were cemented to prevent Bedouin shepherds from roaming.  A few Bedouin shepherds were allowed to stay in the central Negev. But after 1982, when the Sinai was returned to Egypt, these Bedouin were also eliminated. At the same time, strong pressure was applied on the Bedouin to abandon cultivation of their fields in order that the land could be transferred to the army.  No reliable statistics exist concerning the amount of land held today by Negev Bedouin. It is a known fact that a large part of the 40,000 hectares they cultivated in the 1950s has been seized by the Israeli authorities. Indeed, most of the Bedouin are now confined to seven \\\"development towns\\\", or *sowetos*, established for them.\",\"I'm concerned about a recent posting about WBT/SIL.

Leading the first Armenian units who crossed the Ottoman  border in the company of the Russian invaders was the former Ottoman  Parliamentary representative for Erzurum, Karekin Pastirmaciyan, who  assumed the revolutionary name Armen Garo. Another former Ottoman  parliamentarian, Hamparsum Boyaciyan, led the Armenian guerrilla forces  who ravaged Turkish villages behind the lines under the nickname \\\"Murad\\\",  especially ordering that            'Kill Turks and Kurds wherever you find them and in            whatever circumstances you find them.

In March 1915, the Russian forces began to move toward Van. Immediately, in April 11, 1915 the Armenians of Van began a revolt, massacring all  the Turks in the vicinity so as to make possible its quick and easy  conquest by Russians. Little wonder that Czar Nicholas II sent a  telegram of thanks to the Armenian Revolutionary Committee of Van in  April 21, 1915, \\\"thanking it for its services to Russia.\\\" The Armenian  newspaper Gochnak, published in the United States, also proudly  reported in May 24, 1915 that   \\\"only 1,500 Turks remained in Van the rest having been slaughtered.\\\"  Source: Hovannisian, Richard G.: Armenia on the Road to Independence, 1918.

The estimated population  of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were  Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem.  Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third  of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the   Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan  uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians  as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,  however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the  guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000  inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character   notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian   Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the   southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.\\\"   (See also Map 1.

Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They   found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border   into Turkey. The rest were killed.

The main legal principles of the Turkish State  are summarized in Article 2 of the Constitution:   \\\"The Republic of Turkey is a democratic, secular and social State  governed by the rule of law; bearing in mind the concepts of public  peace, national solidarity and justice; respecting human rights;  loyal to the nationalism of Ataturk, and based on the fundamental  tenets set forth in the Preamble of the Constitution.\\\"  Freedom of culture and religion prevailed during the Ottoman Empire, allowing the many nations and races within its boundaries to remain autonomous. The fact that the Ottoman Empire was the longest lived in recent history may be attributed to these freedoms, despite the lack of any written Constitution. The first attempts to create a written Constitution occurred in 1839 and 1856. Although the documents adopted during these two attempts remained in force only temporarily, they provided the basic elements of a Constitution.  The 1876 Constitution was the first legal document to force a Parliament and the right of election to share the sovereignty of the Emperor. The Constitution of 1906 placed some additional limitations on the Emperor, while increasing the power of the Parliament and the government.  The First World War (1914-1918) brought the Ottoman Empire to an end. By the occupation of Istanbul, the Parliament was dissolved and the Constitution was abolished. The members of Parliament were sent to exile to an island by the occupying forces.  During the Independence War, the \\\"Turkish Grand National Assembly\\\" held their first meeting on April 23, 1920 to serve as the legislative body of the new Turkish state. This assembly prepared the new legal structure of the Turkish Republic. The new Republic was proclaimed on October 29, 1923 and the new Constitution was adopted in 1924. That Constitution served as the legal  backbone of today's modern Turkish Republic. In 1945, Turkey adopted a  multi-party political system. The Constitution of 1924 was replaced by others in 1961 and 1982. All three Constitutions of the Republic have been based on the principles of parliamentary democracy, human rights, national sovereignty, division of powers, private ownership and secularization.  \\\"Major Principles of the Constitution\\\"  The constitution (with 177 Articles) establishes the structure of the Republic within the following principles:  - The Turkish Republic is a democratic, secular and social state governed by    law; - It should be governed to maintain public peace, national solidarity, justice,   human rights and the objectives of Ataturk; - The language of the State is Turkish; - Sovereignty is vested in the nation without any conditions or restrictions.   Sovereignty is exercised by organizations authorized by the nation; - Legislative power is carried by the Parliament elected by the nation. This   power cannot be delegated (transferred) to any one else; - Executive power is exercised by the President, and Council of Ministers; - Judicial power is exercised by the independent courts on behalf of the   Turkish nation; - All individuals are equal, irrespective of language, race, religion, color,   sex, or political beliefs; - Laws cannot be contradict those principles stated in the Constitution.  \\\"Structure of the State\\\"  In accordance with the Constitution, the structure of the state is based on the principle of \\\"division of power\\\" to create a balanced and self-controlled system. The power is divided into \\\"legislative power,\\\" \\\"executive power,\\\" and \\\"judicial power,\\\" balanced to secure freedoms and powers to control each other (self-control).   A. Legislative Power:   The \\\"Turkish Grand National Assembly\\\" is a parliament with one House, elected  by the nation for a term of five years to exercise legislative power on  behalf of the nation. The basic functions of this Assembly are:   - to adopt, to amend, or to repeal laws;  - to approve or to dismiss the Council of Ministers;  - to supervise and to question Ministers or the Council of Ministers;  - to debate, to amend and to approve annual budgets;  - to ratify international agreements;  - to grant amnesty or pardons.   Members of Parliament do not have any liability for their words (either oral  or written) during the course of their legislative duties. The country is  divided into constituencies. The number of representatives of each is  calculated according to its population. Every Turkish citizen over the age  of twenty-one can vote.   Elections are supervised by the \\\"Supreme Council of Elections,\\\" which solves  all disputes or appeals. In each province, the local \\\"Board of Election\\\"  runs and controls the election under the supervision and guidelines of the  Supreme Council. Members of the Council and Boards are elected among   independent judges.   B. Executive Power:   The President of the Republic is the Head of State (not the head of government  as in the Unites States). The main functions of the President are:   - to represent the State and the Country;  - to insure the implementation of the Constitution;  - to coordinate legislative, judicial and executive functions;  - act as the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces;  - to ratify laws and government decrees.    The President is elected by the Grand National Assembly for a period of seven  years. The President may ratify or return the laws for a second debate, may   call for a referendum.   Executive power is exercised by the \\\"Council of Ministers,\\\" headed by the  Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is appointed by the President from the  members of Parliament. The Prime Minister names the Ministers for approval  by the President. The new Government (Council of Ministers) reads their  program at the Parliament and the vote of confidence follows. There are 21 (?)  Ministers in the Council.   Ministers and other members of the administration can be sued in independent  \\\"administrative\\\" courts for their misuse of power, administrative errors or  functions against any law.   C. Judicial Power:   Judicial power is exercised by independent courts. No authority or power can  instruct the judges or public prosecutors of the courts. These cannot be   discharged, replaced or retired by executive authorities except for the  reasons clearly stated by the appropriate laws. There are three categories  of courts in the Turkish judiciary system:   - Courts of justice deal with legal, commercial and criminal cases. The     decisions of these courts may be reviewed by the supreme court of justice    upon the appeal of the parties involved.  - The decisions or functions of the executive power (including the Prime    Minister and Ministers or any governmental department) can be appealed in    administrative courts if these functions or decisions are against the law.    The decisions of these administrative courts may also be reviewed by the    high administrative court.   The laws and decisions of the Grand National Assembly can be examined by the  \\\"Constitutional Court\\\" if they contradict the Constitution. If found  contradictory, this court may cancel the decisions or laws of the Parliament.   Serdar Argic\",\" Educate yourself before you rip on this years manager of the year.

A TTL gate has the basic structure of AND/OR/INVERT, and an inversion of a sum of a product is just exactly ONE gate delay.  The reason to find a minimal sum of products is that this matches a hardware optimization.   A positive-OR gate (such as the 9-gate solution uses) has TWO gate delays (and there's another gate delay in the second term) so that the second solution, while simpler in logic symbols, can  be expected to be something less than optimal in the real world. ECL is similar to TTL, in that it can support an OR/AND gate with the minimum delay (unlike TTL, you get both true and inverse outputs for 'free' when using ECL).   PALs are basically large programmable AND/OR/INVERT gates (with your choice of internal connections between the various sections, and perhaps some latches), so a minimum sum of products ALSO is a way to shoehorn a logic design into  a few PALs.  It's not comparably easy to design with a minimization of logic gates, but some software packages claim to allow you to do so, and will take just about any mess of gates (as a nodelist with 74xxx series logic ICs) and produce a description of a logic cell array to do the same job.  Xilinx's XACT software does this by treating each logic block as a macro, and expanding it all out, then simplifying.\",\"Pardon me for interrupting, but why doesn't anyone ever bring up other possibilities besides more government, less government, or no government and stop there?

The original documentation for the sound hardware (IM-3) documents how to make sound by directly accessing hardware.  Basically, you jam values into all the even bytes from SoundBase to SoundBase+0x170. This was because of how the Mac 128 (and some later machines) generated sound was by scanning this block and D/Aing every even byte (the odd bytes went to the floppy on some machines).  When the Mac II (and Apple Sound Chip) was invented, it was designed to generate stereo sound. It was also designed to be compatible with we had once documented. So storing bytes at the even values at SoundBase meant \\\"I want to play a mono sound\\\" and so it was emulated. But Apple had since retracted the documentation on SoundBase and decided not to document the lowest layers of sound generation. So apple never explained where to stuff bytes if you want to make stereo sound.  Enter game developers. The sound driver and current sound manager are inconveniently lame for making games. Furthermore, people who port from the IBM don't want to learn more APIs. So, it has become popular for game writers to write to SoundBase to make sound, since it is very easy.  Since the Mac II, Apple has had many different kind of sound output hardware, and the only things they have in common are that writing to SoundBase works. On some hardware, (Mac II, IIx, IIcx, IIci at least), writing to SoundBase gets you mono sound through both speakers. On some Macs (Quadra 700/900/950 at least) writing to SoundBase gets you mono sound on the left channel only. Both are technically correct interpretations of the original specification, but one is obviously preferable for asthetic reasons.  If developers use the Sound Manager (and I think the sound driver), mono sounds will (typically) come out through both channels regardless of the underlying hardware. It is possible to specify you want to generate left channel only, but no one does. If developers write to sound base, their games will only come out the left on some games.  The other problem, the original Mac II only producing left channel sound on the internal speaker, while the SE/30 mixes both, isn't really related. It is due to the post generation amplification used on the motherboards of the different machines. It only affects true stereo sounds. Sounds which are actually mono, will play on the internal speaker, no matter what machine you have.  Now, to more directly address the question, the games you list: and also Hellcats, Super Tetris Oxyd (and many more, these are just what I've tested)  Cheat and write to SoundBase and so are only left channel on Quadras.   Other games you list: and also PGA Tour Golf Civilization (and more, these are again only from personal experience)  Use the sound manager and work fine on all machines.  The more of the story is to developers: DON'T CHEAT! Really, I am absolutely, positively not allowed to do what I am about to do, but I'm going say it anyway. Stop cheating on sound! Really soon, you will be sorry, as even those without external speakers will be disappointed with your sound on future hardware. The grace period is about to end. The Sound Manager is understandable now, and works pretty well and will work even better soon, so use it.  In conclusion: To Doug, it isn't a hardware problem, at least, not a bug. To Jon, it isn't a choice to developers as to whether they want to send sound to both channels. If they do it the right way, it is taken care of automatically. If you cheat, there is not way to make it work on all hardware.   Have fun.  Disclaimer number 1: I don't work on sound here at Apple, I'm just pretty well informed. So don't write me with sound questions.  Disclaimer number 2: If it says up above that I wrote anything like \\\"the grace period is about to end\\\" then it is a bug in your news feed, since I am catagorically not allowed to say anything like that.

Cheers, Kent\",\"Read this through once or twice.  Then replace \\\"prince\\\" with \\\"government\\\" or \\\"president\\\", as appropriate, and read it again.    [From Chapter XX of _The Prince_, by N. Macchiavelli, as translated by Daniel Donno.]   In order to keep their lands secure, some princes have disarmed their subjects; others have prompted division within the cities they have subjugated.  Some have nurtured animosities against themselves; others have sought to win the approval of those they initially distrusted.  Some have erected fortresses; others have destroyed them.  Now, although it is impossible to set down definite judgements on all of these measures without considering the particular circumstances of the states where they may be employed, I shall nevertheless discuss them in such broad terms as the subject itself will allow.   To begin with, there has never been a case of a new prince disarming his subjects.  Indeed, whenever he found them disarmed, he proceeded to arm them.  For by arming your subjects, you make their arms your own.  Those among them who are suspicious become loyal, while those who are already loyal remain so, and from subjects they are transformed into partisans.  Though you cannot arm them all, nonetheless you increase your safety among those you leave unarmed by extending privileges to those you arm.  Your different treatment of the two categories will make the latter feel obligated to you, while the former will consider it proper thoat those who assume added duties and dangers should receive advantages.     When you disarm your subjects, however, you offend them, by showing that, either from cowardliness or from lack of faith, you distrust them; and either conclusion will induce them to hate you. Moreover, since it is impossible for you to remain unarmed, you would have to resort to mercenaries, whose limitations have already been discussed. Even if such troops were good, however, they could never be good enough to defend you from powerful enemies, and doubtful subjects.  Therefore, as I have said, a new prince in a newly acquired state has always taken measures to arm his subjects, and history is full of examples proving that this is so.   But when a prince takes posession of a new state which he annexes as an addition to his original domain, then he must disarm all the subjects of the new state except those who helped him to acquire it; and these, as time and occasion permit, he must seek to render soft and weak.  He must arrange matters in such a way that the arms of the entire state will be in the hands of soldiers who are native to his original domain.   ...\",\"  [other uninformed, purposefully ignorant gun control ranting deleted]   I want this man to tell me how in the hell you can take the  explosives used in the WTC bombing, considering that the  consensus seems to be that the explosive was a fertilizer-based one.

Chiu knows the score and is just being silly. However, \\\"decibel\\\" is in fact 1/10th of a bel. He is right on that one, but I don't know if it was accidental or not.  Strictly defined, a bel is the ratio of the log of two power levels, and a decibel is 1/10th of a bel so you have 10X decibels for every bel, hence bel=log(P2/P1) and decibel=10Xlog(P2/P1).  The bel, ohm, volt, farad, ampere, watt, hertz, henry, etc. are all named for pioneers in the field. It's a traditional and fine way to honor researchers who discover new knowledge in a new field. Hertz was one of the most important of the early electronics explorers, but had been left out in having a term or unit named after him until recently, (1960's, prior to that what is now a hertz was a cps.) All the other units were defined many decades earlier.       --  ----------------------------------------------------------------------    \",\"Archive-name: space/schedule Last-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:23 $  SPACE SHUTTLE ANSWERS, LAUNCH SCHEDULES, TV COVERAGE      SHUTTLE LAUNCHINGS AND LANDINGS; SCHEDULES AND HOW TO SEE THEM      Shuttle operations are discussed in the Usenet group sci.space.shuttle,     and Ken Hollis (gandalf@pro-electric.cts.com) posts a compressed version     of the shuttle manifest (launch dates and other information)     periodically there.

Official NASA shuttle status reports are posted to sci.space.news     frequently.       WHY DOES THE SHUTTLE ROLL JUST AFTER LIFTOFF?      The following answer and translation are provided by Ken Jenks     (kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov).      The \\\"Ascent Guidance and Flight Control Training Manual,\\\" ASC G&C 2102,   \\\"During the vertical rise phase, the launch pad attitude is  commanded until an I-loaded V(rel) sufficient to assure launch tower  clearance is achieved. Then, the tilt maneuver (roll program)  orients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a  negative q-alpha, which in turn alleviates structural loading. Other  advantages with this attitude are performance gain, decreased abort  maneuver complexity, improved S-band look angles, and crew view of  the horizon. The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining  downrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (MECO) target  in second stage.\\\"      This really is a good answer, but it's couched in NASA jargon. I'll try     to interpret.      1) We wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.      2) Then, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack  between the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the  \\\"relative wind\\\") and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line  between the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly  negative angle (\\\"a negative q-alpha\\\"). This causes a little bit of  \\\"downward\\\" force (toward the belly of the Orbiter, or the +Z  direction) and this force \\\"alleviates structural loading.\\\"  We have to be careful about those wings -- they're about the  most \\\"delicate\\\" part of the vehicle.      3) The new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more  mass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, or  to change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be  the case if we didn't roll (\\\"performance gain\\\").      4) The new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated  flight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort  maneuvers, the Return To Launch Site (\\\"decreased abort maneuver  complexity\\\").      5) The new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radio  antennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radio  antennae on the Orbiter (\\\"improved S-band look angles\\\").      6) The new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is a  helpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.      7) The new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is  more nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east  (usually).  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity  in the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  Remember:  velocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction.  The Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its  velocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.      This all begs the question, \\\"Why isn't the launch pad oriented to give     this nice attitude to begin with?  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to     achieve that attitude?\\\"  The answer is that the pads were leftovers     from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one     for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main     Engine exhaust.  (You can see the effects of this on any daytime     launch.  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust is     fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the \\\"top\\\"     [Orbiter side] and the \\\"bottom\\\" [External Tank side] of the stack.) The     access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented     basically the same way they were for the Saturn V's.  (A side note: the     Saturn V's also had a roll program.  Don't ask me why -- I'm a Shuttle     guy.)      I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics. He added that the \\\"roll     maneuver\\\" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.     The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons     stated.  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping     the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw     component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  The total     maneuver is really expressed as a \\\"quaternion,\\\" a grad-level-math     concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element     array.       HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL, NASA SELECT      NASA SELECT is broadcast by satellite. If you have access to a satellite     dish, you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R, Transponder 13, C-Band, 72     degrees West Longitude, Audio 6.8, Frequency 3960 MHz. F2R is stationed     over the Atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from     California and points west. During events of special interest (e.g.     shuttle missions), SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite     for these viewers.      If you can't get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry SELECT.     It's worth asking if yours doesn't.      The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is     frequently posted to sci.space.news. Generally it carries press     conferences, briefings by NASA officials, and live coverage of shuttle     missions and planetary encounters. SELECT has recently begun carrying     much more secondary material (associated with SPACELINK) when missions     are not being covered.

Recently, I had a baby boy born with seizures which occured 12-15 hours after birth.

This has been a major learning experience for me and my wife not only in learning the medical problems that faced our son but also in dealing with hospitals, procedures...etc.  I don't want to go into a lot of detail, but his condition was termed  quite severe at first then slowly he began to grow and put on weight as a normal baby would. He was put on the standard anti-convulsion drugs and that did not seem to help out. His MRI, EKG, cat-scans are all normal, but the EEG's show alot of seizure activity.

Blacks have the same (+- 2%) crime report rate, arrest rate, and incarceration rate for violent crimes.  So I doubt that for violent crimes, that there is any inherent bias mechanism present.  There is a wider discrepancy for all crimes for blacks wrt to 3 categories.  Interestingly enough, the discrepancy is the largest in the Southern United States -- where blacks are incarcerated well BELOW the average in the rest of the United States! Which points to an anti-bias-against wrt blacks.  In any case, for violent crimes and burglary and drug selling, blacks are reported 53%, arrested 44%, and are present in jails/prisons 47% (1988).  Considering that 12% of the population is black, 6% are black males, and some percentage of that is out of the high/low age groups, we do have a situation where (if I remember my old calculations right) 4% of the population commits almost half of the really nasty crimes.

You are correct about 'majority.'  Somewhere between 1 out of three and  one out of 10 will at some period in their lives experience a violent  assault.  The risk is generally higher than emergency medical problems like heart attack and stroke.  'Vast' is probably too loose a term.  With approximately 1,000,000 Americans using firearms each year, over a 30 year period we get (roughly, since some may have to do this more than once) 30 MILLION Americans with experience in  using firearms for self defense.  30/250 yields 12 percent of the population. (Yes, I know that is a REAL rough estimate.  We're closer to 270 million now,  but many of these are minors and should be included etc, thus the percentage if anything is low.)  At any rate, most minority groups in this range are not usually referred  to as 'tiny' minorities, so I don't see how the other part of the group  can be referred to as the 'vast' majority.

From one (absurd) perspective, *all* pain is neurologic, because in the absence of a nervous system, there would not be pain.  From another (tautologic) perspective, any disease is in the domain of the specialty that treats it.  Neurologists treat headache, therefore (at least in the USA) headache is neurologic.  Whether neurologic or not, nobody would disagree that disabling headaches are common.  Perhaps my fee-for-service neurologic colleagues, scrounging for cases, want all the headache patients they can get.  Working on a salary, however, I would rather not fill my office with patients holding their heads in pain.\",\"The following press release was distributed April 1 by NASA Headquarters.  Space Station Redesign Advisory Members Named  Along with Dr. Charles M. Vest, recently named by Vice President Albert Gore to head the advisory committee on the redesign of the Space Station, NASA has announced the names of representatives from government and industry and academic experts from across the country to participate in an independent review of the redesign options being developed by NASA.  \\\"I am extremely honored to have been selected to lead this important review panel. America's future in science and technology and as a world leader in space demands our utmost attention and care,\\\" said Vest. \\\"We have assembled a diverse panel of experts that, I believe, will bring the appropriate measures of insight, integrity and objectivity to this critical task.\\\"  The advisory committee is charged with independently assessing various redesign options of the space station presented by NASA's redesign team, and proposing recommendations to improve efficiency and effectiveness of the space station program. Space station international partners also are being asked to  participate and will be named at a later date. The advisory committee will submit its recommendations in June.  Advisory committee members named today include:  Dr. Charles Vest              Dr. Bobby Alford President, MIT                Executive VP & Dean of Medicine                               Baylor College of Medicine  Mr. Jay Chabrow               Dr. Paul Chu President, JMR Associates     Director, Texas Center for                               Superconductivity                               University of Houston  Dr. Ed Crawley                Dr. John Fabian Prof of Aero & Astro          President & CEO MIT                           ANSER  Maj.

The amounts of methanol formed from the ingestion of aspartame-containing foods are completely in the metabolic noise, since you're forming equally minute amounts of methanol from other components of food all the time.  In studies involving administration of high doses of the additive, blood methanol levels were undetectable. Methanol is a poison only in quantities seen in human poisonings, say 5ml and above.  This is a consequence of its oxidation to formaldehyde and formic acid, two quite reactive compounds which at high enough levels can damage tissues like the retina and kidney, because at such high doses the body's detoxification system is overwhelmed.  Interestingly, one treatment for early methanol poisoning is to get the person drunk on ethyl alcohol--vodka or an equivalent.  That's because ethanol is metabolized preferentially over methanol by the enzymes in the liver. If the methanol stays as methanol and isn't metabolized to formaldehyde, it is actually relatively non-toxic. \",\": >And, while we are on the subject, has a captain ever been traded,  : >resigned, or been striped of his title during the season?

Caleb  And let us not forget that the New Jersey Devils traded captain Kirk Muller for Stephen Richer and Chorske\",\"I can only comment on the Kings, but the most obvious candidate for pleasant surprise is Alex Zhitnik. He came highly touted as a defensive defenseman, but he's clearly much more than that. Great skater and hard shot (though wish he were more accurate). In fact, he pretty much allowed the Kings to trade away that huge defensive liability Paul Coffey. Kelly Hrudey is only the biggest disappointment if you thought he was any good to begin with. But, at best, he's only a mediocre goaltender. A better choice would be Tomas Sandstrom, though not through any fault of his own, but because some thugs in Toronto decided  to threaten his career in order to avoid conceding a goal. Other than that, the award goes to Robert Lang, an uninspiring Czech. Robitaille could easily be MVP, but I'd prefer to give it to Rob Blake who is quietly becoming one of the league's premier defensemen, and if the Kings manage to hold onto him and the  rest of our young defense, it could one day mean that we'll let in fewer goals than Hartford.

The athiest's position is that there is no PROOF of the existence of God.  As much as some people accept their Church, their priests or straight from their own scriptures as the \\\"proof\\\", this does not  satisfy atheists.

What they dispute is that Churches, priests, scriptures etc. represent true authorities and know the TRUTH.   Are you asking us to believe blindly?  You are trying to deny that part of us that makes us ask the question \\\"Does God exist?\\\" i.e. self-awareness and reason.  If we do not use our ability to reason we become as ignorant as the other animals on this earth.  Does God want us to be like that?  You are right that science and reason cannot PROVE anything.

AA and other 12-step abuse- recovery programs are acknowledged as being among the most effective.  Unfortunately, as evidence for God, this can be dismissed by stating that the same defect of personality makes substance abusers as makes  people 'religious', and the debunker could perhaps acknowledge that being religious is a better crutch than being a drug addict, but still maintain that both are escapism.  (And I suspect that there are some atheists who would find the substance abuse preferable to Christianity.)  I think that an essential problem with communication between Christ- ians and atheists is that as Christians we necessarily see ourselves as incomplete, and needing God (the 'God-shaped hole'), while atheists necessarily see themselves as self-sufficient.  If the atheists are right, Christians are guilty of being morally weak, and too cowardly to stand up for themselves; if the Christians are right, the atheists are guilty of considerable arrogance.  (I use the term atheist to refer to a person who has a definite conviction that there is no God, as opposed to one who does not know and/or does not care about God.) == Seanna Watson   Bell-Northern Research,       | Pray that at the end of living, (seanna@bnr.ca) Ottawa, Ontario, Canada       | Of philosophies and creeds,                                               | God will find his people busy Opinion, what opinions?

Wasn't Primeau, Murray's first decision as GM...\",\" I think the point is being missed - that it is apparantly acceptable for Big Government (Big Brother?) to use TANKS to control the people, as long as they don't use the BIG GUN (but everything else is allright...).  Tanks deployed against civilians, let alone FIRING on them with crew served weaponry (a .50 Heavy Machine Gun is crew-served) is something both our press and government howl about instantly when done in some other country.  Against civilians that have, at most, one-shot-at-a-time LIGHT small arms.  Certainly nothing that places the people in or behind the tank in any real danger.  Molotov coctails?  A round from a rifle or pistol deals with anybody approaching with one of those.  And \\\"snipers\\\" too often turn out to be strays from other cops/guard/army gunfire.  I don't know about the other people in this group (or on the net) but the idea of tanks being used to control civilians, in anything that pretends to be a free society is outrageous.  When Big Government feels it is necessary to use that kind of force to stomp out protests (even violent) of the citizens, that suggests that the government is totally out of control, since that is effectively the government declaring war on its own people.  If the government was living up to its responsibility, government of the people BY THE PEOPLE, not the 'lords' and other elites who want to keep their good thing going, the citizens wouldn't feel the need to be resorting to acts that need to be squashed with a military boot.  People do things like that because they have become convinced that it is the only option that remains, other attempts to have grievances redressed have been ignored.  And yes, there is a criminal element that will exploit this, but the fact remains that the government has been unresponsive or such acts wouldn't be apt to happen.  Still not an excuse to open up on civilians with tanks, heavy machine guns, or whatever. Its the old 'might makes right' philosophy that is the hallmark of a government going rogue:  They don't like it? Tough. We will simply squash them under an iron boot.  Actually addressing their grievances in other than token fashion with huge volumes of hot air is just too inconvenient...  Sort of a variation on mushroom management:  Keep them in the dark, Smother them with shit, and Crush them when ready...  And these are the folks that many liberals are trying to arrange things so that they will have a MONOPOLY on coercive force (firearms that are than expensive toys...) by gutting the Bill of Rights (cuz it just isn't PROGRESSIVE or doesn't fit in with MODERN THINKING anymore)...  Unbelievable.  And I do believe amid the smoke, confusion, etc of a real riot situation, that it would be POSSIBLE for a tank to get away with firing the main gun into a building at close range?  One would hear an explosion among many explosions.  It is loud, but it is not going to stand out like a 1000 pound bomb or a tactical nuke.  There would be a hole blown in the wall, and some rubble, but with tanks knocking over walls, and other sources of buildings turning into rubble, and other covering racket such as gunfire, including 50's tacking away, it would not stand out that much, and could be explained by \\\"musta been a gas leak... \\\".  I think it could be done and not be reported under such conditions - it is POSSIBLE.  It is not like a tank driving down a quiet street on a Sunday afternoon, turning and firing, you know.  THAT would stand out, and be pretty impossible to cover up.   \",\"[..]  This statement simply amazes me!  \\\"Through no fault of ATF, the element of   surprise was lost\\\"!

Tommy Soderstrom will get credit for the shutout, but he barely broke a sweat until the third period as the FLYERS defense kept the Leafs from mounting any serious attack.  Injuries:  Pelle Eklund is day-to-day with a bruised thigh.  Roster Moves:  Jason Bowen was added to the lineup for his first NHL game. Jason was the FLYERS second pick in the first round (15th overall) of the 1992 entry draft. 19 years old, 6'4\\\", 210 lbs. In 62 games with the tri-city Americans he had 10 goals, 12 assists and 219 PIM. He plays left wing and defense, he played defense in this game although Bobby Taylor said that Bill Dineen was planning to use him up front as well.  Andre Faust was returned to Hershey. He actually left after the second period of the Kings game, flew to Albany, got the game tying goal in a Bears OT win, and played again for Hershey Sunday night.  Lines:  Fedyk-Lindros-Recchi Beranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen Lomakin-Butsayev-Conroy Acton-Brown  Galley-McGill Yushkevich-Cronin Carkner-Hawgood Bowen  Tommy Soderstrom in goal.  Acton replaced Lomakin in the 3rd period.  Game Summary:  If the FLYERS played like this every night, they'd be in the playoffs this year. The FLYERS hit everything that moved. They created scoring chance after scoring chance. They snuffed out everything that the Leafs tried to do.  Jason Bowen made a good play on his first NHL shift that almost created a goal. He had the puck in the top of the left offensive circle all alone, but instead of taking the shot he found Brind'Amour crashing the net on the other side. A perfect pass and a good shot across Daren Puppa's body should have been a goal, but Puppa made a great save reading the play.  Garry Galley gave the Maple Leafs 7th ranked power play the first chance when he hooked Doug Gilmour at 4:25. The FLYERS lowly 21st ranked penalty killing unit was almost flawless the entire game, and set the tone on this kill. The Maple Leafs got almost nothing but long unscreened shots, and the defense swept away every rebound.  After the power play, the FLYERS got a goal on an ugly play. Rod Brind'Amour gave the puck to Greg Hawgood at the right point, and he sent a drive at the net. Puppa made the save and kicked the rebound right into the feet of Josef Beranek and Bob Rouse, who were wrestling in the slot. Beranek was able to get his stick on the puck and push it out to Dineen who was skating into the slot from the right circle, and he lifted a backhander over Puppa for a 1-0 FLYERS lead at 8:10.  The FLYERS kept the pressure on, and Puppa was the only Leaf keeping the FLYERS from building on their lead for a while. Eventually things settled down and defense prevailed. Each team got an occasional scoring chance, but the goalies were strong. Bowen started giving some Lindros-like checks in his own corners. Then Lindros, who was looking to avenge a hit Foligno gave him, thought he had a chance to even the score. He had Foligno lined up at center ice, leaned into him, and rode him into the center ice boards. The only problem was that Foligno was a little far from the boards, and Mike \\\"Mister\\\" McGeough felt that it warranted a boarding call at 15:38  The Leafs couldn't get anything going on the power play as the FLYERS were very aggressive (for a change) on the kill.  With time running out in the period, Recchi carried through the neutral zone and handed to Lindros as they approached the Leaf's blue line. They were in a crowd with Wendell Clark and Jamie Macoun, Lindros tried a backhand pass to Recchi through the feet of Macoun that connected to Recchi, but then Clark checked Recchi off the puck. Macoun then tried to clear, but it was weak and went right to McGill who had manned the point. He drove it from just inside the blue line. Macoun got his stick on it and deflected it past his own goalie at 19:55.1. Shots were 13-8 FLYERS in the period.  The FLYERS finally got their first chance on the power play when Dave Andreychuk tripped up Rod Brind'Amour in his offensive zone. During the power play, the FLYERS got cheated a little when the puck popped up into the air and Eric gloved it down, but McGeough thought it hit his stick above his head. We could see from our seats at the other end of the ice that it only hit his glove and the replay confirmed, but the faceoff went to the other end. As time was running out in the advantage, Lindros found Galley with a pass across the goal mouth but Puppa made the save. The rebound kicked back to the right corner where Recchi picked it up, passed it out to Eric crashing through the right circle, and Eric one-timed past Puppa at 7:55. With the assist, Recchi moves past Bobby Clarke's 74-75 season, the second best one season total for a FLYER at 117.  Eric moves up to 4th all time in FLYERS rookie scoring with 67 points.  Mike Eastwood took down Al Conroy at 8:30 to give the FLYERS another chance on the power play. Not much pressure before Garry Galley ended the power play with a slash at 9:19. Not much happened on the 4 on 4, although the Leafs had most of the possession. The FLYERS smothered the Leafs short power play. Tempers flared a little at 13:14. Bowen and Pearson got roughing minors, Keith Acton got a bloody face. Dave McLlwain then took a dive and got Greg Hawgood a hooking minor at 13:46 to set up a 4 on 3. The replay showed that Hawgood's stick stopped making contact with McLlwain long before he spun around and fell. Again the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play, led by Dimitri Yushkevich. Bowen made a thundering hit when he came out of the box on Pearson. Berehowski tried to perplex everybody with his sloooowball. He had the puck at the point, and just trickled a pass down the slot. He made all the FLYERS look silly as nobody could get a stick on it, and it got to Gilmour at the side of the net, but Soderstrom stoned him.  The FLYERS picked things up offensively after the kill was over, but didn't get anything home. Shots were 13-10 FLYERS.  The FLYERS were content with the 3 goal lead in the third period, and they decided that if Tommy wanted a shutout, he was going to have to work for it a little.  The FLYERS got most of the scoring chances in the first 7 or so minutes of the period, but couldn't get past Puppa. Then the Leafs got tired of Lindros making road kill out of them, and tempers flared. 2 each for Doug Gilmour and Lindros  (unsportsmanlike conduct) and 2 each for Glenn Anderson and McGill (roughing) all at 7:02. Terry Carkner then took a kneeing penalty at 7:51 on Gilmour.  Again the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play.  At about the 12 minute mark, Dave Andreychuk got a shot away from his left circle that got through Soderstrom. The puck was rolling on it's side, and as luck would have it it turned away from the net instead of turning towards it (think of how a rolling quarter inevitably starts to lean one way or the other). Seconds later Rod Brind'Amour tripped up Gilmour at 12:24 to give the Leafs another chance on the power play. On the advantage, after Soderstrom stoned Andreychuk while lying down, Andreychuk got the rebound through Soderstrom, but from behind the net and it went straight through and was swept away by one of his defensemen. They kept the pressure on, but Soderstrom was equal and preserved the shutout.  Recchi cross checked Ken Baumgartner to get tempers hot and start a brawl at 16:01. No punches thrown, Recchi got the initial minor, Krushelnyski Baumgartner and Lindros each got roughing minors. At 17:02 Rouse and Beranek expressed their mutual dislike for each other and got 2 each for slashing to set up another 4 on 4. Mike Eastwood shoved down Ryan McGill in the FLYERS zone as they were battling for the puck, and while McGill was down he ran his stick across McGill's face. The FLYERS were not happy with that at all. 5-8 Al Conroy paired up with 6-1 Berehowski, and started throwing punches. Upward. Well, Al held his own, much to the delight of the crowd. Each got a couple punches in before going down in a head, and Al got a standing O! Penalties: Eastwood 5 (cross check) + game, Clark, Carkner 10 each. Berehowski and Conroy 5 each (fighting) at 17:49.  So a major penalty for the rest of the game for the FLYERS. The had no interest in stting on the lead. Hawgood, Galley and Brind'Amour played catch until Hawgood found Dineen all alone in the left circle, he controlled the puck and blasted it past Puppa at 18:39.  That was all the fireworks, Tommy Soderstrom would not face another shot. Puppa did, but kept the FLYERS off the board. 4-0 FLYERS, shots were 9-8 FLYERS in the 3rd. Probably the strongest game I've seen from the FLYERS since the All Star break. Shutout number 4 for Soderstrom, all since 1/10. Tied for 2nd most in the NHL, but he's played fewer games than Belfour (6) or the goalie I can't remember that he's tied with.  Next up it's the Winnipeg Selannes Tuesday night in Winnipeg. The FLYERS cannot be eliminated if they win, but a loss coupled with an Islander win that night in Washington would be the official end.  FLYERS up to 71 points on the season in 78 games. Last year they had 75 points in 80 games (5 under .500), so they need at least 8 points in their last 6 games to improve on that only by percentage points (5 under in 84 is better than 5 under in 80).  Tragic number holds at 3 points with 6 games left. The tragic number for 5th is 5 points, I watched the Rangers blow a 4-2 third period lead at home to lose 5-4 before I finished this up. Why 5 points instead of 4? Well, the FLYERS will win the tie-breaker if they catch them, whereas the Islanders win tie breakers against the FLYERS and so need only a tie. The Rangers could crumble down the stretch as they play the Devils, the Pens twice, the FLYERS, and finish up with 2 games against the Caps. So I guess 5th place could be the goal for the team to focus on.

In     general, however, systems connected to 'the net' fall in one of three     categories: Internet, Usenet, or BITNET. Electronic mail may be sent     between these networks, and other resources available on one of these     networks are sometimes accessible from other networks by email sent to     special 'servers'.      The space and astronomy discussion groups actually are composed of     several mechanisms with (mostly) transparent connections between them.      One mechanism is the mailing list, in which mail is sent to a central     distribution point which relays it to all recipients of the list. In     addition to the general lists for space (called SPACE Digest for     Internet users, and SPACE on BITNET), there are a number of more     specialized mailing lists described below.      A second mechanism is Usenet 'netnews'. This is somewhat like a bulletin     board operating on each system which is a part of the net. Netnews     separates contributions into hundreds of different categories based on a     'group name'. The groups dealing most closely with space topics are     called 'sci.space.news', 'sci.space', 'sci.space.shuttle', 'sci.astro',     and 'talk.politics.space'. Contributors 'post' submissions (called     'articles' in netnews terminology) on their local machine, which sends     it to other nearby machines. Similarly, articles sent from nearby     machines are stored locally and may be forwarded to other systems, so     that an article is posted locally and eventually reaches all the Usenet     sites interested in receiving the news group to which the article was     posted.      Gateway machines redirect the Usenet sci.space group into Internet and     BITNET mailing lists and vice versa; the other Usenet groups are not     accessible as mailing lists. If you can receive netnews, its more     flexible interface and access to a wider range of material usually make     it the preferred option.

Refer to the San Jose Sharks for proof... But I have hope for the Marlins. I was a sometime member of the Rene Lachemann fan club at the Oakland Coliseum, and have a deep respect for the guy. He's a gem. And, of course, Walt Weiss gives that franchise class. But yeah... whoever designed those uniforms was guilty of a paucity of style and imagination. Ugghhh!\",\" That's ridiculous!   They aren't designed, they evolved.  And, much as it discomforts us, in humans a trouble-free birth process was sacrificed to increased brain and cranial size.  Wild animals have a much easier time with birth than humans do. Domestic horses and cows typically have a worse time.  To give you an idea: my family tree is complicated because a few of my pioneer great-great- grandfathers had several wives, and we never could figure out which wife had each child.  One might ask why this happened.  My great-great- grandfathers were, by the time they reached their forties, quite prosperous farmers.  Nonetheless, they lost several wives each to the rigors of childbirth; the graveyards in Spencer, Indiana, and Boswell, North Dakota, contain quite a few gravestones like \\\"Ida, wf. of Jacob Liptrap, and baby, May 6, 1853.\\\"   More like one in ten.  And the consequences can be devastating; I have direct experience of more than a dozen victims of a fouled-up breech birth.   It isn't always fatal.  But it is often fatal, when it happens out of reach of adequate help.  More often, it permanently damages one's health.  Clearly women's bodies _evolved_ to give birth (I am no believer in divine design); however, evolution did not favor trouble-free births for humans.     My, aren't we wroth!  I haven't read a more outrageous straw man attack in months!  I can practically see your mouth foam.  We're statistically sophisticated enough to balance the risks.  Although I can't produce exact statistics 5 years after the last time we looked them up, rest assured that we balanced C-section risks against other risks. I wouldn't encourage my wife to have a Caesarean unless it was clearly indicated; on the other hand, I am opposed (on obvious grounds) to waiting until an emergency to give in.  And bear this in mind: my wife took the lead in all of these decisions. We talked things over, and I did a lot of the leg work, but the main decisions were really hers.   I don't know of very many home birth advocates, even, that think that a first-time mother should have her baby at home.   But people should bother to find out the relative risks.  My wife was unwilling to take any significant risks in order to have nice surroundings. In view of the intensity of the birth experience, I doubt surroundings have much importance anyway.  Somehow the values you're advocating seem all lopsided to me: taking risks, even if fairly small, of serious permanent harm in order to preserve something that is, after all, an esthetic consideration.\",\"  Yup, you said it.  I admire such honesty. ;-)   Fire an Anschutz .22, then come back and talk to us.  You're letting ignorance and possibly fear cloud your thinking.  Either that, or this is sour grapes because we beat you in the Olympic shooting events. Funny, you'd think biathalon would be a natural sport for the norse. ;-)   Precisely.  That makes them the best method of defense for the citizenry. Not everybody has the time to train with a gladius, you know, but for some reason those who prey on others seem to have more free time.  To extend this a bit further, you need only a certain level of competence to beat another with a range weapon.  Getting in their face with a weapon and winning is much more difficult, and requires more training time the average citizen just does not have.  I've spent a few years practicing with a sword.  I can take the common person armed with one (though self-defense isn't the reason I own one).  My kid sister would have an even chance of beating me, gun vs. gun, with only a month of training.  That makes firearms much better, in our eyes.   Excellent point.  Perhaps you aren't so naive after all?   Taken into consideration in what respect?  Though quite wrong, let's make it a blanket statement for weapons in general.  This has been taken into consideration.  We call use of them aggrivated assault, assault with a deadly weapon, assault with intent to kill, attempted murder, and a whole host of others, and tack on extra prison time.   In Norway I suspect it was about the only weapon available.  You conquered your land (among others) a full millenia before we were thought of, and shortly thereafter weapons weren't quite so common.  I suspect that a few world wars made a difference too, since in times of emergency weapons tend to be turned in or donated to needy causes.  I'm curious, though, were the weapons used in the crimes bought shortly before the crime, or were they aquired by other means?  Any requirements other than just registering the shotgun?   \\\"Come on down to honest Erik's Used Swords!  Here's a slightly-used short sword, *THE* battlefield supremacy weapon of the eleventh century!  Only $39.95 with trade-in.  Easy financing!\\\"  Sorry, I couldn't resist.  You guys still slicing each other with long knives, or is this really not a problem?   I'm all for that.  What gets me is that scandanavians (and yes, I'm only a couple generations off the longship) used to be some of the most feared warriors on the planet a mere millenia ago, yet now seem to spend their time sitting in spas and doing a bit of topless sunbathing. Maybe you had a bit more time, and a more homogeneous culture, to become civilized with?   Yes.  We're too damned violent, partially I believe because we are not a homogeneous culture and don't identify ourselves as \\\"Americans\\\" first and foremost.  I'm rather proud of my Norwegian and Danish heritage, whereas I suspect you couldn't care less about that 2% Welsh blood in your veins thanks to a raid in Ireland back in 1055?  The time scale and the homogeneous culture are important.  Equally important is a basic philosophical difference in personal versus collective good. In America, the individual is more important than the masses.  Personal liberties are prized above all.  This is, sadly, changing of late, but I trust you notice how this call for freedom makes laws that restrict individuals for little collective benefit hateful to Americans.  I'd hazard a guess that, were America less interested in freedom and personal liberty and more interested in collective good we never would have sent our armed forces anywhere.  One poor effect of this culture we have is that we're looking out for ourselves and it is quite easy to identify with only a small segment of the population.  My grandmother tells of being discriminated against back in Denmark because she spoke \\\"low Dane,\\\" whereas others spoke \\\"high Dane.\\\"  It was shortly after World War II, as I remember, that \\\"low Dane\\\" was abolished so there was one common dialect.  We cannot fathom such a minor thing being a problem, because we have even more obvious means of identifying an \\\"outsider.\\\"   Take heart, yours is better than 90% of what gets posted by native speakers.

And one of the things that I've heard -- I don't want to get into the details of this because I don't know -- but one of the things that they were speculating about today was that the wind was blowing so fast that the windows might have been opened and some of the gas might have escaped and that may be why it didn't have the desired effect.       They also knew, Sarah, that there was an underground compound -- a bus buried underground where the children could be sent.  And they were -- I think they were hoping very much that if the children were not released immediately outside that the humane thing would be done and that the children would be sent someplace where they could be protected.       In terms of the gas masks themselves, I learned yesterday -- I did not ask this fact question before -- that the gas was supposed to stay active in the compound longer than the gas masks themselves were to work.  So that it was thought that even if they all had gas masks, that eventually the gas would force them out in a nonviolent, nonshooting circumstance.       MS. MYERS:  Last question.       Q  Mr. President, why are you still saying that --       Q  Could you tell us whether or not you ever asked Janet Reno about the possibility of a mass suicide?  And when you learned about the actual fire and explosion what went through your mind during those horrendous moments?       THE PRESIDENT:  What I asked Janet Reno is if they had considered all the worse things that could happen.  And she said -- and, of course, the whole issue of suicide had been raised in the public -- he had -- that had been debated anyway.  And she said that the people who were most knowledgeable  about these kinds of issues concluded that there was no greater risk of that now than there would be tomorrow or the next day or the day after that or at anytime in the future.  That was the judgment they made.  Whether they were right or wrong, of course, we will never know.       What happened when I saw the fire, when I saw the building burning?  I was sick.  I felt terrible.  And my immediate concern was whether the children had gotten out and whether they were escaping or whether they were inside, trying to burn themselves up. That's the first thing I wanted to know.       Thank you.       Q  Mr. President, why are you still saying it was a Janet Reno decision?  Isn't it, in the end, your decision?       THE PRESIDENT:  Well, what I'm saying is that I didn't have a four- or five-hour, detailed briefing from the FBI.  I didn't go over every strategic part of it.  It is a decision for which I take responsibility.  I'm the President of the United States and I signed off on the general decision and giving her the authority to make the last call.  When I talked to her on Sunday, some time had elapsed.  She might have made a decision to change her mind.  I said, if you decide to go forward with this tomorrow, I will support you. And I do support her.       She is not ultimately responsible to the American people; I am.  But I think she has conducted her duties in an appropriate fashion and she has dealt with this situation I think as well as she could have.       Thank you.

I have seen where people have blown up ballons then sprayed material into them that then drys and makes hard walls...  Why not do the same thing for a space station..  Fly up the docking rings and baloon materials and such, blow up the baloons, spin then around (I know a problem in micro gravity) let them dry/cure/harden? and cut a hole for the docking/attaching ring and bingo a space station..  Of course the ballons would have to be foil covered or someother radiation protective covering/heat shield(?) and the material used to make the wals would have to meet the out gasing and other specs or atleast the paint/covering of the inner wall would have to be human safe..

This morning, my 88 Ford Ranger was idling at 10,000 RPM. Ok, so I exaggerated a little, but it was idling very fast.  It has a 2 liter carburated engine in it, and no blipping of the throttle would cause the idle to drop back to normal (I don't think the linkage is stuck). What can I do to fix this problem?  This has been a problem from time to time, but has straightened itself out - until now.  I don't have a tach, but by gauging by the sound of the engine, it is idling about twice as fast as it should be.  This is down from what it was idling at when I pulled up at a stop light.

Was the crucification the will of God or a tragic mistake.  I believe it was a tragic mistake.  God's will can never be accomplished through the disbelief of man.  Jesus came to this world to build the kingdom of heaven on the earth.  He desperately wanted the Jewish people to accept him as the Messiah.  If the crucification was the will of God how could Jesus pray that this cup pass from him.  Was this out of weakness.  NEVER.  Many men and women have given their lives for their country or other noble causes. Is Jesus less than these.  No he is not.  He knew the crucification was NOT the will of GOD.  God's will was that the Jewish people accept Jesus as the Messiah and that the kingdom of Heaven be established on the earth with Jesus as it's head. (Just like the Jewish people expected). If this had happened 2000 years ago can you imagine what kind of world we would live in today.  It would be a very different world.  And that is eactly what GOD wanted.  Men and women of that age could have been saved by following the living Messiah while he was on the earth.  Jesus could have established a sinless lineage that would have continued his reign after his ascension to the spiritual world to live with GOD.  Now the kingdom of heaven on the earth will have to wait for Christ's return.  But when he returns will he be recognized and will he find faith on this earth.  Isn't it about time for his return.  It's been almost 2000 years.  Mike    And the two simplest refutations are these:  (1)  What impact?  The only record of impact comes from the New Testament. I have no guarantee that its books are in the least accurate, and that the recorded \\\"impact\\\" actually happened.  I find it interesting that no other contemporary source records an eclipse, an earthquake, a temple curtain being torn, etc.  The earliest written claim we have of Jesus' resurrection is from the Pauline epistles, none of which were written sooner than 20 years after the supposed event.  (2)  It seems probable that no one displayed the body of Jesus because no one knew where it was.  I personally believe that the most likely explanation was that the body was stolen (by disciples, or by graverobbers). Don't bother with the point about the guards ... it only appears in one gospel, and seems like exactly the sort of thing early Christians might make up in order to counter the grave-robbing charge.  The New Testament does record that Jews believed the body had been stolen.  If there were really guards, they could not have effectively made this claim, as they did.\",\" Paul,  Unfortunately, there are not too many retail outlets that'll stock just about every chip made.  The stuff they will stock are the ones that'll sell, like standard DRAM's, 80386's, 68000's, etc,etc. i.e.  I cna't think of any 'one-stop-shopping' store.  The closest you can get is to pick up a copy of Byte magazine or the Circuit Cellar, Popular Electronics, and the like and flip through them.  Distributors like Wyle Electronics, Hamilton Avnet, Pioneer Electronics, etc, etc, don't normally deal with end-users like ourselves where we only a couple of everything...they only deal with people who buy by the hundreds or more.  Each distributor represents and sells a variety of different non-competing manufacturers.  What do I mean by this? Suppose ABC Electronics sells Intel 80386's.  It's a pretty good bet that they won't be selling any of AMD's 386's, or vice-versa. They also can obtain just about *any* chip you want from a manufacturer they represent.  Who knows?  You might be lucky to be able to buy from one of them. But I'd be suprised if you do.  ALso bear in mind that the 1 or 2 qty prices they will charge you will be *much* greater than what a mail order outlet will charge.  My advice?  If you're gonna be designing anything, try to stick with off-the-shelf stuff.  You're going to get stuck if you use too many esoteric parts sooner or later.  good luck,\",\"NHL RESULTS FOR GAMES PLAYED 4/14/93.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                   STANDINGS       PATRICK              ADAMS              NORRIS              SMYTHE  TM    W  L  T  PT   TM    W  L  T  PT   TM    W  L  T  PT   TM    W  L  T  PT   xPIT  56 21  7 119  xBOS  51 26  7 109  xCHI  46 25 12 104  xVAN  45 29  9  99 yWAS  42 34  7  91  yQUE  47 27 10 104  yDET  46 28  9 101  yCAL  42 30 11  95 yNJ   40 36  7  87  yMON  48 30  6 102  yTOR  44 28 11  99  yLA   39 34 10  88 yNYI  39 37  7  85  yBUF  38 35 10  86   STL  36 36 11  83  yWIN  39 37  7  85  PHL  34 37 11  79   HAR  26 51  6  58   MIN  36 37 10  82   EDM  26 49  8  60  NYR  34 38 11  79   OTT  10 70  4  24   TB   23 53  7  53   SJ   11 70  2  24  x - Clinched Division Title y - Clinched Playoff Berth  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Boston Bruins    (51-26-7)   2   2   0   -   4 Ottawa Senators  (10-70-4)   0   1   1   -   2  1st period: BOS, Roberts 5 - (Juneau) 7:19      BOS, Wiemer 1 - (Juneau, Oates) 17:47  2nd period: BOS, Neely 11 - (Juneau, Murphy) 6:10      BOS, Hughes 5 - (Richer, Kimble) 7:55      OTT, Archibald 9 - (Rumble, Lamb) 11:37     3rd period: OTT, Boschman 9 - (Kudelski) 5:10  Powerplay Opportunities-Bruins   0 of 2    Senators 0 of 4  Shots on Goal- Bruins    13  11  10  -  34   Senators   5   9  12  -  26  Boston Bruins--Moog (36-14-3) (8 shots - 8 saves)  Blue (9:38 second)          (18 shots - 16 saves) Ottawa Senators--Sidorkiewicz (8-46-3) (27 shots - 23 saves)  Berthiaume    (6:36 third) (7 shots - 7 saves)  ATT-10,500  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Washington Capitals   (42-34-7)   0   0   2   -   2 New York Rangers     (34-38-11)   0   0   0   -   0  1st period: NONE  2nd period: NONE  3rd period: WAS, Bondra 36 - (Pivonka, Cavallini) 6:54      WAS, Bondra 37 - (Cote, Pivonka) 10:10  Powerplay Opportunities-Capitals 0 of 2    Rangers  0 of 1  Shots on Goal- Capitals  16  11  12  -  39   Rangers    8   7   8  -  23  Washington Capitals--Tabaracci (7-11-0) (23 shots - 23 saves) New York Rangers--Richter (13-17-3) (39 shots - 37 saves)  ATT-17,897  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  New York Islanders  (39-37-7)   2   1   1   0   -   4 Hartford Whalers    (26-51-6)   2   1   1   1   -   5  1st period: NYI, Ferraro 13 - (Malakhov, King) 1:29      NYI, Hogue 32 - (Thomas, Turgeon) 1:57      HAR, Yake 21 - (Poulin) 4:15      HAR, Yake 22 - (Nylander, Poulin) 16:44  2nd period: HAR, Verbeek 39 - (Cassels, Weinrich) (pp) 2:43      NYI, Thomas 35 - (King, Ferraro) 7:58  3rd period: HAR, Burt 5 - (Sanderson, Cassels) 13:41      NYI, Malakhov 14 - (Hogue) 17:45  Overtime:   HAR, Janssens 12 - (Poulin) 1:08  Powerplay Opportunities-Islanders 0 of 3    Whalers   1 of 3  Shots on Goal- Islanders  16   8   7   1  -  32   Whalers     7  13   7   1  -  28  New York Islanders--Fitzpatrick (16-15-5) (28 shots - 23 saves) Hartford Whalers--Lenaduzzi (1-0-1) (32 shots - 28 saves)  ATT-10,915  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Pittsburgh Penguins  (56-21-7)   2   3   1   0   -   6 New Jersey Devils    (40-36-7)   2   4   0   0   -   6  1st period: PIT, Daniels 5 - (Needham, Tippett) 4:14      NJD, C.Lemieux 29 - (Semak, Driver) 10:19      PIT, K.Stevens 55 - (Tocchet, Murphy) (pp) 12:40      NJD, Zelepukin 22 - (Driver, Niedermayer) 17:26  2nd period: PIT, M.Lemieux 68 - (Stevens, Tocchet) 1:42      NJD, Semak 36 - (C.Lemieux, Zelepukin) 2:27      PIT, McEachern 28 - (Jagr, Barrasso) 4:24      NJD, S.Stevens 12 - (Guerin, Pellerin) 5:45      PIT, M.Lemieux 69 - (sh) 12:40      NJD, Richer 37 - (Nicholls) 15:53      NJD, C.Lemieux 30 - (Semak, Zelepukin) 17:40  3rd period: PIT, Mullen 33 - (Jagr, M.Lemieux) 18:54  Overtime:   NONE  Powerplay Opportunities-Penguins 1 of 5    Devils   0 of 3  Shots on Goal- Penguins   9  11   8   2  -  30   Devils    12  15   9   3  -  39  Pittsburgh Penguins--Barrasso (43-14-5) (39 shots - 33 saves) New Jersey Devils--Billington (21-14-4) (30 shots - 24 saves)  ATT-14,796  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \",\"Your \\\"lite\\\" posting for the day, from rec.humor.funny:  -- \",\" ajteel@dendrite.cs.Colorado.EDU (A.J.

There is a way.  Certainly it is not by human reason.  Certainly it is not by human experience. (and yet it is both!)  To paraphrase Sartre, the particular is absurd unless it has an infinite reference point.  It is only because of God's own revelation that we can be absolute about a thing.  Your logic comes to fruition in relativism.    Ah, now it is clear.  Ludwig was a desciple of Russell. Ludwig's fame is often explained by the fact that he spawned not one but two significant movements in contemporary philosophy. Both revolve around Tractatus Logico-Philosphicus ('21) and Philosophical Investigation ('53).  Many of Witt's comments and implicit conclusions suggest ways of going beyond the explicit critique of language he offers.  According to some of the implicit suggestions of Witt's thought, ordinary language is an invaluable resource, offering a necessary framework for the conduct of daily life.  However, though its formal features remain the same, its content does not and it is always capable of being transcended as our experience changes and our understanding is deepened, giving us a clearer picture of what we are and what we wish to say.  On Witt's own account, there is a dynamic fluidity of language.   It is for this reason that any critique of language must move from talking about the limits of language to talking about its boundaries, where a boundary is understood not as a wall but a threshold.   vonWrights's comment that Witt's \\\"sentences have a content that often lies deep beneath the surface of language.\\\"  On the surface, Witt talks of the insuperable position of ordinary language and the necessity of bringing ourselves to accept it without question.  At the same time, we are faced with Witt's own creative uses of language and his concern for bringing about changes in our traditional modes of understanding.  Philosophy, then, through more perspicacious speech, seeks to effect this unity rather than assuming that it is already functioning. Yes?  The most brilliant of scientists are unable to offer a foundation for human speech so long as they reject Christianity! In his Tractatus we have the well nigh perfect exhibition of the nature of the impasse of the scientific ideal of exhaustive logical analysis of Reality by man.  Perfect language does not exist for fallen man, therefore we must get on about our buisness of relating Truth via ordinary language.    This is why John's Gospel is so dear to most Christians.  It is so simple in it conveyance of the revealation of God, yet so full of unlieing depth of understanding.  He viewed Christ from the OT concept of \\\"as a man thinketh, so he is.\\\"  John looked at the outward as only an indicator of what was inside, that is the consciousness of Christ.  And so must we.  Words are only vehicals of truth.  He is truth.  The scriptures are plain in their expounding that there is a Truth and that it is knowable.  THere are absolutes, and they too are knowable.  However, they are only knowable when He reveals them to the individual.  There is, and we shouldn't shy from this, a mysticism to Christianity.  Paul in ROm 8 says there are 3 men in the world.  There is the one who does not have the Spirit and therefore can not know the things of the Spirit (the Spirit of Truth) and there is the one who has the Spirit and has the capacity to know of the Truth, but there  is the third.  THe one who not only has the Spirit, but that the Spirit has him! Who can know the deep things of God and reveal them to us other than the Spirit.  And it is only the deep things of GOd that are absolute and true.    There is such a thing as true truth and it is real, it can be experienced and it is verifiable.  I disagree with Dr Nancy's Sweetie's conclusion because if it is taken to fruition it leads to relativism which leads to dispair.    \\\"I would know the words which He would answer me, and understand what He would say unto me.\\\"  Job 23ff  --Rex\",\"Adam Benson Mt.

He scared the hell out of me when he came in last year.  On the other hand, the club though enough of Boever to put him into an awful lot of games (he may have led the league in appearances - he did at least at some point).  He seemed to be a very viable setup guy - but I guess that's not considered that crucial by the club.  I can just remember two years ago so well, though... ...  I'm not that concerned.  Those guys have been relatively consistent over the years and they have no good reasons to decline (no injuries, not old, ...). I expect them to come through just fine.  It's those guys that have not been consistently good that are the worrisome part, even if they are coming through right now.  This sounds like their old road unis.  Pretty dull.  Buttons or pullovers? I'll check through my uniform book to see if they've always had some orange.   Well, we'll see.  I've got a Astros pullover shirt with the \\\"Astros stripes\\\" across the shoulders and I have trouble making myself wear it in public.  i can see why they might want that to change.  Gee, if they eliminate the orange, will they reupholster the seats in the Astros stripes section (what used to be the gold and yellow levels - I don't know those numbers they use now).

He usually only used the \\\"economy\\\" range to get an overdrive sixth gear out of it.  He had 59000 miles on it when it was stolen.  It was recovered shortly after that, repaired, and, for all I know, it's still going strong.   The CB1000C was a shaft-driven overbore version of the CB900 and was made for exactly one year (yep, head and base gaskets are VERY expensive). Helluva bike.

Immediately after the defense attorney asked the question, there was an \\\"Objection!\\\" heard in the background.  The clip ended at that point so I don't know if the objection was upheld.  I can't imagine NC is *that* bad.   This I didn't hear as an audio clip but heard it reported a number of times on news stories both during and after the trial.  Now the \\\"we did it on purpose\\\" thing is stretching, I think it was something more like--he had it coming.

They work alone, or can coexist witout hang-ups but can't access the ESDI or the IDE,  depending on setup/jumpers.

(It was a few months before _The Abyss_ came out.) As far as I can remember, they mentioned three things that were difficult to do at once with a substitute breathing fluid:   - low viscosity --- if it's too difficult to force the fluid in & out      of the lungs, you can't extract enough oxygen to power your own     breathing effort (let alone anything else)    - diffusion rate --- obviously, not all the air in your lungs is     expelled when you breathe out; and the part that isn't expelled     is the part that's nearest the walls of the alveoli. (alveolus?)     So the trip from the blood vessels to the new air has to be done     by diffusion of the gas through the fluid. Apparently oxygen     tends to diffuse more readily than CO2, so even if you can get enough     oxygen in, you might not be able to get enough CO2 out.    - oxygen/CO2 capacity --- you have to be able to dissolve enough     gas per unit volume.     Oh, and of course, your new breathing fluid must not irritate the lungs or interfere with their healing or anything like that...  \",\" Please don't misuse newsgroup hierarchy names as distributions.

EDT                     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I guess I'm just prepared to take  questions today.              Q   George, Bob Dole says that the Clinton  administration's policy on Bosnia is a failure and that he wants the  United States to take the lead in lifting the arms embargo so that  the Bosnian Muslims can defend themselves.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As you know, President Clinton has  said that that suggestion is under active consideration.  Obviously,  this is a tragic situation in Bosnia.  And if the Bosnian Serbs don't  come to the negotiating table in a constructive way, we'll look  seriously at pressing for lifting the arms embargo.  In the meantime,  we're going to continue to press for a tough sanctions resolution in  the U.N.  We're going to continue to work on the Serbs to come to the  negotiating table.  But the prospect of an arms embargo is something  the President certainly will consider if the Serbs don't come to the  table.              Q   How much longer are you going to give them to come  to the table, George?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're working on that right now.              Q   It's been a long time.              Q   On February 19th, the President mentioned the value  added tax in Ohio.  And when he was asked about it later by  reporters, he said -- quote -- \\\"That is a radical change in the tax  system of the United States.  It's something I think we may have to  look at in the years ahead.\\\"  Questioned again about it later he  says, \\\"It is not something that is now under consideration.  If we  start considering it, I'll tell you.\\\"  It wasn't a trial balloon or  anything, he said.  I was just discussing the tax response to a  question.  Donna Shalala, quoted in USA Today this morning -- quote - - \\\"Certainly we're looking at a VAT.\\\"  What's gone on?              Q   The same with Alice Rivlin this morning.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The health care task force is  reviewing a number of options.  They haven't made any decisions yet.   And as I have said from this podium time and time again, we're not  going to comment on decisions that haven't been made.              Q   But you have also said from this podium time and  time again --              Q   Wait a minute.  Whoa, Nelly.  Whoa.                Q      that that was not under consideration.              Q   Yes.  Clinton says, \\\"It is not something that is  now under consideration.\\\"  Is that no longer true?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe the working group, as Ms.  Shalala says, has looked at this prospect, but no decisions have been  made of any kind.              Q   Well, I know.  But he said he'd tell us about it if  it was ever under consideration.  I take it that now he is and he  didn't tell us about it or --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Did he say if it was under  consideration or if it was something to be proposed?              Q   \\\"If we start considering I'll tell you.\\\"              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  If it's something to be proposed?              Q   \\\"If we start considering it, I'll tell you.\\\"   That's a direct quote.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The task force has looked at a  number of different options.  They have not made any decisions yet.   The President has not made any decisions yet.  This is -- one of the  proposals under consideration by the task force was to go out and  cast as wide a net as possible for different ideas on how to reform  the health care system.  They have cast a very wide net.  They have  looked at hundreds of different proposals -- probably thousands of  different proposals.  But the President has not made any decisions.              Q   Well, is the President aware of their consideration  of this option?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if he's been briefed  on any preliminary conclusions or anything like that from the task  force on this specific proposal of any kind.  I don't know that  that's gotten to his level.  He started yesterday to go through with  the task force a very wide range of decisions and I don't believe  that that's been presented to him, no.              Q   Well, he's not relying on the USA Today to tell him  what his task force is considering in the way of taxes.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, he's going through it in a very  deliberate fashion.  There are a number of decisions that have to be  made.  I don't know that this proposal has reached that decision- making point.              Q   If this is still under consideration, that's a  change, at least from what we've been told by Dee Dee, I think about  three weeks ago or so.  She said, that is not an option, talking  about the -- had a big argument with somebody over this, so I  remember it specifically -- and said it not once, but twice.  Is that  not the case?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know if this has  been presented to the President as something that is being looked at  at some level in the task force.              Q   It was ruled it out, though.  I mean, unlike other  options that you've kept in the mix, this one specifically was ruled  out.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, this is something that is  being looked at, but no decision has been made of any kind.  I mean,  it doesn't -- it's not necessarily material until you get to the  decision-making phase.  The working groups are looking at hundreds of  different options.              Q   If it was ruled out before and it's not ruled out  now, then something has changed, George.  Yes, no?              Q   When a guy says in February --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the working groups are  looking at the widest possible range of options.              Q   So something's changed.  They weren't looking at it  before; they're looking at it now.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I don't know if the working  groups have gotten to that point yet.  They are casting a very wide  net.              Q   How was it possible that you and Dee Dee were able  to sell -- definitively rule it out as an option previously and now  are saying that, in fact, it is being considered?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, the working groups are  looking at a wide range of options.  They have not --              Q   Do you deny that you and Dee Dee ruled it -- flatly  ruled it out on several occasions in the past month?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't deny that -- I mean, those  are the President's words.  Those are very clear.              Q   Subsequent to the President's words, do you deny  that within the last month you and Dee Dee have both publicly ruled  it out?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know about the timing.  I  think what we did was refer back to the President's words and say  they stand.              Q   So don't they stand any longer?              Q   March 25th, Clinton said for the next four to five  years it was ruled out.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, those words -- the President  did say that in February.  The working groups are on a separate  track, and as I said, I don't believe --              Q   Separate from the President?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't believe this has been  presented to the President.              Q   Are they considering something that the President  --              Q   Has ruled out?              Q      has ruled out?  I mean, will the President  consider a VAT tax?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, the working groups have not  presented this to the President.  They have looked at a wide range of  options.  I suppose that if an argument is made, he will clearly  listen to it.  That does not mean he has decided to do it.              Q   Can we put this another way?  In his answer in  Ohio, he looked at the VAT in terms of restructuring the whole tax  system.  Under those -- that was the circumstance that he said it  might be considered at some future point.  Is that no longer the  case, or is that the only way that he can see a VAT emerging?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I guess I'm not sure exactly what  you're asking.              Q   He talked about the VAT in the context of a  restructured tax system, not as a specific way to finance health  care, for example.              Q   Or anything else.              Q   Or anything else.              Q   It was always in the context of substituting for  other taxes at a time of a dramatic overhaul of the whole tax system.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.              Q   Has that change, too?              Q   Is that still his view?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I haven't spoken about those  specific comments.  I think -- I can just go back to it -- are the  working groups -- have they examined the possibility of a VAT?  Yes,  they have.              Q   Certainly we're looking at a VAT, she said.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They have examined the possibility  of a VAT.  Has it been presented to the President?  Has he made a  decision?  No, he has not.              Q   What kind of a deal do you have when you've got the  President's appointed task force, obviously not oblivious to his  ruling something out except in the context of some huge down the line  reform, goes ahead on its own and considers a tax which he has  specifically ruled out in any context other than much later, and then  goes ahead and announces that that's what they're looking at?  Is the  President concerned about that sort of thing?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that the President's  concern is to make sure he gets the best health care proposal  possible.  He's concerned with making sure that they have the most  thorough process for examining all the possible alternatives, all the  different alternatives.  If a decision is made to go forward with  something like that it's certainly something the President will  explain and justify.  But no decision has been made along those  lines.              Q   What does it mean exactly, though, when the  President rules something out?  Does it mean it can get back on the  table later if a more persuasive argument is made?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's just -- that's indisputably  true.  If you -- but, at the same time, he has not ruled it in.  He  has not made a proposal.              Q   What makes him open to it now when he wasn't open  to it before?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's certainly willing to listen to  the argument.              Q   Was he willing to listen to the argument for a  short-term tax this year, and he wasn't willing to listen to it in  Chilicothe?  He's now open to it --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The context of his comments was  that it was not something -- he wanted to be clear that this is not  something he was proposing, not something he was floating.              Q   Not something he was considering.  Those are his  words -- \\\"It's not something that's now under consideration.  If we  start considering it, I'll tell you.\\\"  You're now acknowledging, are  you not, that it is under consideration and --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm acknowledging that the task  force has studied this proposal.  I am also stating that the  President has not made a decision on it.              Q   But the door is open for the President to  reconsider including this as part of --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Obviously, the working groups are  looking at it.  Again, but the President has not made a decision.              Q   Do you know if they will make a presentation on  behalf of the VAT to him?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know that.  I assume that  if -- I don't know what stage they are it in proposing.  I don't know  that they're going to make the conclusion that this is something they  should present to him.  I know this is something the working groups  are looking at.              Q   Do you understand, George, that none of us are  asking these questions in context of a decision that the President  has made, only about what the President is considering?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I understand that, and I am  acknowledging that the working groups have examined the issue of a  VAT.              Q   And the President will consider it?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I assume that he will consider the  argument if it is presented to him.              Q   Does that mean the President -- that working groups  think that when the President says no, he means maybe?  (Laughter.)              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that means that the working  groups are trying to do the most thorough job possible.              Q   George, can I ask you another question about  Bosnia?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sure.  (Laughter.)              Q   No, he wants us to stay on this.              Q   Let's do gays in the military.  (Laughter.)              Q   No, he got out of that swamp.              Q   I think we've gotten the bottom line on that VAT.   Reggie Bartholomew, your Special Ambassador in Belgrade, today said  that if the Serbs do not accept the agreement that has been worked  out -- quote -- \\\"We will do our part to pursue the lifting of the  arms embargo together with our allies.\\\"  That seems to go a bit  further than what you've just said --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sounds almost exactly what I just  said.              Q   Well, do you accept -- in other words, you accept  what Reggie --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the President has said that  this is something that's under consideration.  It is something he  will consider if the current actions don't bring the Serbs to the  table.              Q   Isn't there some kind of timetable here?                MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, there is a timetable.  There's  going to be a vote on the U.N. resolution in about 10 days.              Q   That's on sanctions, that's on tightening the  sanctions.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's right, that's sanctions.   And we believe that that will ratchet up the pressure, and we hope  that that will bring the Serbs to the table.  As you know, Mr.  Bartholomew also met with Mr. Churkin of Russia, and they are also  working on ways to bring the Serbs to the table.  We will continue to  pressure them in many different ways and this is one possible option  as well.              Q   The question is whether there's a timetable for  consideration or a vote on a decision on lifting the arms embargo,  not the sanctions.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The next vote in the U.N. is on  sanctions.  As far as I know, there are no votes scheduled on lifting  the arms embargo.  But it is something that we have discussed both  internally and with our allies.              Q   Why did Reggie Bartholomew tell the Serbs that the  U.S. would do that?  What was the point of his telling them that?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, clearly, I mean, this is  something that's under consideration, and this is something that we  take quite seriously if they do not come to the table.  They should  know the consequences of failing to come to the table.              Q   Have they been given a deadline?              Q   Warren Christopher has been saying the same thing  and it hasn't seemed to change the Serbs' behavior in the least.  Why  should the Serbs take any heed of a threat to lift the arms embargo  when so far everything that's been done has had no effect on the  fighting in Bosnia?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I just don't accept the premise of  your question.  It has had an effect; the embargo is having an  effect.                Q   What effect?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  If the Serbians choose not to heed  our warnings, then they will face the consequences.              Q   What effect has it had in Bosnia?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the effect that it has had on  the Serbians, it has tightened up -- they are not getting their  shipments through.  We can brief more fully --              Q   In Bosnia, George.  In Bosnia what effect has it  had?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, it's hard to say if it's  stopped the aggression to date.  That is why we're continuing to  press for the Serbians to stop.  But we believe that over time we  will continue to weaken the Serbs and that will have   an effect.   I'm not saying it's going to happen overnight; it clearly hasn't  happened overnight.  But we believe that over time the sanctions can  weaken the Serbs.  If it fails to work and if the Serbs fail to come  to the negotiating table, we'll move forward with the embargo.              Q   Isn't there a working deadline, George, of the 24th  -- the same date as the U.N. -- the scheduled U.N. vote?  Hasn't the  United States said, along with many of the other NATO allies, that if  the Serbs aren't willing to sign on to the peace accord by then, that  we'll seek -- haven't we said that we will seek --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We've said continually we're going  to --              Q   But on that deadline?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't have a specific date, but  we're going to move forward with the resolution, the U.N. resolution,  by around that time.  And if that fails to take effect, if that fails  to bring the Serbs to the table, we will clearly consider other  actions.              Q   Isn't this awfully incremental?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're taking a step-by-step  approach.  We're ratcheting up the pressure and we're going to  continue to do that.              Q   Is there a possibility, George, that by the time  all these incremental steps are taken the Serbs will have achieved  their goals and then what's the purpose?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the purpose is to get the  Serbs to stop the aggression.  We are pursuing that goal on many  different fronts.  We are pursuing it through the U.N.; we're  pursuing it through direct talks; we are pursuing it through  tightening the sanctions.  And we will consider lifting the arms  embargo.  We are turning the screws up on the Serbs and we will  continue to do that.              Q   But if the efforts have been unsuccessful in  getting the Serbs to stop the aggression how effective will any  campaign be to have the Serbs give back what they've gained?  I mean,  once they're entrenched --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't speculate on that.  We're  going to continue to press for them to come to the table now.  We're  going to continue to find ways to stop the aggression.  But I can't  see into the future.              Q   George, on the stimulus package, House Republicans  say they're going to hold a series of town meetings on Saturday to  try and explain the details of your package.  They cite polls which  show that the more people learn about it, the less they like it.   What's your strategy to counter that?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The strategy we have is the one  we're going to continue.  As you saw, the President today pointed up  the very real benefits of the summer jobs program that this package  will provide:  700,000 new summer jobs this summer for kids in inner  cities and suburbs to do productive work.  We are also going to point  out the benefits of the highway money, the investments in highways.   We're going to point up the benefits of immunization.  We're going to  point up the benefits of Head Start.  We are going to say that the  Republicans have a choice:  they can take action to create jobs or  they can perpetuate the gridlock of the last four years.               Q   Does it concern you, though, that the House now,  the House Republicans are after you as well as the Senate?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The House Republicans voted against  it before.  They made a mistake then; they're making a mistake now.              Q   George, does it strike anybody in the  administration that it's a bit strong to describe, as the President  did this morning, the summer jobs program as -- quote -- \\\"a  reaffirmation of a promise of America\\\"?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not at all.  I think it's the  promise of America to give kids a chance to reach their full  potential.               Q   Government-funded jobs?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  To give people a chance to work?   Absolutely.  That is the promise of America.              Q   I want to follow up on something I asked yesterday  -- where does 700,000 summer jobs, where does that figure come from?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That is on top of.  I did look at  it.  There are currently 600,000 summer jobs in the pipeline.  This  will be on top of the 600,000, so it will be a total of 1.3 million.              Q   The 700,000 would be created by the stimulus  package?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.              Q   Where does that number come from?  Because we've  been told all along that the stimulus package would create 500,000  new jobs.  And according to Panetta, that breaks down to something  like 200,000 full-time jobs and 150,000 summer jobs.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, but the summer -- that's when  you do their full-time equivalence.  I mean, 700,000 individuals will  receive jobs this summer.  When you calculate it for the full-time  job effect, you have to do -- I don't know what the exact formula is.              Q   Seven hundred thousand part-time jobs --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- 150,000 or --              Q   One to four because it's three months.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Thank you.              Q   Can I follow up on that?  Did the President  misspeak this morning when he said that some of the government money  for these summer jobs will pay for private -- for kids to work in the  private sector?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not necessarily.  I mean, I think  that there will be grants available.  That's one of the ways that you  pay for the jobs.  At the same time, he's also issued a challenge to  the private sector to hire kids on their own as well.                Q   Tax dollars, for instance, would pay for kids to  work at Time-Warner?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the Time-Warner is actually  somebody coming forward and actually doing a grant.  That's going to  be the bulk of it.  There could be isolated instances, though, where  there would be grants to businesses.              Q   Has the President spoken with any Senate  Republicans this week?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:   No, but there's been a lot of contact with Senate Republicans in the  White House.              Q   At a lower level.  But the President hasn't?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has not, no.              Q   Getting any closer to get the votes?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're continuing to work on it.               Q   Anybody leaning your way?              Q   On Haiti, The New York Times seems to be reporting  something of a breakthrough in Aristide's attitude towards the coup  leaders.  Can you confirm that there has been this change, and what  impact will it have on the process?  And what did Pezzullo have to  say yesterday in his report?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Pezzullo did brief the principals.   I can't confirm what's actually happening in the talks.  I would  leave that to the negotiators themselves.  But Mr. Caputo has  returned to Haiti.  We have received a briefing here at the White  House from Ambassador Pezzullo.  And as we have said time and time  again, we believe that assurances of security are important to a  final resolution to a broader political settlement.              Q   George, yesterday you offered some selective  breakdowns of how the stimulus would impact some states and cities.   Can we get a complete breakdown by state of how these jobs would be  impacted?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we have it for most states,  yes.  And I think we can get it out.              Q   Could you make that generally available?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe we can.              Q   And could you do it by the component of the  stimulus?  In other words --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if we can do -- I know  that we can do it by summer jobs and other jobs.  I don't know how  deeply it can be broken down.  But clearly, we can break it down into  summer jobs and other jobs.              Q   And can I follow up?  Is this the information that  Jeff Eller and the rest of the White House is using in the ads in the  states?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if they're ads, but  they're press releases.              Q   Can you describe what those press releases contain?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  All we're doing is pointing out the  benefits of this package to various states.  For instance, I know  that today Senator Dole is heading up to Vermont and New Hampshire.   And I would point out that the stimulus package, the jobs package  creates 1,000 jobs in Vermont.  It creates 2,000 jobs in New  Hampshire.  And the people of those states should remind him that  this is important.               Q   Where are the releases going?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They go to the states.              Q   To whom?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We can get them.  It's no problem.              Q   Can we get it?              Q   Why don't you put them out here as well?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we can.              Q   This afternoon?  Would that be possible?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'll have to check.  I don't know.   But as soon as we can.              Q   Are you focusing these press releases on states  where there are moderate or pragmatic Republican senators?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we're trying to get as many  as we can.  It's actually quite difficult to pull this together and  we're doing our best.  We're putting them out as we get them.              Q   Why are you so closely tracking Senator Dole's  schedule?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I was just following it.               Q   Are press releases going along to states where he's  visiting?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure.  I think that  probably there are press releases going to Vermont.  (Laughter.)              Q   Will there be a man in a chicken suit waiting?   (Laughter.)              Q   George, as the President goes about the business of  defending what's in his stimulus package, he doesn't address what  seems to be the Republicans' main point, that you're funding it with  deficit spending rather than \\\"if it's so important, why not come up  with the funding for it\\\" seems to be the Republican argument.  And  how do you answer that?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  What was answer is, we are paying  for it over time.  And if you look at our budget, we pay for this  package over time.  We believe right now the economy needs a jump- start for jobs.              Q   You're not claiming, are you, that that doesn't add  to the deficit this year?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm saying we're paying for it over  time.  I didn't say that.              Q   I know that, George.  But I mean, from the  beginning, the question -- we do have annual budgets and things -- deficit spending will pay for that this year, will it not?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  This year they clearly will.  But  over time our budget fully pays for this program.              Q   What you're saying is that there are savings that  would cover this if it were this year in future years?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely.  That's exactly what I  said.              Q   I know that, but there is going to be outstanding  debt, it will add to the national debt from this year --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, we're reducing the deficit by  $500 billion -- $514 billion over the next four years.              Q   You mean you're reducing it below what it would  have been?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Exactly.              Q   In fact, you're adding a very large amount to the  national debt over the period of --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  But we're reducing it far more from  what it would have been.  That's true.                Q   Washington-type reduction.  (Laughter.)              Q   You're getting to be a grumpy old man.              Q   George, has any decision been made about the White  House or the President's participation in the gay rights march coming  up in a week and a half?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're working on the President's  schedule now.  I believe he's going to be at the Senate Democratic  retreat in Jamestown that weekend.              Q   Will he address it by phone?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know about that.  It's a  little far out, but I believe he's going to be in the Senate retreat.              Q   So will he have the leaders in a day or two before  the speech?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.  I would expect that  at some point he would meet with the leaders of some of these groups.   I don't know the schedule on it, though.              Q   Will there be an AIDS czar appointed prior to or in  conjunction with the event?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not sure.              Q   April 22nd is Earth Day.  What is the President  going to do to mark that, and is it the case that he is going to sign  the biodiversity treaty that day?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I know there's been some work on  the biodiversity treaty.  I don't know about signing it that day, but  I would expect he'll have a statement on Earth Day or right around  then.              Q   Where is the work on the biodiversity treaty?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'd have to check with Katie  McGinty.  I just know that there's been some work done, but I don't  know exactly what.              Q   When is Earth Day?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The 22nd, I think.              Q   Why is it you know that he is going to have a  statement on Earth Day but you don't know if he's going to have a  statement on the gay rights march?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I said I don't know if he's going  to meet or when he's going to meet.              Q   Do you have a statement on the gay rights march?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't, actually, no.  I wouldn't  be surprised if he did, though.              Q   Do you have some details on the Miyazawa visit?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's a working visit on Friday and  the President is looking forward to that in discussing a number of  issues including Russian aid and the Japanese stimulus package and  the trade issues between the two countries.              Q   There was some expectations that a second aid  package to Russia was going to be unveiled at the G-7 meeting and, if  I understand, it hasn't happened.  Why is that or what's the status  on that?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The G-7 meeting is still going on  and, as you know, Secretaries Bentsen and Christopher have talked  about the outlines of a possible package.  But we're going to  continue to consult with Congress and our G-7 allies on that.              Q?     We will not then make any kind of announcement  during the two-day meeting?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The meeting's not over yet.                Q   Is that when you're going to make one?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not ruling out the possibility.              Q      the President's going to announce it tomorrow.              Q   Bentsen said that.              Q   Yes, Bentsen said it would be tomorrow.              Q   So did Christopher.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'd have to look at that, but I  believe it is more likely that the announcement will come out of  Tokyo.              Q   George, has there been further consideration here  about going to -- sending the President out to Los Angeles?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know that there's -- it's  not something we've ruled out.  We don't have a date set for it.              Q   George, you all have a position or do you support  Immigration's plan to settle 4,000 Iraqi prisoners in the United  States?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's the first I've heard of it.              Q   George, there was a report today about the --              Q   Fortunately.  (Laughter.)               Q      about the pace of appointments and says that  President Clinton is behind President Bush in the number of positions  that people have been nominated for.  Are you going to speed up the  pace of nominations or where do you stand with it?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We filled 814 of the President's  appointments.  And it's broken down -- we have 384 Schedule C; 147  noncareer SES; 213 PAS full-time.  I'm not sure what that means -- (laughter) -- 70 PA full-time.  And this is about the same -- it's  about the same pace of President Bush.  Obviously, as you move along  farther, once you -- each level of appointment actually has a  multiplier effect and frees up far more appointments.  So we expect  the process to speed up.  But we're at the pace of Bush.  Obviously  we'd like to get these done as quickly as possible.                I would point out that the FBI background checks and the  background check is far more comprehensive and it takes more time  than our predecessors, and that is part of the holdup.  But we're  working on it.              Q   Is that because of Nannygate?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's an awful big part of  it, yes.              Q   In the story this morning, you were at  approximately the same pace as Bush in making appointments, but way  behind in winning confirmations.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's where the background checks  comes into play.  That's the problem.              Q   That's the background checks problem?  Because I  mean, you have a Democratic Senate --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, that's not the -- you make the  appointments, and then it takes quite a bit of time to fill out all  the forms and have the background checks done.  That's exactly where  the problem is.              Q   What's the President doing this afternoon, and  what's on the plan for tomorrow?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's got some meetings -- just  office meetings this afternoon for the most part, on a variety of  issues that -- probably a half-dozen different issues.  And then  he'll be -- tomorrow we'll have an event, probably again focused on  the stimulus and jobs package out of here at the White House.  And  Friday is the Miyazawa meeting.              Q   Will you be releasing his tax return tomorrow,  George?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Either tomorrow or Friday.              Q   Is there going to be a pre-briefing regarding the  Japanese Prime Minister's visit tomorrow?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know about tomorrow, but  we'll probably get something done, as we usually do, for these  visits.              Q   Was Reverend Jackson here this morning and do you  know what that was about?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He was here.  He met with a group  of us here at the White House, including Mack McLarty.              Q   Who?              Q   Reverend Jackson.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Reverend Jackson.  Mack McLarty,  me, Gene Sperling, Bruce Reed, Jeff Watson, Mark Gearan.               Q   Talking about Haiti?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We talked about general urban  policy.  He is about to go to Los Angeles.  He was just back from  Mississippi, where we had a good victory last night; and he's going  on to Los Angeles.              Q   Did he request the meeting?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Actually, no.  He's in continual  contact with the President.  He had written a letter on a variety of  issues, and so we asked him to come in and talk about it.              Q   George, Dole is having a fundraiser for Jeffords  tonight in Vermont.  Have you guys been  in contact with Jeffords at  all on this?        MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think there's been some contact,  sure.              Q   Can you tell us about the contacts?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure --               Q   Do you know who contacted him or what was said?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I know that Howard Paster talked to  him and they just has a general talk about the package.              Q   And did he express his support for it now, or is he  --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't divulge the details of the  conversation, but there have been conversations.              Q   The L.A. Times is reporting that abortion -- elective abortions is likely to be included in the basic health care  package.  Is this something the President is considering?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again --              Q   Along with the VAT?  (Laughter.)              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's certainly something that's  been looked at, but no decisions have been made.              Q   What was the question?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The L.A. Times story on whether  abortions will be covered by the President's health plan.              Q   Did the President in his meeting -- did you in your  meeting with Reverend Jackson ask his advice, solicit his advice  about what kind of stance the White House should take in the wake of  the verdict in L.A.?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, we certainly talked about the  situation in Los Angeles and the long-term prospects for economic  development and other issues.              Q   For instance, did you discuss whether it would be  helpful for the President to go there or not?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, we discussed a wide range of  issues related to Los Angeles.  That was certainly one of them.              Q   Letting you perhaps go out on the way you came in,  I need to go back to Bosnia just for a second and ask --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, good.              Q      your reaction to Margaret Thatcher's comments  that you're just sitting by and watching a massacre.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, we've been pushing very hard  on a number of fronts for more aggressive action.  We will continue  to do that.              Q   Can you tell us if you've made any progress in your  talks on the stimulus package getting a compromise?  I mean, we don't  have any feel except talks are ongoing.  Have you talked to like 20  people or --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know the numbers.  We've  talked to several people and we've had wide-ranging sessions.                Q   Anyone leaning your way?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't get into that.  We're just  going to keep working through Tuesday.

Let's make things clear: My opposition to H.R. violations in Arab States is total and without qualification. No Arab State is and can claim to be democratic. No Arab state claims to be democratic.  I am born in Palestine (now Israel). I have family there. The lack of peace and utter injustice in my home country has affected me all my life. I am concerned by Palestine (Israel) because I want peace to come to it. Peace AND justice.   If anybody has legitimate claims towards Arab states, he should present his claims and ask for support. Jews who left Arab states are fully  entitled to make claims and should do so, if they consider their case has a merit. It is their basic right to return to these countries, if they wish. If not, they should not complain and compare themselves to the Palestinians who have been struggling for the right of return since Israel was established and whose right is upheld by the United Nations quasi totally. If Jews feel discriminated in Arab countries, they have a legitimate claim that any decent person can and should support.   Human rights violations by Arab States don't justify, legitimate nor are the cause for Israeli breaches of international law and human rioghts. Israeli breaches stem from the Zionist concept, which can only be implemented by negating basic rights to Palestinians.   Israeli trights and Palestinian rights are not symmetrical. The first party has a state and the other has none. The first is an occupier and the second the occupied. For any meaningful relationship to emerge, some symmetry must be established. As long as Israelis and Jews don't realise the necessity of a change of perspective towards the Palestinian people and as long as Israelis and Jews don't want to exorcise their own past towards the Palestinians (the Naqba of 1948, etc.) and refuse to acknowledge that the creation of Israel was dependent upon the removal of most Palestinian Arabs, there will be no base for a real trust.  When I read the first time the list of the 383 Arab villages destroyed by the State of Israel in and after 1948, I got a shock.  I hope others will be touched by this discovery and think about the meaning of such massive destruction and destitution.\",\"I have an Adcom GFA-555 that I got in 1985.

Anyway, I think it would be a great idea to  develop such a product, perhaps in the underground, as it would otherwise  probably become illegal pretty quickly here...  It's really very feasible and shouldn't be too expensive - all that's needed is a box with a phone jack on one side, a DSP in the middle to do codec functions of speech->compressed bytestream, and an RS232 on the other side.  You'd plug your phone into it, plug the RS232 into your computer, and have a good old fashioned normal modem on your other RS232 port.  The CPU in the middle would do the encryption with a version of pgp modified to work on a byte stream.  With v32bis or better modems to carry the bytestream, it should work.  Quality would only be marginally lower than a normal telephone.  At the very highest price, you could use one of those voice-mail compatible modems to do the digitisation - that puts an upper bound of about $500 on the cost of such a box.  In practice, you really ought to be able to get the price well below $100 - I could do it now in software on my cheap&nasty home RISC box (Acorn Archimedes) with the digitising microphone I bought for 25 pounds, if I knew how to write good speech compression software (which I don't).  The reason it won't work of course is that hardly anyone will have one - the only consumer equipment to have encryption will use the wiretap chip. Economics, I'm afraid.  However... we can get about 2Kcps throughput on the internet even with the bottleneck of a v32bis modem.  When we get ISDN for all (ha ha ha) and the new NREN, it might then be trivial to run compressed speech over a tcp/ip connection on the Internet.  Perhaps we should start thinking now of a standard to keep voice on the internet compatible for everyone, and side-step the clipper stuff and use internet for all our phone calls in future :-)  [1/2 joking]\",\"I can't believe this, Howe has an ERA in the 80's He is improving!!!  \",\"   The only way out seems to be death.  ---      \\\" I'd Cheat on Hillary Too.\\\"\",\"    We're looking at a series of chips by WSI, the PSD3xx series.

Matthew 5:17    \\\"Think not that I have come to abolish the law and the  prophets; I have come not to abolish them but to fulfil them.  Matthew 5:18   For truly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away,  not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the law until all is accomplished.  Matthew 5:19   Whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments  and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he  who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of  heaven.  Matthew 5:20   For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of  the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.   There are several problems with this.  The most serious is that the Law was regarded by Jews at the time (and now) as binding on Jews, but not on Gentiles.  There are rules that were binding on all human beings (the so-called Noachic laws), but they are quite minimal.  The issue that the Church had to face after Jesus' death was what to do about Gentiles who wanted to follow Christ.  The decision not to impose the Law on them didn't say that the Law was abolished.  It simply acknowledged that fact that it didn't apply to Gentiles.  This is a simple answer, which I think just about everyone can agree to. (A discussion of the issue in more or less these terms is recorded in Acts 15.)  However there's more involved.  In order to get a full picture of the role of the Law, we have to come to grips with Paul's apparent rejection of the Law, and how that relates to Jesus' commendation of the Law.  At least as I read Paul, he says that the Law serves a purpose that has been in a certain sense superceded.  Again, this issue isn't one of the abolition of the Law.  In the middle of his discussion, Paul notes that he might be understood this way, and assures us that that's not what he intends to say.  Rather, he sees the Law as primarily being present to convict people of their sinfulness.  But ultimately it's an impossible standard, and one that has been superceded by Christ.  Paul's comments are not the world's clearest here, and not everyone agrees with my reading.  But the interesting thing to notice is that even this radical position does not entail an abolition of the Law.  It still remains as an uncompromising standard, from which not an iota or dot may be removed. For its purpose of convicting of sin, it's important that it not be relaxed.  However for Christians, it's not the end -- ultimately we live in faith, not Law.  While the theoretical categories they use are rather different, in the end I think Jesus and Paul come to a rather similar conclusion.  The quoted passage from Mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest of the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus shows us how he interprets the Law.  The \\\"not an iota or dot\\\" would suggest a rather literal reading, but in fact that's not Jesus' approach.  Jesus' interpretations emphasize the intent of the Law, and stay away from the ceremonial details.  Indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude towards the Sabbath and kosher laws.  Some scholars claim that Mat 5:17-20 needs to be taken in the context of 1st Cent. Jewish discussions.  Jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a tenth of even the most minor herbs, but neglecting the things that really matter: justice, mercy and faith, and caring about how cups and plates are cleaned, but not about the fact that inside the people who use them are full of extortion and rapacity.  (Mat 23:23-25) This, and the discussion later in Mat 5, suggest that Jesus has a very specific view of the Law in mind, and that when he talks about maintaining the Law in its full strength, he is thinking of these aspects of it. Paul's conclusion is similar.  While he talks about the Law being superceded, all of the specific examples he gives involve the \\\"ceremonial law\\\", such as circumcision and the Sabbath.  He is quite concerned about maintaining moral standards.  The net result of this is that when Paul talks about the Law being superceded, and Jesus talks about the Law being maintained, I believe they are talking about different aspects of the Law.  Paul is embroiled in arguments about circumcision.  As is natural in letters responding to specific situations, he's looking at the aspect of the Law that is currently causing trouble: the Law as specifically Jewish ceremonies.  He certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards of conduct.

It is indeed what atheists (generally) expect and it is neither fair nor unfair, it just is. You might as well argue about whether being made mostly of carbon and water is \\\"fair\\\".  However, the atheists who claim that Hell is unfair are talking about the fire and brimstone place of endless suffering, which necessarily includes eternal existance (life, I dunno, but some sort of continuation); not at all the same thing.  Granted, you clearly feel that hell=death, but this is not a univeral sentiment as near as I can tell.  If *your* idea of God \\\"condemns\\\" heathens to ordinary death, I have no problem with that.

I would say that that is valid.  If Winnipeg is such a lousy defensive team then why the hell does Salami stand around the other team's blueline when the puck is in his own end?    Excuse me?  Are the Jets playing .500 hockey?  Let me check...yes - but just barely.  They have allowed more goals than they have scored.  Sounds an awful lot like Salami's +/- to me.  Sounds like they would be just as well off - or better - if he played the solid two-way game that our friends in Finland claim he is capable of.  But if he did that he wouldn't be chal- lenging for the league lead in goals would he?  The Bi-Planes might be challenging for first however...   Now let's see...you have compared Timo to Anderson and Cullen.  Who's next?  Mike Foligno?    Some of our Finnish friends who have watched him play claim that he can play a solid two-way game.  I would have to say that this style of contribution would be more conducive to winning.  Or don't you  think so?    I don't believe it!  You did compare him to Foligno!

It seems from the following that the CPSR is atleats starting to question this bogosity:      ---------------------------------------------------------------- April 16, 1993 Washington, DC                 COMPUTER PROFESSIONALS CALL FOR PUBLIC            DEBATE ON NEW GOVERNMENT ENCRYPTION INITIATIVE          Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR) today called for the public disclosure of technical data underlying the government's newly-announced \\\"Public Encryption Management\\\" initiative.  The new cryptography scheme was announced today by the White House and the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), which will implement the technical specifications of the plan.  A NIST spokesman acknowledged that the National Security Agency (NSA), the super- secret military intelligence agency, had actually developed the encryption technology around which the new initiative is built.          According to NIST, the technical specifications and the Presidential directive establishing the plan are classified.  To open the initiative to public review and debate, CPSR today filed a series of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests with key agencies, including NSA, NIST, the National Security Council and the FBI for information relating to the encryption plan.  The CPSR requests are in keeping with the spirit of the Computer Security Act, which Congress passed in 1987 in order to open the development of non-military computer security standards to public scrutiny and to limit NSA's role in the creation of such standards.          CPSR previously has questioned the role of NSA in developing the so-called \\\"digital signature standard\\\" (DSS), a communications authentication technology that NIST proposed for government-wide use in 1991.  After CPSR sued NIST in a FOIA lawsuit last year, the civilian agency disclosed for the first time that NSA had, in fact, developed that security standard. NSA is due to file papers in federal court next week justifying the classification of records concerning its creation of the DSS.          David Sobel, CPSR Legal Counsel, called the administration's apparent commitment to the privacy of electronic communications, as reflected in today's official statement,  \\\"a step in the right direction.\\\"  But he questioned the propriety of NSA's role in the process and the apparent secrecy that has thus far shielded the development process from public scrutiny.  \\\"At a time when we are moving towards the development of a new information infrastructure, it is vital that standards designed to protect personal privacy be established openly and with full public participation.  It is not appropriate for NSA -- an agency with a long tradition of secrecy and opposition to effective civilian cryptography -- to play a leading role in the development process.\\\"          CPSR is a national public-interest alliance of computer industry professionals dedicated to examining the impact of technology on society.

These are indeed provocative questions but they are asked time and again by people around me.  1.      Is it true that the Israeli authorities don't recognize Israeli nationality ? And that ID cards, which Israeli citizens must carry at all times, identify people as Jews or Arabs, not as Israelis ?  2.      Is it true that the State of Israel has no fixed borders and that Israeli governments from 1948 until today have refused to state where the ultimate borders of the State of Israel should be ?  3.      Is it true that Israeli stocks nuclear weapons ? If so, could you provide any evidence ?  4.      Is it true that in Israeli prisons there are a number of individuals which were tried in secret and for which their identities, the date of their trial and their imprisonment are state secrets ?  5.      Is it true that Jews who reside in the occupied territories are subject to different laws than non-Jews?  6.      Is it true that Jews who left Palestine in the war 1947/48 to avoid the war were automatically allowed to return, while their Christian neighbors who did the same were not allowed to return ?  7.      Is it true that Israel's Prime Minister, Y. Rabin, signed an order for ethnical cleansing in 1948, as is done today in Bosnia-Herzegovina ?  8.      Is it true that Israeli Arab citizens are not admitted as members in kibbutzim?  9.      Is it true that Israeli law attempts to discourage marriages between Jews and non-Jews ?  10.

It is a beautiful building.  The Pettits and the city like to promote it as the best facility for hockey in North America. As to what will happen with the Admirals if Milwaukee does acquire a franchise, word is the team will move to Green Bay and play in the Brown County Arena. Once again, the Admirals are an independent franchise, and the people of Milwaukee have been supporting them well.  The games I have been to have seen crowds anywhere from 10,000 to 13,000, which are numbers some NHL teams (i.e. the Islanders, Hartford, New Jersey) would be envious of having on some nights.

Beemers have no EC (tm).\",\" : In any case, I think Viola would have made a better signing.  Why? : Viola is younger, and is left handed (how many left handed starters does : Toronto have?  Well, I agree that Viola is a better signing.  However, why does everyone say that you want lefthanded starters?  I understand lefthanded spot relievers, even though they usually face more righthanded batters than lefthanded batters.  I just don't understand why people insist on lefthanded starters, unless there is a park effect (e.g., Yankee Stadium). Most batters in MLB are righthanded, so righthanded starters will have the platoon advantage more often than lefthanded starters. I guess one argument for lefty starters is that certain teams may be more vulnerable to LHP's than RHP's.  However, this is probably only a factor in the postseason, because teams seldom juggle their starters for this reason during the regular season.  I think you just want the best starters you can get, regardless of whether they are lefties or righties.  Lefthanded starters tend to have higher ERA's than righthanded starters, precisely because managers go out of their way to start inferior lefties (or perhaps because of the platoon advantage).

Take chances.\",\" Every city and suburban police officer I've seen around the Twin Cities in the last two years has carried a semi-auto of some type (different brands though I haven't seen any Glock's).   With regard to this discussion:  We are getting dangerously far from the usual rantings of t.p.g, and close to the realm of r.g, but I'd like to put my two cents worth in.  While there's nothing wrong with a revolver (especially a  large frame S&W in .357 magnum - my favorite) there are valid advantages to semi-autos.  I suggest reading Massad Ayoob's (I know, some people can't stand him and think he's full of bull, but I think that in general his material is very valid and useful) book _The Semi Auto Pistol in Police Work_ (or something  like that).  He defines a number of ways that semi-auto's are different, and that \\\"different is good\\\".  The main advantage is not in increased firepower, but in  more accurate followup shots when you go to single action mode.  There is also a certain \\\"propriatory nature\\\" of each gun that takes some familiarity to  learn.  This may have diminished with time as more criminals become familiar with different models of semi-autos, but it was cited as stopping or at least slowing down criminals who had grabbed a police officers gun.   Yes, but this is best done with a two hand hold.  With a single hand you either pull the gun far off target to cock, or must fire double action.  The DA semi auto has the same advantages plus is always SA after the first shot.    I'm not sure if this is meant to be different from your first point.  In a DA semi-auto you can pull the trigger again to try dropping the hammer on the same round - an advantage you don't have in a revolver where the next trigger pull will always go to the next round (discussing this point now).  This is fine with a dud but what about a hangfire situation?  Granted it's very rare, but your round will now go off confined in the cylinder with no place to go.  Slingshotting the slide on a misfire takes very little time.    Actually with modern revolver designs incorporating hammer blocks this is not necessary or usually recommended.  A revolver would have to fall hard enough and at the right angle to actually break the hammer and driver the firing pin into the round to set it off.   The best speedloader users, especially those using the spring loaded speed loaders are very fast.  A problem is that ejecting the spent cases is a two handed job where dropping the expended magazine is one handed.  This means that while you can be inserting a fresh magazine as soon as the old one clears the gun, with a speed loader you have to go through more motions that will always  take more time.  You also don't have the advantage of tactical reloads (replacing a partial magazine to bring you back to full capacity - the partial magazine can still be used if needed later).     Yes, the time to recognize the problem is just as important as the time to clear it.  Really though, in either a revolver or semi-auto the odds of an actual misfire with factory ammo are awfully small.  You are more likely to get a jam in a semi-auto but even these are exceptionally rare with modern quality guns (Sigs, Glocks, et.al.).     All common semi-auto's can be carried with a round in their chamber without any safety problems.  While I put that out as a statement that I believe, I should say that this applies to all of the ones I've looked at.  For the DA semi's it's no different from the revolver situation:  The guns all have hammer or firing pin blocks.  They also have a safety.  Because there's no real advantage carrying one of these cocked and locked you have the same safety and speed of employment as a revolver, plus the advantage of SA followup shots.  I'm not familiar with SA semi-autos except for the 1911-A1.  I admit that I was initially skeptical about carrying this cocked and locked, but after examining the design, trying to defeat the safeties (gun unloaded of course), and  shooting it a lot, I see no inherent safety problems with it, especially in a thumbreak holster with the strap under the hammer.  This design also gets you more speed for an accurate first shot than a revolver.   Yeah, the infamous Glock.  I still can't figure out how it's worse than a revolver for safety.  If you don't pull the trigger it doesn't go off.  I imagine that if all your revolver shooting was done double action then you could pull the Glock trigger far enough to fire before you realized it.  In addition, if you had developed that nasty habit of keeping your finger on the trigger when holstering your gun and relying on your thumb on the hammer to remind you to take it off before you blew off your foot then you'd have problems when the hammer wasn't there.   I think this is even okay for a riot (as long as it's a small one B^)).   I have the poor man's Beretta (Taurus 99) and consider it inferior as a carry weapon to the Springfield .45 (oops, 9mm vs. 45 arguments are relegated to r.g).  You are right, though.  If you don't hit what you aim at then the shooter/gun combination has failed.  I don't ascribe failures in the the fire real fast with a wonder-nine scenario you mention to the gun.  This is a shooter failure, whether through lack of discipline or lack of training.    9mm's are becoming more popular with crooks too, though the .38 does still lead the list.  And like I said, around here semi-auto's seem the rule for the street cop.  Don't know about the State Patrol however, they may still carry the \\\"Highway Patrolman\\\".   Vincent, please don't take any of this as a flame.  Just my $0.02 (whoops, looks more like $2.00) worth.  And much of it is IMHO, but do check Ayoob's book.\",\"Got a few things I want to get rid of...

Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port         2. X terminals         3. NeXT         4. Silicon Graphics         5. IBM RS/6000  6. Other stuff      1. Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port   If you've got a proprietary computer which uses its own keyboard  (Sun, HP, DEC, etc.) then you're going to have a hard time finding  a vendor to sell you a compatible keyboard.  If your workstation  runs the X window system, you're in luck.  You can buy a cheap used  PC, hook your expensive keyboard up to it, and run a serial cable  to your workstation.  Then, run a program on the workstation to read  the serial port and generate fake X keyboard events.   The two main programs I've found to do this are KT and A2X.   a2x is a sophisticated program, capable of controlling the mouse, and  even moving among widgets on the screen.  It requires a server  extension (XTEST, DEC-XTRAP, or XTestExtension1).  To find out if your  server can do this, run 'xdpyinfo' and see if any of these strings  appear in the extensions list.  If your server doesn't have this,  you may want to investigate compiling X11R5, patchlevel 18 or later,  or bugging your vendor.   kt is a simpler program, which should work with unextended X servers.  Another program called xsendevent also exists, but I haven't seen it.   Both a2x and kt are available via anonymous ftp from soda.berkeley.edu.      2. X terminals   Also, a number of X terminals (NCD, Tektronics, to name a few) use  PC-compatible keyboards.  If you have an X terminal, you may be all  set.  Try it out with a normal PC keyboard before you go through the  trouble of buying an alternative keyboard.  Also, some X terminals add  extra buttons -- you may need to keep your original keyboard around  for the once-in-a-blue-moon that you have to hit the Setup key.      3. NeXT   NeXT had announced that new NeXT machines will use the Apple Desktop  Bus, meaning any Mac keyboard will work.  Then, they announced they  were cancelling their hardware production.  If you want any kind of  upgrade for an older NeXT, do it now!      4. Silicon Graphics   Silicon Graphics has announced that their newer machines (Indigo^2 and  beyond) will use standard PC-compatible keyboards and mice.  I don't  believe this also applies to the Power Series machines.  It's not  possible to upgrade an older SGI to use PC keyboards, except by  upgrading the entire machine.  Contact your SGI sales rep for more  details.      5. IBM RS/6000   IBM RS/6000 keyboards are actually similar to normal PC keyboards.  ||  Unfortunately, you can't just plug one in.  You need two things: a  ||  cable converter to go from the large PC keyboard connector to the   ||  smaller PS/2 style DIN-6, and a new device driver for AIX.  Believe ||  it or not, IBM wrote this device driver recently, I used it, and it ||  works.  However, they don't want me to redistribute it.  I've been  ||  told Judy Hume (512) 823-6337 is a potential contact.  If you learn ||  anything new, please send me e-mail.        ||          6. Other stuff   Some vendors here (notably: Health Care Keyboard Co. and AccuCorp)  support some odd keyboard types, and may be responsive to your  queries regarding supporting your own weird computer.  If you can  get sufficient documention about how your keyboard works (either  from the vendor, or with a storage oscilloscope), you may be in  luck.  Contact the companies for more details.   Apple Adjustable Keyboard     Apple Computer, Inc.     Sales offices all over the place.      Availability: February, 1993     Price: $219     Supports: Mac only      Apple has recently announced their new split-design keyboard.  The     keyboard has one section for each hand, and the sections rotate     backward on a hinge.  The sections do not tilt upward.  The keys are     arranged in a normal QWERTY fashion.      The main foldable keyboard resembles a normal Apple Keyboard.     A separate keypad contains all the extended key functions.      The keyboard also comes with matching wrist rests, which are not     directly attachable to the keyboard.      As soon as soda comes back up, I'll have a detailed blurb from     TidBITS available there.   FlexPro Keyboard     Key Tronic     Phone: 800-262-6006     Possible contact: Denise Razzeto, 509-927-5299     Sold by many clone vendors and PC shops      Availability: Spring, 1993 (?)     Price: $489 (?)     Supports: PC only (highly likely)      Keytronic apparently showed a prototype keyboard at Comdex.  It's     another split-design.  One thumb-wheel controls the tilt of both     the left and right-hand sides of the main alphanumeric section.     The arrow keys and keypad resemble a normal 101-key PC keyboard.      Keytronic makes standard PC keyboards, also, so this product will     probably be sold through their standard distribution channels.   DragonDictate-30K (and numerous other Dragon products)     Dragon Systems, Inc.     320 Nevada Street     Newton, MA  02160      Phone: 800-TALK-TYP or 617-965-5200     Fax: 617-527-0372      Shipping: Now.

The program is called a2x, and is  available via anonymous ftp:   soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/a2x.tar.Z  export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/a2x.tar.Z (most current)   If you want to use your Dragon product with X windows, you may want  to ask for Peter Cohen, an salesman at Dragon who knows more about  this sort of thing.      Dragon Systems sells a number of voice recognition products.     Most (if not all) of them seem to run on PC's and compatibles     (including PS/2's and other MicroChannel boxes).  They sell you     a hardware board and software which sits in front of a number     of popular word processors and spreadsheets.      Each user `trains' the system to their voice, and there are provisions     to correct the system when it makes mistakes, on the fly.  Multiple     people can use it, but you have to load a different personality file     for each person.  You still get the use of your normal keyboard, too.     On the DragonDictate-30K you need to pause 1/10th sec between     words.  Dragon claims typical input speeds of 30-40 words per minute.     I don't have specs on the DragonWriter 1000.      The DragonDictate-30K can recognize 30,000 words at a time.     The DragonWriter 1000 can recognize (you guessed it) 1000 words at a time.

The thumbs have     a number of switches.  Despite appearances, the key layout resembles     QWERTY, and is reported to be no big deal to adapt to.  The idea is     that your hands never have to move to use the keyboard.  The whole pod     tilts in its base, to act as a mouse.

You purchase     \\\"compatibility modules\\\", a new cord, and possibly new keycaps, and     then you can move your one keyboard around among different machines.      It's a three-piece folding keyboard.  The layout resembles the     standard 101-key keyboard, except sliced into three sections.  Each     section is on a \\\"custom telescoping universal mount.\\\"  Each section     independently adjusts to an infinite number of positions allowing each     individual to type in a natural posture.  You can rearrange the three     sections, too (have the keypad in the middle if you want).  Each     section is otherwise normal-shaped (i.e.: you put all three sections     flat, and you have what looks like a normal 101-key keyboard).

The layout has a large blank space in the middle, even though the     keyboard is about the size of a normal PC keyboard -- slightly     smaller.  Each hand has its own set of keys, laid out to minimize     finger travel.  Thumb buttons handle many major functions (enter,     backspace, etc.).      You can remap the keyboard in firmware (very nice when software won't     allow the reconfig).

Soft rubber keys, which rock     forward and backward (each key has three states), make chords for     typing keys.  Learning time is estimated to be 2-3 hours, for getting     started, and maybe two weeks to get used to it.

The opinions in here are my own, unless otherwise mentioned, and do not represent the opinions of any organization or vendor.\",\" I'll tell you my story as an example of what *not* to do.  Early in 1984 I took some riding lessons from my college roommate on his old Honda CB360T.  He had taken the MSF beginner's course, so I actually learned *some* of what I needed to know to ride.  I proceeded to buy a beat-up Honda CL350 for $400 and a $12 helmet and rode around wearing this and a cotton windbreaker.  Then I decided to invest in a full-face helmet (first smart move).  Sometime around then I also passed my road test.  On May 4, 1984, I got caught in a rainstorm on my way home from a 4-mile trip.  Entering the town where I lived (a rather urban suburb), I had to stop suddenly for a red light that I noticed too late, skidded the rear tire out, and was ejected face upward into the oncoming lane of traffic.  Fortunately for me the oncoming traffic was also stopped for the same red light, otherwise I might have slid under a car and been killed.  Now this is anecdotal evidence, to be sure, but I later took the Experienced Rider Course from the MSF and saw that earlier training could have helped me greatly.  In your case the need is even greater since you have nobody to help you practice even the most basic stuff as I did.  So my advice is to take the MSF beginner's course first thing.  I wouldn't even buy a bike until you've taken the course, unless you happen to pick up a real good deal and can store it someplace until you're ready to use it.   While you're waiting to take the course (it might take a few weeks in DC, as I recall there were always waiting lists in Boston), could you save up some more money to start out right?  Say $300 for riding gear, plus the cost bike, plus maybe $100 (guess) to a mechanic to make sure the machine is safe (assuming you economize by buying some old beat-up machine from a private individual), plus insurance, plus registration and licensing fees, plus the course, you're looking at maybe $600 not including the bike itself and a reserve for ongoing maintenance.   I pay about $100 insurance now (upstate NY) but it was closer to $200 in Boston (more urban) for decent insurance including substantial coverage for liability, which you want unless you plan always to be poor.  I'd guess DC is more like Boston than like a rural area, ergo more expensive.   There used to be annual buyer's guides in the usual motorcycle magazines; I found those helpful in getting an idea of what new or recent models might be available.  You could probably look through past issues to size up what used bikes might be available.  (My first bike was 13 years old when I bought it so I went on my friend's advice instead.)  Also look at the bikes that you see people riding or that are parked on the street.  I basically settled on my present bike by noticing that there were a lot of high-mileage BMW's running around and they were generally set up the way I wanted.  Nothing wrong with talking to various dealers in your area or visiting showrooms.  Dealers in the Boston area, at least when I was shopping, were very nice about letting you look around their showrooms and quoting prices for bikes that weren't the latest models (hence cheaper), although I ended up buying both bikes in private sales.\",\"I have the following items for sale:  Animation Works software for Macintosh by Gold Disk           This is a brand new shrink-wrapped copy  Microsoft Excel for Windows Ver. 4.0           Opened, but includes everything including Registration card  Video7 FastWrite VGA card. 512 video memory. 800x600 resolution.

The Bible \\\"ends\\\" with the book of Revelations. But does God's reign end there ? No. So who can say for sure that God's messages are either no longer happening or still happening ?  I can now hear the clamor for proof. 8-) With the cold response I've gotten from the past from this group, it's very hard to get the point across. I'll only go over the physical stuff so that skeptics can look at documents stored somewhere. I've cited the uncorrupted bodies of saints before. They're still there. 8-) The apparitions at Fatima, Portugal culminated in a miracle specifically granted to show God's existence. That was the spinning/descending of the sun. It was seen in several countries. That event is \\\"approved\\\" by the Pope. Currently, images of Mary in Japan, Korea, Yugoslavia, Philippines, Africa are showing tears (natural or blood). These are still under investigation by the Church. But realize that investigations take decades to finish. And if the message is Christ will come in ten days, that's a bit too late, isn't it 8-). Other events under investigation are inner locutions (\\\"coming to know\\\"), stigmata (the person exhibits Christ's wounds. And they don't heal. And doctor's don't know why). Non-believers are welcome to pore through documents, I'm sure.  This stuff is not like Koresh. Or Oral Roberts (give me $5M or God will call me home). It's free. Find out why they're happening (as we ourselves are studying why). If anybody can figure this out, tell us ! You can be of any religion. If you have the resources, go to one of the countries I mentioned. These are not \\\"members only\\\" events. God and Mary invites  everybody.  So in conclusion (finally) ... We RC's believe in the modern day manifestations of God and Mary. We are scared to death sometimes although we're told not to. There are more proofs and events. And that is why \\\"not everything is in the Bible\\\". Although in a lot of the apparitions, we are told to read the Bible.  As far as the Protestant vs. Catholics issue is concerned... In the end, God's churches will unite. I'm not sure how. I have some idea. But the point is we shouldn't worry about the \\\"versus\\\" part. Just do God's work. That's all that matters. Unity will come.  BTW, I'm just a plain person. I'm not the Pope's spokesperson. But I am RC.  -- \",\"Attention Israel Line Recipients                       Friday, April 16, 1993     Two Arabs Killed and Eight IDF Soldiers Wounded in West Bank Car Bomb Explosion   Israel Defense Forces Radio, GALEI ZAHAL, reports today that a car bomb explosion in the West Bank today killed two Palestinians and wounded eight IDF soldiers. The blast is believed to be the work of a suicide bomber. Radio reports said a car packed with butane gas exploded between two parked buses, one belonging to the IDF and the other civilian. Both busses went up in flames. The blast killed an Arab man who worked at a nearby snack bar in the Mehola settlement. An Israel Radio report stated that the other man who was killed may have been the one who set off the bomb.

EDT                     SECRETARY RILEY:  Good evening and welcome to all of you  in the thousands of communities around the country that are taking  part in this satellite town meeting for the month of April.              You know, today is April 13th.  In 1743, Thomas  Jefferson was born, 250 years ago.  I think that's appropriate to  mention at the beginning of this meeting because since that time he  has been, of course, a person who has been one that we've all  followed in terms of our democracy and the importance of education  here in this great country.  The success of our democracy according  to Jefferson really depends upon the success of our educational  system.              His philosophy of government, his belief in the  importance of education is also very meaningful to our special guest  here this evening.  Tonight we're so pleased to have with us  President Clinton.  He's come over from the White House to join us in  the Chamber of Commerce studios.                Mr. President, it's good to have you.  We thank you for  taking the time to visit with these communities here on the satellite  network and we welcome you here this evening.              Also we have with us Secretary of Labor Robert Reich.   And, Bob, it's certainly pleasant to have you with us this evening  also.              I have some questions for our two guests, and I'm sure  many of you do, too.  So please call us if there's something that  you'd like to ask.  The number is 1/800/368-5781 or 5782.  In  Washington, D.C. the number is 202/463-3170 or 3171.              I believe the President has a few words that he might  want to share with us.  And, Mr. President, I'll ask you to do that  at this time.  It's great to have you.              THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.              I'm glad to be here with my friends, Dick Riley and Bob  Reich -- also members of my Cabinet -- at the headquarters of the  Chamber of Commerce to support the effort that the Chamber is making,  along with its Center for Work Force Preparation, to help to examine  tonight the whole critical question of how to move our young people  from school to the work place.              I want to compliment the Chamber on all their efforts,  recognizing that without an educated work force we can't grow this  economy or remain competitive, and recognizing that we all have to  work together -- business and government, labor and educators -- to  make things happen.              This satellite town meeting is a good example of that  kind of working together.  And if you'll forgive me a little home  state pride, I want to say a special word of thanks to the Wal-Mart  Corporation, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas, for providing  several hundred of the sites for this town meeting tonight.  I  appreciate that a lot, as well as the sites that are provided for all  the rest of you.              I have tried as hard as I could to move toward  constructive change for this country.  Secretary Riley talked about  this being Thomas Jefferson's 250th birthday.  If Thomas Jefferson  believed in anything, he believed in these three things:  first, in  education; second, in real personal liberty, freedom of religion,  freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of the press; and  third, in the absolute imperative of changing as times change.                If you go to the Jefferson Memorial here in this  beautiful city, which is now bedecked with all of its wonderful  cherry blossoms, you will see Jefferson saying that we have to change  with changing times.              For us here in America, that means reducing our deficit  and increasing our investment and putting our people first so that we  can compete in the world.  We're here to talk about that tonight -- about what we can do to educate and train our people better.  Unless  we do that, none of the efforts that all the rest of us make in  government, even to bring the budget into balance, even to increase  our investment in other things which will grow jobs, will last in the  long run.              We also have to have people who can carry their load.   And in a world where the average young person will change jobs seven  or eight times in a lifetime, that begins with the education system  and continues into the work force where education must go on for a  lifetime.  It's not just important what you know, but what you can  learn.              And if I might, I'd like to close just by emphasizing  we're doing our best to try to have the most innovative partnership  between the Labor Department and the Education Department and the  private sector to build a good school-to-work transition.  And we're  trying to get off to a good start this summer with a program that  would create more than 700,000 new summer jobs, including many  thousands that have a strong education component so our young people  can be learning and working at the same time.              Dick, I think I ought to stop there.  That's a good  place we can begin, I think, the discussion.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you so much, Mr. President.              Each month we get together and talk about ways that all  citizens can work towards reaching the national education goals.  And  tonight, we'll focus on goal five, and how communities such as yours  can prepare students for this world of work.              This week, the Education Department and the Labor  Department are hosting a conference here in Washington, D.C. called  Summer Challenge, a program of work and learning, to America's youth.   The aim is to use some special funds from President Clinton's  proposed economic stimulus package to provide educationally-enriched  jobs and summer school programs for young people in disadvantaged  areas of the country.                Mr. President, let's talk a minute -- you alluded to it  somewhat -- about the  Summer Youth Challenge.  Your program calls  for more educational enrichment in the summer jobs.  And why in your  words is that so important?              THE PRESIDENT:  I think it's important for two reasons.   First of all, a lot of the young people we're trying to reach may  have had trouble adjusting to school and learning.  And while we want  them to have a good experience with a real job, we also want them to  continue to learn during the summer because we know from a lot of  research that a lot of kids that have trouble learning in school may  forget as much as 30 percent of what they learned the previous year  over the summertime.  And that is a very unproductive thing for  schools to have to take up a lot of time teaching what they already  taught before.              Secondly, we want to help these young people progress,  not only in terms of work, but in terms of learning.  We want to  abolish the artificial dividing line between what is work and what is  learning because we think that the best and most productive workers  will have to be lifetime learners.  And we think that this experience  could maybe drive that point home and prepare these young people to  succeed in school, or at work, or in college as they go on.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I think the fact that these are  disadvantaged kids -- that gap, that lag you mentioned as they go  into the next year, is really even greater.                Secretary Reich, of course, you have training programs  throughout the year.  And I wonder is you have any comment about this  educational component of training.              SECRETARY REICH:  Well, what we've learned, Mr.  Secretary, is that for many young people, whether it's for the summer  or for the year, actually on-the-job work experience combined with  education is one of the best ways of learning.  Many young people,  for example, have a lot -- they have a difficult time learning  geometry.  But when they actually are there building something or  working on something, and they can see the exact and direct  application of geometry, they understand what it's used for.  And a  lot of young people -- just that sense of connection between  education and the world of work is terribly, terribly important.   It's important during the summer, but it's important for a lot of  young people even beyond the summer.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you.                Mr. President, you've called for a youth apprenticeship  program, school-to-work transition.  And I wonder if you would tell  us a little bit about your concept of that and how you see it  developing.              THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, let's talk about why  it's important.  Most new jobs that will be created in this decade  will not require a four-year college degree, but most of them will  require some learning and skills that go well beyond what most people  get in a high school diploma.                If you look at the last 10 years, the average salaries  of young people that had at least two years of good post-high school  education was a good salary that went up over the decade.  The young  people who had less than that tended to have lower wages that did not  go up, and in many cases in real terms fell over the decade, because  they weren't productive, they weren't more valuable to their  employers.              So we think America has a big economic interest in  trying to ensure that all the young people who get out of high school  but don't go on to college make a transition to work, which includes  two years of further training either in a community college, a  vocational setting, or perhaps on the job.  And what I have done in  this budget, as you know, is to give you and Secretary Reich some  funds and some incentives to try to work in partnership with states  and with the private sector to build these programs state-by-state in  a way that would be customized essentially by the business community,  based on the needs of the economy in any given area.  It could  revolutionize long-term the quality of the American work force and  the earnings of American workers.              SECRETARY REICH:  I should add, Mr. President -- I think  you know this from your experience in Arkansas -- and many of the  people watching this program -- that the business community and  educators, labor groups are already in many of our communities, many  of our states, building a school-to-work transition program.  In  fact, there's an awful lot of ferment, a lot of excitement.  The  people watching this program probably are the ones who are most  directly involved in that.  And more power to them.  Secretary Riley  and I are going to do everything we can to build on the successes  already out there.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Bob, we're going to be talking tonight  about youth apprenticeship and tech prep, the co-op learning   career academies.  And what features all those programs that deal  with this subject -- what are some of the features that every one of  these school-to-work programs might have that   are important?              SECRETARY REICH:  Well, one thing that we've seen -- and  you and I have been working at this for a long time, and you much  longer than I -- we've seen that active involvement of the business  community is absolutely essential.  And I'm so delighted that we're  doing this in the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce.  The  Chamber of Commerce of the United States is committed to doing these  kinds of programs -- training, education, retraining -- and we've  aimed to work very closely with the Chamber.              The business community is going to be actively engaged  in developing almost an audit of the kind of jobs that are needed and  helping the educators, community colleges, technical institutions  develop curricula that are relevant for the jobs of the future.              Communities have got to come together.  I mean, this is  one of the most important things.  You've got to have all of these  players in a community come together and work together and cooperate  together.  You know, too often we have the educators over here and  the business leaders over here, labor groups over here and everybody  is talking, but they're not really working together in a common  strategy.              And the third and final ingredient I would say, Dick,  would be a commitment to excellence -- a commitment both to academic  excellence and also to skills development excellence.  This is not a  tracking program we're talking about for kids who are not going to  make it.  This is a program that every young person ought to be  eligible for.  If they want to go on beyond that to four-year  college, that's fine.  That ought to be permissible.  But we're  talking about the foundation of learning about jobs, the foundation  skills for on-the-job learning.              And again, those are the critical components.  It's  already being done.              THE PRESIDENT:  I think -- if I might just interject one  point based on my personal experience at home -- the business  community has a critical role to play, not simply in saying here are  the job skills that are needed and here's what ought to be taught,  but also in monitoring that excellence.  If you have the right sort  of partnership there, the people who are paying the taxes and who are  going to then be hiring the workers are not going to permit the  second-rate programs to survive if they have any way to shape and  influence them.  So I think that's very important.              And when we try to, if you will, fill in the blanks at  the federal level, trying to set some standards and provide some  funds, one of the things that we want to be sure and do is to make  sure that the employer has a heavy amount of influence over the  quality of these programs, because that's really what's going to  determine whether the whole thing is worthwhile.              SECRETARY RILEY:  That's great.  We've been talking, of  course, about school-to-work and also the jobs and economic recovery  program for this summer and fall.  But let's talk just a moment about  long-term school reform.  It's something especially close to me.  Mr.  President, I wonder if you would give us some of your ideas for the  communities out here on Goals 2000 legislation that I think will be  coming forth before too long.              THE PRESIDENT:  Well, as you know, back when you and I  were both governors, we spent a lot of time working on our public  schools and we tried to be very candid with our people in saying that  a lot of these things were going to take some time to materialize.                I had a hand in writing the National Education Goals  that the governors drafted, along with representatives of President  Bush's administration back in 1989.  And what we're going to try to  do this year with your leadership is to introduce legislation in  Congress that will actually define the things that the national  government ought to do to try to help the local schools and the  children of this country and the adult learners, too, meet those  goals -- making sure that when -- by 2000, people show up for school  ready to learn; that we get a 90 percent on-time high school  graduation rate; that children at the 4th, 8th, and 12th grades are  confident in the subjects they're supposed to know; that they are  second to none in math and science; that are schools are safe,  disciplined, and drug-free.  And, of course, the fifth goal --I took  them out of line to say this the last -- is that we have a system of  life-long learning in this country.              And each one of those goals there's a national role, a  state role, a school role, school district role, and a private sector  role.  And what you've attempted to do in this bill you're going to  introduce with me in the next few weeks is to define what our job is;  and then to give the rest of America a way of defining what their job  is and seeing whether we're actually meeting the standards of quality  that we need to meet.              It's very exciting.  So far as I know, nothing quite  like it has ever been done in the form of federal legislation before.   Not mandating and telling people what they have to do with their  money, but actually setting up a framework for excellence and  partnerships so that we can do our job.  I'm really excited about it.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I am, too.  And I think really  it will be an entirely new role for the federal government in terms  of its relationship with states, serving as a partner really to  support and facilitate and to help out in these education reform  efforts, all driven by high standards.  That's the point.              Bob, let me ask you one question, and then we'll get to  the telephone calls.  It's about the same subject.  We have, of  course, skills standards that are going to be part of Goals 2000, and  I wonder if you would comment on that.              SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you know, we have 75 percent of  our young people who don't graduate from college.  Very often they  don't have very many alternatives.  They do have a wonderful system  of community colleges and technical institutions, but if we had  national skill standards to which they could aspire and which  employers would understand as a national credential, many of these  young people would actually find that they were much more eligible  for jobs.              Everybody doesn't have to go to college.  Other  countries you have smaller proportions of their population going to  college, but you have a whole level of people who have certain  technical, preprofessional skills.  We can do it in this country.  If  you don't go to four-year college you're not a loser.  And we want to  develop those national skill standards.  We're going to be working  with the states, with the Education Department, with a lot of private  industry in developing those standards.  And I think they will be the  kinds of things that enable our vocational and technical and other  institutions to rally around, as well as our business community.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, that's great.  Why don't we go  ahead and go to the telephone.  We have a call, I see -- Mayor Bruce  Todd of Austin, Texas.              Q   Yes, Mr. President and Mr. Secretary Reich and  Riley, we certainly appreciate the opportunity to join you today.  We  have some dedicated professionals and volunteers here in Austin who  have heard what you have said and are very appreciative.  Let me  simply say, amen to some of the comments made already.  We agree with  much of the tone that the Clinton administration has taken, and are  very supportive.                We have been successful here in Austin of tripling our  summer employment program over the last four years.  We expect to  have over 2,000 employed this year in the summertime; perhaps as much  as 3,500 with the federal assistance.                Much of the question that we had designed you have  answered in your opening comments, so we must be thinking alike.  But  the question essentially involved what initiatives after Labor Day  would be appropriate.  We know summertime is important.  Year-round  is even more important.  And what kind of initiatives at the federal  level might be proposed to meet the needs of the youth on a year- round basis?  And perhaps more importantly, how can families and the  local community be more involved using the federal initiative? That's  something that we believe is very important to success in this  effort.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Mr. President.              THE PRESIDENT:  I think I'll give everybody a chance to  answer the question, Bruce, but let me first thank you for calling,  and thank you for all the great work that you're doing in Austin.   I've seen some of it and I've always been very impressed.                First, with regard to the summer program, we hope we can  structure it in a way that will enable us to continue the summer  program and that will move a lot of these young people back into  schools under circumstances that might allow them to do some work in  the private sector, too.  We hope that -- Secretary Reich is going to  try to set up a system where we create a lot of private sector jobs  to be matched with the public sector jobs this summer.  And we're  working on that.              Secondly, in the program that I have presented to the  Congress over the next five years, what we are attempting to do is to  build in an amount of investment that's quite substantial for job  training programs, for school-to-work programs, all of which give  heavy, heavy weight to local community input -- just the question you  asked -- but do provide some federal investment dollars, which we  hope you can put with local dollars to keep people working and being  trained on a year-round basis.              And I will say again, to echo what Secretary Reich said  a moment ago, to try to break down the barrier between what is seen  as work and what is seen as learning.  An awful lot of young people  actually have quite high IQs, but actually learn so much better when  they're doing than when they're reading or just listening.  So we  hope that the community involvement part of it will be permanent, and  we hope that if the whole budget passes -- and we do have 200 budget  cuts and more than 200, actually, in the budget -- and some revenue  raisers, and some new money for education and training, that we'll be  able to do just what you seem to want based on your question.              Bob, do you want to say anything?              SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you took most of the words out  of my mouth, Mr. President, as usual.  But let me just add one thing,  and that is that one of the most important aspects of post-high  school for a lot of young people who are not going on to college, in  addition to the school-to-work program, simply is the availability of  jobs.  And we've got to get this economy moving again, obviously.   It's terribly important to get this recovery program, to get the  economy back on track.  That's sort of the prerequisite to everything  else.  If we don't get the economy back on track -- we have -- I  think this is the 16th -- correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. President -- I  think is the 16th month we have had seven percent unemployment or  greater.  This is a jobless recovery.  A lot of those kids are going  to be getting out of school in June.  And even if we did everything  right, they would have a very, very hard time getting jobs.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you both.  Of course, Goals 2000  will be a permanent, long-term thing that will certainly reach into  next year.  It will involve, if passed -- and we certainly hope it  will be -- action plans with every state where we can be working  together to reach for the goals in a number of different ways.  And  then the state, with all the various school districts, a very  important part of that will be citizen and parent involvement.  And I  think everybody will see a great energy out there, once we get that  moving.              The next call is Dr. Harry Heinemann, New York.                Doctor?              Q   Good evening, Mr. Secretary.  It is a pleasure to  be on with you this evening.  As you may know, bridging the school  and work has been central to La Guardia's educational program since  its inception in the 1970s, and that includes the college, the two  alternative high schools that operate on our campus, and the linkages  we have forged with the local schools.  We have found this to be an  extremely effective learning strategy.              And over the years, we've come to believe that there are  several principles that are very important in bridging the school and  work.  And these include integrating theory in the classroom with  practice in the workplace, with providing all students early exposure  to careers, as well as providing opportunities for them to reflect  upon these experiences while they strengthen their skills; and  lastly, the critical role of the liberal arts, particularly in the  development of high performance competencies.                My question, then is:  How can the general education  faculty and the academic curriculum be more closely integrated with  transition to work experience?  And what mechanisms and strategies  can you suggest to achieve this integration?              SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, thank you very much.  I think --  and we'll get a response from you all on that, and very interesting  work going on there.  We're going to have three people, our next  guests on the program this evening, that will be some specialists    in that area that you're speaking, and I'll certainly pass that on to  them and we can discuss it later.              You all care to comment -- any comments you might have?              THE PRESIDENT:  I'd just like to say, if I might, one  thing.  I want to reemphasize this and I don't think I'm being as  clear about it as I'd like, although I think at least one of the  people who will be on the second panel will be able to say it more  explicitly than I.  I think this whole concept of applied academics  is very important.  And I think that we have to basically abolish  what I consider to be a very artificial distinction between what is  vocational learning and what is academic learning.              I think we should keep the liberal arts going.  I think  we should have a strong component for people who are in the  vocational program.              SECRETARY REICH:  It seems to me that we also need to  rethink our entire tracking system, because a lot of these school and  work combinations are important for mainstream students.  They're  important for all students.  It's not just a special group of  students that needs them.              Some of the experiments that I've seen around the United  States -- Dick, I'm sure you've seen them as well -- are mainstream  experiments.  They're mainstreaming all the students.  At 11th and  12th grades they're giving them a combined work and school experience  and then a transition program.  And again, the kids can either go on  to college if they want; they can go on to technical community; they  can go on to an entirely -- a large variety of possibilities and  career directions.              But we have to get away from the stigmatizing that often  goes on with young people who simply are doing job-related or work- related work within the classroom, within our schools.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you, very much.  I think that's  going to be the last call that we have time for.  Mr. President, I  think you've got to move on to another matter, and I want to thank  you and Secretary Reich for being here.  We appreciate your time and  your ideas, and it's been a tremendous help to us.  \",\"I see that our retarded translator, David, is still writing things that don't make sense.

I agree completely. One thing I can't stand about the Mac interface is its shear determination to FORCE you to use the mouse(what if your mouse breaks--your whole system is down!).  I like the mouse--it is handy on some occassions such as cut and past and moving icons around, etc.  But for most work, the keyboard and hot keys are 10-20 times faster than using the mouse. Sure it is a plus to be able to do something simple if you are an inexperienced user, but how long is it before your are experienced? A month? Two? (Speaking of PCs at the moment.)  I don't think it is too much to ask that window programmers provide not only a menu/mouse interface but also look forward to those who would like to move on to hot keys and command line interfaces, which usually allows you to do more in less time IF you are experienced.

I pointed out that I did, in fact, agree that both Robert Weiss and Jim Meritt took quotes out of context.  Hence, I find it difficult to understand why Jim thinks I am a hypocrite.  Needless to say, I don't have time to reply to *every* article on t.r.m. that takes a quote out of context.    I asked Jim the following:  Jim replied by saying   But today we find four articles from Jim, one of which has the subject \\\"Silence is concurrence\\\":     Which is, of course, a complete red herring.  Taking quotes out of context isn't a crime.  I don't have time to read every article on t.r.m., and I'm certainly under no obligation to reply to them all.  Does \\\"silence is concurrence\\\" imply that Jim thinks that because I didn't respond to Weiss' articles I must condone Weiss' taking quotes out of context?  Jim doesn't want to give a direct answer to this question; read what he has written and decide for yourself.   But back to the context of my conversation with Jim.  Jim's next  gambit was to claim that he was using inductive logic when he concluded that I was being a hypocrite.  I challenged him to provide the details of that logic that led him to an incorrect conclusion. Today we find another obscure article (posting it twice didn't help make it more clear, Jim), titled \\\"Inductive Logic\\\":   More red herrings.  Could Jim mean that he has read an uncountably large number of my articles?  Could Jim mean that because I \\\"axed\\\" his articles, but not Weiss' articles, he wants to conclude inductively ... Well, I can't see where he is going with this.  But I can help him with his induction.  I've written roughly 80 articles since January.  The vast majority of them are discussions with Frank DeCenso and other inerrantists, where I take the position that they are making bad arguments.  Some are discussions with Jim Meritt where I take the position that he is making bad arguments (a straw man argument earlier, and taking quotes out of context more recently.)  Think hard about this Jim.  See the pattern?  Think harder.  Run it through your induction engine and see what pops out.  \",\"Here is a press release from the White House.   Remarks by President Clinton to NCAA Division I Champion Hockey Team April 19; Q&A Following  To: National Desk  Contact: White House Office of the Press Secretary, 202-456-2100     WASHINGTON, April 19 -- Following is a transcript of remarks by President Clinton to the University of Maine \\\"Black Bears\\\" NCAA Division I hockey champions:                             The Rose Garden   9:58 A.M. EDT       THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning ladies and gentlemen.  It's an honor for me to welcome the University of Maine Black Bears, the winner of the NCAA Division I hockey national championship to the Rose Garden and the White House.  I understand from Senator Mitchell that this is the first team from the University of Maine every to win a national championship.  And we're glad to have them here.       I'm inspired not only by how the team pulled together to win the championship, but how the entire state pulled together to cheer them onto victory.       Coming from a state that is also relatively small in size, but also filled with pride and tradition and community, I can understand how the people of Maine must feel about the Black Bears. In our state people are still talking about the time we won the Orange Bowl over the number one ranked football team, and that was back in 1978.  I'm sure that 15 years from now, the people of Maine will as proud of this team as they are today.       You know, in my state football is a slightly more popular sport than hockey.  We don't have a lot of ice.  (Laughter.) But after spending three months getting banged around in this town, I can understand a little more about hockey than I did before I came here.  Hockey is a tough game.  It's a hard-hitting sport.  It does have one virtue though, there's a penalty for delay of game.  I wish we had that rule in the Senate.  (Laughter.)       In government as in hockey, leadership is important.  In the United States Senate, our team has a great captain, the Majority Leader and the senior Senator from Maine, George Mitchell; junior Senator -- Cohen looks so young, I can't imagine.  (Laughter.)  I'm actually bitter about Senator Cohen because he looks so much younger than me.       On your hockey team, the captain Jim Montgomery has done a great job.  He scored the winning goal late in the championship game, leading you to a come-from-behind victory -- something else I know a little bit about.       Sport brings out the best in individuals and in teams and in communities.  I share the pride that Senator Mitchell and Senator Cohen and Congressman Andrews and all the people of Maine must feel for the Black Bears who have shown us all how to play as a team, how to bring out the best in one another, and how to come from behind.       I think it's important, as I ask young people from around America who have achieved outstanding things in working together, to come here to the White House to be recognized and appreciated by their country, to remember that those kinds of values and those kinds of virtues need to be ingrained in all of us for all of our lives.       We now have another role model, and I'm glad to have them here today.  (Applause.)       (The President is presented with team jersey.) (Applause.)       THE PRESIDENT:  That's great.  I love it.  It's beautiful. (Applause.)       (The President is presented with an autographed stick.)       THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  That's great.  (Applause.)                               * * * * * *       Q  Mr. President, did you authorize the move on Waco this morning, sir?       THE PRESIDENT:  I was aware of it.  I think the Attorney General made the decision.  And I think I should refer all questions to her and to the FBI.       Q  Did you have any instructions for her as to how it should be executed?       THE PRESIDENT:  No, they made the tactical decisions. That was their judgment, the FBI.       Q  Is this a raid?       THE PRESIDENT:  And I will -- I want to refer you to -- talk to the Attorney General and the FBI.  I knew it was going to be done, but the decisions were entirely theirs, all the tactical decisions.       Q  What did you and Senator Mitchell talk about this morning?       Q  Any chance for that stimulus package?       THE PRESIDENT:  Senator Mitchell ought to pay my quarter.  (Laughter.)  I was in there -- (laughter).       SENATOR MITCHELL:  You have to pay that quarter.       THE PRESIDENT:  I was ready.  (Laughter.)  Senator Mitchell, he's worth a quarter any day.       Q  Any chance for your bill, sir?       THE PRESIDENT:  We talked about what was going to happen this week in the Senate and about what other meetings we're going to have for the rest of the week.  We only had about five minutes to talk.  And we agreed we'd get back together later, around noon, and talk some more.       Q  Senator Dole said over the weekend that your compromise is no compromise.       THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I know he did, but, look, Senator Dole and a lot of the other Republicans now in the Senate voted for the same kind of thing for Ronald Reagan in 1983; and our research indicates that a majority of them over time voted for a total of 28 emergency spending measures totalling over $100 billion when Reagan and Bush were President, in those administrations.  And many of those purposes were not nearly as worthy as putting the American people back to work.  I don't want to go back and revisit every one, but you   can do it.  You can look at the research there.  So this position they're taking is not credible.  We have a very tough five-year deficit reduction plan.  All these costs are covered during that time and then some.  And the very people that are saying this has all got to be paid for don't have much of a history on which to base their position.  They've got 12 years of vote for stimulus measures of this kind that had very little to with putting the American people back to work.  So I think we've got a chance to work it out, and I'm hopeful. We'll see what happens today and tomorrow.  I'm feeling pretty good about it.       THE PRESS:  Thank you                                   END       10:10 A.M.

So, has nay of you heard of a computer called the Connection Machine.  If so, could you e-mail me any and all info you have,  eg- references, ideas etc.   All help is appreciated.     Caviar Dreams  L.Cause \",\"A very kind soul has mailed me this reply for the bugs in CView. Since he isn't in the position to post this himself, he asked me to post it for him, but to leave his name out. So here it comes:  CView has quite a number of bugs.  The one you mention is perhaps the most annoying, but not the most dangerous.  As far as I can determine, it has to do with the temp files that CView creates.  CView gives the user no control over where it places its temp files: it just places them in its \\\"current directory\\\".  The problem you mention occurs (as far as I can tell) when it runs out of disk space for its temp files. It seems as if CView doesn't check properly for this situation.  As Cview decodes a jpeg, it seems  to write out a temp file with all the pixel data with 24 bit colour information. Then, for 8 bit displays, it does the \\\"dithering\\\", again writing another file with the 8 bit colour information.  While it is writing this second file, it also writes the data to your colour card. Then when it does the last chunk of 8 bit data, it recopies all the data from the 8 bit file to your screen again.  (It does this last \\\"recopy\\\" operation for its \\\"fit to screen\\\" feature, even when this feature is not enabled.)   The result of this process is the following:         1) If it runs out of disk space when writing the first 24 bit file, all         you ever see is as much data as it has room for, and the last bit of         data is simply repeated over and over again because CView never         realizes the disk has filled up and disk writes/reads aren't performed.       2) If it has enough room for the 24 bit data, but runs out of room for         the 8 bit data, you see almost all of the picture as it does the         dithering and writes to the screen card.         However, then when it finishes the dithering and recopies the data         from the 8 bit file to screen (for whatever reason it does this)         one again just gets a repetition of the last chunk of data for which         there was room on the disk.  This is just a guess, but probably fairly accurate.  At least the general idea is on track I think, although I have probably made errors in details about file I/O etc.  The way around this is  of course to clear up sufficient disk space.  The temp files for large JPEG's (1200x900 and bigger) can be very large (3 Meg + 1 Meg ).  On some of the largest I have needed in excess of 6 Meg free disk space.   CView has a much more serious bug: if you are trying to display a file from a floppy, and you change floppies while CView has some temp file open on the floppy, then CView in certain circumstances will write the directory (and FAT table? I can't remember) for the removed floppy onto the newly inserted floppy, thus corruptimg the new floppy in a very serious, possibly unrevcoverable way.  SO BE CAREFUL!  It is incredibly poor programming for a program to do this.  On the other hand, when choosing files in the Open Files menu, CView insists on doing a few disk reads every time one moves the hi-lighter square.  Incredibly annoying when it could do them all at once when it gets the directory info.  And really, how much effort does it take to sort a directory listing? \",\"  How many NuBus slots do you have?  Applied Engineering has something called the QuadraLink, which is a card with 4 serial ports that you get at through the comms toolbox (in addition to the built-in ones) It also comes with software for fooling applications to open an AE port when they think they open a built-in port.  They also have a more expensive card with DMA (better performance) and I _think_ they, or someone else, have a card that handles 8 ports simultaneously.  As I said, with NuBus, you're green.

As published in \\\"US Industrial Outlook 1993\\\"  (which was released in January), revenues from the 1993 US space  business are currently projected to be about $4,890 M.     In contrast to previous years when US commercial space sales had  shown double digits growth rates, this year's projected results are  driven by the US satellite manufacturing industry, where sales are  projected to drop from 12 satellites worth $1,300 M in 1992 to 7  satellites worth $ 670 M in 1993.  The US Industrial Outlook also  projects U.S. commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year,  and while predicting that 1993 revenues will increase 10 percent to  $450 M, future sales will be \\\"adversely affected by the downward  revision in Department of Defense launch plans.\\\"                               Offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries,  revenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to  increase to $1,900 M, primarily driven by increased revenues from  broadcast and cable TV networks.  Similarly, remote sensing products  and sales are projected to increase to $250 M in 1993 (up 15%).

In general, not a bad  report -- with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite  manufacturing area.  There, changes of only a few satellites worth  $100 M or so apiece can substantially influence the annual  projection.  If we look forward over several years, this market  sector should retain strong sales as US firms have been very  successful in regaining international market share in the satellite  business.     Furthermore, sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in  the next revision of this data, expected to be released about mid- year.  Data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales (including  such items as GPS receivers and portable satellite terminals)  appears to be missing from the January data set.  DoC usually  publishes a listing of  \\\"Space Business Indicators\\\" in mid-year, and  the next revision of commercial space revenues should be released  then.  I expect the revised revenues should easily top $5,000 M, if  the mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the  numbers, and the year should show about a 10% overall market growth.     Looking beyond this year's data, future markets look quite  promising.  The DoC projects satellite service revenues could top  $3,000 M by 1995 if new mobile satellite services and direct  broadcasting are implemented as planned, and that mobile satellite  station sales are expected to continue to growth at 15-20 % per year  through the mid 1990's.  My numbers are somewhat more pessimistic  for near-term market growth, but I agree the trend should be for  substantial growth in US commercial space sales over at least the  next 5-10 years.  (My pessimism is due to more conservative  assumptions on market capture and growth in LEO communications and  satellite direct broadcasting services.  I don't believe all of the  current players in the yet-to-be-born LEO communications satellite  market and in the yet-to-be-proven direct broadcasting market will  be financial successes, nor that sales growth will be as explosive  as currently projected.)     It should also be noted this year's DoC data is the first  release to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research  facilities.  The $60 M shown in the Janurary data is primarily for  the Spacehab module, planned for launch in April on the Space  Shuttle, but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first  sales from the COMET orbital launch and recovery experiment module.]   2- DELTA WINS TWO KEY LAUNCH CONTRACTS    McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which builds and markets the Delta  launch vehicle has won two important launch contracts.  Motorola  Inc. announced in mid February that it had selected the Delta to  launch most of the satellites in the 66-satellite Iridium LEO  communications constellation, and in mid April, McDonnell Douglas  was awarded the USAF Medium Launch Vehicle III contract.     The launch services contract with Motorola for the Iridium  constellation launch is for at launch of least 45 Iridium  satellites.  Another 21 satellites have been contracted to be  launched by Khrunichev Enterprise in Russian on 3 Proton vehicle  launches.  These 45 satellites planned for the Delta will be  launched 5 at a time,  providing for at least 9 launches.   Additional satellites in the Iridium constellation, such as a  planned on-orbit spares, may also be launched on Delta.  Although  details of the launch services contract were reported to be  negotiation, and not yet final.     The USAF MLV contract also went to MDC, bidding a variant of  their Delta II launcher.  This contract is only initially worth $7.5  million, but establishes a set of launch options for up to 36  launches, encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002.  These  launches will deploy the next generation of the USAF's Global  Positioning System Block IIR navigation satellites, plus other  programs.  First option for to meet the USAF launch options is  expected to be exercised this year, after which the USAF is expected  to request launches of up to 6 Deltas per year for at least 6 years.   Under this contract the USAF can also request \\\"launch on demand\\\"  services from MDC for the 1996-2002 time period, with a launch to  occur within 40 days of the request.      [Commentary:  If these two contracts are fulfilled, they should  provide an excellent business base for MDC's Delta launch program  through the turn of the century.  Combined, these two contracts have  a potential for about 45 launches, worth about $2,200 M to MDC, and  sustaining a core business base of $300-400 M/year.  Other contracts  for international and commercial payloads, as well as for NASA  Medium ELV-class payloads, will add to this business base -- keeping  MDC as a viable commerical launch company.      However, it should be noted there are risk elements in these  contracts.  Motorola's Iridium LEO communications constellation has  not yet received a US Federal Communications Commission license for  operation in the U.S., nor has Motorola lined up all the financing  and financial partners for the Iridium venture.  Without these  approvals or financial backing there will be no Iridium launches.   But, hopefully, these uncertainties will be settled this year.     Similarly, the USAF MLV III program has been the target of  several Congressional actions which have slowed the production of  the GPS Block IIR satellites and deleted the funding for the MLV III  program in favor of the USAF NLS/\\\"Spacelifter\\\" program.  At this  time, while it appears the MLV III contract will be executed, future  funding for the MLV III and other USAF commercial launch contracts  is being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy  reviews.  Some opinions expressed from within the Administration and  Congress propose cancellation of all \\\"ELV upgrade\\\" programs  (including the MLV programs) in favor of the proposed \\\"Spacelifter\\\"  program.  Such opinions may have some weight in this year's budget  deliberations, particularly as DoD funds will be more difficult to  find in the shrinking US Defense budget.]    3- COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING VENTURE GETS DOC \\\"GO-AHEAD\\\"    The first commercial license to operate a remote sensing  satellite was approved in early February by the US Department of  Commerce's Office of Space Commerce.  A license was granted to  WorldView Imaging Corporation of Oakland, California to build and  operate a pair of LEO imaging satellites to provide multi-spectral  images of the Earth.     [Commentary:  There has been little data released on this venture  by WorldView and the DoC, other than the announcement of the  operating and construction license.  This was reported to be at the  request of WorldView.  Most industry speculation identifies this new  venture as a \\\"Star Wars\\\" spinoff, using SDI-type technology to  provide digital Earth sensing data, and heavily integrated into  digital GIS databases for remote sensing/GIS users.  Most probable  customers for this service include exploration geologists,  agricultural planners, and urban planners.      It is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the  1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act.  The Act, as passed last  November, provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote  sensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices.  Prior to  this act, remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to  all users at the same prices, and private remote sensing ventures  would have had to sell at the government-set Landsat data prices.     There are rumors of several other potential commercial remote  sensing ventures working their way through the system at different  stages of development.  I think the large Landsat and SPOT satellite  systems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing  data market for the next decade or so.  In contrast to these large,  government-sponsored remote sensing systems, smaller market ventures  such as WorldView and others can exploit market niches and use  innovative technology, and I believe, can find profitability on the  margin.  I predict there may be some very interesting ventures  appearing in the next year or so.]                    4- INVESTMENT FIRM CALLS GD'S SPACE BIZ \\\"STILL A GOOD INVESTMENT\\\"     Wall Street investment house Morgan Stanley thinks General  Dynamic's Space Systems Division could still be a moneymaker,  despite having failed in the last 3 Atlas launches.  In a recent  analyst's report Morgan Stanley said \\\"We are more than ever  convinced that if the company can return the Atlas to its historical  95%-plus success rate, this will become a highly profitable, cash- generating unit.\\\"  Based upon discussions with GD's corporate  management, Morgan Stanley projects that if the Atlas problems are  cleared up the unit could see $70 M in earnings per year by 1995 and  $100 M per year by 2000.  This is based upon GD's projection of  capturing about 10 Atlas launches per year on the world market.     [Commentary:  Three failures in a row of their launch system has  hurt General Dynamic's Space Systems Division.  Since GD has  restructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses,  many market pundits have been speculating GD's space business might  be next to be sold.  The Morgan Stanley report indicates GD's Space  Systems Division has some potential as a moneymaker, despite current  problems -- if they can get their act together.  Sales are projected  to be about $560 M in 1993, which will probably generate a loss of  about $25 M.  If GD can capture their projected share of the space  launch market, and if they have managed to clean up the reliability  of their Atlas launchers, then they could generate healthy profits  from those sales.  But until they demonstrate the Atlas Centaur  program is back on track, this division will continue to show  substantial losses.     In response to the sell-off rumors, in my opinion, this operation  is not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability.   To do such a takeover, the current set corporate and divisional  management would be replaced with another set from outside the firm.   In GD SSD's case, to get the division back on track, the management  team will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with  the Atlas Centaur, as well as in selling Atlas services.  This would  indicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch  operations could find such talent in-house, and be able to convince  customers to buy their launch services.  Optimally, the firm would  have substantial liquid rocket experience, and experience in  marketing space technology internationally as well.  Candidates for  this might be TRW, Rockwell, Lockheed, and Martin, and possibly  McDonnell Douglas and Boeing.  But most of those firms have cash  flow problems (MDC), have had a substantial business contraction  (Boeing and MDC), are involved with other launch firms (Lockheed),  or have taken on substantial debt (Martin).  And coming up with the  $700-1500 M purchase price for the division is a big chunk of  change for any company.]    5 - ARIANE PREDICTS DIP IN LAUNCH DEMAND    Arianespace, the operator of the Ariane launch system, is  projecting a dip in launch demand in the late 1990's.  In early  February, Arianespace released their annual market survey, which  detailed their projection of the space transportation market for the  next decade.     Over short run, Arianespace expects to retain their dominant  position and sustain a majority share of the launch market.  Of 54  international and commercial launches planned through 1995, Ariane  holds contracts for 31, General Dynamics' Atlas vehicle holds 14  contracts, McDonnell Douglas' Delta holds 7, and Great Wall's Long  March vehicle holds 2 launch contracts.     Three-quarters of future launch contracts for which Ariane can  compete are projected to come from communications satellites with  the remaining 25% split between weather, Earth observation, and  scientific satellites.  Most of the future telecommunications demand  growth is predicted to come from the Asia/Pacific region.     Arianespace expects the current market consolidation of  individual satellite operators into regional or national groups will  continue, with these groups investing in heavier satellites with  larger communications payloads carrying more transponders.  Arianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications  satellites should increase by 20 % over today's average level, to  about 3000 kg in GEO.     Demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain  strong over the next three years, but in the second half of the  decade, Arianespace predicts demand will decrease.  Arianespace  bases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder  demand and supply,  particularly as new data compression techniques  appear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing  or near-term transponders.     One of the significant possible changes in the market was  identified as the arrival of new launch vehicles, including Russian  launch systems.  But Arianespace predicts that in the long term,  investors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade  off between launch service quality and price, and that Russian and  other new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities  and service quality, and their market penetration will be minimal.     [Commentary:  Ariane releases their market surveys annually, and  I reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of CSN/STI.   Comparing the two surveys, there aren't outstanding differences in  the numbers.   The most notable change is the consideration of new  data compression techniques, reducing the demand for new physical  transponders on orbit.    I note that in contrast to some predictions, demand for space- based communications transponders appears to be remain strong. While  fiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the  established point-to-point telecommunications markets, growing  demand for telecommunications services world wide and for point-to- multipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space  transponder demand.  Fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability  service, but only from established point A to established point B.  To establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable  between the points, and while there are improved network solutions,  installing a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost  millions or billions of dollars.      For broadcast services where there is not an existing ground  network structure, satellites still offer the most cost effective  solution.  And if new services are required into a new region, it is  cheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of  thousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite  network.  This allows rapid growth of new satellite services, and  has kept demand high.  The replacement market for fiberoptics is  growing as well, since as demand grows between the points serviced,  it becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to  handle the increase in traffic.     Since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still  growing rapidly, satellite market projections remain rosy.  But  satellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes.  Current  generation satellites are now getting guarantees of at 15 years of  on-orbit service or more, in contrast to 10 years of service from  last generation's satellites.  This has cut back some of the launch  demand, as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite  launches over longer intervals.     And as last note; Arianespace didn't flag it this year, but it  looks like the space transportation market will be rather over- supplied by existing launch systems in the near term.  The annual  commercial launch demand is for about 15-20 medium sized satellites  per year.  From the supply side, Ariane is capable of launching up  to about a dozen medium sized satellites a year, Delta is capable of  about 9-12 per year, Atlas is capable of 6-12, Long March 4-8,  Japan's H-Vehicle 2-4, Russia's Proton capable of 8, and other  systems such as Zenit and Soyuz another 10-20 medium launches per  year.  That's a lot of capability for a small market.     We can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial  launches.]  6- NTSB INVESTIGATES PEGASUS LAUNCH OVER ABORTED ABORT     The 9 Feb Pegasus launch by Orbital Sciences Corporation has  spawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety  rules.  A valid abort order from a NASA range safety officer to halt  the mission was overridden and the Pegasus was launched in violation  of range safety rules.      In the last few minutes of the Pegasus launch countdown, one of  two abort command receivers aboard the Pegasus failed.  Such a failure  typically scrubs a launch,and a NASA range safety officer at  Wallops Island, VA issued a mission abort order about a minute  before the scheduled Pegasus launch.  Somehow this command was  overridden by the OSC launch team or the message was lost in the  communications channels, and the Pegasus was launched despite the  valid abort call.     Fortunately, the Pegasus functioned as expected, and the abort  command receiver was not needed.  But this incident did spark an  investigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed-to  launch constraint rules, and was not obeyed.     Leading the investigation is the National Transportation Safety  Board (NTSB) with support from NASA, OSC, and the Air Force.  This  investigation marks the first time NTSB has taken the lead on an  incident involving a space launch.  According to the NTSB, their  investigation will take about 6 months, and is primarily looking at  lines of authority, communications links and safety procedures used  in the launch.    [Commentary: This is the first time that the NTSB has led an  investigation into a space launch.  Their leadership was requested  by the Department of Commerce's Office of Commercial Space  Transportation, who had licensed the commercial launch.      At the time of writing this column, some of the initial  investigations have been concluded, and some of the results are  starting to leak out into the trade press.  Apparently, 3 or four  different communications channels were in use during the test. After  the abort destruct receiver stopped responding, the NASA test  director and range controller in the Mission Control room at Wallops  Island gave abort orders about a minute before the launch.   According to the mission rules, this should have stopped the launch.  Somehow, the OSC test conductor ordered the abort reversed, and the  NASA communicator on the net relayed that order to the B-52 carrying  the Pegasus at about 22 seconds before launch.  Differing  explainations of exactly how this happened are proposed -- with the  best set being that clear lines of communications and clear  definition of the responsibilities of the mission control team, and  understanding of the mission rules were not established before the  launch.      As we see more and more commercial launches, more of these  procedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved.    This case is interesting because it is the first time the NTSB has  been called in to investigate a commercial launch problem (as they  do with commercial aircraft problems).      I think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with  procedures and communications, and will be cleared up with issuance  of guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how  specific lines of authority should be delineated.]   7- ANOTHER PEGASUS COMPETITOR IS ANNOUNCED    Tsniimach Enterprise in Russia announced it is marketing a new  small space launch system, based upon converted ICBM components.   Two versions of the launcher are being marketed: the \\\"Aerokosmos\\\"  winged vehicle launched like the OSC Pegasus, and the \\\"Severkosmos\\\",  launched from a mobile ground transporter.  The Aerokosmos is  projected to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to  an 800 km circular orbit, and the Severkosmos to be capable of 430  kg to 200 km orbits and 225 kg to 800 km.  Also proposed to be used  with these launch systems is a LEO data relay system called  'Sineva'.  Tsniimach Enterprise is described as a ex-military  establishment, focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of  spacecraft and which has participated in the development of the  Buran shuttle system,  They are located near the NPO Energia  facility in Kaliningrad, outside of Moscow.     [Commentary: There's very little released information on this new  venture.  My suspicion is it is another Russian enterprise looking  for hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in-house  knowledge of ex-Soviet launch systems.  It adds to the list of numerous  commercial space startups announced from the ex-Soviet Union.     This one's a little different in that they are offering variants  of ex-Soviet ICBMs, but I can't identify any key customers being  targeted or substantial financial backing.]  8- GEORGIA LAUNCH SITE DROPPED FROM PLANNING    In late January, Georgia Tech Research Institute released the  results of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial  rocket launching site in Camden County, Georgia at the old Kingsland  Missile Test Launching Site on the Atlantic coast.  The preliminary  study recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch  site, stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected  low investment returns, plus environmental and other geographic  considerations.  However, the report did say the site might be ideal  for other aerospace uses, and recommended other potential uses.     [Commentary:  This should put the nails in the coffin of the  Kingsland Commercial Launch Site.  While other sites are still  proceeding with commercial launch site development plans, Kingsland  found without a key customer to act as anchor tenant, and if  substantial infrastructure had to be put in, then the expected  returns were too low to justify the cost of development.      This might point out some key discriminators in judging the  feasibility of a commercial launch site.  These include:   - Is there an identified key customer to provide core usage  sufficient to recover setup costs?   - Is there a market advantage of using the site?   - Can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site?   - Can financing be found at low enough cost to support the  investment?      Other commercial launch site ventures -- including those at  Woomera, Poker Flat, Cape York, White Sands, Alabama Off-Shore  Platform, Hawaii, and Vandenberg have to also be judged against  these criteria.  In my opinion, some of these ventures are flying  on hope and speculation, and not on sound financial grounds.]  9- SPAIN'S CAPRICORNIA LAUNCHER STILL PROCEEDING    In one of his last official acts, former President Bush  authorized space technology transfer for several joint space  ventures between US and other firms.  One of these was a proposed  use of US technology by Spain to build a small booster.  With that  regulatory impediment removed, the 3-stage Capricornia launch  vehicle will start development later this year, planning for a first  launch in the 1995/96 time period.  The Capricornia is described as  a small 3-stage all solid booster designed to put 250-500 Kg into  LEO.  Several launch sites are being examined for the system,  including 2 on the Iberian peninsula and 1 on the Canary Islands.   Originated by INTA in Spain, the project reports it has $ 30 M in  development funding, and will use technology from Argentina's Condor  launch vehicle as well as from the US.     [Commentary:  Several firms have identified a market opportunity  in providing a small launcher for the European market.  Small  payloads from European firms or organizations currently use either  Ariane piggyback launches or the US/Italian Scout launcher.   However, Ariane piggyback opportunities are limited, and the Scout  program is being phased out (accompanied by some disarray in the  Italian government and space industry regarding any follow-on  system).      This has left an apparent niche for a new European small launch  system.  Surprisingly enough, ESA has not supported development of  such a system within the current space funding structure.  Studies  have been performed by British Aerospace, Aerospatiale, Deutsche  Aerospace, and Italian organizations, but with the exception of the  Swedish/PacAstro system (reported below), I have not been able to  find any other European development work with even a rumor of  funding for hardware.     Also of interest is the linking of the Capricornia to the  Argentinian Condor launcher.  There have been some interesting  rumors surfacing out of Argentina over the past year about a space  launcher/IRBM program funded under the military junta which ruled  the country in the 1970's and early 1980's.     What is known is in Feb 1992, the Argentinian Air Force formally  transferred control of the Condor 2 missile program to the new  civilian Argentinian national space agency (Comison Nacional de  Atividades Espaciales - CNAE).  The Condor 2 program was described  as originating in 1983, expanding upon the smaller Condor 1 rocket  program in collaboration with Egypt and with support of German  firms.  The Condor 2 was also reportedly funded indirectly by Iraq  in the mid-1980's.  Fairly large solid rocket motors were built and  tested, but Argentinan development of a suitable guidance package  lagged that of the propulsion system.     It should be noted CNAE is planning to launch its first  scientific satellite in late 1994.  The US$ 9 M, 181 Kg, SAC-B  satellite will study the Earth's upper atmosphere and includes  cooperative experiments from Italy and the US. No launch vehicle has  yet been selected, but OSC's Pegasus and the Russian Burlak Air  launched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this  contract.]   10- PACASTRO SIGNS LAUNCH RESERVATION WITH SWEDISH SPACE CORP    PacAstro, a small launch firm in Herndon, Virginia announced in  late February it had received a $6 M launch reservation contract  from the Swedish Space Corp to launch a satellite on PacAstro's PA-2  launch vehicle.   This will be performed as part of the Polar  Satellite Service (PSS), a joint Norwegian Space Center/ Swedish  Space Corp. program to upgrade the Andoya Rocket Range in Norway and  offering small satellite launches into the polar regions.  According  to PacAstro, PSS is also performing an $8 M upgrade of the Andoya  launch facilities, including a new integration facility and a fully- enclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like  the PacAstro PA-2.  PacAstro has been chosen as \\\"the main  alternative rocket supplier\\\" for the small satellite launch service  to be offered by PSS from Andoya.  The date of the launch of the  Swedish satellite was not specified.     [Commentary:  PacAstro has been trying to line up customers and  funding for their launch vehicle for some time now.  The PA-2 is a  small, two stage rocket fueled by RP-1 and Liquid Oxygen.  From  PacAstro's literature, the engines designed for the PA-series  rockets are built of \\\"off the shelf\\\" components based upon the Lunar  MOdule Descent Engines built by TRW, and are capable of putting a  225 Kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit.      PacAstro is trying to arrange construction financing for its  first three PA-2 vehicles, with a first launch planned for 1995, and  2 orbital launches planned for 1996.  My records show PacAstro hired  TRW to provide marketing support and systems design,  with primary  engineering to be done by AeroAstro, a small satellite builder  closely associated with PacAstro (headquartered in the same  building).  The Swedish Space Corporation would supply engineering,  launch operations, vehicle subsystems, and marketing support.  Sumitomo Corp. of Tokyo, is a first round investor and sits on the  board of directors.      PacAstro has gotten a first round financial package of at least  $550 K  (Some sources place this of high as $1 M), but has been  searching for about a year for the additional $20-30 M needed to  design, build and launch their first set of vehicles.     The launch reservation from SSC can possibly be used to help  bring some investors on board, but by my estimate, they will need  much more than the single $6 M sale to put their venture into real  hardware.]   11- CHINA AND TAIWAN JOINT SATELLITE VENTURE REPORTED     In early March, it was reported a joint satellite communications  venture between a Taiwanese and mainland Chinese was in the works.   As reported in the Taipei press, China Development Corp. (CDC),  headquartered in Taiwam and with links to the ruling Nationalist  Party, is planning to set up a joint venture in Hong Kong with China  Great Wall Industry Corp. with the objective of launching a regional  communications satellite. CDC would cover about 10% of the satellite  system cost (US $10 M) in exchange for rights to 10% of the  satellite's communications channels.      [Commentary:  This announcement came close on the heels of the  release of Taiwanese plans for space development (released in mid  January).   In those plans, the National Space Program Office of  Taiwan will launch 3 satellites, starting with ROCSAT-1, a 400 Kg  scientific spacecraft, planned for launch in 1997.  Two additional  satellites are planned, both communications satellites.   TRW has  been helping Taiwan plan this program, budgeted at T$13.6 B (US $530  M) through 2006.      I haven't been able to establish any relationship between this  venture and those of the NSPOT, but there might be a connection.   While Taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures, the  current Taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two  separate sastellite ventures.     The reported name for the Tiawanese/Chinese system is \\\"Asiasat- 2\\\", but I don't thinks this has any relationship with the existing  Hong Kong-based \\\"Asiasat\\\" program involving Chinese, Hong Kong, and  other Asian investors, other than using it as an organizational  model.  There are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing  venture -- it could provide excellent first-hand experience to  Taiwan for a very low cost, which then can be used in later  satellite ventures.  But there are internal political issues between  Taiwanese and Chinese ventures, but putting any joint venture  through a  Hong Kong intermediary corporation might allow it to  proceed.     In any case, the East Asian satellite market is lighting up with  substantially growth projected in space services and revenues.  This  is just another indicator to add to the list.]   12- SOUTH KOREA ANNOUNCES NATIONAL MOVE INTO SPACE TECHNOLOGIES    South Korea's Trade, Industry and Resources Ministry recently  announced plans to invest US$22 B in research and development and  another US$17 B into manufacturing and research facilities for  advanced aerospace technologies.  Space technologies have been  specifically targeted as part of this program, beginning with  manufacture and launch of an advanced multi-purpose satellite by  1997.  The objective of this investment is to raise South Korea's  aerospace technology to the level of the world's top 10 countries by  2000.                                     [Commentary: South Korea has been quietly working to develop its  national aerospace industry, specifically including space  activities. I'm noting this as a flag that potential new players are  coming into the commercial space market.     As part of their national effort, 2 national telecommunications  satellites for Korea Telecom will be launched in April and Oct 1995  on Delta. Designated Koreasat 1 and 2, the platforms will provide  television and telephone service throughout the Korean Peninsula,  southwestern Japan and portions of China bordering North Korea.     South Korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on  Ariane in Aug 1992, called Uribyol-1 (Our Star) and costing about US  $8.8 M.  Uribyol-2 is planned for piggyback launch in October of  this year, again on Ariane, and will be entirely \\\"made in Korea.\\\"   Uribyol-3, projected for a 1995 launch, will be an environment- monitoring micro-satellite.     This satellite may be the precursor to a series of small Earth  observation satellites,  The KEOS (Korean Earth Observation System)  project, which has been submitted for approval to the South Korean  government, would use two or three 300-kg spacecraft equipped with  optical and microwave sensors.    South Korean press reports claim there is also a parallel  military effort to establish the capabilities for building and  launching small military satellites by 2001.  Supposedly a  government panel had been established to oversee such an effort,  funded at US $ 500 M between 1993 and 2001, in anticipation of an   expected pullout of U.S. intelligence-gathering systems from the  Korean peninsula.           In conjunction with all of these reported efforts, South Korean  is also pursuing production work either as off-sets to existing  aerospace technology contracts (for example, McDonnell Douglas is  offsetting production of some Delta parts to South Korean firms as  part of the Koreasat launch contracts), or for production of  consumer space items (among other products, South Korea exports  satellite receiver television setups to Japan, and Samsung has  announced teaming for production of OSC's Orbcomm user terminals.).      This looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies.   Considering that East Asia is currently the fastest growing sector  for commercial space services (primarily for telecommunications), a  South Korean push into space technologies may change the composition  of commercial space market there over the next decade.]   13- SPACE TECHNOLOGY INDEXES THROUGH MARCH    As announced in the last CSN/STI, each issue will give the  results of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and  investments.  The table below summarizes results to the end of  March.  The Space Technology Index did quite a bit better than the  market as a whole, as represented by the S&P 500 index.  Since 90+%  of the values included in the index are US firms, this represents a  general increase in the market value of space-related firms.  The  increase in the first quarter is more than in all of 1992 -- which  is a very promising sign, although future months may reverse this  trend. The Commercial Space Technology Index has also done quite  well, but the Pure Play portfolio -- consisting of stocks of firms  which are pure plays in space technologies -- has also surpassed its  results in all of 1993.  We'll keep an eye on these ....

As for Pilon, he can't carry the puck out to center ice by himself. He either makes a bad pass resulting in a turnover, or he attempts to bring the puck  towards the neutral zone and skates right into an opposing skater. He can't stay on his skates with most forwards or centers. He either falls down or  committs a penalty. Call up somebody from Capital District AL!!!!!

Have any of you read Tony Campollo's book- liar,  ->lunatic, or the real thing?  (I might be a little off on the title, but he  ->writes the book.  Anyway he was part of an effort to destroy Christianity,  ->in the process he became a Christian himself.  Sounds like you are saying he was a part of some conspiracy.  Just what organization did he  belong to? Does it have a name?  -> The book says that Jesus was either a liar, or he was crazy ( a  ->modern day Koresh) or he was actually who he said he was.  Logic alert - artificial trifercation.  The are many other possible explainations.  Could have been that he never existed.  There have been some good points made in this group that is not  impossible  that JC is an amalgam of a number of different myths, Mithra comes to mind.  -> Some reasons why he wouldn't be a liar are as follows.  Who would  ->die for a lie?  Wouldn't people be able to tell if he was a liar?  People  ->gathered around him and kept doing it, many gathered from hearing or seeing  ->someone who was or had been healed.  Call me a fool, but I believe he did  ->heal people.     Logic alert -  argument from incredulity.  Just because it is hard for you to believe this doesn't mean that it isn't true.  Liars can be very pursuasive, just look at Koresh that you yourself site. He has followers that don't think he is a fake and they have shown that they are willing to die. By not giving up after getting shot himself, Koresh has shown that he too is will to die for what  he believes.  As far as healing goes.  If I rememer right the healing that was attributed is not consistent between the different gospels.  In one of them the healing that is done is not any more  that faith healers can pull off today.  Seems to me that the early gospels weren't that compeling, so the stories got bigger to appeal better.  -> Niether was he a lunatic.  Would more than an entire nation be drawn  ->to someone who was crazy.  Very doubtful, in fact rediculous.  For example  ->anyone who is drawn to David Koresh is obviously a fool, logical people see  ->this right away. -> Therefore since he wasn't a liar or a lunatic, he must have been the  ->real thing.     Or might not have existed, or any number of things.  That is the logical pitfall that those who use flawed logic like this fall into.  There are bifurcations (or tri, quad, etc) that are valid, because in the proceeding steps, the person shows conclusively that the alternatives are all that are  possible.  Once everyone agrees that the given set is indeed all there are, then arguments among the alternatives can be presentent, and one mostly likely to be true can be deduced by excluding all other possible alternatives.  However, if it can be shown that the set is not all inclusive, then any conclusions bases on the  incomplete set are invalid, even if the true choice is one of the original choices.  I have given at  least one valid alternative, so the conclusion that JC is the real McCoy just because he isn't one of the other two alternative is no longer valid.  -> Some other things to note.  He fulfilled loads of prophecies in  ->the psalms, Isaiah and elsewhere in 24 hrs alone.  This in his betrayal  ->and Crucifixion.  I don't have my Bible with me at this moment, next time I  ->write I will use it.  JC was a rabbi.  He knew what those prophecies were.  It wouldn't be any great shakes to make sure one does a list of actions that would fullfill prophecy.  What would be compeling is if there were a set of clear and explicit prophecies AND JC had absolutely NO knowledge of then,  yet  fullfilled them anyway.  -> I don't think most people understand what a Christian is.  It  ->is certainly not what I see a lot in churches.  Rather I think it  ->should be a way of life, and a total sacrafice of everything for God's  ->sake.  He loved us enough to die and save us so we should do the  ->same.  Hey we can't do it, God himself inspires us to turn our lives  ->over to him.  That's tuff and most people don't want to do it, to be a  ->real Christian would be something for the strong to persevere at.  But  ->just like weight lifting or guitar playing, drums, whatever it takes  ->time.  We don't rush it in one day, Christianity is your whole life.   ->It is not going to church once a week, or helping poor people once in  ->a while.  We box everything into time units.  Such as work at this  ->time, sports, Tv, social life.  God is above these boxes and should be  ->carried with us into all these boxes that we have created for  ->ourselves.    Here I agree with you.  Anyone who buys into this load of mythology should take what it says  seriously, and what it says is that it must be a total way of life.  I have very little respect for  Xians that don't.  If the myth is true, then it is true in its entirity.  The picking and choosing that I see a lot of leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

Anybody knows compression-algorithms & -factors for voice ?  I've posted some info on CELP coding on sci.crypt.  Looks like you can squeeze speech into 4000bps if you have a fast enough computer like a sparcstation (or a Newton with the Acorn Risc Machine in it :-) )  This drops the bandwidth to so low a figure that it's feasible to run speech over tcp/ip running on top of slip down a v32bis modem.  Not only will this let us run point to point encrypted speech, it'll let us run speech internationally over the internet if no-one stops us by getting *very* heavy about regulations.  The thought of this, if the administration realised, would probably scare them shitless.  Now of course the trick is to develop and define a standard protocol for internet speech *damn fast*, allowing anyone who feels brave to inplement custom handheld hardware as well as us hacking it on our workstations.  Shouldn't be too difficult.  The CELP stuff is standardised, we use tcp/ip streams, and a protocol allowing silences to be used to catch up on any net lag, and also to avoid sending any data during silences (ie it's not wise to be synchronised real-time on each end because any net delays would add up to big voice-lags)  As for me, I'm going to press ahead on trying this stuff as soon as I get my sparc back from being loaned out and buy the necessary microphone. It'll save me a fortune in calling my friend in texas every night :) (whether encrypted or not)  You know, surely *someone* is working on this.  Who?  It's so obvious, why doesn't it exist already?

I think it is unlikely that data like this could be used in court. Currently LEAs can install wiretaps on large numbers of phones, record calls without listening to them, and then post-facto obtain warrants and listen to calls after probable cause is established.  But this strategy wouldn't get the stuff admitted in court.  (At least, not in the near term.)  In other words, near as I can tell, the thing that makes such evidence inadmissable is the interception without a warrant, not the attempt to interpret what was intercepted without a warrant.  I'd be surprised that archiving data without consent would be interpreted as anything but analogous to a wiretap by the courts.  Note that that doesn't mean I think it won't be done if technically feasible.  Just as I'm sure many wiretaps are done now without warrants, just to fish for avenues to investigate.  So in the future, start surveilance, start archiving data, trump up some probable cause, decrypt post-facto after the warrant is in hand, and the investigation gets a boost from data that, sadly, won't ever be presented to a jury.  While I'm posting...  for an interesting cautionary tale projecting this archiving scenario to extremes, read \\\"Lacey and his Friends\\\", a collection of sf stories by David Drake.  The US starts down the slippery slope by archiving *everyghing*.  But don't worry folks, it's stored in a secure repository where nobody but LEAs with warrants can get to it.  And by the way, we'll be installing cameras on all major streets.  Hey, this is nothing new, we already have cameras in banks and teller machines, don't we?  And then we'll pass laws requiring cameras covering *all* public places.  Then in some private places.  Then we'll make it a crime ever to be out of range of a camera, except in legally licensed privacy cubicles.  Only alone.  And with a thorough body search before and after.  But, see, there's still a right to privacy.  We haven't curtailed any rights, not really.  And just think how much easier it'd be to solve crimes in such a situation: just obtain a warrant, put on a VR helmet and take a walk down memory lane.  And hey, nobody'll be tracking *you* or *me*, no need to be self-conscious.  After all, if you're not doing anything illegal...  Funny, though.  While speeding and the radar detector industry became pretty much a thing of the past, somehow all this didn't elminate all crime in the story.  And somehow, politicians got exemptions on grounds of national security, and rich corporations got exemptions for their execs on grounds of industrial espionage and the preservation of competition.

Normmaly DES.                                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  Note the use of the word \\\"business\\\" in the above. The whole tenor of this release seems to be establishing a ground rule that only \\\"business\\\" use is legitimate for debate. If you want the nothings you drop in your wife's ear to remain secret and private, that is not even on the agenda for debate. Note that there is NO role for you to contain private info in this. The only reference is to information already in the hands of others. The 'unauthorized release' bit is also drawing a long bow. Most of these cases are by people who have legitimate access abusing it, and revealing, or often selling the info. These people are, of course, in this proposal, the people who will have the keys.  The criminals also use lawers, courts, the CIA, white-house officials and pens to go about their business. When will they be outlawed as well? Yeah, several of them would be a better idea than CLipper!  Them again, the protections of law and the courts have been seriously erroded over the last decade ofr so.                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ NSA   Yeah, this bit is VERY true.   Note the repeated mixing of telephone scrabeling and encryption. A demo of the above claim on an ordanary POTS would be a good nights entertainment I suspect. Note also the 'many'. not 'all', as the general tone implies.                                  ^^^^^^^^^                                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  The case record seems to indicate that what is needed is a brutal tightening of the current abuses. I have not heard, yet, of a case that was impeaded by the use of secure encryption by the men in black. The other side, abuse by law enforcers is well documented, even by govt agencies. And the phone vs other coms is blurred yet again.                                   Lets run that line twice. Not **VERY** carefully what it says. The stated purpose of the key eschrow is to make the use of Clipper compulsory. Note the word \\\"ensure\\\". As to 'protect', or 'law-abiding', I will leave to you. So to the person who asked if it included the outlawing of other encryptions, the answer in this press release is, YES.   Just as they only can wiretap now with a warrent.    Just makes sure that the illegal ones are preserved.   Where do you find many experts. Any ex KGB people looking for a contract? :-) And as a later posting asks, what of the STU-IIIs they already have. It will be very interesting to see if the military and US embasies start to use it. After all, it is secure, isn't it. The govt will answer that point by its own actions.                                                  ^^^^^^^^  Again, personal use seems to be a unaskable question.                                                    ^^^^^  Ah, so warrents are not always needed it seems.   The ITARs seem to slightly impeed this.   Note that all this wonderfull stuff will be in secret. Only the 'proper people' will be able to express an opinion, hence only the desired result will emerge.   Encryption and codes have been around for millenia. They are generaly in equilibrium with the technology of the time. The systematic study of cyphers has resulted in a swing in favor of the encrypter, AT THE MOMENT. I have no doubt that the factoring problem will fall in time. Probably fofr practical purposes by the middle of the next century.   It is a little hard to critisise a non-proposal.   Note we drop back to 'phone-mode' again. If this is a true answer, it can be rephrased as \\\" It sucks big time. Anyone who can drive the crypt work-bench will use it for light amusement before breakfast.\\\"   This link between the security of the key-eschrow, and the actual algorithm is  a real winner.

They don't seem to be saying anything that makes much sense. And this proposal DOES prohibit it except in a very limited way. And, this is the one explicit reference to personal rights. It is a denial. And yes, I don't think that the Mexicans, Brazilians, and Canucks are included in Clinton et als magnanamous gesture.   The 'false tension' is false. The balance is between two repugnant points. The RIGHT to privacy is hand-waved to non-existance by putting it behind the \\\"false assessment\\\". It is assumed that the removal of the right to take what ever steps YOU deem suitable to protect YOUR privacy is non negotiable, hence is defined in the govenment language to be non-existant. If you don't agree, you must be a criminal, as only criminals don't agree with out laws. Also note the non- question. \\\"If what is here was not possible...\\\"   It indicates we know that Bush dropped the ball in squashing that nasty < insert suitable retoric > and will stamp out this disorderly, unruley outbreak of freedom and ultra-national sentiment.

Good luck folks.\",\"  I tend to agree that players are not hurt by early play in the big leagues. The BRaves organization is a fertile ground to test this hypothesis, as they had little talent on their roster for some time.  Steve Avery, for example, was rushed to the majors, and he fared very poorly during his initial campaign. His subsequent pitching has not been affected by his 5+ ERA during his rookie year.  Bill James pointed out that it was relatively unusual to struggle so and then rebound.  Bob Horner was also rushed to the majors (out of Arizona State directly) had good numbers immediately.  I am not certain of the ages of people like Pete Smith, Craig McMurty, and Derek Lilliquist.  The Braves pitching staffs were so bad when they came up that they might have been rushed.  Lilliquist and Smith struggled, but it didn't hurt PS and DL may have been overhyped.  I seem to recall CM pitching well initially, though I don't have stats handy.\",\"Victoria Hotel Reserv. 2 nights $40  MID-WEEK (Sun - Thurs) Hotel reservation available for Victoria, Canada. 2 nights/3 days for $40.

I read once that the Babe made $80,000 one year and that was about as good  as it got for him.  Let's assume he made that in 1928 (I'm not sure of the figures, but I know I'm in the ballpark--pun intended). :-)  Today, assuming a 4% yearly inflation rate, which is an understatement if not accurate, his measly $80,000 salary would be worth.  FV = $80,000 x (1+4%)^(1993-1928)    = $80,000 x (1.04)^65    = just over $1,000,000.  Assuming inflation is average of around 5%.  FV = $80,000 x (1+5%)^65    = almost 2,000,000.  (I didn't crunch these numbers beforehand).  These numbers might lead one to believe that today's players are slightly  overpaid.  The Babe appears to have made then what today's average to above average players make now.  Perfectly accurate salary, year of salary, and  average inflation rate would make this analysis more accurate, but I don`t  think I'm off by much.

Any leads?  \",\"  No matter how \\\"absurd\\\" it is to suggest that a common moral system created by mankind is absolute, it is not contrary to reason to suggest that a common moral system created by mankind is sensible. In fact, for the Bible to be of any use to mankind as a moral code, it must be interpreted by mankind and a workable moral system created for everyday use.  The Jewish Talmud is the result of centuries of Biblical scholars analysing every word of the Torah to understand the morality behind it. The Children of Israel were given a very strict set of Moral, Civil, Judicial and Ceremonial Laws to follow and yet this was clearly not enough to cover every instance of moral dilemma in their Society. For a Christian, the situation is no better.  It seems to me that the only code of morality that we have from the Judeo- Christian God is that which is contained in the Bible (which we can see from the diverse opinions in the Christian newsgroups is not clear). There may well be an absolute morality defined by the Judeo-Christian God for mankind to follow but it seems that we only have a subset simply because the concept was written down by man.  This leads to the problem of defining morality for our society. If we take the divine Morality then we have a code of practice which may be interpreted in many different ways (as an example, consider the immolation of heretics in the fifteenth century and the interpretation of the Bible which allows a man to do that to another man under the precept to administer Justice). If we take an agnostic Morality then we have a code of practice that can be modified to suit society (with all the danger that this implies). Alternatively, we could take the basis of the Judeo-Christian morality and interpret/extend this to create and justify a code of morality which suits the society we live in and enables the people to live Righteously (as many Christian and Non-Christian philosophers have done).  Whatever the driving force behind the definition of morality for our society, I think the important aspect is the result.

If the (naive) market is flooded with proprietary, but weak, encryption, then truly strong  encryption will be unable to compete. Suppose the govt had a secret TV broadcast standard, and then sold TVs below cost. Private industry has a better standard, but it's not as widespread due to the govt early flooding of the market with cheap proprietary sets. Even though the industry's technology is better, the programming is being broadcast to the govt's unduplicatable standard. Who could compete?    The other flaw, of course, is that making something voluntary today ensures that it will be voluntary in the future.

The bones are said to have been loaded at Mudania on the Sea of Marmora and to be the remains of the victims of massacres in Asia Minor. In view of the rumors circulating it is expected that an inquiry will be instigated.     - - - Reference - - -  [1] _New York Times_, December 23, 1924, page 3, column 2 (bottom)     - - - - - - - - - - - -  On the 78th Commemorative Anniversary of the Turkish genocide of the Armenians, we remember those whose only crime was to be Armenian in the shadow of an  emerging Turkish proto-fascist state. In their names we demand justice.  In April 1915, the Turkish government began a systematically executed  de-population of the eastern Anatolian homeland of the Armenians through a  genocidal extermination. This genocide was to insure that Turks exclusively ruled over the geographic area today called the Republic of Turkey. The  result: 1.5 million murdered, 30 billion dollars of Armenian property stolen and plundered. This genocide ended nearly 3,000 years of Armenian civilization on those lands. Today, the Turkish government continues to scrape clean any vestige of a prior Armenian existence on those lands. Today's Turkish governmental policy is to re-write the history of the era, to manufacture distortion and generate excuses for their genocide of the Armenian people. In  the face of refutation ad nauseam, the Turkish Historical Society and cronies  shamelessly continue to deny that any such genocide occurred. This policy  merely demonstrates that in the modern era, genocide is an effective state  policy when it remains un-redressed and un-punished. A crime unpunished is a  crime encouraged. Adolf Hitler took this cue less than 25 years after the  successful genocide of the Armenians.  Turkey claims there was no systematic deportation of Armenians, yet... Armenians were removed from every city, town, and village in the whole of  Turkey! Armenians who resisted deportation and massacre are referred to as  \\\"rebels\\\".  Turkey claims there was no genocide of the Armenians, yet...Turkish population figures today show zero Armenians in eastern Turkey, the Armenian homeland.  Turkey claims Armenians were always a small minority, yet...Turkey claims  Armenians were a \\\"threat\\\".  In a final insult to the victims, the Republic of Turkey sold the bones of  approximately 100,000 murdered Armenians for profit to Europe.  Today, the Turkish government is enjoying the fruits of that genocide. The success of this genocide is hangs over the heads of Turkey's Kurdish population.  The Armenians demand recognition, reparation, return of Armenian land and property lost as a result of this genocide.

I seriously doubt that any practical implementation of this proposal would place the onus on the individual to register keys.  Realistically, the Clipper-Chip will probably emit an ID code which will serve as the identifier when requesting the key fragments.

The chip could be used in a cellular phone, a modem, or other device -- it really makes no difference:  When the authorities detect the use of this encryption standard during surveillance, they would then capture the ID and apply for the key in order to decrypt the data.\",\"Archive-name: atheism/faq Alt-atheism-archive-name: faq Last-modified: 5 April 1993 Version: 1.1                      Alt.Atheism Frequently-Asked Questions  This file contains responses to articles which occur repeatedly in alt.atheism.

Typical posting:  Why have a newsgroup about atheism?  Why do atheists organize in groups?   What is there to discuss?  Response:  Many things are discussed here, including:  * Whether it is reasonable to feign theism in order to avoid upsetting one's   family * Prayer in schools * Discrimination against atheists * Sunday trading laws * The Satanic Child Abuse myth * Whether one should be an overt atheist or 'stay in the closet' * How religious societies prey (sic) on new college students * How to get rid of unwanted proselytizers * Whether religion is a danger to society and/or the individual * Why people become atheists  Of course, inevitably alt.atheism tends to attract evangelical Christians looking for someone to convert.  Most readers of the newsgroup don't  want to be preached to, although a few seem to derive perverse pleasure  from tearing apart particularly ill-considered or uninformed postings.  ------------------------------  Subject: Hitler was an atheist!  Typical posting:  Hitler was an atheist, and look at what he did!  Response:  Adolf Hitler was emphatically not an atheist.  As he said himself:     The folkish-minded man, in particular, has the sacred duty, each in    his own denomination, of making _people_stop_just_talking_    superficially_of_God's_will,_and_actually_fulfill_God's_will,_and_    not_let_God's_word_be_desecrated._[orig. ital.]     For God's will gave men their form, their essence, and their    abilities.  Anyone who destroys His work is declaring war on the    Lord's creation, the divine will.  Therefore, let every man be    active, each in his own denomination if you please, and let every    man take it as his first and most sacred duty to oppose anyone who    in his activity by word or deed steps outside the confines of his    religious community and tries to butt into the other.     [...]     Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will    of the Almighty Creator: _by_defending_myself_against_the_Jew,_I_am_    fighting_for_the_work_of_the_Lord._[orig. ital.]            -- Adolf Hitler, from \\\"Mein Kampf\\\", trans. Ralph Mannheim.  Of course, someone bad believing something does not make that belief wrong.  It's also entirely possible that Hitler was lying when he claimed  to believe in God.  We certainly can't conclude that he's an atheist,  though.  ------------------------------  Subject: The Bible proves it  Typical posting:  In the Bible it says that...  Response:  Most of the readers of alt.atheism feel that the Bible is of questionable accuracy, as it was written thousands of years ago by many authors who were recording oral tradition that existed many years before.  Thus, any claimed 'truth' in it is of questionable legitimacy.  This isn't to say that The Bible has no truth in it; simply that any truth must be examined before being accepted.  Many of the readers of this group also feel that because any passage is subject to \\\"interpretation\\\", any claim that a passage 'means' one thing and one thing only is not legitimate.  Note that this feeling tends to extend to other books.  It is also remarkable to many atheists that theists tend to ignore other equally plausible religious books in favour of those of their own religion.  ------------------------------  Subject: Pascal's Wager  Typical posting:  If you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing -- but if you don't believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you will go to hell. Therefore it is foolish to be an atheist.  Response:  This argument is known as Pascal's Wager.  It has several flaws.  Firstly, it does not indicate which religion to follow.  Indeed, there are many mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out there.  This is often described as the \\\"avoiding the wrong hell\\\" problem.  If a person is a follower of religion X, he may end up in religion Y's version of hell.  Secondly, the statement that \\\"If you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing\\\" is not true.  Suppose you're believing in the wrong God -- the true God might punish you for your foolishness. Consider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine in favour of prayer.  Another flaw in the argument is that it is based on the assumption that  the two possibilities are equally likely -- or at least, that they are of  comparable likelihood.  If, in fact, the possibility of there being a God  is close to zero, the argument becomes much less persuasive.  So sadly the argument is only likely to convince those who believe already.  Also, many feel that for intellectually honest people, belief is based on  evidence, with some amount of intuition.  It is not a matter of will or  cost-benefit analysis.  Formally speaking, the argument consists of four statements:    1. One does not know whether God exists.   2. Not believing in God is bad for one's eternal soul if God does      exist.   3. Believing in God is of no consequence if God does not exist.   4. Therefore it is in one's interest to believe in God.  There are two approaches to the argument.  The first is to view 1 as an assumption, and 2 as a consequence of it.  One problem with this approach, in the abstract, is that it creates information from no information.  This is considered invalid in information theory.  Statement 1 indicates one has no information about God -- but statement 2 indicates that beneficial information can be gained from the absolute lack of information about God.  This violates information entropy -- information has been extracted from no information, at no \\\"cost\\\".  The alternative approach is to claim that 1 and 2 are both assumptions.  The problem with this is that 2 is then basically an assumption which states the Christian position, and only a Christian will agree with that assumption. The argument thus collapses to \\\"If you are a Christian, it is in your interests to believe in God\\\" -- a rather vacuous tautology, and not the way Pascal intended the argument to be viewed.  The biggest reason why Pascal's wager is a failure is that if God is omniscient he will certainly know who really believes and who believes as a wager.  He will spurn the latter... assuming he actually cares at all whether people believe in him.  ------------------------------  Subject: What is Occam's Razor?  Typical posting:  People keep talking about Occam's Razor.  What is it?  Response:  William of Occam formulated a principle which has become known as Occam's  Razor.  In its original form, it said \\\"Do not multiply entities  unnecessarily.\\\"  That is, if you can explain something without supposing the existence of some entity, then do so.  Nowadays when people refer to Occam's Razor, they generally express it  more generally, for example as \\\"Take the simplest solution\\\".  The relevance to atheism is that we can look at two possible explanations  for what we see around us:  1. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, which came into being as a result of natural processes.  2. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, and  there is also a God who created the universe.  Clearly this God must be  of non-zero complexity.  Given that both explanations fit the facts, Occam's Razor might suggest  that we should take the simpler of the two -- solution number one. Unfortunately, some argue that there is a third even more simple solution:  3. There isn't an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there.   We just imagine that there is.  This third option leads us logically towards solipsism, which many people  find unacceptable.   ------------------------------  Subject: Why it's good to believe in Jesus  Typical posting:  I want to tell people about the virtues and benefits of my religion.  Response:  Preaching is not appreciated.  Feel free to talk about your religion, but please do not write postings that are on a \\\"conversion\\\" theme.  Such postings do not belong on alt.atheism and will be rejected from alt.atheism.moderated (try the newsgroup talk.religion.misc).  You would doubtless not welcome postings from atheists to your favourite newsgroup in an attempt to convert you; please do unto others as you would have them do unto you!  Often theists make their basic claims about God in the form of lengthy analogies or parables.  Be aware that atheists have heard of God and know the basic claims about him; if the sole purpose of your parable is to tell atheists that God exists and brings salvation, you may as well not post it, since it tells us nothing we have not been told before.  ------------------------------  Subject: Why I know that God exists  Typical posting:  I *know* from personal experience and prayer that God exists.  Response:  Just as many theists have personal evidence that the being they worship exists, so many atheists have personal evidence that such beings do not exist.  That evidence varies from person to person.  Furthermore, without wishing to dismiss your evidence out of hand, many people have claimed all kinds of unlikely things -- that they have been abducted by UFOs, visited by the ghost of Elvis, and so on.  ------------------------------  Subject: Einstein and \\\"God does not play dice\\\"  Typical posting:  Albert Einstein believed in God.  Do you think you're cleverer than him?  Response:  Einstein did once comment that \\\"God does not play dice [with the universe]\\\".  This quotation is commonly mentioned to show that Einstein believed in the Christian God.  Used this way, it is out of context; it refers to Einstein's refusal to accept the uncertainties indicated by quantum theory. Furthermore, Einstein's religious background was Jewish rather than Christian.  A better quotation showing what Einstein thought about God is the following: \\\"I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists, not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings.\\\"  Einstein was unable to accept Quantum Theory because of his belief in an objective, orderly reality; a reality which would not be subject to random events and which would not be dependent upon the observer.  He believed that QM was incomplete, and that a better theory would have no need for statistical interpretations.  So far no such better theory has been found, and much evidence suggests that it never will be.  A longer quote from Einstein appears in \\\"Science, Philosophy, and Religion, A Symposium\\\", published by the Conference on Science, Philosophy and Religion in Their Relation to the Democratic Way of Life, Inc., New York, 1941.  In    \\\"The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events    the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side    of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature.  For him    neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an    independent cause of natural events.  To be sure, the doctrine of a    personal God interfering with natural events could never be    *refuted* [italics his], in the real sense, by science, for this    doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific    knowledge has not yet been able to set foot.     But I am convinced that such behavior on the part of representatives    of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal.  For a doctrine    which is to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark,    will of necessity lose its effect on mankind, with incalculable harm    to human progress.  In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers    of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal    God, that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past    placed such vast power in the hands of priests.  In their labors they    will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable    of cultivating the Good, the True, and the Beautiful in humanity    itself.  This is, to be sure, a more difficult but an incomparably    more worthy task...\\\"     \\\"It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religous convictions,    a lie which is being systematically repeated.  I do not believe in a    personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly.    If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the    unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our    science can reveal it.\\\"  The latter quote is from \\\"Albert Einstein: The Human Side\\\", edited by Helen  Dukas and Banesh Hoffman, and published by Princeton University Press.   Also from the same book:    \\\"I do not believe in immortality of the individual, and I consider ethics    to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind     it.\\\"  Of course, the fact that Einstein chose not to believe in Christianity does  not in itself imply that Christianity is false.  ------------------------------  Subject: Everyone worships something  Typical posting:  Everyone worships something, whether it's money, power or God.  Response:  If that is true, everyone is a polytheist.  Theists care just as much about those things that atheists care about.  If the atheists' reactions to (for example) their families amount to worship then so do the theists'.  ------------------------------  Subject: Why there must be a causeless cause  Typical posting:  Sets of integers that have a lower bound each have a smallest member, so chains of causes must all have a first element, a causeless cause.  Response:  The set of real numbers greater than zero has a definite lower bound, but has no smallest member.  Further, even if it is true that there must be a causeless cause, that does not imply that that cause must be a conscious supernatural entity, and especially not that any such entity must match the description favoured by any particular religion.  ------------------------------  Subject: The universe is so complex it must have been designed  Typical posting:  The presence of design in the universe proves there is a God.  Surely you don't think all this appeared here just by chance?  Response:  This is known as the Argument From Design.  It is a matter of dispute whether there is any element of design in the universe. Those who believe that the complexity and diversity of living creatures on the earth is evidence of a creator are best advised to read the newsgroup talk.origins for a while.  There is insufficient space to summarize both sides of that debate here. However, the conclusion is that there is no scientific evidence in favour of so-called Scientific Creationism. Furthermore, there is much evidence, observation and theory that can explain many of the complexities of the universe and life on earth.  The origin of the Argument by Design is a feeling that the existence of something as incredibly intricate as, say, a human is so improbable that surely it can't have come about by chance; that surely there must be some  external intelligence directing things so that humans come from the chaos deliberately.  But if human intelligence is so improbable, surely the existence of a mind capable of fashioning an entire universe complete with conscious beings must be immeasurably more unlikely?  The approach used to argue in favour of the existence of a creator can be turned around and applied to the Creationist position.  This leads us to the familiar theme of \\\"If a creator created the universe, what created the creator?\\\", but with the addition of spiralling  improbability.  The only way out is to declare that the creator was not created and just \\\"is\\\" (or \\\"was\\\").  From here we might as well ask what is wrong with saying that the universe just \\\"is\\\" without introducing a creator?  Indeed Stephen Hawking, in his book \\\"A Brief History of Time\\\", explains his theory that the universe is closed and finite in extent, with no beginning or end.  The Argument From Design is often stated by analogy, in the so-called  Watchmaker Argument.  One is asked to imagine that one has found a watch on the beach.  Does one assume that it was created by a watchmaker, or that it evolved naturally?  Of course one assumes a watchmaker.  Yet like the  watch, the universe is intricate and complex; so, the argument goes, the  universe too must have a creator.  The Watchmaker analogy suffers from three particular flaws, over and above  those common to all Arguments By Design.  Firstly, a watchmaker creates  watches from pre-existing materials, whereas God is claimed to have  created the universe from nothing.  These two sorts of creation are  clearly fundamentally different, and the analogy is therefore rather weak.  Secondly, a watchmaker makes watches, but there are many other things in  the world.  If we walked further along the beach and found a nuclear  reactor, we wouldn't assume it was created by the watchmaker.  The argument  would therefore suggest a multitude of creators, each responsible for a  different part of creation.  Finally, in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that  the watch is not part of nature because it is ordered, and therefore  stands out from the randomness of nature.  Yet in the second part of the  argument, we start from the position that the universe is obviously not  random, but shows elements of order.  The Watchmaker argument is thus  internally inconsistent.  ------------------------------  Subject: Independent evidence that the Bible is true  Typical posting:  The events of the New Testament are confirmed by independent documentary evidence.  For example...  Response:  The writings of Josephus are often mentioned as independent documentary evidence.  Early versions of Josephus's work are thought not to have mentioned Jesus or James; the extant version discusses John in a non-Christian context.  Many scholars believe that the original mentioned Jesus and James in passing, but that this was expanded by Christian copyists.  Several \\\"reconstructions\\\" of the original text have been published to this effect.  Much information appears in the Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius (about 320 C.E.).  It is worthless as historical material because of the deliberate falsification of the wily Eusebius who is generally acknowledged as 'the first thoroughly dishonest historian of antiquity.' It is Eusebius who is generally given the title of authorship for this material.  Aside from the New Testament, the biographical information about Jesus is more well-documented.  For further information, please consult the Frequently Asked Questions file for the newsgroup soc.religion.christian.  ------------------------------  Subject: Godel's Incompleteness Theorem  Typical posting:  Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible for the Bible to be both true and complete.  Response:  Godel's First Incompleteness Theorem says that in any consistent formal  system which is sufficiently expressive that it can model ordinary  arithmetic, one can formulate expressions which can never be proven to be  valid or invalid ('true' or 'false') within that formal system.  (Technically speaking, the system must also be recursive; that is, there must be a decision procedure for determining whether a given string is an axiom within the formal  system.)  Essentially, all such systems can formulate what is known as a \\\"Liar  Paradox.\\\"  The classic Liar Paradox sentence in ordinary English is \\\"This  sentence is false.\\\"  Note that if a proposition is undecidable, the formal  system cannot even deduce that it is undecidable.  The logic used in theological discussions is rarely well defined, so claims that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible to prove or disprove) the existence of God are worthless in isolation.  One can trivially define a formal system in which it is possible to prove the existence of God, simply by having the existence of God stated as an axiom.  This is unlikely to be viewed by atheists as a convincing proof, however.  It may be possible to succeed in producing a formal system built on axioms that both atheists and theists agree with.  It may then be possible to show that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem holds for that system.  However, that would still not demonstrate that it is impossible to prove that God exists within the system.  Furthermore, it certainly wouldn't tell us anything about whether it is possible to prove the existence of God generally.  Note also that all of these hypothetical formal systems tell us nothing about the actual existence of God; the formal systems are just abstractions.  Another frequent claim is that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that a religious text (the Bible, the Book of Mormon or whatever) cannot be both consistent and universally applicable. Religious texts are not formal systems, so such claims are nonsense.  ------------------------------  Subject: George Bush on atheism and patriotism  Typical posting:  Did George Bush really say that atheists should not be considered citizens?  Response:  The following exchange took place at the Chicago airport between Robert I. Sherman of American Atheist Press and George Bush, on August 27 1988. Sherman is a fully accredited reporter, and was present by invitation as a member of the press corps.  The Republican presidential nominee was there to announce federal disaster relief for Illinois.  The discussion turned to the presidential primary:   RS: \\\"What will you do to win the votes of Americans who are atheists?\\\"   GB: \\\"I guess I'm pretty weak in the atheist community.  Faith in       God is important to me.\\\"   RS: \\\"Surely you recognize the equal citizenship and patriotism of       Americans who are atheists?\\\"   GB: \\\"No, I don't know that atheists should be considered as citizens,       nor should they be considered patriots.  This is one nation under       God.\\\"   RS: \\\"Do you support as a sound constitutional principle the separation       of state and church?\\\"   GB: \\\"Yes, I support the separation of church and state.  I'm just not       very high on atheists.\\\"  UPI reported on May 8, 1989, that various atheist organizations were still angry over the remarks.  The exchange appeared in the Boulder Daily Camera on Monday February 27, 1989.  It can also be found in \\\"Free Enquiry\\\" magazine, Fall 1988 issue, Volume 8, Number 4, page 16.  On October 29, 1988, Mr. Sherman had a confrontation with Ed Murnane, cochairman of the Bush-Quayle '88 Illinois campaign.  This concerned a lawsuit Mr. Sherman had filed to stop the Community Consolidated School District 21 (Chicago, Illinois) from forcing his first-grade Atheist son to pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States as \\\"one nation under God\\\" (Bush's phrase).  The following conversation took place:    RS: \\\"American Atheists filed the Pledge of Allegiance lawsuit yesterday.       Does the Bush campaign have an official response to this filing?\\\"    EM: \\\"It's bullshit.\\\"    RS: \\\"What is bullshit?\\\"    EM: \\\"Everything that American Atheists does, Rob, is bullshit.\\\"    RS: \\\"Thank you for telling me what the official position of the Bush       campaign is on this issue.\\\"   EM: \\\"You're welcome.\\\"  After Bush's election, American Atheists wrote to Bush asking him to retract his statement.  On February 21st 1989, C. Boyden Gray, Counsel to the President, replied on White House stationery that Bush substantively stood by    \\\"As you are aware, the President is a religious man who neither supports    atheism nor believes that atheism should be unnecessarily encouraged or    supported by the government.\\\"  For further information, contact American Atheist Veterans at the American Atheist Press's Cameron Road address.  ------------------------------  Subject: I know where hell is!  Typical posting:  I know where Hell is!  Hell is in Norway!  Response:  There are several towns called \\\"Hell\\\" in various countries around the world, including Norway and the USA.  Whilst this information is mildly amusing the first time one hears it, readers of alt.atheism are now  getting pretty fed up with hearing it every week.  ------------------------------  Subject: Biblical contradictions wanted  Typical posting:  Does anyone have a list of Biblical contradictions?  Response:   American Atheist Press publish an atheist's handbook detailing Biblical contradictions. See the accompanying posting on Atheist Resources for details.  There is a file containing some Biblical contradictions available from the archive-server@mantis.co.uk. See the contacts file for more information.  ------------------------------  Subject: The USA is a Christian nation  Typical posting:  Because of the religious beliefs of the founding fathers, shouldn't the United States be considered a Christian nation?  Response:  Based upon the writings of several important founding fathers, it is clear that they never intended the US to be a Christian nation.  Here are some quotes; there are many more.    \\\"What influence, in fact, have ecclesiastical establishments had on society?    In some instances they have been seen to erect a spiritual tyranny on the    ruins of the civil authority; on many instances they have been seen    upholding the thrones of political tyranny; in no instance have they been    the guardians of the liberties of the people.  Rulers who wish to subvert    the public liberty may have found an established clergy convenient    auxiliaries. A just government, instituted to secure and perpetuate it,    needs them not.\\\"       - James Madison, \\\"A Memorial and Remonstrance\\\", 1785    \\\"I almost shudder at the thought of alluding to the most fatal example of    the abuses of grief which the history of mankind has preserved--the Cross.    Consider what calamities that engine of grief has produced!\\\"       - John Adams, in a letter to Thomas Jefferson    \\\"History I believe furnishes no example of a priest-ridden people    maintaining a free civil government.  This marks the lowest grade of    ignorance, of which their political as well as religious leaders will    always avail themselves for their own purpose.\\\"        - Thomas Jefferson to Baron von Humboldt, 1813    \\\"I cannot conceive otherwise than that He, the Infinite Father, expects or    requires no worship or praise from us, but that He is even infinitely    above it.\\\"        - Benjamin Franklin, from \\\"Articles of Belief and Acts of Religion\\\",         Nov. 20, 1728  ------------------------------  Subject: The USA is not a Christian nation  Typical posting:  Is it true that George Washington said that the United States is not in any sense founded upon the Christian religion?  Response:  No.  The quotation often given is in fact from Article XI of the 1797 Treaty of Tripoli (8 Stat 154, Treaty Series 358):     Article 11     As the government of the United States of America is not in any sense    founded on the Christian Religion, -- as it has in itself no character of    enmity against the laws, religion or tranquility of Musselmen, -- and as    the said States never have entered into any war or act of hostility    against any Mehomitan nation, it is declared by the parties that no    pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption    of the harmony existing between the two countries.  The text may be found in the Congressional Record or in treaty collections such as Charles Bevans' \\\"Treaties and Other International Agreements of the United States of America 1776-1949\\\", vol. 11 (pp. 1070-1080).  The English text of the Treaty of Tripoli was approved by the U.S. Senate on June 7, 1797 and ratified by President John Adams on June 10, 1797.  It was recently discovered that the Arabic version of the treaty not only lacks the quotation, it lacks Article XI altogether.  The person who translated the Arabic to English was Joel Barlow, Consul General at Algiers, a close friend of Thomas Paine -- and an opponent of Christianity.  It is possible that Barlow made up Article XI, but since there is no Arabic version of that article to be found, it's hard to say.  In 1806 a new Treaty of Tripoli was ratified which no longer contained the quotation. \",\" Catcher is their weakest position, with the possible exception of second base. They have a chance to simultaneously replace their biggest offensive problem spot with a well-above-average offensive player *and* acclimate a highly promising potential star with no pressure on him to carry the team, and they want to play *Olson* and *Berryhill* instead?!   \\\"A catcher's defensive reputation will be inversely proportional to his  recent offensive level of performance.\\\"  Thus, Mickey Tettleton goes (in  the media) from being a no-hit defensive whiz to a slugging thumb-finger  in two short years.  The rule doesn't apply to perceived \\\"superstars\\\", who  get the Gold Glove Offensive Transfer effect instead.  Greg Olson is probably  considered to be a good defensive catcher precisely because he can't hit.    Aren't they the same thing?   Either that or just stupidity.   Of course.   One could make the same sort of argument in other cases.  Pete Rose, in pursuing Ty Cobb's record, was a huge gate attraction (and national media magnet).  The Reds made a lot of money off that; they also wasted the prime of Eric Davis.  That may be \\\"good business\\\", but that doesn't mean I don't loathe them for it.   \",\"Does anyone on this newsgroup happen to know WHY morphine was first isolated from opium?

Cheers, Kent\",\" I have heard that the sabbath was originally determined by the phases of the moon, and had elements of moon worship.  Early stuff, Egyptian in nature. \",\" I have a question that is a slight variation on the previously mentioned examples that perhaps people could give me some pointers on (it has been a couple of years since my Con Law class in college so I hope I am not missing something obvious here...)  Basic Scenario:   I set up a bbs that uses public-key encryption and encryption of  files on disk.  The general setup is designed so that when users   connect they send a private key encrypted using the system public  key and the user's public-private keypair is used to wrap the  one-time session keys used for encrypting the files on disk.  The  result of this is that even if I reveal the system private key it  is impossible for anyone to gain access to the files stored on the  machine.  What is possible is for someone to use the revealed  system private key to entice users into revealing thier personal  private keys during the authentication sequence.  Questions:   Does the fact that the system private key does not provide any  information useful for a search give me any protection as far as  being coerced to reveal the key?  (I doubt it myself..)   It seems providing the system private key does not mean that I am  assisting in \\\"entrapment\\\" (the users would send thier key anyway  and are not being enticed into doing something they would not  otherwise do) but is there any other hook that can be used?   Would the user private-key enticement require wiretap approval?  Any answers or general musings on the subject would be appreciated...  jim\",\"The media is beating the incident at Dodger Stadium on Wednesday to death, but I haven't seen anything in rsb yet.  Gerald Perry of the Cardinals pinch hit in the eighth inning with two on and his club down by a run.  He stroked a line drive into the right field corner.  The ball cleared the three-foot high fence and went into the crowd.  Darryl, racing over from right center, got to the spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence, but he missed the ball.  A fan sitting in the front row, wearing a mitt, reached up and caught the ball.  Home run.  Now I've seen the replay several times and I have concluded that Darryl missed the ball, and that the fan's glove was essentially behind Darryl's.  Several Dodger fans with seats in the immediate vicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with Strawberry.  What cannot be disputed, however, is that the fan who caught the ball never took his eye off it;  he was oblivious to where the fielder was playing.  He was also quite exuberant as soon as he realized he had made the catch.  That exuberance disappeared immediately, however, when Strawberry went into a tirade at the man.  All reports indicate he used a lot of profanity and accused the man of interference, and therefore of costing the Dodgers a game.  Shortly afterwards other fans hurled food and beverages toward the man who made the catch.  Dodger Stadium officials started to remove him from the park, but then relented and just relocated him to another area.  In an interview after the game, Lasorda blamed the fan for the loss.  Strawberry also went into a tirade about how the fans are stupid and they don't care about  winning.  L.A. Times columnists similarly blasted the man who made the catch.  Before each Dodger game the public address announcer makes a speech wherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls that are hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any  that are in the field of play.  Was the fan wrong?  Should he have been more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility of interference?  Or was he human and just reacting?  By the way, he is a season ticket holder and on his request the Dodgers have relocated his seats to another area of the Stadium where future interference is impossible.  Others have questioned why Darryl should be so concerned with what the fan did when he has a grand total of 1 rbi through the first nine games.  I question what he was doing in right center with a left-handed pull hitter up and the game on the line.  Had he been closer to the play, he certainly would have had a much better chance of catching the ball.  But I guess the big debate continues as to what are the responsibilities of the fan.    -- The Beastmaster   \",\"Hi folks.

I don't happen to have my SAE manual handy, but oil viscosity in general _decreases_ with temperature.  The SAE numbers are based on a `typical' curve that oils used to all have, running from (say) the viscosity of a room-temperature 90-weight at 0C, down to (say) that of a room-temperature  5-weight at 20C, for a typical 40-weight oil.  Oils that are designed for operation in `normal' temperatures just have a weight specification.  Oils that are designed for operation in exceedingly cold temperatures have a `W' tacked on the end, so in winter in a cold place, you'd stick 10W in your car in the winter and 40 in it in the summer, to approximate the appropriate viscosity throughout the year.  Modern multi-viscosity oils change viscosity much less with temperature. As a result, their viscosity graphs cross over several curves.  A multi-vis specification pegs the curve at two temperatures, a `normal' operating temperature and a `cold' one (though I can't remember the numbers...).  In any event, the weights do indicate a significant difference.  Remember that your engine is temperature-regulated (by the thermostat and radiator or air fins) most of the time -- unless you overheat it or something.  Any weight of oil is better than no oil, or than very old, carbonized oil.  Thin oil won't (in general) lubricate as well at temperature, thicker oil will (like a 20W50) will lubricate better at temperature,  but not as well during startup, when most engine wear occurs.    If you're planning on making long drives, the 20W50 is probably fine (esp. in the summer) in your 10W40 car.  But if you're making short drives, stick to the 10W40.  \",\"In response to a lot of email I've gotten, I need to clarify my position.  I am not in favor of paganism.

Avoid things that would plug her up.  Crohn's has no dietary restriction in general.   The feeling obout this has changed in the GI community.  The current feeling is that inflammation is not induced by food.  There is even evidence that patients deprived of food have mucosal atrophy due to lack of stimulation of intestinal growth factors.  There is now interest in providing small amounts of nasogastric feeding to patients on IV nutrition.  But I digress.   Symptoms can be drastically enhanced by food, but not inflammation.   The low residue diet is appropriate for you if you still have obstructions. Again, it is not felt that food causes inflammation.  These foods are avoided because they may get stuck.  I'd go ahead and have the fudge, though ;-)  .  Spencer makes an especially good point in having an observant and informed patient.  Would that many patients be able to tell what causes them problems.  The digestive processing idea is changing, but if a food causes problems, avoid them.  Be sure that the foods are  tested a second time to be sure the food is a real cause.  Crohn's commonly causes intermittent symptoms and some patients end up with severly restricted diets that take months to renormalize.  There was a good article in the CCFA newsletter recently that discussed the issue of dietary restriction of fiber.  It would be worth reading to anyone with an interest in Crohn's.

So     unless the first BIOS 'get date' call after midnight is done by     the DOS 'kernel' (which is the only part of DOS which knows how to     increment the date, the day wrap indication is normally lost. My guess is that Kevin's 'menu' system uses BIOS calls to read the clock (in order to display the time), and is hence the entity which causes the day wrap indication to get lost. Even if the 'menu' system 'notices' the day 'wrap' (which I think is indicated by a non-zero value in AL), there really isn't any particularly good way to tell DOS about it, so that DOS can update the day. The menu system 'should' use DOS calls to get the time, which would cause the DOS 'kernel' to do the BIOS call, and the wrap indicator would hence be processed properly.  Possibly, though, the 'menu' system can't easily use DOS calls for time, because DOS is not reentrant, and perhaps time incrementing ofters occur while the 'menu' system is 'inside' some other DOS call.\",\"From article <1pq6i2$a1f@news.ysu.edu>, by ak296@yfn.ysu.edu (John R.

I am  using X11R4 and Motif 1.1 currently, although I will also be  working with Open Look in the future.       What I need to do is under certain circumstances prevent the  user from switching from one window of the application to  another window.  Let's say, for example, that Window A is on top  of Window B in the window hierarchy.  Normally, if the user clicks  the mouse in Window B it will be brought to the top of the  window hierarchy and placed on top of Window A.  Under certain  circumstances if the user clicks the mouse in Window B I need to  beep and prevent Window B from being raised on top of Window  A.        From the research and testing I've done so far, it appears that  this window ordering is handled by the window manager, in this  case Motif.  I haven't found any way to override this default  processing through standard X Window functions.  I can tell  when this switching occurs through focus change and mapping  notify events, but I can't find any way to tell Motif not to make the  switch.        The temporary solution I've currently come up with is very  kludgy but it partially works.  When I detect such a window switch  in those cases when the switch is not allowed, I manually force  the formerly top window back on top with an XRaiseWindow call  and beep with the XBell function.  This provides the necessary  functionality but looks ugly when the windows switch places  twice.        Does anyone know how I can tell Motif (or preferably *any*  window manager) when I don't want the window order switch to  actually take place?

People might quibble about what \\\"intrinsically\\\" means but the reason we are sinners is because we do not behave as good as we are. The message of Christ is that each of us are not only good, but great, that we can approach perfection, albeit perhaps through a  different technique than you claim Buddhism teaches. Because we do not realize our greatness, we sin. Peter had no problem walking  on water until a little doubt crept in.  Doesn't David ask in the 8th Psalm \\\"what is man that you [God]  should care for him, but you have made him just a little lower  than the angels\\\"?

Instead Jesus gives him a harder task, sell everything and follow Him. Jesus is raising the bar. The desciples say how can anyone do this if it's so hard even for rich people. Jesus says anyone can do it, with God's help.  Jesus says not only can we avoid killing people, we can avoid getting angry at people. Not only can we avoid committing adultery, we can control our own desires.   I realize this was not your main point, but I wonder how other people see this.

I think that Muslims worship the same God as I do, we can learn from their name \\\"submission\\\". Hindus and Buddhists and Taoists, etc. claim that \\\"God\\\" is impersonal.  Is God personal or impersonal? I say yes, but if I think a little more my answer is whichever is greater. I think it is greater  to be a personal entity, with an individual consciousness, but you're right that that might be a cultural bias. If I think more I must admit that God's personal nature is as far beyond my conception as His impersonal nature is beyond the Hindu's conception.

Shutting down selective service would cost \\\"good jobs\\\" and we can't do that.     What we really need is to involve selective service in a more closely directed manner.  We need the selective service involved in environmental protection, high-speed rail, commuter aircraft,  civil rights, national service and health care.  Every dollar we put into selective service now will get us $10 less spending in future.

When he first logs on (via xdm), he has a single xterm window appear with the mwm window manager running.  In this configuration, X windows applications (particularly xdvi) work fine.  However, if he opens up a second xterm application, suddenly xdvi cannot start in either window, giving the error: Unable to load ISO 8859-1 font.     The only difference between the two xterm windows is that the initial one references a different name in the Xsession file, with prettier colours and other slight changes.  Further investigation shows that only opening a default xterm causes this behaviour, and more significant, ALL X applications can no longer load any fonts if they are invoked from the command line in either window.  If I start the xterm with a different font (using the -fn option), no problems.  It would seem that the default xterm is loading a font which somehow causes the server to lose all of its fonts.  Note: xlsfonts in either window shows all of the fonts available, so there doesn't appear to be a problem in the font directories/hash-tables.     Other than rewriting the XTerm app-defaults file to use a different font and hope for the best, does anyone have any ideas?\",\"I wanted to create a postcript file with Win#.1, to print it on a laserwriter II.

When the directors kicked Durant out of GM in 1910 he took Chevrolet and others with him.  As mentioned before, they founded the successful Chevrolet company.  A little-known fact is that the Chevrolet Co. actually took over GM! That was how Durant got back in charge of GM-- legally his new company Chevrolet Co. did the buying, and GM was a division of Chevrolet!  After 1920 and into the Sloan era, GM shuffled things so that the GM board was superior, but there was always a degree of autonomy given the Chevy division, presumably because of the initial structure. (If you look at the organization chart for GM in Sloan's book, Chevy division reports directly to 14th floor, not through the \\\"passenger car division\\\" which covers Buick, Olds, Cadillac, and Oakland/Pontiac)\",\"Hi!

For about six weeks, I've been suffering on pains in my left head side, the left leg and sometimes the left  arm. I made many tests (e.g. computer tomography, negative, lyme borreliosis, negative, all electrolytes in the blood in their correct range), they're all o.K., so I should be healthy. As a matter of fact, I am not feeling so. I was also at a Neurologist's too, he considered me healthy too.  The blood tests have shown that I have little too much of Hemoglobin (17.5, common range is 14 to 17, I unfortunately do not know about the units). Could these hemi-sided pains be the result of this or of a also possible block of the neck muscles ?  I have no fever, and I am not feeling entirely sick, but neither entirely  healthy.

I was wondering if anyone out there knows of a DRAM controller which will handle refreshing the data.  It's ok if the controller doesn't handle bank switching - that part is easy.  The only controllers I know of are the ones out of the National Semiconductor DRAM Management Handbook (1988 edition) eg. DP8429.  I would like to know if another manufacturer produces one which may be easier to implement in my circuit.  BTW, if anyone is wanting to hook up DRAM to a microcontroller, Dallas Semiconductor makes a neat chip: the DS1262 Serial DRAM Nonvolatizer Chip.  It uses the SPI (I2C) bus and refreshes/controls up to 16Mx1 of DRAM memory.  It can use an external battery to refresh the DRAM when the power is off.  Price is $11.75 from Dallas (quan 1).  I wish I could use this chip but its maximum SPI clock rate is 1 MHz (too slow for me...).

No fun, but I must have met the minority then. And \\\"given by god\\\" refers to any action whereby a god god causes or better effects something.     Rob, I am not intimate with Jewish theology, but I understand that you are a Messianic Jew. Correct me if I am wrong, but it appears that the views of Messianic Jews on metaphysics is different to that of the majority of Jews. While Jewish theology overall is quite distinct from the Christianic god views, I have heard that it is possible for Jews to attribute evil to their god, an no-no for Christians, the Bible is still seen as effect of the interaction of some god with man.     (Deletion)   The context was metaphysics, even when the process of adapting the commandments is not transcendent, the justification of the process lie in metaphysic specualtion. I wonder how you break out of the shackles of having metaphysics in your system.     (Deletion)   Is is in a book that commands to commit genocide among other reprehensible deeds. The context is repulsive, and it is foul play, IMO, to invoke some relatively enlightened passages as an example for the content of the whole book.     (Big deletion)   No, not the interpretation of some laws, but the interpretation of the bible. As in the example that Sodom and Gomorrha mean argue with god. The whole idea that it is metaphorically and yet allows you to argue with a god (whatever that means, that alone is a theo- logic question) is proof of a theology used.       It is an important question in the light of what for instance the passage witrh Sodom and Gomorrha means. Either there is some connection between the text, the fact that it exists, and your interpretation of it, or it is purely arbitrary.. Further, the question is why is has one to carry the burden of Biblical texts when one could simply write other books that convey the message better. You might answer that one can't becuase  some peculiar Biblical information might be lost, but that holds true of every other book, and the question remains why has the Bible still a special place? Can't it be replaced somehow? Is it ok to bargain the dangerous content of the Bible against some other message that is included as well?     (Deletion)   Sorry, but there are worse systems does not say anything about if one could not have a better system.   (Deletion)   If we read two stories in the Bible, one that god commands people to kill children for being idolaters and another where god kills children directly, what is more important to resolve, the message that children are to be killed or if it has  to be done by god?     And the argument you have given is a fallacy, while it may not be important in the context you have given to find out if god is corporeal or not, it can be crucial in other questions. Religious believers resolve contradictions with that they choose one of the possibilities given in an arbitrary way, and have the advantage of being able to attribute their decision to some god.\",\"Yes, there are serveral programs which can convert font files (eq the Borland fonts) to objects consisting of spheres, cones etc.  I've used a program (forgot its name/place, but i can look for it) which converted these Borland fonts to three different raytracers.

Besides, I would      rather spend an eternity in Hell than be beside God in Heaven      knowing even one man would spend his \\\"eternal life\\\" being      scorched for his wrongdoings...

What gives you the fiat to look into the minds of Israeli generals?  Has this 'policy of intimidation' been published somewhere?  For your information, the actions taken by Arabs, specifically the PLO, were not uncommon in the Lebanon Campaign of 1982.  My brain is full of shit?  At least I don't look into the minds of others and  make Israeli policy for them!   Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We all suffer.  It's too bad that civilians get killed but I will blame their Arab leaders who put them in positions of danger before I will blame the Israelis.  Just like Palestinians who send their children into warzones to throw rocks at armed Israeli soldiers.  What irresponsible parents!

If you want to look at non-christian sources try Alvin Toffler as the perennial optimist.  His views while blatently non christian explore where technology may be going.   This is regardless of technology.  Be careful to separate the issues of related to speed and dispersion of technology (how far the letter went and how quickly it got there) and the message being passed in the technology (something that seems to be totally wrong.)   When lecturing in this area I challenge my (non-christan/atheistic) class about the impact technology has on life, quality of life and the rights that they consider important.  Depending on how you work out your faith will determine your response to the use of technology.  For example friends of mine are considering IVF due to a life threatening situation the wife is going through; when it is over they will have the baby. (God willing).  In this case the technology is available and my friends have to decide what to do.  In all cases though you must decide if the technology is against God's revealed word.  Regards  David\",\"        Hmmm... people in the americas before the time of Christ, children who die young, etc. ?        But of course, the popular conception of hell (correct or incorrect) is something akin to eternal perpetuation of consciousness, at the very least.       I think a good number of atheists believe there is nothing beyond  bodily death, but it is simply an abuse of language to say they believe they're going to hell. They believe they're going to _die_. Understand that you've turned Hell into a verb. Using the same logic, it also follows that all animals are 'going to Hell.' Are you sure this is what you want to say? (presumably animals don't have the opportunity to get to heaven, but this still doesn't change the fact that they're going to Hell (die a final death))     I don't claim to know whether or not there is an afterlife of _some_ sort, but if Hell is as you described (final death, and not eternal perpetuation of consciousness) it will be true that there will never be a moment when I am aware of my non-existence.  (assuming I 'go to Hell' and not to Heaven) In other words, I'll never know I'm dead. Hmmm...         Ever hear people say of a loved one who was ill, and has died:  \\\"At least she's not suffering any more; She's in Heaven now.\\\" ?      Consider the following statement:  \\\"At least she's not suffering any more; She's in Hell now.\\\"      The above statement sounds odd, but according to your definition of Hell,  it would be a true statement. The person in Hell would not be suffering.  Granted, they wouldn't be *anything* (wouldn't be having any conscious experience whatsoever).       You say Hell (death) is eternal. However, this loses its meaning  to a dead person. And to me, it seems that the threat of some sort  of eternal punishment only makes sense/has force if one expects to be conscious throughout this eternity.       Many atheists believe that the thirst for an afterlife is simply the product of propaganda (\\\"Friend, do you want the FREE gift of e-ternal life?\\\" It's my understanding that the early jews did not believe in an afterlife. Can anyone back me up on this?) combined with the survival instinct all animals share. The difference is we have consciousness, and once we get the idea of eternal life drilled into our brains, we then desire a sort of super-survival.          That would depend on what Heaven is like. If God is a King, and  an eternity in heaven consists of giving thanks and praise to the King, I might opt for Hell. I read a lovely account of a missionary trying to convert Eskimos to Christianity in the book _The Illusion of Immortality_ by Corliss Lamont. The missionary started to speak about Heaven.  \\\"Are there seals in heaven? Will we be able to go hunting?\\\" asked an Eskimo. The missionary said no. The group of Eskimos then said something to the effect of, \\\"Well what good is your Heaven if there's no hunting? Scram.\\\" I highly recommend the above book (IOI) to anyone who wants an account of the other side of the immortality coin (that there is no  immortality).

They could still be considered true Muslims, and you can't judge them, because this is something between God and the person.  You have to apply your rule as well with atheists/agnostics, you don't know their belief, this is something between them and God.

Cheers, Kent\",\"WASHINGTON (UPI) -- A senior State Department official on Tuesday ruled out any softening of U.S. attitudes toward Iraq but said relations with Iran's Islamic regime could improve substantially if that government disassociates itself from international terrorism.  ``Despite the name-calling and the harsh rhetoric from across the Gulf, despite all this, we do not take a position of permanent hostility towards the Islamic Republic of Iran,'' David Mack, deputy assistant secretary for Near Eastern Affairs, said.  The primary U.S. objection is ``Iran's international behaviour'' which includes ``extending support of violence'' to disrupt the Arab Israeli peace process and its rapid build-up of dangerous weapons.  Mack said ``Iran could contribute to regional stability and peace but first it is to end the behaviour which threatens this area.''  Mack spoke at the U.S.-GCC business conference aimed at promoting Gulf-American trade. He said the ``Middle East will be an item very high on the agenda of the U.S. administration.''  The importance of the Gulf is underlined by Secretary of State Warren Christoper's visit last year to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait before anywhere else in the world, Mack said. He added that the U.S. has no long-term plan to station troops in the Gulf.  Mack also insisted that the Clinton administration will continue to pressure Iraq to ``comply with all the U.N. Security resolutions.''  ``As long as Iraq is ruled by Saddam Hussein we do not expect compliance,'' Mack told delegates. \",\" So why do I read in the papers that the Qumram texts had \\\"different versions\\\" of some OT texts.

EDT                     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Good afternoon.                Q   Could we do this on the lawn?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That would be nice.  Let's go out  to the cherry blossoms.  We'll do like the President.              Q   Is the stimulus package dead?               MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely not.                Q   Can you tell us more about the Dole talks?  You  said it was a good visit, but no compromise.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.  The President had a good talk  with Senator Dole last night.  I think that as we said before, there  were no specific compromises on either side, although it was a very  good discussion about the jobs package and about other issues as  well.  As you know, the President first called Senator Dole I believe  Tuesday night to talk about the Russian aid package.  They did not  speak -- Senator Dole called him back Wednesday morning -- when the  President was out.  Instead he spoke with Tony Lake, and at the close  of that conversation, indicated that he wanted to speak to the  President about the jobs and stimulus package.  They finally talked  about that yesterday afternoon.              At the close of that discussion they said that they  would have another talk last night, which they did, when the Senator  was up in New Hampshire.  And although there were no specific  compromises made on either side, they did say that they would  continue to have some discussions.  And that's where we are.              Q   Well, who is giving in?  Where is it standing --are  both making concessions?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know that it's at that  phase.  No compromise has been made.  As the President has said  consistently, he intends to come forward with an adjusted package.   He believes in the package, but he believes that if it's going to  take adjustments to get the minority to release it, he's willing to  make those adjustments.              Q   On the subject of a VAT --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, boy.              Q   Can we stay on this for one more minute?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sure.              Q   We have a problem with the five minutes --              Q   I know no decisions have been made, but what would  lead the health group to believe that a VAT might be necessary?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sorry, Andrea, I'm not going to go  down that road.  No decisions have been made.  As the President said  this morning, a number of groups, a number of members of Congress, a  number of other organizations have recommended that this be looked  at.  The working group is looking at it, but no decisions have been  made.              Q   To follow, have they done that directly through  him?  Have labor and business groups been in touch with the President  about it?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not to my knowledge, although  there's a lot of people who have public decisions in support of the  VAT.  But the President has not made a decision.              Q   At the meetings that he's had with his own task  force advisers, have they discussed the funding issue and what the  possible options would be?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think that that has been  presented for a decision, no.              Q   Not for a decision, but has it been discussed as an  option?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, there are a lot of levels of  briefing.  I do not believe that the VAT has been presented to the  President as, okay, this is something for you to decide on.                Q   You're not saying he didn't know it was being  considered, though, are you?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, he said it's being considered.              Q   He knew that.              Q   But has he discussed that with his advisers?   That's what I'm asking.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has said it's being  considered.  I do not know what level of discussion there has been  over the VAT.  It is something the working groups are looking at.  I  don't even know that it's --              Q   But he didn't say he was considering, did he, at  this stage?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, he is not.  I think we're  getting into something of a metaphysical debate right here.  What is  considered --               Q   Well, he is the one who said, I haven't reviewed  it.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That is true.  That is what I just  repeated.               Q   George, is there any concern here that as a result  of the definite statement he made in February and the promise that if  it were to be considered he'd let us know, and having it trickle out  the way it did, that there may now be the development of a  credibility gap on this issue and others?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think so.  I mean, it is  now public knowledge that this is being considered.              Q   Is he or you at all embarrassed about the absolute  statements that were made from this platform to the effect that it  was off the table and was not being considered, and then to have it  come out not from you people, but --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, wait a second.  It came out  from the administration.  What are you talking about?              Q   What I'm saying is, though, that the President said  he would let us know.               MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.              Q   You people then said -- you said, I believe, that  it's not going to be on the program.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  On March 25th.              Q   On March 25th.               MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Circumstances change.              Q   Well, I understand.  But we have to find that out  by rooting around in the fine print of an interview              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Rooting around -- I know you did do  a very good job there to read the USA Today article.  But this is -- (laughter) -- the Deputy Director of the OMB and the Secretary of  Health and Human Services.  I mean, that is common anytime you guys  write a story that has an unattributed quote from somebody in the  Clinton administration, the headline is -- I'll look at it right  here, and AP story -- \\\"Clinton wants more money for spying.\\\"              Q   What about his remark that if it were being  considered, he'd tell us about it?                MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  And the administration's concerned,  and he'd let you know.              Q   And did he?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.  Absolutely.  What did he say  this morning?              Q   It had to be dragged out of you here yesterday.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It didn't have to be dragged out of  me.  We had the Deputy Director of the OMB, we had the Secretary of  Health of Human Services say it was being considered.  That is his  administration.  That is his administration policy.              Q   Were these authorized trial balloons, or were they  orchestrated leaks?  I mean, what was the --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They were asked questions, they  answered the questions.              Q   You're saying here that it didn't have to be  dragged out, that you more or less made it clear yesterday you were  considering it.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely.  I was very clear.   Painfully clear.              Q   Was there a particular political strategy in making  it clear the administration is considering a new tax increase on tax  day?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, it was just this issue is being  considered.  They were asked if it was being considered; they  answered that it was being considered.              Q   George, The New York Times --              Q   Why do it yesterday?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They were asked.              Q   The New York Times reports today that Secretary  Reich and the chief economist at the Labor Department used apples and  oranges numbers in order to portray last month's unemployment figures  in a way that was supportive of the President's job stimulus bill,  but which turned out to be totally false.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if it was totally  false, but I think -- (laughter) -- the chief economist at the Labor  Department did grant that it was an inappropriate mixing, and they  say that.               Q   The question is, is the President concerned about  behavior that amounts to corrupting government data?  And what's he  doing about it, if so?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The chief economist has said that a  mistake was made, it won't happen again, and that's the end of the  matter.              Q   Isn't that the same information that goes to the  President?              Q   If I could go back to the stimulus package --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  There's two separate pieces of  information.  I think that's where the confusion was.              Q   When did you all first learn about this mistake  that was made?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I read the article this morning.              Q   And as far as you know, is the President aware of  it?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think so.              Q   And was he aware of it before he read about it in  The New York Times?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.  Not to my knowledge.              Q   Did you ever hear about it before this morning?   Anything?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I didn't.              Q   Wasn't the President given an erroneous spin on  this for his own purpose?  For his speeches, for his arguments?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well again, I'm not sure.  Both  statements are true.  What the Labor Department has granted is that  mixing them in one sentence, essentially, was misleading.  They said  it was a mistake.  They said they wouldn't do it again.              Q   Did they drop it -- is this something that you  choose to spin or make an issue of?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Whenever fewer people are out of  work, we're gratified.  But that doesn't take away from the need to  get this jobs package going.              Q   If I could go back to the stimulus package for a  minute.  You said that the President plans to come forward with an  amendment.  Is the timetable still what it was -- that the amendment  would be laid down on Monday and voted on on Tuesday, or did he, in  the conversation with Dole, talk about the possibility of putting  that off for a few more days to give more time for the discussion?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think at this point there's no  changes in the schedule at all.  I don't know that they discussed the  timing like that.              Q   Do you believe that you're closer or getting closer  this week than you were last week?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I believe that we're going  to pass a jobs package.  The President is prepared to make  adjustments in order to get that to happen.  I don't know where the  votes are on cloture at this particular time.  I don't know what's  going to happen until we have a vote.  But the President believes  deeply in this jobs package and wants to get it done.              Q   Has there been any indication that this situation  has changed?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're going to continue to work on  it.  We'll know when the votes are taken.              Q   George, last week you said that there are -- or  various people in the administration were saying that you couldn't go  through Dole, you were going to have to try and go around him because  he was immovable on this subject of a compromise, or at least the  compromise he wanted was not anything like the one that you could  accept.  This week you're talking to him.  Is that because you've  realized that the peeling off effort wasn't going to work?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's because Senator Dole wanted  to talk to the President about the stimulus package.              Q   He initiated the conversation?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.              Q   Secretary Reich this morning said that, in fact,  the President is not willing to compromise on this bill at all.  You  say he's making --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know that that's exactly  what he said.  I think he said he didn't have any indication that  there was any compromises yet or that there would be a compromise,  and the President doesn't want to compromise.  And the President  doesn't want to compromise.  But if he has to make adjustments to get  it through, he will.              Q   Officials here yesterday said that Panetta was  working on a series of adjustments that might be made public before  the actual vote.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's possible.              Q   Today?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure exactly when that will  happen, but I think that it's very possible that we'll come forward  with some sort of a different package, or Senate Democrats will come  forward with some sort of a different package in order to get it  passed.              Q   As we understood his conversations with Dole, the  first one was some discussion of this and I'll get back to you  tonight with some details or some adjustments, or whatever the phrase  is.  Did he offer him some details or some adjustments?                MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it's a question of how  detailed.  I mean, I think they had a general discussion about the  package last night, subsequent to their conversation yesterday  afternoon.  I believe that there will be follow-up discussions today  in the Senate, not necessarily between the President and Senator  Dole.  And let me just reiterate, neither side has made specific  compromises at this date.  When we have something we'll let you know.   And I'm not suggesting that Senator Dole has accepted anything that  we've talked about or that we've offered anything in a hard way.              Q   What are the follow-up discussions if not the  President and Dole?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think Senator Mitchell is going  to talk to Senator Dole.              Q   Is that a threat?  (Laughter.)              Q   Did the President say to Senator Dole, all right,  how about this number as an overall size, or did Dole say to the  President, I can go as high as this?  Did they talk numbers?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think it was a negotiation  in that respect.  It was more of a discussion about their positions.              Q   Did they discuss actual numbers?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not sure.  I know they  talked about the basic outlines of the packages.  I think they talked  about the programs they cared about.  I don't know if they got to the  level of this many x-billion dollars.               Q   Does Dole have to sign off before there is a  package?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, of course not.              Q   Did the White House have anything to do with the  protesters who showed up in New Hampshire today where Senator Dole  was speaking?  Was that in any way organized by --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not to my knowledge, no.              Q   And has the President been in touch with Senators  Kohl or Feingold?                MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think he's talked to them,  no.              Q   George, is the President considering the more  palatable fact of having a national sales tax instead of having the  haves having to continuously pay for the have-nots?  And is he going  to scrap his proposed tax on the privileged few, with the haves  having to pay for the have-nots?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes deeply that  the tax rates on upper income Americans, as he presented in his  budget, should go up.  And I think for the second half of your  question, I'll refer you to my briefing from yesterday.              Q   George, on the subject of accuracy in information,  you suggested the other day that the stimulus package included money  that would solve the water problem in Milwaukee.  Apparently that is  not true.  It's actually waste water money.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's waste water money for  Wisconsin, and some could go to Milwaukee.               Q   But it would not affect the drinking water problem  because it's waste water money, right?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It would affect the water treatment  overall.               Q   But the implication from your statement the other  day was that it would help fix this disease problem in Milwaukee now.   Would you agree that's not the case?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure of the specifics.  I  know that it goes to the overall water treatment in Wisconsin.              Q   A leftover question from this morning, which was,  when did the President find out that the task force was deliberating  on a VAT?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure exactly when.  I just  don't know.  I assume it came up over the last -- certainly between  the time that we had commented on in the past and two days ago.                Q   So sometime since March 25th?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's right.  I don't know  the exact date.              Q   George, the President this morning mentioned that  some labor and business groups are for the VAT tax.  Apparently, the  National Association of Manufacturers talks about perhaps the VAT tax  being okay if it replaces the BTU tax.  So does the President feel  that perhaps this might be in place of some other tax he's proposed,  or is this totally in addition to the other taxes he's already  proposed?                MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we've said all we have to  say about the VAT at this point.  I mean, there's just no -- this is  being considered by the health care working groups, and that is all.   The President hasn't made any further decisions beyond that.               Q   But it would be to finance health care, it wouldn't  be to replace some other tax that finances -- it wouldn't replace the  income tax, for instance?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  There have been no discussions on  that.              Q   In terms of getting a VAT tax through Congress,  Senator Dole's press release today said VAT -- on tax day.  Do you  think -- does it have a chance of getting through Congress?  Would it  have a chance?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I have no idea.               Q   Is that a consideration whether you all put it  forward?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That would become a consideration  if the President were to decide to do it.  It's not in consideration  now.              Q   You said at the beginning of the briefing that  circumstances had changed and that had caused the VAT to now be under  consideration.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, what the President referred to  this morning.  These groups came forward and said this is something  that has to be considered.              Q   Those are the circumstances that have changed?   That's the only difference between now and when he emphatically ruled  it out that groups have asked it to be considered?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's what he said.               Q   Is that true?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.              Q   Was there, in fact, some understanding that sin  taxes would not produce enough money for the health care benefits?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not going to get into the  deliberations.              Q   But, George --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  What the consideration is, as  the President said, groups came forward and said this is something  you ought to consider.  The working groups are looking at it.               Q   Is that the only thing that's changed since his  prior statement and your prior statement on the VAT?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.              Q   Can you explain how those groups -- how that  information got to him that groups wanted it?  Was it just reading  the newspaper or did groups make presentations?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the groups -- as you know,  the health care task force has met with dozens of groups.              Q   But this is the President's knowledge that these  groups had come forward.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he was referring to what  was coming to the working groups.  Obviously, there have also been  published positions in the newspapers.              Q   Have certain groups briefed him on the group's  presentations to them?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if they've briefed him  -- I mean, how detailed the briefings have been.    I know that the  working groups decided to look into this after being pressed by these  groups.              Q   What kind of arguments did the groups make that  were persuasive enough that the President would change the position  that he had enunciated previously?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know, it's just they've had  longstanding positions that this would be a good way to finance  health care.              Q   The President wasn't aware of those longstanding  positions?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He may have been at some level.   Obviously, he's been a governor for a long time and he knows the  basic arguments for and against a VAT tax.              Q   What we're trying to figure out here -- you're  telling us that the only change, the only thing that affected this  change in the President's attitude toward the VAT between February  and now --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President's attitude hasn't  necessarily changed.  I mean, he has not made a decision.              Q   I know, but the President said that it was off the  table.  So did you.  And you're saying that the only thing that's  changed is the positions of these groups, except you're also  describing them as longstanding positions.  I don't see the change.   If these groups haven't had any change in their position that's been  made to the President --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, they've made the  presentations to the health care task force.              Q   There's no relationship at all between the fact  that sin taxes that he had said -- suggested in February that he  favored will not produce enough revenue to finance --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think he ever suggested  that they would produce all the revenue.              Q   Well, he suggested that he thought that those were  appropriate ways to finance health care.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He did say that.  I don't know that  he said anything to refute that.              Q   But, in fact, has the task force discovered that  there wouldn't be enough revenue from those taxes to finance the kind  of core benefits --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't think that the task  force ever suggested that there would.              Q   George, if he advocated a VAT tax, would that break  his promise not to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for his  programs?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't comment on a hypothetical  situation.                 Q   But does that promise -- would that promise not to  raise taxes on the middle class to pay for the programs prevent him  from seeking a VAT tax?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has made no decisions  on the VAT tax.  When he does, we'll tell you and we'll explain the  implications then.              Q   Which specific groups can you cite -- business,  labor or otherwise -- whose recommendations to the health care task  force has prompted this consideration?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't have the specific.  I just  don't have that.              Q   George, can you tell us to what extend these other  alternatives, for instance, the employer tax or the sin taxes or  other financing options are also still on the table and what these  options are?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, as members of the task force  and representatives of the working groups have said, they are looking  at a wide variety of options.  I think that Ira Magaziner said that  there are 20 different options under consideration.  But I'm not  going to comment --              Q   What's the scope --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not going to comment on  them, no.              Q   What's the scope of the need?  How much are you  talking about that has to be produced by one or a combination of the  --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's what the health care task  force is looking at.              Q   Since there's not going to be any briefing on the  Miyazawa visit, two questions:  One, generally what does the  President hope to use that meeting for, but more specifically, is his  task complicated by the Japanese anger over the Vancouver note and  the remark about market access at the press conference?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The Vancouver note?              Q   Does no mean yes.              Q   Yes and no.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I don't know.  I saw the  Prime Minister's press conference where he was asked the question  about that note and he gave a very gracious and complete answer when  he was asked the question.  The questions of trade are something that  certainly will be discussed between the Prime Minister and the  President.  There is obviously a trade imbalance between Japan and  the U.S. that we want to do something about.              Q   Also in those comments the Prime Minister made he  suggested that the United States should come down heavy on him in  terms of trade.  Are you going to oblige?                MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:   I think the President will state  our views on trade very clearly and our views on the trade deficit  very clearly.  I don't necessarily want to agree with your  characterization of the Prime Minister's comments.              Q      that we need specific export targets, specific  numerical targets -- is that what he's going to discuss with  Miyazawa?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They're going to have a broad  discussion of a wide range of trade issues.  I don't want to get into  those specifics until after the meeting.              Q   Why?              Q    That's the crux of the issue, right?  Whether or  not -- does the President believe that without specific numerical  targets, it is really, as he said in his press conference, sort of  hopeless that this is going to change very much?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that we must  have pressure on Japan to turn the trade imbalance around.  I do not  want to get into the specifics of how that would be done.              Q   But does the President believe that their stimulus  package announced yesterday will rectify the imbalance?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think, first, the President wants  to get a full briefing on the stimulus package from Prime Minister  Miyazawa himself, and then he'll make the comment on it.              Q   How about the Russian aid package?  There seems to  be some confusion about how the U.S. views that, Secretary  Christopher saying -- or Bentsen saying the Japanese may need to do  more, the Japanese saying that that's not what they heard?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, we're going to continue to  work with all our allies in the G-7, and we're going to continue to  press for help for Russian reform, Russian democratic reform.  And I  think that, so far, we had a very good announcement out of Tokyo and  we're going to continue to work with our allies for bilateral  packages.              Q   Do you think the Japanese need to do more?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're going to continue to work  with all our allies to do as much as we can.              Q   Secretary Christopher was asked today on the Today  Show this morning what he thought of Margaret Thatcher's comments on  the Bosnia policy.  And he said, \\\"It's a rather emotional response.\\\"         MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Over an emotional issue.              Q   Right -- to an emotional problem.  Does the White   House condone that kind of remark?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that Secretary  Christopher's remarks speaks for itself.  The President believes also  that this is a deeply troubling situation that we're trying to find  answers for.               Q   But that specific -- \\\"rather emotional response\\\" --  specific term?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, it speaks for itself.              Q   In connection with that, doesn't it seem that with  the numbers of people who are being killed at this very moment, is it  good American policy to put off some decisions that might be made now  to help Boris Yeltsin win a referendum?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  For example?              Q   To take stronger action, to take military action --  air strikes, anything that can be done?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that what  must be done now is to push harder for sanctions.  He is also -- as  you know, the administration has been discussing lifting the arms  embargo.  He believes those are the appropriate ways to increase  pressure at this time.              Q   What is your response to the critics who would say  that the U.S. is now stymied by trying to help Boris Yeltsin retain  the presidency?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They're wrong.  We're pressing hard  for the Serbs to come to the negotiating table.  We're pressing hard  for increased sanctions, and we're talking to our allies about the  arms embargo.              Q   You were putting great store in Vance and Owen  getting people to agree to that.  Now, Vance and Owen have both said  that military force to some extent would be acceptable.  Does that  change your thinking?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Clearly, we're going to listen to  whatever people who have put so much time into a situation have to  say.  But at this point, the President is moving forward on sanctions  and talking about the arms embargo.              Q   A follow-up on a Dee Dee comment this morning.  She  said she would be able to provide some administration officials who  could document the effect the sanctions are having in Bosnia.  Are  you going to be able to do that, or do you have anything --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think that's what she said.              Q   That's exactly what she said.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think that's true.  But  what she said -- we would look into the situation of what kind of  evidence can be provided in Bosnia.  Obviously, if there are  connections between the Bosnian Serbs and the Serbs in Belgrade and  we are tightening the screws on the Serbs in Belgrade, that will have  an effect over time.  I do not know day by day, minute by minute,  what kind of help is being given between the two and what the exact  effect has been.   But, clearly, we are slowing the shipment of goods  into Belgrade.  We are having an effect on the Serbs there.  What  kind of effect that will eventually have on the Bosnian Serbs I don't  know.  But one thing I would say is if it were having no effect at  all, I don't know why they'd be fighting it so much.              Q   Are the First Lady's tax returns going to be  released?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think there's a joint tax return.   And it will be probably later today.              Q   Is the President considering signing an executive  order banning discrimination against homosexuals in the federal work  force as part of the gay rights march here next week?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think there's any proposal  for that at this time, not that I know of.              Q   It's something that the President promised during  the campaign that he would do.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I have not seen any -- I don't  think it's anything that's on his plate right now.              Q   Is he meeting with gay rights leaders at any point  on this issue?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know about on this issue.   I assume that he'll meet with representatives of the gay and lesbian  community sometime soon, as he meets with representatives of lots of  different groups and communities.              Q   Do you know if that's scheduled --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's probably going to be tomorrow.              Q   Probably going to be tomorrow?  (Laughter.)              Q   It's a good thing you asked.              Q   Who's probably going to be there?  (Laughter.)              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.              Q   How long --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.  That's all I know.              Q   Do you know if it's at 3:00 p.m. tomorrow?   (Laughter.)              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know what time it is.  I  don't even know for sure if it's going to be tomorrow.              Q   Environmental groups have asked him to make a major  speech next week of some kind.  Is that going to happen, do you know?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if they've asked, but  I think the President has always planned, as he did last year, to  give a speech on Earth Day and I expect that he will.  If it's not  exactly on Earth Day, it might be a day before or something like  that.              Q   Is he planning to sign or announce the signing of  the biodiversity treaty in connection with Earth Day?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know the specific  timing of something like that, but it's certainly something under  discussion and something we've been working on.              Q   Campaign finance reform?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're working on it.              Q   Do you think it will be next week?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not sure.              Q   The biodiversity treaty is something you're working  on?  I missed the question.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, something we're working on.   He asked if it was ready to be signed, and I said I didn't know  anything about that but it's something we've certainly been working  on.              Q   Do you know what organizations might be represented  in this meeting with the gay and lesbian groups?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't.              Q   Do you know if he is going to reconsider being out  of town on the day of the march?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's got to be at the Senate  meeting in Jamestown, and I believe he's also going to be giving a  speech to the American Association of Newspaper Publishers in Boston  on Sunday, as he did last year.              Q   Would you have told us if she had not pressed you  on the question?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  On what?              Q   On the gays.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  When we went through the  President's schedule for the day, certainly.              Q?     George, what day is the publisher's speech?  Is  that Sunday?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it's a Sunday.              Q   And Saturday he'll be in Jamestown?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.              Q   So you're just going to be in Jamestown for one  day?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, I'm not sure.  I don't know how  long the Senate thing goes.  It might go overnight.  I just don't  know.              Q   You would have made the gay meeting public, right?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm certain if we had the meeting  -- I don't know about open to the press, but we would have told you  about it.              Q   I mean, because it is, as far as I can tell, the  first time in history a President has met in the Oval Office with --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I didn't say it was going to be in  the Oval Office.  (Laughter.)  But I didn't -- I'm not say that it's  not, but I didn't say that it was.  (Laughter.)              Q      at the White House in the Bush administration  gay officials were invited to a bill signing ceremony and the White  House had to repudiate having done that.  So I just wanted to make  sure --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the President wouldn't do  anything like that.              Q   Certainly not.              Q   What marching orders did the President give to  General Vessey?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They had a very good discussion for  about half an hour today.  He wanted -- the most important thing was  he had a full accounting for American POWs and MIAs.  He will  obviously look into the circumstances surrounding this new document.   The President stressed that he wanted the fullest possible accounting  and said that only when we have that can we even consider any changes  in our policy towards Vietnam.  He'll be looking at Vietnam's  response to the questions raised by the document and he'll also look  into investigations on discrepancy cases, increased efforts on  remains, implementing trilateral investigations -- and access to  military archives.                And Ambassador Toon also briefed the President on the  activities of the joint commission and on the document.              Q   Vietnam says it's a fake.  What is the DOD analysis  at this stage?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's not completed yet, and it's  also the first thing that General Vessey will bring up with the  Vietnamese.              Q   A number of Defense officials have been saying that  they think that the 600 or so prisoners referred to are, in fact,  non-Americans that the Vietnamese had captured who they referred to  as Americans from time to time.  Do people --               MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We don't have any final  determination.  We're going to wait for the complete review; when we  have it, we'll make a judgment.              Q   I know you don't have any final determination, but  given all of the intense public interest in this, do you think that  that's a likely possibility?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I just don't want to characterize  it in any way until the review is complete.              Q   George, was there a topic scheduled for the speech  in Boston?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.               Q   Is the President going to have a press conference  tomorrow with Miyazawa?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think so, but I'm not positive.   Yes, I expect, yes.              Q   Was Toon in with Vessey?                MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.               Q   He was in on the meeting?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.              Q   What was the question?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Was Ambassador Toon in with Vessey,  and the answer is yes.               Q   Do you have any response to The Wall Street Journal  report this morning the President's distressed about some of his  press clippings and that perhaps he's distressed with you about that?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  Well, I do have a response.  I  think the article was highly misleading to the extent that it implied  that the President has had restricted access to the press.  I would  point out that he's answered 358 questions on 77 occasions, more than  any of his predecessors. I would also point out it also --              Q   How many questions?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Three hundred fifty-eight, on 77  occasions.              Q   How many were while he was jogging?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, no, that's actually a very  good question, Andrea.  And I would point out further that the  article also implied that these questions were only answered at  tightly controlled photo opportunities, which is just patently false.   He's had 13 press conferences in either the East Room, the Oval  Office or the Roosevelt Room or the Briefing Room, in addition to  questions taken at photo opportunities, and that is only the --              Q   Oval Office press conference -- when was that?               MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's answered questions in the -- East Room.  He's had five in the East Room, he's had one in the Oval  Office, he's had one in the Rose Garden, he's had one or two in the  Roosevelt Room.  And this is just to the White House, Washington  Press Corps.  In addition to that, he's had 17 interviews with local  television anchors.  He's met with the editorial board of The  Portland Oregonian.  He's had an hour-long interview with Dan Rather.  He's had interviews with local press from California, Florida and  Connecticut --              Q   Can you address the question of the attitude?  The  article implies that he doesn't --              Q   Why doesn't he like us?  (Laughter.)              Q   Did you really get blamed for that Post story?              Q   The story is that you -- are you held responsible  for it.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think I'm going to comment  about this.              Q   Are you denying that the President has shown  displeasure publicly?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I am not commenting on the  discussions between the President and myself.              Q   Did the President write that letter to Chris  Webber?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  What?              Q   The letter to the University of Michigan basketball  player?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, yes.              Q   That is an authentic letter?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.              Q   Since the President first talked about the VAT in  February, he said at the time that he thought there probably should  be exceptions made in basic necessities such as food and clothing.   Does he still hold that position given the impact it could have?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I just can't comment on a  proposal he hasn't made.              Q   George, does the President have some agenda for  this meeting with the gay leaders tomorrow?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I think it will just a  general meeting on the wide range of issues that they care about  including AIDS and other issues -- civil rights.              Q   The military issue?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm certain it will come up.              Q   Is he using this event to name the AIDS --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think so.              Q   George, what specifically is the President doing to  prepare for tomorrow's meeting with the Prime Minister Miyazawa?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's had briefing memos.  He's had  general discussions with members of the Treasury Department, the  Trade Representative and others.              Q      report yet?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if he has the report  referred to in The Times, but Ambassador Kantor was here to brief him  today.              Q   He was?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.              Q   Does he intend to use any of these instances that  --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know that the  report's been presented.  But obviously, the President will press  hard in any case where he thinks that a violation has occurred.              Q   In terms of the Wall Street Journal, the thrust was  that there's a real schism here -- a hostility.  Do you think he  feels that way?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not at all.  As I said on the  record in the article, I think the President likes reporters.  Again,  I think that the thrust of the article was still misleading.  The  thrust of the article was that in some way, some attitude which the  President may or may not have is affecting access when, in fact, he  has the most open, accessible administration than have any in recent  history.        Q   Can we come up to your office?  (Laughter.)        MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  If you're invited.                THE PRESS:  Thank you.                                   END                    1:34 P.M.

As a result of the spacecraft entering Contingency Mode on April 9, all payload instruments were automatically powered off by on-board fault protection software.  Gamma Ray Spectrometer Random Access Memory was successfully reloaded on Monday, April 19.  To prepare for Magnetometer Calibrations which were rescheduled for execution in Flight Sequence C9 on Tuesday and Wednesday of next week, a reload of Payload Data System Random Access Memory will take place this morning beginning at 10:30 AM.  Over this weekend, the Flight Team will send real-time commands to perform Differential One-Way Ranging to obtain additional data for analysis by the Navigation Team.  Radio Science Ultra Stable Oscillator testing will take place on Monday .  The Flight Sequence C9 uplink will occur on Sunday, April 25, with activation at Midnight, Monday evening April 26.  C9 has been modified to include Magnetometer Calibrations which could not be performed in C8 due to Contingency Mode entry on April 9.  These Magnetometer instrument calibrations will allow the instrument team to better characterize the spacecraft-generated magnetic field and its effect on their instrument. This information is critical to Martian magnetic field measurements which occur during approach and mapping phases. MAG Cals will require the sequence to command the spacecraft out of Array Normal Spin state and perform slew and roll maneuvers to provide the MAG team data points in varying spacecraft attitudes and orientations.\",\"Yes, it's possible... in fact, there's some gl widget code in /usr/lpp/GL somewhere... (it's named Glib.c; my IBM's down right now though, so I can't find the exact location :)    WARNING: this code feels quite bogus. It does things like calling noport() before winopen(), and then extracting an X window id from it anyway. It worked just fine under aix 3.1; I spent last weekend trying to port it to 3.2 (gl under 3.2 doesn't seem to like it), and it's turning into a Hard Job.    Check out your \\\"info\\\" pages; it has some pretty good documentation on whan you can and can't do when mixing gl and X, and how to go about doing so.\",\"        Not provable.  It's about as \\\"provable\\\" as the number of votes vast for Bill Clinton in the last election.  If you accept the information available, you can prove one way or the other.  If you refuse to accept it, nothing is \\\"provable.\\\"         Fine, support your assertation.  But, you haven't supported any assertations just yet.        The National Crime Survey, that secret Arm of the NRA, estimates between 40,000 and 50,000 with-gun self-defenses from assaults, and is considered to considerably under-report.  When broken down by weapon, there is no form of \\\"self-defense\\\" including dowing nothing which is more effective at avoiding injury or death.         Ok, support *this* assertation.  Hell, support *one*.         That's nice.         That's nice, too.          Why on Earth should we?  If you're correct we've nothing to lose by continuing to argue against it and everything to gain. \",\"Archive-name: cryptography-faq/part10 Last-modified: 1993/4/15   FAQ for sci.crypt, part 10: References  This is the tenth of ten parts of the sci.crypt FAQ.

I bought it, but will not purchase anything of his ever again without THOROUGHLY looking at it first.  What tripe.  The book is inconsistent, and filled with selective analysis.  James claims to be looking forward, and then makes some absolutely bizarre statements of value.  Not only that, but I got the impression he probably glanced at the book for about an hour before he put his name on it.   To say I was disappointed is a grand understatement.  \",\"According to what I have read on Biblical idioms, speaking \\\"in X's name\\\" is a standard Aramaic/Hebrew legal idiom for what we today would call Power of Attorney.  A person from Jesus' culture authorized to conduct business \\\"in John's name\\\" had full authority over John's financial affairs, but was held under a solemn fiduciary obligation to work only for John's benefit and consonant with John's wishes.  It was not required for the steward to preface each business transaction with \\\"in John's name\\\"; it was sufficient to have valid power of attorney and be operating in good faith. (Note the overlap here between legal and religious definitions of \\\"faith\\\".)  With this cultural background, praying \\\"in Jesus' name\\\" does not mandate a particular verbal formula; rather it requires that the petitioner be operating faithfully and consciously within an analogous \\\"fiduciary\\\" relationship with Jesus and for the purposes of His Kingdom.  The message of \\\"praying in Jesus' name\\\" is thus closely aligned with the parable of the talents and other passages about God's delegation of Kingdom business to his stewards, both resources and responsibilities.  This idea of praying \\\"in Jesus' name\\\" is not only present but prominent in the Lord's Prayer, although the verbal forumula is absent.  The act of praying the words \\\"In Jesus' Name\\\" may be beneficial if they cause us to clarify the relationship of our requests to the advancement of God's Kingdom.  For that reason, I'm not quite ready to say that the praying the formula is without meaning.  Prayers to God for other purposes (desperation, anger, thanksgiving, etc.) don't seem to be in this category at all, whether uttered by Christian or non-Christian, whether B.C. or A.D. (that's B.C.E. or C.E. for you P.C. :-).  I don't see anything in Christ's words to contradict the idea that God deals with all prayers according to His omniscience and grace.

(BTW, as of a couple years ago, the most stolen bikes in Orange County and SF were 750 GSX's and Ninjas). Probably the biggest reason BMWs aren't ripped off is that most people who buy BMWs will only deal with the actual BMW dealer, or mail- order types. Most of these can have their inventory checked fairly easily by law-enforcement types, and their mark-up is usually sufficient to keep  them honest about acquiring parts.   For Harleys and rice-rockets, you've got 2 different situations. There is a HUGE aftermarket in Harley parts, so a bike can be parted out fairly easily. Ditto the non-sport Japanese bikes, but the prices on the parts for these are not as high, comparatively. For the 'rockets', anytime a bike goes down, the  plastic is usually cracked, and is expensive to replace. It's fairly easy, then, for a disreputable shop to take a fairing from a stolen bike, slap it on a bike in for repair, repaint it, and make a tidy profit. The other parts, more traceable, can be used, or discarded if they are too traceable.  Mike\",\":    Watch us soar in 1993!

This is a rating system used by ARPA and other organisations to measure the maturity of a `software process' i.e. the entire process by which software gets designed, written, tested, delivered, supported etc.  See `Managing the Software Process', by Watts S. Humphrey, Addison Wesley 1989. An excellent software engineering text. The 5 levels of software process maturity are:  1. Initial 2. Repeatable 3. Defined 4. Managed 5. Optimizing  The levels are approximately characterized as follows:  1. no statistically software process control. Have no statistical    basis for estimating how large software will be, how long it will    take to produce, how expensive it will be, or how reliable it will    be.  Most software production is at this level.  2. stable process with statistical controls, rigorous project    management; having done something once, can do it again. Projects    are planned in detail, and there is software configuration    management and quality assurance.  3. The process is defined and understood, implementation is    consistent. This includes things like software inspection, a    rigorous software testing framework, more configuration management,    and typically a `software engineering process group' within the    project.  4. Statistical information on the software is systematically gathered    and analysed, and the process is controlled on the basis of this    information. Software quality is measured and has goals.  5.

Seemed to trigger arthritis-like problems.  Sue\",\"Golgotha the whole process of the fall of man  This was precisely my point.  From a theological bent, those who lived immediately after the flood, such as Noah, Ham, his son Cush, and his son Nimrod had a much stronger appreciation of Divine wrath.  They also had a stronger understanding of the True God.  In fact, this immediacy was a cause of hardship for some, so much so that Atlas, who is seen with heavens resting on his shoulders.  But this is not merely the physical heavens that he is lifting.  It is to put God and the strict spirituality of His law at a distance, and thus he became the \\\"Elevator of the heavens.\\\"  This \\\"god\\\" made men able to \\\"feel\\\" as if heaven were afar off and \\\"as if either the God of Heaven could not see through the dark cloud, or did not regard with displeasure the breakers of His laws.\\\"  It is interesting to see that it was that was titled \\\"Emancipator\\\" or \\\"Deliverer\\\"  or Phoroneus. It was Nimrod who invaded the patriarchal system and abridged the liberties of mankind, yet was worship for having given many benefits.  He was a deliverer all right but not as we think of Christ as a Deliverer.  One delivered from a conscious feeling of God's wrath, the other actually performed a delivery from Gods wrath and it is up to us to accept it as true.   I don't see the problem.  From the time of Adam, those who looked forward to the coming \\\"Anointed One\\\" and put their faith in the fact that it was God who was to do the provision, were accounted as righteous.  But up to the Crucifixion, their sins were only covered, not taken away.  Therefore, the dispensation of the Church views the accountability of sin the same, but see it as a completed action.  Rom's makes it clear that it has always been salvation via faith and nothing else.   I understand what you're trying to convey, but I don't think I'd lay hold of it because the scriptures do equate the eternality of the second death with the eternality of, say the Church ruling with Christ.  Jn 17 tells us what eternal life is exactly, as you are correct that it is much more than non-cessation of consciousness.     It depends upon your def of \\\"lost.\\\"  The elect were lost only in time as outside of time they had been chosen from the foundation of the world.  Existentially we were all born \\\"lost\\\", but the \\\"righteous\\\" were \\\"in Christ\\\" and therefore never *assuredly* lost.    Maybe this summer I could find time to put together a paper on it.  I simply have to buy more books for myself, and these older books are very expensive.  Either that or countless trips to the oriental museum.   Couldn't agree with you more.  Our understanding, of say eschatology, is clearly clearer than that of, say Isaiah.  But that is not what I was referring to.    No, I understand it as you have said. This was my point.   Ah!  This is it.  This is the big question.  However, I would say, again I think, that the best lie is one that has an appreciable amount of truth to it.  Look at Satan's twist of God's Word when he coerced Eve.  That is a very interesting study.   >The similarity in the midst of great variety of  Yes, that is my point.  But it is a two edged sword. For some do not want the underlying reality to be revealed.  They were not known as \\\"mystery\\\" religions for no reason.  There was the public side of them and there was the private side, that was so protected that the initiates to an oath of death if they revealed that private side.  That is why it is so hard to bring their teachings to light. The \\\"Mystery of Iniquity\\\" that we find in the Bible, correlates to this I think.  The primary object of the mysteries was to introduce privately, little by little, under the seal of secrecy and sanction of oath, what it would not have been safe to openly profess was the true religion.  Case in point today might be the Masons.  (Just a note, that they too worshipped Osiris in Egypt, who can be traced to Nimrod, the \\\"husband son.\\\")   No, I disagree with you here Gerry.  I know what you're alluding to in that the church, primarily the RCC, did endorse Aristotelian philosophy into their worldview, but I would disagree with you that it originated in Greece.  If you are a student of history, you will come to see that much of what Greece came to expound to the world as their original, was just an adulteration of that which they had taken from conquered countries.  The soul is clearly mentioned and discussed at length in the Egyptian religions. As was the unity of God and also the trinity of God.  See if you can find Wilkinson's \\\"Egyptians.\\\"  He really does a number on what the Greeks did to what they \\\"pilfered\\\" from the Egyptians.

This has highlighted the need for citizens to be able to defend themselves and their children against the excesses of their own government.\\\"     \\\"Any suggestion by opponents that this bill will increase crime is a  distortion of the facts, at best.  The aggressive outreach by officials in central Florida to train and arm women has led to a dramatic drop in the level of assault and rape in that area.  Of course, this program is a rare gem, as many law enforcement officials apparently believe that an unarmed citizenry will be easier to control, and thus favor tighter  restrictions.\\\"      \\\"The vote today is a tribute to the good sense of the public at large who are putting their lives on the line every day as they go about their lawful affairs.  The entire country knows how vulnerable the average  citizen is, both to attacks from criminals and from armed assault by our own police.  Texas lawmakers who voted for this concealed handgun bill have shown total understanding for those innocent, law-abiding citizens on the front lines, and the families of those who have fallen.\\\"      \\\"I urge the House of Representatives to pay attention to the needs of their constituents, and not be stampeded by ill-conceived arguments from ideological fanatics.\\\"  Ain't propaganda fun?

The controller is a Toshiba MFM controller, with an additional 9 pins connector.  There are 2 busses from my harddisk to this controller. One with 9 wires and another with 34 wires.  The controller has two connectors for a 9 wire-bus and one for a 34 wire bus.  Now I got a 20 MB harddisk from a friend of mine, and I wondered whether I can connect this second harddisk to the same controller (there is room for a 9 wire-bus, but not for the 34 wire bus)  How can I solve my problem, any suggestions?

All they are are fluorescent bulbs  without the phosphor, and a UV transparent bulb (special glass).  I've also seen incandescent versions that you screw into an ordinary 120VAC socket, probably not what you want.   As far as I know, near UV (as opposed to far-UV) is longwave UV (near the visible spectrum).  Longwave UV is safer as far as accidental (I hope) exposure to the eyes.  As far as fluorescent minerals go (the reason a friend has a UV lamp), some only respond to only one of short or long UV.  Hope this helps.

But yes, you've got the idea -- the reboost is done by taking the whole shuttle up.   Somebody has to build that thruster module; it's not an off-the-shelf item.  Nor is it a trivial piece of hardware, since it has to include attitude control (HST's own is not strong enough to compensate for things like thruster imbalance), guidance (there is no provision to feed gyro data from HST's own gyros to an external device), and separation (you don't want it left attached afterward, if only to avoid possible contamination after the telescope lid is opened again).  You also get to worry about whether the lid is going to open after the reboost is done and HST is inaccessible to the shuttle (the lid stays closed for the duration of all of this to prevent mirror contamination from thrusters and the like).  The original plan was to use the Orbital Maneuvering Vehicle to do the reboost.  The OMV was planned to be a sort of small space tug, well suited to precisely this sort of job.  Unfortunately, it was costing a lot to develop and the list of definitely-known applications was relatively short, so it got cancelled.\",\" Mexico City, Bogota, La Paz?   ---  An unconventional remedy that you might try for altitude sickness in the Andes is chewing coca leaves or taking teas made from coca leaves.

One of the chapters in Palmer and Thorn's 'Hidden Game' is titled 'Pitching is 44% of Baseball,' implying that fielding is 6%.  How do they determine that?  Beats me -- it's been a long, long time since I read it.  One also has to separate offense into batting and baserunning, with the split probably somewhere around 49.5% and 0.5%. --\",\" No, but some OS's ( COHERENT , etc ) are able to drive one of the ports in polled mode without using the IRQ. In your example, after accessing the modem, the mouse won't work until you reboot, because the IRQ is used by the modem.   Yes, you can change the IRQ's for com3/4, but it depends on your other hardware. com1 uses IRQ4, com2 IRQ3.  If you have only one printerport  ( IRQ7 ), you can change com3 to IRQ5 ( normally 2nd printer ). For com4, you can assign IRQ2, if its free. As far as I know, no other IRQ can be used until your I/O-card is 16bit and caould access IRQ's > 8.

A couple of years I was involved in a low-speed getoff in which I landed on my back on the pavement.  My head (helmeted) hit the pavement with a \\\"clunk\\\", leaving a couple of dings and chips in the paint at the point of impact, but no other visible damage.  I called the helmet manufacturer and inquired about damage.  They said that the way a fiberglass shell works is to first give, then delaminate, then crack. This is the way fiberglass serves to spread the force of the impact over a wider area.  After the fiberglass has done its thing, the crushable foam liner takes care of absorbing (hopefully) the remaining impact force. They told me that the second stage of fiberglass functionality (delamination of the glass/resin layers) can occur with NO visible signs, either inside or outside of the helmet.  They suggested that I send them the helmet and they would inspect it (including X-raying).  I did so.  They sent back the helmet with a letter stating that that they could find no damage that would compromise the ability of the helmet to provide maximum protection. (I suspect that this letter would eliminate their being able to claim prior damage to the helmet in the event I were to sue them.)  The bottom line, though, is that it appears that a helmets integrity can be compromised with no visible signs.  The only way to know for sure is to send it back and have it inspected.  Note that some helmet manufacturers provide inspections services and some do not.

SCSI-1{faster} this requires a SCSI-2 controller chip and provides  SCSI-2 {8-bit to 16-bit} speeds with SCSI-1 controlers. SCSI-2: 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst{8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit},  and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst{32-bit/wide and fast}.  16-bit SCSI can be wide or fast, it depends on how the port is designed{The Quadras will support fast SCSI but not wide when the OS SCSI manager is rewritten since the Quardas use a SCSI-1 {non-wide} port}.  The article in PC Mag 4/27/93:29 was talking about SCSI-1 {SCSI-2 uses TEN (10) devices in it native mode, outside its native mode it behaves a lot like SCSI-1 (7 devices, slower through put}  From your own figures SCSI-1 is indeed twice ESDI as the article pointed out as for \\\"20% faster then IDE\\\" that seems to be 8-bit SCSI-1 using a SCSI-2  contoler chip {The Mac Quadra uses a SCSI-2 controler chip for its SCSI-1 and gets 6MB/s through put for asynchronous {8-bit} SCSI-1, far in excess of a normal SYNCHRONOUS SCSI-1 output} 120% of 8.3 is 9.96 which is near the burst of a SCSI-1 machine with a SCSI-2 controller chip.  The PC world seems to have SCSI-1 and SCSI-2 mixed up.  Fact is SCSI-2  controler chips allow near SCSI-2 speeds through a SCSI-1 device {As shown in the Mac Quadra} which skews some of the data of SCSI-1 vs IDE or ESDI test. I agree that the article COULD have stated that the \\\"20% faster then IDE\\\" came off a SCSI-1 device with a SCSI-2 chip.  Maybe it was there and the EDITOR killed it because the article was dealing with SCSI-1 NOT SCSI-2 and he did not understand the effect of a SCSI-1 device with a SCSI-2 controller chip. SCSI-1 chips are limited to 5/MB max.  SCSI-1 devices with SCSI-2 chips {becoming common} produce up to 10Mb/s in 8-bit mode and 20MB/s in 16-bit mode {the fast version, SCSI-1 ports cannot use wide SCSI}.  Of cource the prime piece of wierdness is that SCSI-1 devices HAVE SCSI-2 chips {or more accurately the machine does}. This allows the best of BOTH worlds: high SCSI-2 speeds and cheeper SCSI-1 costs {FULL SCSI-2 hardware (port, electronic controller, etc) is VERY expensive.

The biggest proponent of proposing was Dr. Lewis Branscomb.  Dr. Branscomb was the IBM Chief Scientist and had come to IBM from NBS.  Fortunately for all of us, Dr. Branscomb understood the answer to the above question much better than I.  He realized how difficult it would be to gain acceptance for any cryptographic mechanism.  Because of the necessary complexity, publicity would not be sufficient and neither would  authority.  In fact, it has taken both of those plus more than 15  years.  We have also had independence.  The DES was solicited by NBS, invented and proposed by IBM, and vetted by NBS.  It has also been examined and vetted by experts like Adi Shamir, who are not subject to influence by any of these.  Even now, there are still people posting on this list who do not trust the DES in spite of all the time, all of the analysis, and all of the public scrutiny.  (Of course, it is just this point that NIST misses when it attempts to  gain acceptance for a novel mechanism, developed in secret, on the basis of authority alone.)  We had a long thread here about whether or not the NSA can \\\"break\\\" the DES.  That is a silly question.  At some cost and in some time they can \\\"break\\\" anything.  The important question is at what cost and in what time.  The fundamental strength of the DES and RSA are not nearly so important as what we know about their strength.  As long as we understand the cost and duration for an attacker, then we can use them in a safe way. At this point, we may never replace either because of the inability of any successor to overcome this knowledge gap.  DES and RSA are among the most significant inventions of the century and the most important inventions in the history of cryptography. We are damned lucky to have them.\",\" It works on xterms.

First, in February, the Russians deployed a 20-m reflector from a Progress vehicle after it had departed from the Mir Space Station.  While this \\\"Banner\\\" reflector was blank, NPO Energia was very active in reporting that future  Banner reflectors will be available to advertisers, who could use a space- based video of their logo or ad printed on the Banner in a TV commercial, as filmed from the Mir.    The second development, has been that Space Marketing Inc, the same company responsible for merchandising space on the Conestoga booster and COMET spacecraft, is now pushing the \\\"Environmental Billboard\\\".  As laid out by SMI Chief Engineer Dr Ron Humble of the University of Colorado Space Laboratory and Preston Carter of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the \\\"Environmental Billboard\\\" is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to 804x1609 meters.  Advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area, deployed by the inflatable 'frame'.    To help sell the concept, the spacecraft responsible for maintaining the billboard on orbit will carry \\\"ozone reading sensors\\\" to \\\"continuously monitor the condition of the Earth's delicate protective ozone layer,\\\" according to Mike Lawson, head of SMI. Furthermore, the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum exposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the Earth's atmosphere. According to IMI, \\\"as the biodegradable material burns, it will release ozone-building components that will literally replenish the ozone layer.\\\" The remaining spacecraft will monitor the atmosphere for another year before it, too, re-enters and burns up and \\\"adds to the ozone supply.\\\"    This would not be a cheap advertisement, costing at least several millions of dollars (exact costs were not available).  But SMI estimates that market exposure would be 3-5X that of the people who watched the SuperBowl, where a 30-second advertising 'unit' cost $600,000.  Since SMI is located in Atlanta, Georgia, it is being promoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta.    But back to Brian's questions:        See above. As for serious -- if they can get $15-20 M or so (my estimate of $5-10 for development costs and a flight unit, plus $10-15 M for a launch), then it's probably real.  They are claiming to tailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for optimum advertising impact so they probably can't piggy back upon someone else's planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated launch.  That's a $10-15 M cost they need to raise, right there.     And there will probably be some legal challenges to this as well.  Note there is one potential legal challenge to SMI on the use of launch vehicle advertising already.  While I don't think the legal challenges would win out (and yes, I am an amateur astronomer, and no, I don't really like the idea of this additional light pollution, but I know of no prohibition of it...),  the legal challenges and court fights would probably remove any positive aspects of the advertising.  I can imagine several ways to make the advertisers look like louts for doing this -- which would change positive market exposure to negative market exposure, and negate the space advertising advantage.  (Would you spend $15 M to look like an idiot?)    (And light pollution might not be too bad -- if it's in a low enough orbit, and it relies upon reflected light only, it would only be visible for a short time just after local dusk and before dawn.  For maximum market exposure, you want to have it visible just after dusk --minimizing impact on astronomy, since that's the time of worse seeing due to day/night thermal turbulence.  It might still be a problem, but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this...)     As for having real funding -- none that I can identify.  There were about 60 expressions of interest made on the Conestoga advertising opportunity, but that included curious folks and was for only a $500,000 commitment.  I haven't heard of any serious funding for this, but I'm sure they are shopping the venture around looking for some money in order to flesh out the concept some more.  But I am confident there are no firm or paying customers at this time.       And if anybody wants to cross-post this to sci.astro, please be my guest.

In other words, I think that statements like gods are or somehow interfere with this world are false or meaningless. In Ontology, one can fairly conclude that when \\\"A exist\\\" is meaningless A does not exist. Under the Pragmatic definition of truth, \\\"A exists\\\" is meaningless makes A exist even logically false.   A problem with such statements is that one can't disprove a subjective god by definition, and there might be cases where a subjective god would even make sense. The trouble with most god definitions is that they include some form of objective existence with the consequence of the gods affecting all. Believers derive from it a right to interfere with the life of others.     (Deletion)\",\"  : [ The discussion begins: why does the universe exist at all?  ]   : One of the Laws of Nature, specifying cause and effect seems to dictate  : (at least to this layman's mind) there must be a causal event.  No : reasonable alternative exists.  I would argue that causality is actually a property of spacetime;  causes precede their effects. But if you claim that there must be an answer to \\\"how\\\" did the universe (our spacetime)  emerge from  \\\"nothing\\\", science has some good candidates for an answer.  I have always wondered why Christians use the \\\"There are questions science (or atheism) cannot answer\\\" argument; I hope this is the appropriate group to ask this question.  The most popular question is the question of origins. Why does the universe exist, or anything, for that matter?  I think this question should actually be split into two parts, namely  1) Why is there existence? Why anything exists?  and  2) How did the universe emerge from nothing?  It is clear science has nothing to say about the first question. However, is it a meaningful question, after all?  I would say it isn't. Consider the following:  A die-hard skeptic being (be it human or whatever) attempts to doubt one's very existence. Since it is so easy to doubt everything else - I cannot be _sure_ the world exists, it may be my mind fooling me - can I ever be sure I exist?  However, it is only possible to exist or not to exist. (Someone insert an appropriate Shakespeare quote here ;-) )  A being that does not exist cannot doubt one's existence. A being that does exist can doubt one's existence, but this would be pointless - the being would exist anyway.  Let us return to the original question: why? A being that does not exist does not need any reasons for its non-existence. This being is not _sure_ whether anything else exists but his mind, but let us assume that the world exists independent of the mind (the objectivity postulate). The question \\\"why anything exists\\\" can be countered by demanding answer to a question \\\"why there is nothing in nothingness, or in non-existence\\\". Actually, both questions turn out to be devoid of meaning. Things that exist do, and things that don't exist don't exist. Tautology at its best.  I seriously doubt God could have an answer to this question.  Some Christians I have talked to have said that actually, God is Himself the existence. However, I see several problems with this answer. First, it inevitably leads to the conclusion that God is actually _all_ existence, good and evil, devils and angels, us and them. This is pantheism, not Christianity.  Another answer is that God is the _source_ of all existence. This sounds much better, but I am tempted to ask: Does God Himself exist, then? If God is the source of His own existence, it can only mean that He has, in terms of human time, always existed. But this is not the same as the source of all existence. This argument sounds like God does not exist, but meta-exists, and from His meta-existent perspective, He created existence. I think this is actually a nonsolution, a mere twist of words.  The best answer I have heard is that human reasoning is incapable of understanding such questions. Being an atheist myself, I do not accept such answers, since I do not have any other methods.  The second question: How did the universe emerge from nothing? belongs to the domain of science, and I, for one, do not doubt the question can be answered by its methods. Many cosmologists have suggested that it is entirely possible for universes to emerge from vacuum (this possibility has been suggested in a recent Hawking biography; see also Lizhi & Shuxian: Creation of the Universe, World Scientific, 1989). However, I think the sci groups are more appropriate for discussions like this.   : As far as I can tell, the very laws of nature demand a \\\"why\\\".  That isn't : true of something outside of nature (i.e., *super*natural).  This is not true. Science is a collection of models telling us \\\"how\\\", not why, something happens. I cannot see any good reason why the \\\"why\\\" questions would be bound only to natural things, assuming that the supernatural domain exists. If supernatural beings exist, it is as appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist.   : I believe the \\\"genetic code\\\" will be entirely deciphered in our lifetimes, : but we will not see man convert entirely inert material into self sustaining,  : reproducing life, *ever*.  (I've never been much of a prophet, though. I : can't even *picture* New York in my mind 8^] ).  I don't believe *any* : technology would be able to produce that necessary *spark* of life, despite : having all of the parts available. Just my opinion.  This opinion is also called vitalism; namely, that living systems are somehow _fundamentally_ different from inanimate systems. Do Christians in general adopt this position? What would happen when scientists announce they have created primitive life (say, small bacteria) in a lab?  There is a problem with your prophecy: artificial life has been created, although not yet in a chemical form. Computer simulations of evolution contain systems that are as much alive as any bacterium, although their code is electronic, as well as their metabolism. See a recent book  Steven Levy: Artificial life - The Quest for a New Creation. Jonathan Cape, London 1992.  Artificial chemical life is just around the corner - after all, no  spark of life has been found to be necessary; living systems do not violate any physical laws as we know them.   : You don't mind if a few of us send up a prayer on your behalf during your : research, do you?  After all, if we of Christ are deluding ourselves, you : really have nothing to worry about, eh?  Exactly. This is why I think atheists should _not_ post any evangelical atheist arguments to soc.religion groups, since people who seek to  find peace in religions must be allowed to gather together. I would normally have asked these questions in alt.atheism or talk.religion.misc, but it seems many Christians do not read these groups.

Two weeks ago I registered a concern about some programming that was being conducted by a student organisation here at the University of Texas at San Antonio.  As a result, I was interrogated by the capus police, who also attempted to create a positive-identification file (photo, fingerprints, etc.). I refused to permit this, and filed a complaint with the University administration.  The Vice-President for Business Affairs (the 'boss' of the campus police) stated that he had no interest in the legal/Constitutional implications of those actions. \",\"Hello,      I'm investigating the purchase of an Object Oriented Application Framework.  I have come across a few that look good:    Zapp 1.1 from Inmark   Zinc 3.5 from Zinc software   C++/Views from Liant   Win++ from Blaise  Some considerations I'm using:    Being new to Windows programming (I'm from the UNIX/X world), the quality and intuitivness of the abstraction that these class libraries provide is very  important.  However, since I'm not adverse to learning the internals of Windows programming, the new programming methodology should be closely aligned with the native one.  I don't believe arbitrary levels of abstraction, just for the sake of changing the API, are valuable.    Since we will be developing for the 32bit Windows NT system the memory management issues and issues particular to the Windows 3.1 API are less important.     We will probably buy another C++ class library (something like Tools.h++ or Booch components from Rational) to handle data structures and other miscellaneous stuff  (allocators etc...).  So those features are not that important for this toolkit to have.  The two that I have narrowed it down to are ZApp and Zinc, they seem to be the two toolkits that have received the most attention from the media.  I was wondering if anyone had any first-hand experience with any of these toolkits (especially ZApp and Zinc).  A couple of observations about these toolkits that seem particularly noteworthy are:  ZApp ----   Seems to have the most extensive coverage of Windows functionality and     also includes some other miscellaneous useful classes.   Has new fancy 3D-style controls available, and support for custom controls.   Has a Windows NT version (Essential)   Redirectable graphics display/output architecture (useful for printing)   Sizer class for automatically managing control layout after resize.   Seems to be the newcomer, this could be an advantage in designing a better system.   Zinc ----   Has a platform independent resource strategy.  (Not too important for me right now)   Comes with a interface builder tool   Has a Windows NT version (Essential)   Seems to have been around longer (more mature), but grew up out of a DOS version.     Had a better demo :-)  Both have source code availability options Both are lacking OLE support Neither seem to have any particular support for multimedia type stuff   Any thoughts anyone has on this would be much appreciated,  Thanks,   Brett Harper \",\"Could someone tell me how to make/find/get the best frontplate for IIvi/IIvx/C650 with internal SyQuest drive?

I limit myself to *one* 'standard serving' of alcohol if I'm going to ride. And mostly, unless the alcohol is something special (fine ale, good wine, or someone else's vsop), I usually just don't drink *any*.  But then alcohol just isn't really important to me, mainly for financial reasons...

Specs for the 68040 can fill a 500 page book.

That sort of trick can't really be done with CISC architectures.  I finally saw some details on the 586/Pentium and was not greatly impressed.  They've finally done some work on the FPU to get it up to speed, but otherwise it's only going to be a 2x speedup.

Please post the number if you've got it!  Thanks. \",\" Gawd, I love Windows :-)   You'll probably want to delete any damaged executables and reload them fresh.  Data files should be examined and repaired.   You're not stupid.  Smartdrive caches things, and Windows also runs a swap file which may contain data also.  All of this is pretty risky stuff in a PC environment.   A reasonably accurate prediction...   Here's a brief description of how DOS stores files:  There are three pieces to a file.  The directory entry, the FAT chain, and the data area.  You can think of these as a sheet of lined notebook paper, a sheet of graph paper, and a stack of 3X5 cards.  The directory entry (notebook paper) holds the file name, actual size, and first cluster number.  It also holds some other information that's not important right now.  The File Allocation Table (FAT) chain (graph paper) tells where to find the actual data.  Each square of graph paper holds a number.  If the number is zero, the cluster associated with this box is available.  If it holds a \\\"magic\\\" number, it is either the last piece of a file or a bad (unuseable) spot on the disk.  Any other number tells which cluster contains the next section of the file.  The data area (3X5 cards) is where the actual information is stored. The data area is organized as clusters of a fixed size; storage is doled out in \\\"chunks\\\" of one cluster each.  (In your case, one cluster is 2048 bytes.)  As a cluster is filled, another is allocated.  To read a file, you first look at the directory entry to get the starting cluster number.  Now you read the data from that cluster. Next, look at the FAT entry for the cluster you just read.  This will tell you the cluster number for the next chunk of the file. Naturally, these numbers are usually sequential, but they can jump around and even go backwards.  Continue reading, one cluster at a time, as you walk this chain through the FAT, until you hit the marker which says it's the last cluster in the file.  CHKDSK is the DOS utility that checks the sanity and coherence of the directories and the FAT and can bludgeon most flaws into submission.  It doesn't have any intelligence, so you have to double-check anything it \\\"fixes\\\".  Now let's do a bit of a post-mortem:   All of these files have sizes (according to the FAT) which don't match the size reported in their directory entries.  CHKDSK /F will alter the directory entries to match the FAT size.  (In other words,   the directory entry for CVPIC.EXE may say the file is 64,877 bytes long. But CHKDSK found a FAT chain of 43 clusters attached to it.  (My numbers, obviously, are made up.))   Disk space was found which is allocated in the FAT, but is not attached to any directory entry.  CHKDSK /F gives you the option of converting these \\\"lost chains\\\" to files.  You can then examine the files (FILE0000.CHK through FILE0223.CHK) and rename or discard them.  Or, if you tell CHKDSK _not_ to convert them to files, then those clusters will simply be marked \\\"available\\\" in the FAT.    ...   These files are both referencing the _same_ data cluster.  Obviously, one of them (at least) must be wrong.  It's interesting to note that C:\\\\386SPART.PAR is your Windows swap file...  To fix this, you should copy each cross-linked file to a new name. This will \\\"fix\\\" the cross-link by giving the files unique data spaces. Now delete the cross-linked files.  Examine the copies and try to assemble them properly.  Good luck.  (Hint:  \\\"Missing pieces\\\" are likely to be found in those \\\"lost chains\\\" at the top...)   Your disk is pretty close to full.  This may be the actual cause of the problem; perhaps Windows needed to expand its swapfile by an amount which exceeded available disk space...  In any case, the short summary is that something trashed your FAT. There are utilities that can mirror your FAT and help repair damage after something like this, but you have to run them _before_ the problem occurs.  Sorry.   --  ---------------------------------------------------- Gordon S.

This little beauty is an 8088 / Z80 luggable with a 4 or 5 inch screen (monochrome CGA) and 2 360 floppies.       For serial ports it has 2 DB-15 connectors (one is labled 'printer') and I can't figure out the pinouts for them.  I also don't know if they  are standard com ports addressable as COM1 and COM2.

Thanks.\",\"I suspect that this clipper thing could backfire on the Gov in a big hurry. I expect that products using these chips will socket them rather than soldering them, since once the keys are handed over by the escrow agencies, the chip is so much garbage, and will need to be replaced. I expect that someone will come along with a pin compatible chip that uses secure encryption -- possibly even disguised so that it's not possible to tell it from the clipper chip until you try to use the 2 backdoor keys.     If I were to manufacture such a chip, as part of my marketing strategy, I would try to subvert one or both escrow agencies either through bribes or industrial espionage -- and then publicize the fact. (doing my best not to be connected with such activities -- which would likely not be legal :-) Publicly discrediting the escrow agencies would go quite far towards creating a market for a secure alternative.    I also believe that someone will reverse engineer the clipper chip, and knowlege of the algorithm will likely be fairly widespread. Any back- doors or weaknesses would further discredit the scheme, and help grow the market demand for a secure alternative.   I believe that the company that provides such an alternative will make few friends in the LE community, but lots of money. I also believe that the government will do it's best to make such plug replacements illegal. I expect that they will see the same success in limiting the availability of such alternatives as they have seen in limiting the availability of certain illicit drugs -- ie. little to none.\",\" Actually, they won't.  What they'll tell you is that if you add up the number of suicides, murders of one drug dealer by another, legit self-defenses of a battered spouse, and so on, you'll end up with a number that is much larger than the number of self-defense killings against strangers committed in the bedroom.  (BTW - they didn't honestly count the latter either, but let's not quibble.)  They try to claim that comparison is between the costs of self-defense and the benefits, but they're wrong.  This comparison doesn't measure the costs of self-defense and it doesn't measure the benefits either.  For example, the goal is not to kill the attacker, whatever your relationship to him, but to stop him. While the number of killings may be proportional to the number of stops, it isn't equal.  Anyone who confuses that comparison with an honest evaluation is either lying or....  -andy\",\"Today's atrocity in Waco has finally impelled me to start working on something I've been thinking about for some time.  Over the last few years I have heard of one case after another of government running completely amok.  Unfortunately, most people are oblivious of the government's crimes and still think of it as their protector.  So I intend to put together what I call the \\\"American Horror File\\\": a compilation of cases where the American government has run roughshod over the rights of its citizens over the last few years, focusing especially on deaths and injuries resulting from no-knock warrants, and financial ruin to innocents resulting from civil forfeiture laws, but including any other cases for which I can find decent documentation.  I hope to make people blood-boiling, artery-bursting, red-hot enraged at their government.  The end result will probably be a book in electronic form (ASCII text and postscript files) detailing the government's crimes of recent years.  This book will be distributed at cost, and I will encourage people to post copies to BBS's, send copies on disk to friends, and print out copies and give them to neighbors.  This is a call for your help.  Any information that you can send me on how government is running amok will be greatly appreciated.  I would prefer information that is well-documented, with sources given, about specific instances of governmental abuses.  I also welcome anyone who wants to join me in collecting and researching information for this project. \",\"            101 Courageous Dr.            Leage City, TX  77573           Phone: (713) 538-6000               Good Luck!

That you have to right to express whatever you want in whatever form your little heart desires so long as you do not impinge on the rights of others.  Encrypted text/sound/video is just another form of expression of that particular text/sound/video.  Just like digitized sound is another  means of expression of sound -- streams of 100100101111 instead of continuous waveforms.  Also, it shouldn't be up to the government at all.  Encryption  _Standards_ can be decided upon by Independent Standards Orgainizations (apologies for the acronym).  One can note how well this has worked with ISO and the Metric System, SAE, etc.  Independent entities  or consortia of people/industries in that particular area are far more qualified to set standards than any One government agency.

Anyone else catch ESPN's piece about prospects and the relationship between age, career length, MVPs and Hall of Fame members? It was part of their preseason special. Basically, they looked  at players that had amassed 1000 plate appearances (or ABs) by the time they were 24, and noticed some interesting things.     For starters, they found out such players comprised the majority of MVPs in the history of the game. They also found out such players represented the majority of the players in the hall of fame. The kicker, though, was that they actually did some number-crunching and found that such players' careers lasted much longer than the careers of players not in that group. They also   found that these players produced at both a greater level of performance and produced over twice the raw totals (HRs, etc) of the other players. The first group outhit the second something like .282 to .260 in raw BA, and blew away the second group in such categories as HRs, 2Bs, RBIs, etc.     It was the most impressive thing I've seen on ESPN in recent memory.

They certainly emphasised a limited role for the federal government but this was not necessarily their true position.   The Senate was less powerful than the House of Lords in the period in question. The stripping of the powers of the House of Lords did not occur until 1914 and David Llloyd George's budget. Even despite this the House of Lords has considerable power even today and is far from a rubber stamping body.     The system is meant to be slow to react, the problem is that it ended up a bit too slow.    The Presiden't veto was meant to be entirely separate. Until Bush abused it in a quite extraordinary manner it was used more in accord with the intent of being a check on unreasonable legislation. The veto was clearly regarded  as a completely last gasp measure its use was meant to be restricted to preventing the legislature interfering with the actions of the executive.\",\"That plastic bodywork is useless. That torque, and an upright riding position is better than a slightly or radically forward riding position combined with a high-rpm low torque motor.  To a cruiser-motorcyclist, chrome has some importance. To sport-bike motorcyclists chrome has very little impact on buying choice.  Unless motivated solely by price, these are the criteria each rider uses to select the vehicle of choice.   To ignore these, as well as other criteria, would be insensitive. In other words, no one motorcycle can fufill the requirements that a sport-bike rider and a cruiser rider may have.(sometimes it's hard for *any* motorcycle to fufill a person's requirements)    You're fishing for flames, Dave.

You won't see this in the printer's docs, and the Apple rep didn't mention it to our users group either. It seems that SE ROMs won't support those \\\"features\\\". Okay, I  guess I should have somehow known that this was the case. Let the buyer beware, huh Apple?  Be that as it may, I have been thinking about the  problem and I'm puzzled. Why  can't a defencieny in the  ROM be made up for in software.

Isn't Mode32, or somesuch piece of  soft- ware, just such a fix.   Anyway, I was hoping someone knowledgeable about Mac internals could set me straight: is it simply impossible for a mac SE to print grayscale, or could someone armed with enough info and a little pro- gramming experience cook something up that would supplement the ROM's capabilities?  Also, how does one know if one's mac can support the grayscale and photograde that the Select 300 is supposedly capable of?

By such a back- door (in the encryption algorithm perhaps) it would be possible (for   the manufacturer) to get the keys of all chips that were programmed in  one session. This would not, btw, enable anybody else to retrieve the  keys in the same way because they'll never get a bunch of 300 (N,U)  pairs with identical S1 and S2. (Note that these have to be constant  for the whole batch by the very nature of the procedure, i.e., they  have to be typed in manually by the `random number supplying agents'!)  And I was wondering why they'll always do 300 chips in one session ...  Since the procedure described by Ms Denning imposes high costs on the  production of every chip (at least three persons for one hour each,  plus the cost of a laptop finally blown to pieces in a spectacular,  Hollywood-like bonfire; add travelling expenses, drinks and lighting,  divide the sum by 300) there won't be a larger demand -- not from the  private sector anyway.

(1/3.4)     D = S  S  c  K  W     : crater diameter in km   g  p  f  n          (1/6)     S = (g /g )      : gravity correction factor for bodies other than      g   e  t        Earth, where g = 9.8 m/s^2 and g is the surface          e        t          gravity of the target body. This scaling is          cited for lunar craters and may hold true for          other bodies.

Under these assumptions, the body which created the Barringer Meteor     Crater in Arizona (1.13 km diameter) would have been about 40 meters in     diameter.

The latter was written with     simplicity of exposition and suitability of digital computation in mind     (spherical trig formulae also appear, as do digitally-plotted examples).      More than you ever cared to know about map projections is in John     Snyder's USGS publication \\\"Map Projections--A Working Manual\\\", USGS     Professional Paper 1395. This contains detailed descriptions of 32     projections, with history, features, projection formulas (for both     spherical earth and ellipsoidal earth), and numerical test cases. It's a     neat book, all 382 pages worth. This one's $20.      You might also want the companion volume, by Snyder and Philip Voxland,     \\\"An Album of Map Projections\\\", USGS Professional Paper 1453. This     contains less detail on about 130 projections and variants. Formulas are     in the back, example plots in the front. $14, 250 pages.      You can order these 2 ways.

The objection naturally is in the way in which you phrase it.  Easter (or Eashtar or Ishtar or Ishtarti or other spellings) is the pagan whore goddess of fertility.  Therefore, your question to me is \\\"what is the objection to celebration of the pagan whore goddess?\\\"  When phrased that way I suspect (or at least I would HOPE) that it becomes immeadiately apparent what my objection to \\\"celebrating\\\" her would be.    > It is celebration of the resurrection of Jesus.         No, you are thinking perhaps of \\\"Ressurection Sunday\\\" I think.  (Though I'm not too crazy about the word \\\"Sunday\\\", but I certainly like this phrasing much better than envoking the name of the whore goddess.)      For that matter, stay Biblical and call it Omar Rasheet (The Feast of First Fruits).  Torah commands that this be observed on the day following the Sabbath of Passover week.  (Sunday by any other name in modern parlance.)  Why is there so much objection to observing the Resurrection on the 1st day of the week on which it actually occured?  Why jump it all over the calendar the way Easter does?  Why not just go with the Sunday following Passover the way the Bible has it?  Why seek after unbiblical methods?    > I don't recall a command in Scripture for us to celebrate  > the resurrection, but it is the sole and only reason that  > we are Christians--how could we not celebrate it?         So what does this question have to do with Easter (the whore goddess)?  I am all for celebrating the Resurrection.  Just keep that whore out of the discussion.    > If it is only the name which is a problem, I suggest that if  > we are too concerned about etymology, there are a lot of  > words we are going to have to drop.  (As an aside, some  > terminally PC people here in Ottawa want dictionaries to be  > altered so that there are no negative definitions associated  > with the word _black_, so as not to offend people of colour.

Fine by me.  And while we are at it, the left-handed people are both \\\"sinister\\\" and \\\"gauche\\\" so we probably will have some objections from that quarter as well.    > In Quebec French, the word for the celebration of the  > resurrection is \\\"Pa^ques\\\"--this is etymologically related  > to Pesach (Passover) and the pascal lamb.  So is the  > French Canadian (mostly Roman Catholic) celebration better  > because it uses the right name?         Yes, that sounds much better to me.  Is there anyone out there would thinks that phrasing sounds worse?    > So from this I infer that there are different rules for  > Christians of Jewish descent?  What happened to \\\"there is  > neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for  > all are one in Christ Jesus\\\"?         Read the letter to Philemon.  Now tell me, was Philemon's \\\"slave\\\" returned to him?  Were there different rules upon the slave than upon Philemon?  How about male and female?  Are there different \\\"rules\\\" that apply to them as well?  Or if there is no more \\\"male and female\\\" can Adam and Steve get married to each other in your congregation?  Yes, there are differences in form and function.  But the way we come to Salvation in Messiah remains the same no matter what our position in life.   ---------------------------------------  [I am in general not in favor of continuing this discussion, as it seems repetitive, but this particular point is one that I believe is new -- the objection is not to having a holiday but to its name.  I'd like to suggest that people think very carefully about this argument.  Words often change their meaning over time.  The days of the week are of course originally based on pagan gods.  Some Christians prefer to refer to \\\"first day\\\", \\\"second day\\\", etc.  However the majority of Christians have not been persuaded.  The question seems to be whether it makes any difference what the dictionary shows as the derivation of a word, if what people mean by it and think when they use it is different.  Indeed I'd like to suggest that postings like this could themselves be dangerous.  Suppose people in general use Easter to mean the celebration of Christ's resurrection.  Postings trying to convince them that they really mean a celebration in honor of some godess run the risk of creating exactly the situation that they claim to oppose. They are doing their best to *create* a linkage in people's minds between their celebration and the pagan goddess.  It's not clear that this is a healthy thing.\",\"The file is frite20.zip and you'll find it in the 'icons' directory at Cica.

Now it's also called Chronic Fatigue and Immune Dysfunction Syndrome (CFIDS), since it seems clear that some sort of immune disregulation is causing the probs.

EDT                  Q   Why was the 10:00 a.m. postponed?                  MS. MYERS:  Just due to scheduling conflicts.  So as we  put out, the President will meet with the leaders of the national  police organizations at 2:00 p.m. in the Rose Garden, as opposed to  10:00 a.m.  The only other things on his schedule today are:  At  11:00 a.m. he'll meet with General Vessey, who, as you know, is on  his way to Vietnam to continue working on the MIA-POW issue.  At  12:30 p.m. he'll have lunch with the Vice President in the Oval  Office.  And at 2:00 p.m. he'll meet with the police organizations. Then from 3:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. he'll do his weekly photos with the  various groups.              Q   A photo op with Vessey?              MS. MYERS:  There's no coverage on the Vessey meeting.              Q   Why?              MS. MYERS:  Why?  It's a closed meeting.                Q   What about the lunch?              MS. MYERS:  The lunch?  No, there's no coverage.              Q   Is he meeting with any congress people today?              MS. MYERS:  Nothing scheduled.              Q   There are no meetings --              MS. MYERS:  There are no congressional meetings today,  no.              Q   Has the President been given any information by the  Pentagon or reached any conclusion about the validity of this report  from Hanoi?  Any instructions to Vessey on how to deal with the  Vietnamese on that subject?              MS. MYERS:  Well, clearly, the report is the first order  of business.  It's high on the agenda on something that they'll  discuss.  I think the President and General Vessey will discuss the  parameters of his visit to Vietnam today, but the President hasn't  drawn any conclusions about the report yet.  Certainly, it's  something that he wants General Vessey to talk with the Vietnamese  about first.              Q   Did the President talk with any Republican senators  yesterday about the stimulus package?              MS. MYERS:  He spoke with Senator Dole.              Q   How many times?              MS. MYERS:  I believe once during the day and once last  night.              Q   What was the outcome of that?              MS. MYERS:  They're continuing to work toward some kind  of an agreement on a jobs package.              Q   Is it your impression that Senator Dole is in any  way flexible on this?              MS. MYERS:  Well, I think we're hopeful that we're going  to get some kind of jobs package through the Senate, and we'll  continue to work with Senator Dole and others until we reach some  kind of an agreement.              Q   Did they discuss the VAT tax?              MS. MYERS:  I don't know if that came up.              Q   Can you check that?              MS. MYERS:  Sure.        Q   So what are they -- is the President offering to  scale down his program -- is that what he's trying to do, buy it down  to where Dole will sign on?              MS. MYERS:  Well, he's trying to protect as much of it  as he can.  But it's important to him to get some kind of a jobs  package through the Senate and through Congress now.  And as soon as  we reach some conclusions on that, we'll let you know.  But at the  moment, he's continuing to consult with members of Congress  including, obviously, Senator Dole.              Q   Is he talking to anybody else?              MS. MYERS:  I don't believe he talked to any other  Republicans yesterday.              Q   Is he talking to anybody today?              MS. MYERS:  I don't think anything is scheduled, but I  wouldn't rule it out.              Q   We were led to believe that the President called  Mr. Dole on the subject of Russian aid and that Bob Dole brought the  conversation around to stimulus package.  Is that correct?              MS. MYERS:  I think the President has contacted several  people on Russian aid.  I think that it was always expected that the  stimulus package or the jobs package will be part of any conversation  he would have with Senator Dole.  The primary objective of the  conversation was Russian aid.  That was the first order of business,  but it was both.              Q   In the President's mind, are they linked  politically in that if the Republicans continue to reject the  stimulus package, he thinks it will be harder to sell Russian aid to  the American people?  Has he made that argument?              MS. MYERS:  I can't talk about specifically what  arguments he might have made.  The President is obviously committed  to both.  He liked to see a jobs package to the American people  first.  But as you know, we outlined the details of additional  Russian aid last night in Tokyo.              Q   But does the President believe that the stimulus  package will make it more difficult to persuade Americans to vote for  Russian -- to accept a vote for Russian aid?              MS. MYERS:  I think that the President is going to  continue to work to pass the stimulus package, to pass a jobs  package, and we're still hopeful that we'll get some kind of jobs  package through the Congress.              Q   Is it fair to say that the President is negotiating  now with Dole?              MS. MYERS:  He's discussing options with him.              Q   On the stimulus, is it your understanding that over  the break some Democrats, themselves, have left the support that they  had earlier for the package, the stimulus package?              MS. MYERS:  I think we still have wide support in the  Senate for the jobs package.              Q   But specifically, that you've lost Democrats other  than Shelby?              MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so.  There hasn't been a  vote.              Q   What about Kohl?              Q   Kohl and Feingold?              MS. MYERS:  There hasn't been a vote yet.  And we'll  continue to work with senators to try to get a majority to try to  bring the package to a vote, because we believe that a majority of  the members of the United States Senate support the package.              Q   If you're weren't worried about Kohl and Feingold,  why did George mention Milwaukee projects the other day?              MS. MYERS:  I think George pointed out a number of  projects in a number of states that stand to be funded, or to lose  funding if this jobs package doesn't pass.              Q   No Democrats.  (Laughter.)              MS. MYERS:  I'll let you draw your own conclusions.              Q   Does he plan to talk to Dole again today or any  other Republicans again today?              MS. MYERS:  There's nothing specifically scheduled, but  again, I wouldn't rule it out.              Q   Does he plan to put out any more press releases to  any other states today?              MS. MYERS:  What we've done is we're in the process of  breaking down the benefits of the jobs package state by state.  I  think it's entirely feasible that as we sort of are able to sum those  up, we'll send out press releases to the various states that suggest  how their states would benefit from this package.              Q   Will you share those with us?              MS. MYERS:  Sure.  As we did yesterday.              Q   Do you have copies of the ones you sent --              MS. MYERS:  Yes, we made those available yesterday.  And  we certainly can continue to provide them today.              Q   Dee Dee, since yesterday's questions and subsequent  stories about the VAT, what further consideration of this issue has  been given?              MS. MYERS:  Nothing's changed since yesterday.  I think  the President commented on it this morning to say only that it was  something he knew was being considered by the task force and that he  has not made a decision on, and I don't think we have anything to add  to that.              Q   But he also said that business and labor groups are  telling him they support it.  Can you tell us --              MS. MYERS:  I think that there has been -- I'm not going  to speculate on who supports it.  I think the President said that  there has been some support among business and labor groups.  I don't  think he said he was directly contacted by them.              Q   Are we to take that to mean that the administration  has sounded out business and labor groups on this --              MS. MYERS:  I think there's been plenty of public  discourse on this over the years and even recently, but I don't think  I want to add to that.              Q   In February, though, the President said that this  was something to be considered 10 or 15 years down the road.  What  has happened between then and now to cause this administration to  change its mind?              MS. MYERS:  I think as we said yesterday, it is  something that the working groups are looking at.  They're  considering a wide variety of options on everything from funding to  specific options that will be covered by the President's health care  plan.  The President has not taken it up yet, has not made a decision  on it.  And beyond that, I don't have anything to add.              Q   You haven't answered the question.  It wasn't being  considered by anyone in the White House after the President's  comments in February, and George reaffirmed that in a briefing.              Q   And then suddenly --              Q   What happened?        MS. MYERS:  The working groups, as we have said  throughout, we instructed to consider a wide variety of options  across-the-board.  And one of the things that has been talked about  and that they are clearly considering is some kind of a value-added  tax.        Q   But the President himself took this off the table,  Dee Dee, and suddenly it reappears.  And this goes to the credibility  of this administration in a way.  What has happened in the meantime?        MS. MYERS:  The President has not looked at this, it  hasn't been presented to him, again, yet.  The working groups are  looking at it, as they're looking at a wide variety of options, and  no decisions have been made.        Q   And it raises the question of how independently the  task force is working.        MS. MYERS:  The task force was instructed to consider  all options, and they've taken that mandate seriously and they're  considering all options.        Q   But that's not the impression that the President  left in February.  The impression he left was that this was something  that was long-range, to be looked at 10, 15 years down the road.  The  clear implication of his remarks was that this was something that was  not on the table, not an option.         Q   \\\"If it changes I'll tell you.\\\"              Q   Bring him on.        Q   And you repeatedly referred to the President's  remarks, telling us that those were still in operation.              MS. MYERS:  It's changed, and we told you.  (Laughter.)              Q   But that's what Alice Rivlin's comments and Donna  Shalala comments were about.  I mean, that seemed like an  orchestrated effort because you have two independent Cabinet officers  --        MS. MYERS:  I wouldn't -- no, Alice Rivlin's not a  Cabinet member, first of all.  Second of all, it was not  orchestrated, but clearly, they both said yesterday and in the last  couple of days that it's something that's being looked at.  We  confirmed that yesterday.  And I don't have anything to add to that.        Q   Is it because he has very few options?        Q   Is this something that it will be incumbent upon  the task force to convince the President about?  In other words, has  the President himself personally ruled it out and it's now up to the  task force to convince him to put it back on the table?  Or is it, in  fact, back on the table, having been placed there by discussions with  the President?          MS. MYERS:  It is not the working group's mission at  this point to convince the President of anything.  It is their  mission to put before him his options and to explain the benefits and  the costs and the basic pros and cons of each of those options.  I  think that they will certainly present the VAT to him in that  context, and at this point he's not -- that presentation has not been  made, but it's something that he will hear and he has not made a  decision on.        Q   They will present it to him as one of his options,  though he specifically ruled it out?        MS. MYERS:  Correct.        Q   Dee Dee, is this more than a trial balloon?  Is  this a serious consideration that the working groups are giving to  this form of taxation?        MS. MYERS:  It's simply a statement of fact.  The  working groups are considering a wide variety of options on a number  of issues relating to health care reform.  One of the options that  they're looking at is the VAT.         Q   Dee Dee, when the working groups were examining  this possibility, was this on the table during the same time period  that you were telling us that it was not?        MS. MYERS:  I don't know what the specific timing of  their drafting of options is.  I don't know.        Q   Who was telling you that it was not under  consideration?        MS. MYERS:  I was referring back to the President's  comments.        Q   Have they discovered that the sin taxes won't raise  enough money to fund the core benefit package?        MS. MYERS:  No, there's no decisions that have been made  on how to pay for the health care plan.              Q   I'm asking whether the projections --              MS. MYERS:  There's a number of options depending on how  the plan is structured.  You can't decide how much the plan is going  to cost until you decide what the plan is going to look like.  And so  you can't discuss what financing options have been ruled in our out  until you know.        Q   Dee Dee, we've been told that they have a computer  models on a number of possible packages.        MS. MYERS:  Correct.          Q   The question is whether they have now determined  whether sin taxes would not produce enough money for even the barest  minimum package.  That is not a very difficult computation.        MS. MYERS:  It is a question that you know that we're  not going to answer until -- there's a number of options being  considered.  It depends on how the package is structured.  The exact  details of the package and the financing mechanisms used to pay for  them are all among the decisions that have yet to be made.                Q   And when the President has been meeting with health  care -- his health care advisors, which we are told he has been doing  --              MS. MYERS:  Correct.              Q      they have never once said to him, these are your  funding options, including the VAT?  He has never heard the word VAT  in his --              MS. MYERS:    I am not going to comment on the specific  nature of the daily -- they're not daily, but the quasi-regular  briefings.              Q   Well, you have.              MS. MYERS:  I have not, other than to say that he's not  considered the VAT.  And I think that is a true statement.              Q   No, but you said that it has not been presented to  him as an option.              MS. MYERS:  Correct.              Q   That doesn't mean he hasn't heard about it.              MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to get into the details of  what's discussed.  I think that statement stands for itself.              Q      specific, Dee Dee.  When you say he hasn't  looked at it, do you mean that he hasn't looked at it in terms of  paying for medical coverage, or hasn't looked at it in general?   Because back in Chilicothe he was very specific in defining how it  works, what the advantages are, the whole thing.  It sounds like --              MS. MYERS:  But that was -- I think in Chilicothe, if  you go back to his remarks there, it was a broader philosophical  discussion of the tax structure.  And I think the comments were  generally in reference to the overall economic plan.  But clearly,  it's something that he's thought about in the broad context.  I mean,  that was clear in Chilicothe.  What I'm saying is that in the process  of the working groups it's something that he hasn't considered yet.   It's something that the working groups will present to him among the  number of options, and that no decisions have been made.  And I'm not  going to comment any further on the details of the meetings where  health care issues are being discussed.              Q   It's your statement from this podium that no  discussion of this has taken place.  You say that no option -- that  the option has not been presented to him.              MS. MYERS:  That is correct.              Q   Do you stand by -- does the White House still stand  by George's statement in March that this will not be in the proposal?              MS. MYERS:  No decisions have been made.  We have  nothing to add to what's already been said.              Q   Let me follow up here.  Do you stand by what Rivlin  said yesterday, that if any kind of VAT were to be used or  considered, that other changes to the tax code would have to be made  so that it would be less regressive?              MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to comment any further on what  might happen if.              Q   But do you stand by the previous conversations in  February that if there were to be a VAT, I think the President said  you'd exclude food and energy --              MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to comment on the specific  structure of a decision that hasn't been made.              Q   Was the President aware prior to Donna Shalala's  comments yesterday that this was under consideration by the working  groups?              MS. MYERS:  I don't know specifically what --              Q   Could you check for us, because that's a real  important credibility question?              MS. MYERS:  Sure.              Q   Since the task force was brought together this  issue has been discussed, at the beginning and throughout, as one  fairly painless way to raise a lot of money.  Were you all kept in  the dark?  Was the Press Office kept in the dark over the past month  and a half when you've been denying that a VAT tax would be  considered that it was actually on the table over there as an option?              MS. MYERS:  I think we've said all that we have to say.   It is something the working groups are looking at.  The President has  not made a decision about it yet.  And beyond that, I have nothing to  add.              Q   Well, sorry, Dee Dee, there are still a couple of  questions that we are going to have to ask because we have a problem  with credibility here -- yours primarily.  What we're asking is, if  you all were not told at all that this thing was being considered  while you were coming out here and telling us that it was not, or if  it's a case that you were coming out here and deliberately misleading  us.              MS. MYERS:  I don't believe that anyone has ever come  out here and deliberately misled you from this podium -- ever --ever.              Q   Has anyone tried to shade it a little bit to  indicate something -- has anybody told anybody to come out --              MS. MYERS:  We're not trying to shade answers or  deliberately mislead anybody.  I've said what I have to say about  this issue.              Q   All we were trying to find out --              MS. MYERS:  I understand what you're trying to find out  and I've given you the answers, Helen.              Q   We're trying to find out what changed -- what made  it an option again.  That's the --              MS. MYERS:  The working groups were given a broad  mandate to investigate all options, and they are doing that.                Q   Yes, but it wasn't an option before.  How can you  investigate it if the President has taken it off the table?              MS. MYERS:  It is something that they're obviously  considering and the President has not made a decision on.              Q   Yes, but he took it off the table in February.              MS. MYERS:  Working groups are considering it.  They'll  present it to the President at some point and he'll make a decision.              Q   Why would they consider it if he has taken it off  the table?              MS. MYERS:  It's clearly on the table.               Q   Yes, but he took it off the table.  Did he change  his mind?              MS. MYERS:  It's back on the table, Bill.              Q   Did he change his mind?              MS. MYERS:  He said this morning that he hasn't made a  decision about it.  He obviously knows that it's on the table.  It's  something that he will look at at some and when we have a decision on  this we'll let you know.              Q   So he must have changed his mind, right?              MS. MYERS:  At some point it will be looked at.  I mean,  --              Q   Dee Dee, there's like two options -- either he  changed his mind or the working groups think they're authority  exceeds the President's.              MS. MYERS:  The working groups were given a broad  mandate to look at all options; they've done that.              Q   Are you going to put out his income tax?              MS. MYERS:  Yes, there will be something available on  his income tax probably later this afternoon.  His return will be  available.               Q   Will there be any kind of briefing to go through  it?              MS. MYERS:  No, nothing's planned.  I think someone will  be available, probably not in a briefing setting, but to walk you  through the questions.              Q   We're used to be walked line-by-line through the  presidential tax forms.              MS. MYERS:  I've seen those briefings.  (Laughter.)              Q   Could we have one?              MS. MYERS:   No, I don't think there will be any kind of  a formal briefing, but there will be somebody available to answer  your questions about it.              Q   Did they file a joint form?              MS. MYERS:  Yes.              Q   When did he file it?              MS. MYERS:  I believe it's being filed today.              Q   Dee Dee, is there going to be a backgrounder for  Miyazawa?              MS. MYERS:  No, there will be a readout after the  meeting.              Q   No backgrounder today?              MS. MYERS:  No backgrounder today.              Q   This is complicated stuff.  We need help.   (Laughter.)              MS. MYERS:  We can't give you taxes and Miyazawa all in  one day, it's too confusing.  (Laughter.)              Q   Vance and Owen have opened the doors on the use of  force in Bosnia.   They've both said that, A, they never ruled it  out, and B, it might be necessary now.  Does that influence your  thinking on whether or not to change your approach?              MS. MYERS:  There's been no change in our policy towards  Bosnia.  We have always said that we'd consider --              Q   But does that impact upon your decision?  Are they  people whose opinions would carry weight with you?              MS. MYERS:  They're people whose opinions carry weight  certainly.  I mean, the President supports the process that they've  initiated.  But there's been no change in our policy for Bosnia,  although we're considering a number of options right now.  If the  Serbs don't come back to the negotiating table, if they don't sign on  to some kind of an agreement, we will consider additional options,  which we've been saying regularly.              Q   One follow-up question then?  We cannot get a  straight answer from anyone in the administration.  Why do you not  set a deadline for the Serbs?  Can you tell us the strategic or  tactical reasons for not giving them a deadline to come to the table?              MS. MYERS:  We're continuing to put pressure on them  every day.              Q   Which doesn't work so --              MS. MYERS:  Well, we think it is having some effect.   We're going to continue to tighten sanctions.  As you know, we  support the omnibus resolution.  We expect that to come to a vote on  the 26th.                Q   You say it's having an effect -- can you give us  any documentation?              MS. MYERS:  I'd be happy to provide somebody to talk to  you about the impact of the sanctions and things like that.              Q   There's been no -- you have not been able to  provide anybody who can tell us that the sanctions have had any  effect in Bosnia.  Serbia, yes; in Bosnia, no.              MS. MYERS:  I think that they've had effect in Serbia  and we think they've had some effect in Bosnia.  And again, I'll be  happy to provide somebody to walk you through the details of that, if  you'd like.              Q   We would like to hear from someone who can show us  what the effect has been in Bosnia.  We had the briefing on all of  the terrible things that are happening in Belgrade, but we haven't  seen anything that indicates an impact on the fighting.  Can you  provide something along those lines?              MS. MYERS:  I will see what I can get you.              Q   On the extra Russian aid that Christopher announced  this morning -- where is that money coming from?              MS. MYERS:  We'll have to work with Congress on the  details of that package.              Q   So that would be new money that you would hope to  get?              MS. MYERS:    Yes, that's new money, in addition to the  $1.6 billion announced in Vancouver.  So I assume that you all have  seen the $1.8-billion package that was announced this morning in  Tokyo by Secretary Christopher.              Q   Isn't there a concern, though, about offering  something which you have to get in Congress?  I mean, that was the  concern with Vancouver; you didn't want to do that.              MS. MYERS:  The concern with Vancouver was to do  something immediately, which required money that was already approved  in the Fiscal '93 budget.  What we're looking at now is a little bit  longer-term plan to build on top of the $1.6 billion that we  announced in Vancouver.  This clearly will require congressional  approval, or some of it will anyway, and we're going to continue to  work with Congress to make that happen.              Q   To what extent has that been vetted or agreed to by  Congress?              MS. MYERS:  The President has had a number of  conversations with members and will continue to work with them as  this process moves forward.              Q   Was Christopher able to put this package out with a  fair degree of understanding that you will be able to get it through  Congress?              MS. MYERS:  It was created in consultation with  Congress.              Q   In meeting with the law enforcement officials, is  that -- does that have a set speech and a goal?  A direction?              MS. MYERS:  Yes, the President will talk about -- and  the law enforcement organizations are endorsing the President's jobs  package.  They believe particularly the summer jobs package will help  give kids something to do.              Q   Who are they?              MS. MYERS:  It's members or leadership from three  organizations:  NAPO, which is the National Association of Police  Organizations; IBPO, which is the International Brotherhood of Police  Organizations, I believe; and IUPA, which is the International Union  of Police Associations.              Q   Will the FBI chief be there?              MS. MYERS:  The FBI chief?  No.              Q   Or any other federal law enforcement officials?              MS. MYERS:  No, it will be the President and these  national law enforcement organization leaders.              Q   Does the $1.8 billion announced today include the  $400 million that's in the FY '94 budget for disarmament?              MS. MYERS:  No.  The Nunn-Lugar money is separate.              Q   So this would be the $700 million that's in the  budget already, plus another $1.1 billion?              MS. MYERS:  I believe all of this is on top of the $700  million already in the budget.              Q   Is this going to be part of the supplemental or  Fiscal '94 --              MS. MYERS:  We'll work with Congress on the exact  funding mechanism -- on exactly how this will be paid for.              Q   This $1.8 billion on top of --              MS. MYERS:  On top of $700 million -- on top of the $400  million Nunn-Lugar money we announced earlier.              Q   And this is what prompted the President to call Bob  Dole -- it was on this tranche, not on the previous money he was  calling Bob Dole?              MS. MYERS:  Correct.              Q   Is there a briefing on Miyazawa?              MS. MYERS:  There will be a readout after the meeting  with Miyazawa.  Tomorrow.              Q   Dee Dee, on a totally unrelated matter, some  Republicans who are active in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are  complaining about this new cozy relationship between the White House  and the Chamber of Commerce.  There are -- the town hall meeting the  other night, the satellite and all of this relationship. Does the White House feel that you're getting too close to these  Chambers of Commerce?              MS. MYERS:  That's an interesting charge.  (Laughter.)   After how many years of Democrats being accused of not paying any  attention to the Chambers, now there are those who would accuse us of  being too close.  I think that's interesting.  But no, we're thrilled  by the support we've received from the national Chamber and local  Chambers across the country and we'll continue to work with them on  this and other initiatives.              Q   What's the status of the President thinking about  going to this Democratic retreat?              MS. MYERS:  It's on his calendar.  I think he'll almost  certainly go.              Q   All three days?              MS. MYERS:  We haven't figured out exactly when he'll be  there yet.                Q   Is it open to coverage?              MS. MYERS:  No, I believe the whole thing is closed.              Q   Is he going to have any kind of address, statement,  anything at all on the gay rights march on the 25th?              MS. MYERS:  We're still looking at that.  We haven't  made a final decision about how we'll -- who will make a statement or  what --              Q   Any meetings scheduled with any of the leaders?              MS. MYERS:  Nothing is scheduled, but I wouldn't rule it  out.              Q   What about an AIDS czar?              MS. MYERS:  It's coming.              Q   Anything on the weekend?              Q   There's been a suggestion that he's going to this  retreat to avoid having to participate in the gay rights -- or appear  or have any involvement in the gay rights march.              MS. MYERS:  No, I think this is something he's been  discussing for a long time -- appearing at the Senate Democratic  retreat.              Q   The weekend?              MS. MYERS:  Weekend?  Don't know -- the only thing on  right now is the radio address on Saturday.              Q   Any travel plans?              MS. MYERS:  If it changes -- none right now.              Q   He's not going to be off campaigning for his  stimulus package?              MS. MYERS:  No specific plans right now.              Q   What about mid-week?  Anything likely?              MS. MYERS:  It's possible.  Yes, I think it's likely  that we'll travel next week -- certainly the weekend.              Q   Has he called Thurmond about his daughter?              MS. MYERS:  I don't know.  I'll check.              Q   Going to name a drug czar this weekend?              MS. MYERS:  This weekend?  I don't believe so.              Q   And the radio address on Saturday -- is that going  to be focused on the stimulus package?              MS. MYERS:  I'm sure it will.              THE PRESS:  Thank you.\",\"   I've had the board for over a year, and it does work with Diskdoubler, but not with Autodoubler, due to a licensing problem with Stac Technologies, the owners of the board's compression technology. (I'm writing this from memory; I've lost the reference. Please correct me if I'm wrong.)  Using the board, I've had problems with file icons being lost, but it's hard to say whether it's the board's fault or something else; however, if I decompress the troubled file and recompress it without the board, the icon usually reappears. Because of the above mentioned licensing problem, the freeware expansion utility DD Expand will not decompress a board-compressed file unless you have the board installed.  Since Stac has its own product now, it seems unlikely that the holes in Autodoubler/Diskdoubler related to the board will be fixed. Which is sad, and makes me very reluctant to buy Stac's product since they're being so stinky. (But hey, that's competition.) -- \",\"If one is a vegan (a vegetarian taht eats no animal products at at i.e eggs,  milk, cheese, etc., after about 3 years of a vegan diet, you need to start  taking B12 supplements because b12 is found only in animals.)

I'm nearly contridicting myself  with the mish-mash of knowledge I've gleaned.\",\"I have a question about tires for my Guzzi. It is a '75 850-T. The tires that were on it when I just bought it are old and cracked. I do not have an owners manual for it (yet), but the tires listed in the Haynes manual are: Front, 3,50 H 18 ; Rear 4.10 H 18, and pressures recommended are 26 front and 33 rear. Oddly, the pressure for the same tire on the T-3 is listed at 29 psi instead. Anyone know the reason? As I know though, the pressure I should run at is that recommended by the manufacturer of the new tires I purchase.  The real question I have is this. The old tires that are on the bike are for the front, a Metzler Touring Special, 4.10 H 18, and for the rear an Avon Roadrunner 4.70 H 18, (120/90) H 18 as marked on each tire. Both are larger than that listed in the Haynes Manual. What does the owners manual recommend, and was it common to go up one size for this bike? Also, this will be my first motorcycle with innertubes. Any comments on the various manufacturers inner tube qualities?  The above sizes are inches (except for the additional mark on the current rear tire). What is the best metric match? The local BMW dealer thought 100/90 H 18 on the front and 120/90 H 18 on the back. He also happens to be very good at getting close to matching mail order prices.  I am thinking of going with a Metzler ME33 Laser (possibly Comp K) on the front and ME88 on the back, both in MBS variety if possible (the longer  lasting belting system). I already use the ME33 on both the Vision and FJ for the front, and like it, and I thought that with the shaft drive behavior and torque from the Guzzi that the ME88 might give more predictable back end control and sliding behavior than a ME55 might, as well as giving much better tire milage life. Any comments?  A friend told me he thought that my bike had Boranni rims which are very good, but are relatively soft and have delicate sidewalls. I do not wish to mount the tires myself this first time, so aside from warning the shop to be careful, any other comments I should make? I havn't looked at the rim to check out the make yet, if it is marked. He just told me late yesterday and I havn't had a chance to check the rim type.  On another note. I will remove the ugly (but in good shape....anyone want it?) Vetter fairing, and I will run without a windscreen for a while, but eventually I would like a simple rounded cafe' style quarter fairing for it. It could be fork/handlebar mounted. Any suggestions? Is there such a thing as a frame mounted quarter fairing of the cafe' style for this bike? How about lower bars/clip-ons for it? I would like to restore the bike into a good condition runner with a few modern updates, but while not being historically exactly accurate still have it reflect relatively well a representation of the cafe' style. (Yes I know to be picky, that period really predates this bike....it is just that this bike has such potential for _that_ look.)  -----------------------------Edward Walsh----Hewlett-Packard Company-------                              edw@boi.hp.com  Disk Memory Division, MS475                              (208)323-2174   P.O.

The difference was the amount of inside padding.  My solution was to buy a large helmet, and construct a removable liner  from a sheet of .5\\\" closed-cell foam and some satin (glued to the inside surface).  The result is a reasonably snug fit on my smallest-headed pillion with the liner in, and a comfortable fit on my largest-headed pillion with the liner out.  Everyone else gets linered or not by best fit.    -- \",\"Hello, my friends and I are running the Homewood Fantasy Baseball League (pure fantasy baseball teams).

He is only insurance in case of extra innings or the 2nd catcher is injured during a game.     So to free up this roster spot for an extra pinch hitter or reliever, why not invoke a catcher re-substitution rule:  If the last roster catcher on a team is injured during a game, the team is permitted to substitute in his place for defensive purposes a catcher who has previously been yanked from the game.     Given this rule, a team wouldn't need 3 roster catchers.  The 3rd catcher could be playing in AAA or be a non-roster bullpen catcher.\",\": Marian CATHOLIC high school, outside of chicago: :  : 666 south ASHLAND avenue. :  Actually, Satanism is technically inverted Catholicism. \",\" To which Mark Ira Kaufman responds:  Mark, Were you one of the millions of Americans cheering the slaughter of Iraqi civilians by US forces in 1991?

Every once in a while, we run into \\\"The Black Screen of Death\\\", a phrase coined by Robert X. Cringely in a recent InfoWorld column.    Basically, sometimes when you quit Windows, the screen goes black and you get a nice little flashing cursor in the top left corner of your screen.  Also, sometimes when you exit to DOS, the same effect occurs. Cringely hints that Microsoft and/or Novell has a patch for Windows' virtual interrupt controller that  may solve this.  Neither company seems to know what I am talking about when I call them.  Has anyone else noticed this phenomenon?    Is there a fix for it?  Any response is welcome.\",\"Sorry about not mentioning platform... my original post was to mac.programmer, and then decided to post here to comp.graphics.

The number of casualties was nearly forty percent of the total number of the attackers. The Arab troops suffered casualties neraly three times as heavy. The fighting was thus very severe. Yet the hostile propaganda, disseminated throughout the world, deliberately ignored the fact that the civilian population of Dir Yassin was actually given a warning by us before the battle began. One of our tenders carrying a loud speaker was stationed at the entrance to the village and it exhorted in Arabic all women, children and aged to leave their houses and to take shelter on the slopes of the hill.  By giving this humane warning our fighters threw away the element of complete surprise, and thus increased their own risk in the ensuing battle. A substantial number of the inhabitants obeyed the warning and they were unhurt. A few did not leave their stone houses - perhaps because of the confusion. The fire of the enemy was murderous - to which the number of our casualties bears eloquent testimony. Our men were compelled to fight for every house; to overcome the enemy they used large numbers of hand grenades. And the civilians who had disregarded our warnings suffered inevitable casualties.      \\\"The education which we gave our soldiers throughout the years of revolt was based on the observance of the traditional laws of war. We never broke them unless the enemy first did so and thus forced us, in accordance with the accepted custom of war, to apply reprisals. I am convinced, too, that our officers and men wished to avoid a single unnecessary casualty in the Dir Yassin battle. But those who throw stones of denunciation at the conquerors of Dir Yassin [1] would do well not to don the cloak of hypocrisy [2].      \\\"In connection with the capture of Dir Yassin the Jewish Agency found it necessary to send a letter of apology to Abdullah, whom Mr. Ben Gurion, at a moment of great political emotion, called 'the wise ruler who seeks the good of his people and this country.' The 'wise ruler,' whose mercenary forces demolished Gush Etzion and flung the bodies of its heroic defenders to birds of prey, replied with feudal superciliousness. He rejected the apology and replied that the Jews were all to blame and that he did not believe in the existence of 'dissidents.' Throughout the Arab world and the world at large a wave of lying propaganda was let loose about 'Jewish attrocities.'      \\\"The enemy propaganda was designed to besmirch our name. In the result it helped us. Panic overwhelmed the Arabs of Eretz Israel. Kolonia village, which had previously repulsed every attack of the Haganah, was evacuated overnight and fell without further fighting. Beit-Iksa was also evacuated. These two places overlooked the main road; and their fall, together with the capture of Kastel by the Haganah, made it possible to keep open the road to Jerusalem. In the rest of the country, too, the Arabs began to flee in terror, even before they clashed with Jewish forces. Not what happened at Dir Yassin, but what was invented about Dir Yassin, helped to carve the way to our decisive victories on the battlefield. The legend of Dir Yassin helped us in particular in the saving of Tiberias and the conquest of Haifa.\\\"   [1] (A footnote from _The Revolt_, pp.226-7.) \\\"To counteract the loss of Dir yassin, a village of strategic importance, Arab headquarters at Ramallah broadcast a crude atrocity story, alleging a massacre by Irgun troops of women and children in the village. Certain Jewish officials, fearing the Irgun men as political rivals, seized upon this Arab gruel propaganda to smear the Irgun. An eminent Rabbi was induced to reprimand the Irgun before he had time to sift the truth. Out of evil, however, good came. This Arab propaganda spread a legend of terror amongst Arabs and Arab troops, who were seized with panic at the mention of Irgun soldiers. The legend was worth half a dozen battalions to the forces of Israel. The `Dir Yassin Massacre' lie is still propagated by Jew-haters all over the world.\\\"\",\"  Not too hard to remember, I bought a GS1000 new in '78. :-) It was 3rd place in the '78 speed wars (behind the CBX & XS Eleven) with a 11.8 @ 113 1/4 mile, and 75 horses. That wouldn't even make a good 600 these days. Then again, I paid $2800 for it, so technology isn't the only thing that's changed. Of course I'd still rather ride the old GS across three states than any of the 600's.  I guess it's an indication of how much things have changed that a 12 second 400 didn't seem too far out of line.\",\" I find this thread on motif accelerators absoultly amazing.  If I were writing an interface to keyboard accelerators, I would have one resource called \\\"accelerators\\\" that took a translation table, period. I would also implement it so that programmer never has to do any work to get the accelerators installed.  As soon as the end-user specified one, it would be active and automatically installed.  To get multiple accelerators on a single menu item I'd do something like:   *menuItem.accelerators: #override \\\\n\\\\   Ctrl<Key>M: fire() \\\\n\\\\   Shift<Key>L: fire() \\\\n  The accelerators would work exactly like translations and you would automatically see a \\\"Ctrl M\\\" show up in your menuItem object.  Why in the world is the motif stuff so complicated with so many different special cases depending on what type of widget you're dealing with?  There has to be some reason.

If I read you right, you're saying in essence that, with a larger    economy, nations will have more discretionary funds to *waste* on a    lunar facility. That was certainly partially the case with Apollo,    but real Lunar colonies will probably require a continuing    military, scientific, or commercial reason for being rather than    just a \\\"we have the money, why not?\\\" approach.  Ah, but the whole point is that money spent on a lunar base is not wasted on the moon. It's not like they'd be using $1000 (1000R?) bills to fuel their moon-dozers. The money to fund a lunar base would be spent in the country to which the base belonged. It's a way of funding high-tech research, just like DARPA was a good excuse to fund various fields of research, under the pretense that it was crucial to the defense of the country, or like ESPRIT is a good excuse for the EC to fund research, under the pretense that it's good for pan-European cooperation.  Now maybe you think that government-funded research is a waste of money (in fact, I'm pretty sure you do), but it does count as investment spending, which does boost the economy (and just look at the size of that multiplier :->).\",\"Mark McWiggins <markmc@halcyon.com> reminds us:  MM> Also, don't forget that it's better for your health  MM> to enjoy your steak than to resent your sprouts ...  YES!  I call this notion \\\"psychological health food\\\" and, in fact, have determined that the Four Food Groups are Ice Cream, Pizza, Barbecue, and Chocolate.  Ideally, every meal should contain something from at least two of these four groups.  Food DOES serve functions other than nutrition, and one of them is keeping the organism happy and thus aiding its immune system.

WordPerfect encryption has been shown to be very easy to break.   The method uses XOR with two repeating key streams: a typed password   and a byte-wide counter initialized to 1+<the password length>. Full   descriptions are given in Bennett [BEN87] and Bergen and Caelli   [BER91].    decrypt WordPerfect document files and I think I have a solution.    There is a software company named: Accessdata (87 East 600 South,   Orem, UT 84058), 1-800-658-5199 that has a software package that will   decrypt any WordPerfect, Lotus 1-2-3, Quatro-Pro, MS Excel and Paradox   files. The cost of the package is $185. Steep prices, but if you   think your pw key is less than 10 characters, (or 10 char) give them a   call and ask for the free demo disk. The demo disk will decrypt files   that have a 10 char or less pw key.''  * How do I break a Vigenere (repeated-key) cipher?    A repeated-key cipher, where the ciphertext is something like the   plaintext xor KEYKEYKEYKEY (and so on), is called a Vigenere cipher.   If the key is not too long and the plaintext is in English, do the   following:     1. Discover the length of the key by counting coincidences.   (See Gaines [GAI44], Sinkov [SIN66].) Trying each displacement of   the ciphertext against itself, count those bytes which are equal.    If the two ciphertext portions have used the same key, something   over 6% of the bytes will be equal. If they have used different   key, then less than 0.4% will be equal (assuming random 8-bit bytes   of key covering normal ASCII text). The smallest displacement which   indicates an equal key is the length of the repeated key.    2. Shift the text by that length and XOR it with itself. This   removes the key and leaves you with text XORed with itself. Since   English has about 1 bit of real information per byte, 2 streams of   text XORed together has 2 bits of info per 8-bit byte, providing   plenty of redundancy for choosing a unique decryption. (And in fact   one stream of text XORed with itself has just 1 bit per byte.)    If the key is short, it might be even easier to treat this as a   standard polyalphabetic substitution. All the old cryptanalysis   texts show how to break those. It's possible with those methods, in   the hands of an expert, if there's only ten times as much text as key.   See, for example, Gaines [GAI44], Sinkov [SIN66].  * How do I send encrypted mail under UNIX? [PGP, RIPEM, PEM, ...]    Here's one popular method, using the des command:      cat file | compress | des private_key | uuencode | mail    Meanwhile, there is a de jure Internet standard in the works called   PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail). It is described in RFCs 1421 through   1424. To join the PEM mailing list, contact pem-dev-request@tis.com.   There is a beta version of PEM being tested at the time of this   writing.    There are also two programs available in the public domain for encrypting   mail: PGP and RIPEM.  Both are available by FTP.  Each has its own   newsgroup: alt.security.pgp and alt.security.ripem.  Each has its own FAQ   as well.    PGP is most commonly used outside the USA since it uses the RSA algorithm   without a license and RSA's patent is valid only (or at least primarily)   in the USA.    RIPEM is most commonly used inside the USA since it uses the RSAREF which   is freely available within the USA but not available for shipment outside   the USA.    Since both programs use a secret key algorithm for encrypting the body of   the message (PGP used IDEA; RIPEM uses DES) and RSA for encrypting the   message key, they should be able to interoperate freely.  Although there   have been repeated calls for each to understand the other's formats and   algorithm choices, no interoperation is available at this time (as far as   we know).  * Is the UNIX crypt command secure?    No. See [REE84]. There is a program available called cbw (crypt   breaker's workbench) which can be used to do ciphertext-only attacks   on files encrypted with crypt. One source for CBW is [FTPCB].  * How do I use compression with encryption?    A number of people have proposed doing perfect compression followed by   some simple encryption method (e.g., XOR with a repeated key).    Unfortunately, you can only compress perfectly if you know the exact   distribution of possible inputs. For all practical purposes it's   impossible to describe ``the typical English text'' beyond coarse   characteristics such as single-letter frequencies. You can build up   more and more sophisticated models of your inputs, but if the enemy   has a slightly more accurate model, he'll be able to find some   redundancy in your compressed output.    Note that nearly all practical compression schemes, unless they   have been designed with cryptography in mind, produce output that   actually starts off with high redundancy. For example, the output of   UNIX compress begins with a well-known three-byte ``magic number''   that can serve as an entering wedge for cryptanalysis.      This is not to say that compression before encryption is inherently a   bad idea; it just has to be done very, very carefully, and by no means   removes the need for strong encryption.    Compression after encryption is silly.  * Is there an unbreakable cipher?    Yes. The one-time pad is unbreakable; see part 4. Unfortunately the   one-time pad requires secure distribution of as much key material as   plaintext.    Of course, a cryptosystem need not be utterly unbreakable to be   useful. Rather, it needs to be strong enough to resist attacks by   likely enemies for whatever length of time the data it protects is   expected to remain valid.  * What does ``random'' mean in cryptography?    Cryptographic applications demand much more out of a pseudorandom   number generator than most applications. For a source of bits to be   cryptographically random, it must be computationally impossible to   predict what the Nth random bit will be given complete knowledge of   the algorithm or hardware generating the stream and the sequence of   0th through N-1st bits, for all N up to the lifetime of the source.    A software generator (also known as pseudo-random) has the function   of expanding a truly random seed to a longer string of apparently   random bits.  This seed must be large enough not to be guessed by   the opponent.  Ideally, it should also be truly random (perhaps   generated by a hardware random number source).    Those who have Sparcstation 1 workstations could, for example,   generate random numbers using the audio input device as a source of   entropy, by not connecting anything to it.  For example,   cat /dev/audio | compress - >foo    gives a file of high entropy (not random but with much randomness in   it).  One can then encrypt that file using part of itself as a key,   for example, to convert that seed entropy into a pseudo-random   string.    When looking for hardware devices to provide this entropy, it is   important really to measure the entropy rather than just assume that   because it looks complicated to a human, it must be \\\"random\\\".  For   example, disk operation completion times sound like they might be   unpredictable (to many people) but a spinning disk is much like a   clock and its output completion times are relatively low in entropy.  * What is the unicity point (a.k.a. unicity distance)?    See [SHA49]. The unicity distance is an approximation to that amount   of ciphertext such that the sum of the real information (entropy) in   the corresponding source text and encryption key equals the number   of ciphertext bits used. Ciphertexts significantly longer than this   can be shown probably to have a unique decipherment. This is used to   back up a claim of the validity of a ciphertext-only cryptanalysis.    Ciphertexts significantly shorter than this are likely to have   multiple, equally valid decryptions and therefore to gain security   from the opponent's difficulty choosing the correct one.    Unicity distance, like all statistical or information-theoretic   measures, does not make deterministic predictions but rather gives   probabilistic results: namely, the minimum amount of ciphertext   for which it is likely that there is only a single intelligible   plaintext corresponding to the ciphertext, when all possible keys   are tried for the decryption. Working cryptologists don't normally   deal with unicity distance as such. Instead they directly determine   the likelihood of events of interest.    Let the unicity distance of a cipher be D characters. If fewer than   D ciphertext characters have been intercepted, then there is not   enough information to distinguish the real key from a set of   possible keys. DES has a unicity distance of 17.5 characters,   which is less than 3 ciphertext blocks (each block corresponds to   8 ASCII characters). This may seem alarmingly low at first, but   the unicity distance gives no indication of the computational work   required to find the key after approximately D characters have been   intercepted.    In fact, actual cryptanalysis seldom proceeds along the lines used   in discussing unicity distance. (Like other measures such as key   size, unicity distance is something that guarantees insecurity if   it's too small, but doesn't guarantee security if it's high.) Few   practical cryptosystems are absolutely impervious to analysis; all   manner of characteristics might serve as entering ``wedges'' to crack   some cipher messages. However, similar information-theoretic   considerations are occasionally useful, for example, to determine a   recommended key change interval for a particular cryptosystem.   Cryptanalysts also employ a variety of statistical and   information-theoretic tests to help guide the analysis in the most   promising directions.    Unfortunately, most literature on the application of information   statistics to cryptanalysis remains classified, even the seminal   1940 work of Alan Turing (see [KOZ84]). For some insight into the   possibilities, see [KUL68] and [GOO83].  * What is key management and why is it important?    One of the fundamental axioms of cryptography is that the enemy is in   full possession of the details of the general cryptographic system,   and lacks only the specific key data employed in the encryption. (Of   course, one would assume that the CIA does not make a habit of telling   Mossad about its cryptosystems, but Mossad probably finds out anyway.)   Repeated use of a finite amount of key provides redundancy that can   eventually facilitate cryptanalytic progress. Thus, especially in   modern communication systems where vast amounts of information are   transferred, both parties must have not only a sound cryptosystem but   also enough key material to cover the traffic.    Key management refers to the distribution, authentication, and   handling of keys.    A publicly accessible example of modern key management technology   is the STU III secure telephone unit, which for classified use   employs individual coded ``Crypto Ignition Keys'' and a central Key   Management Center operated by NSA. There is a hierarchy in that   certain CIKs are used by authorized cryptographic control   personnel to validate the issuance of individual traffic keys and   to perform installation/maintenance functions, such as the   reporting of lost CIKs.    This should give an inkling of the extent of the key management   problem. For public-key systems, there are several related issues,   many having to do with ``whom do you trust?''  * Can I use pseudo-random or chaotic numbers as a key stream?    Chaotic equations and fractals produce an apparent randomness from   relatively compact generators. Perhaps the simplest example is a   linear congruential sequence, one of the most popular types of random   number generators, where there is no obvious dependence between seeds   and outputs. Unfortunately the graph of any such sequence will, in a   high enough dimension, show up as a regular lattice. Mathematically   this lattice corresponds to structure which is notoriously easy for   cryptanalysts to exploit. More complicated generators have more   complicated structure, which is why they make interesting pictures---   but a cryptographically strong sequence will have no computable   structure at all.    See [KNU81], exercise 3.5-7; [REE77]; and [BOY89].  * What is the correct frequency list for English letters?    There are three answers to this question, each slightly deeper than   the one before. You can find the first answer in various books:   namely, a frequency list computed directly from a certain sample of   English text. Of course any such list will be ``correctly'' computed,   but exactly which list you get depends on which sample was taken.    The second answer is that the question doesn't make sense. What do   you mean by ``English letters''? The ``English language'' is not a   fixed, finite, closed object that can be exactly characterized. It   has changed over time; it is different between different authors.   Any particular message will have different statistics from those of   the language as a whole.    The third answer is that yes, no particular message is going to have   exactly the same characteristics as English in general, but for all   reasonable statistical uses these slight discrepancies won't matter.   In fact there's an entire field called ``Bayesian statistics'' (other   buzzwords are ``maximum entropy methods'' and ``maximum likelihood   estimation'') which studies questions like ``What's the chance that a   text with these letter frequencies is in English?'' and comes up with   reasonably robust answers.    So make your own list from your own samples of English text. It will   be good enough for practical work, if you use it properly.  * What is the Enigma?    ``For a project in data security we are looking for sources of   information about the German Enigma code and how it was broken by   the British during WWII.''    See [WEL82], [DEA85], [KOZ84], [HOD83], [KAH91].  * How do I shuffle cards?    Card shuffling is a special case of the permutation of an array of   values, using a random or pseudo-random function.  All possible output   permutations of this process should be equally likely.  To do this, you   need a random function (modran(x)) which will produce a uniformly   distributed random integer in the interval [0..x-1].  Given that   function, you can shuffle with the following [C] code: (assuming ARRLTH   is the length of array arr[] and swap() interchanges values at the two   addresses given)    for ( n = ARRLTH-1; n > 0 ; n-- ) swap( &arr[modran( n+1 )], &arr[n] ) ;    modran(x) can not be achieved exactly with a simple (ranno() % x) since   ranno()'s interval may not be divisible by x, although in most cases the   error will be very small.  To cover this case, one can take ranno()'s   modulus mod x, call that number y, and if ranno() returns a value less   than y, go back and get another ranno() value.   * Can I foil S/W pirates by encrypting my CD-ROM?    Someone will frequently express the desire to publish a CD-ROM with   possibly multiple pieces of software, perhaps with each encrypted   separately, and will want to use different keys for each user (perhaps   even good for only a limited period of time) in order to avoid piracy.    As far as we know, this is impossible, since there is nothing in standard   PC or workstation hardware which uniquely identifies the user at the   keyboard.  If there were such an identification, then the CD-ROM could be   encrypted with a key based in part on the one sold to the user and in   part on the unique identifier.  However, in this case the CD-ROM is one   of a kind and that defeats the intended purpose.    If the CD-ROM is to be encrypted once and then mass produced, there must   be a key (or set of keys) for that encryption produced at some stage in   the process.  That key is useable with any copy of the CD-ROM's data.   The pirate needs only to isolate that key and sell it along with the   illegal copy.   * Can you do automatic cryptanalysis of simple ciphers?    Utah sells products that break the password scheme of a number of   popular Macintosh and PC software packages.  Their telephone number   is (801) 224-6970    No PD software has been cited but there are many papers on the   subject....

One very frequently asked question in sci.crypt is about how the VCR+ codes   work.  The following article attempts to describe it.\",\"This reminds me of the last Graham Kerr cooking show I saw.  Today he smoked meat on the stovetop in a big pot!  He used a strange technique I'd never seen before.  He took a big pot with lid, and placed a tray in it made from aluminum foil. The tray was about the size and shape of a typical coffee-table ash tray, made by crumpling a sheet of foil around the edges.  In the tray, he placed a couple spoonfuls of brown sugar, a similar quantity of brown rice (he said any rice will do), the contents of two teabags of Earl Grey tea, and a few cloves.  On top of this was placed an ordinary aluminum basket-type steamer, with two chicken breasts in it.  The lid was put on, and the whole assembly went on the stovetop at high heat for 10 or 12 minutes.  Later, he removed what looked like smoked chicken breasts.  What surprises and concerns me are:  1)  No wood chips.  Where does the smoke flavor come from?  2)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember hearing that carmel color     (obtained by caramelizing sugar -- a common coloring and flavoring     agent) had been found to be carcinogenic.  I believe they injected     it under the skin of rats, or something.  If the results were conclusive,     caramel color would not be legal in the U.S., yet it is still being     used.  Was the initial research result found to be incorrect, or what?  3)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember Earl Grey tea being implicated     as carcinogenic, because it contains oil of bergamot (an extract     from the skin of a type of citrus fruit).  Does anyone know whatever     happened with that story?  If it were carcinogenic, Earl Grey tea     could not have it as an additive, yet it apparently continues to do     so.  WRT natural wood smoke (I've smoking a duck right now, as it happens), I've noticed that a heavily-smoked food item will have an unpleasant tangy taste when eaten directly out of the smoker if the smoke has only recently stopped flowing.  I find the best taste to be had by using dry wood chips, getting lots of smoke right up at the beginning of the cooking process, then slowly barbequing for hours and hours without adding additional wood chips.  My theory is that the unpleasant tangy molecules are low-molecular weight stuff, like terpenes, and that the smoky flavor molecules are some sort of larger molecule more similar to tar.  The long barbeque time after the initial intensive smoke drives off the low-molecular weight stuff, just leaving the flavor behind.  Does anyone know if my theory is correct?  I also remember hearing that the combustion products of fat dripping on the charcoal and burning are carcinogenic.  For that reason, and because it covers the product with soot and some unpleasant tanginess, I only grill non-drippy meats like prawns directly over hot coals.  I do stuff like this duck by indirect heat.  I have a long rectangular Weber, and I put the coals at one end and the meat at the other end.  The fat drops directly on the floor below the meat, and next time I use the barbeque I make the fire in that end to burn off the fat and help ignite the coals.  And yet another reason I've heard not to smoke or barbeque meat is that smoked cured meat, like pork sausage and bacon, contains nitrosamines, which are carcinogenic.  I'm pretty sure this claim actually has some standing, don't know about the others.\",\"I was a graduate student in the early 1980s, and we had a conference on  Reaganomics where Jerry Jordan, then a member of the Council of Economic  Advisors, was a speaker.  I had the pleasure of driving him back to the  airport afterwards, and since taxes were the main topic of discussion I  thought I would ask him about the VAT.  I have favored it for these reasons  you mention, that the income base is too hazy to define, that it taxes  savings and investment, that it is likely to be more visible.  He agreed,  and reported that the CEA at that time was in favor of VAT.  So why not  propose it?  I asked.  He replied that the Reagan White House feared that  the Democrats would introduce VAT *in addition to* the income tax, rather  than in lieu.  Better not to give them any ideas, he said.  Pretty prescient.  Yes, any Canadian readers, please tell us if the tax is displayed on price  stickers (I'm relatively certain it is not in Europe).\",\"Please Ineed information about desk top publishe- post graduate courses and if possible email address or normal mail. thanks in advance \",\"   Here is another anecdotal story.  I am a picky eater and never wanted to  try chinese food, however, I finally tried some in order to please a girl I was seeing at the time.  I had never heard of Chinese restaurant syndrome.  A group of us went to the restaurant and all shared 6 different dishes.  It didn't taste great, but I decided it wasn't so bad.  We went home and went to bed early.  I woke up at 2 AM and puked my guts outs. I threw up for so long that (I'm not kidding) I pulled a muscle in my tongue.  Dry heaves and everything.  No one else got sick, and I'm not allergic to anything that I know of.    Suffice to say that I wont go into a chinese restaurant unless I am  physically threatened.  The smell of the food makes me ill (and that *is* a psycholgical reaction).  When I have been dragged in to suffer through beef and broccoli without any sauces, I insist on no MSG.

Christopher\",\" I don't meant to defend Eric Molas- I find it somewhat annoying when someone pops up on alt.atheism to tell us all about his (usually atheistic) beliefs, so I can certainly see how Christians might be annoyed- but I'd like to point out a few things.   \\\"no meaning from God\\\" is not the same as \\\"no meaning\\\". From my (atheistic) point of view, if you want meaning in your life, you get to go and get some or make some.  No free gifts of meaning. (I never quite understood how any God can just \\\"give\\\" your life meaning, actually. If he says you exists to do or be X, that gives you a purpose if you care to accept it, but is that the same thing? But I digress...)    This would truely be a miserably existance, which I doubt Eric endures. Life can be enjoyable, so you can live it because you like it, or purposefull, so you can live it to get something done. One should endeavour to make it so, if it is not. Otherwise it would be as you say. Terrible.   Probably true. Remeber he almost certainly sees that particular joy as an illusion, and does not want it. So maybe it isn't so bad?   As an atheist, I am free to be a human person. I think, love, choose, and create.   Ah, now here we begin to diverge. I will not live forever with anyone.  (I don't think you will either, but you are welcome to your opinion on the matter.)   I tend to agree with you.  It's my opinion that (unlike drugs) religions are normal parts of human societies.  I think they have outlived their usefullness, but they are evidently quite ordinary, normal things that haven't proved lethal to humanity yet.   I have heard this claim quite a few times. Does anybody here know who first came up with the \\\"God-shaped hole\\\" business?   You might want to provide some evidence next time you make a claim like this.

During the season, he was probably more valuable than, say, putting Olerud out there to pitch, but yeah, he *was* valuable in getting them there. In the postseason, he sucked dirty canal water through a straw. The Jays won *in spite* of Morris much more than *because of* him.   Umm, Roger? Return with us to those halcyon days of a few postings ago, where the poster Valentine was replying to used # of WS rings as a measure of better. The concept is called \\\"context\\\", and you should really become familiar with it someday.   Unless this transaltes to \\\"Clemens hasn't gone into Lou Gorman's office with a large caliber handgun and refused to come out until he'd been traded to the Jays,\\\" I'm at a complete loss as to any possible meaning for it.   What on earth does this mean? Over their careers, Clemens has \\\"won\\\" 68% of the games he's started, Morris 58%. Per year, Clemens has averaged nearly 17 wins, Morris just under 15. Would you grant the proposition that preventing the other team from scoring increases your chances of winning  a game? If so, then consider that Clemens allows 2.8 runs/9 innings pitched. Morris allows nearly a run more per nine innings. In fact, Jack Morris has never in his career had an ERA for a single year as good as Clemens' career ERA. But I forget, in the Maynardverse there was obviously some mystical significance to Buckner missing that grounder in 1986; had Morris been on the Sox, it would have been a routine groundout, right?   Speaking of stupid, it has been patiently (and not-so-patiently) explained to you many times that attributing greatness to players based on the accomplishments of their teams makes about as much sense as claiming that a racecar has the most attractive paint job because it won the race. Your continued failure to not only understand but even to intelligently reply to any of the arguments presented leads me to the conclusion that you must have spent a few too many games in goal without a mask.   No one is crying; the Jays won, and as a team they certainly deserved to win at least the AL East. They performed well in two short series and won the World Series, and I congratulate them for it. As a Red Sox fan, I hope they keep Morris. I was happy when they picked up Stewart, and elated when they traded for Darrin Jackson. You see, unless you believe in some mystical link between Morris and the offense, you can hardly help but believe that the man was credited with so many wins last year because he got lucky. Luck runs out, just like it did in 1982 when he pitched 50-odd more innings than 1992, gave up exactly *one* earned run more than in 1992, and went 17-16.  Seriously, Roger, I'd really like to hear your explanation of the difference between the 1982 Morris and the 1992 Morris. Which one was a better pitcher, and why? Did Morris somehow \\\"learn how to win\\\" in the intervening ten years? If so, then why did he go 18-12 in 1991 with Minnesota with an ERA over half a run lower than 1992?

JPEG (pronounced \\\"jay-peg\\\") is a standardized image compression mechanism. JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, the original name of the committee that wrote the standard.  JPEG is designed for compressing either full-color or gray-scale digital images of \\\"natural\\\", real-world scenes. It does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line drawings.  JPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it handle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG respectively.  JPEG is \\\"lossy\\\", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't quite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably the fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details of light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are invisible to the eye.  A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small files if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image archives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you aren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.   [2]  Why use JPEG?  There are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store 24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.  Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a 2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the size ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)  If your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have to convert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even with a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image than to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using JPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply.  It's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file.  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.  The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet posting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel (16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have only 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as black-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed in section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably more appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.   [3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?  JPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images, GIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first things to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.  As a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or gray-scale images of \\\"realistic\\\" scenes; that means scanned photographs and similar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit display hardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)  GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors, such as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels that are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by GIF.  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without introducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form. (In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they should be avoided in JPEG files.)  JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels adjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly often in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is particularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high. If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it.  Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and subtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it. The same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).  Plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG. You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale images.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images of up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.  If you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you should convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do. (Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only applies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from a GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG can only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify converting anyway.  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself. If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be prepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not convert well.   [4]  How well does JPEG compress images?  Pretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have handy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three files are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG software described in section 6B.  File    Size in bytes  Comments  ship.ppm 1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits     or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead) ship.ppm.Z  963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress     compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note.     Other text-oriented compressors give similar results. ship.gif  240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif     Most of the savings is the result of losing color     info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)  ship.jpg95  155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)     This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,     at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs. ship.jpg75   58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)     You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this     from the original, even with both on-screen at once. ship.jpg50   38406  cjpeg -Q 50     This has slight defects; if you know what to look     for, you could tell it's been JPEGed without seeing     the original.  Still as good image quality as many     recent postings in Usenet pictures groups. ship.jpg25   25192  cjpeg -Q 25     JPEG's characteristic \\\"blockiness\\\" becomes apparent     at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).     Still, I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were     of poorer image quality than this. ship.jpg5o    6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)     Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or     indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:     the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !  In this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smaller than a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the GIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical ratio for real-world scenes.   [5]  What are good \\\"quality\\\" settings for JPEG?  Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings.  \\\"Quality 95\\\" does NOT mean \\\"keep 95% of the information\\\", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary; it's not a percentage of anything.  The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting (smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another, but here are some rules of thumb.  The default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for experimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a file two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.  If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to go down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you might need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation. The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG. The default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to 95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).  If you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are prepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is about right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as \\\"op art\\\".  (Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG software described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other JPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different quality scale.  Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just \\\"high\\\"/\\\"medium\\\"/\\\"low\\\"-style choices.)   [6]  Where can I get JPEG software?  Most of the programs described in this section are available by FTP. If you don't know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article \\\"How to find sources\\\". (If you don't have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the same article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can get it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with \\\"send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\\\" in the body.  The \\\"Anonymous FTP List FAQ\\\" may also be helpful --- it's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in the news.answers archive.  NOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple months old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.   [6A]  If you are looking for \\\"canned\\\" software, viewers, etc:  The first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one kind of system.  If you don't see what you want for your machine, check out the portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over Internet; but some commercial programs are listed too.  X Windows:  John Bradley's free XV (version 2.00 and up) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and other image formats.  It's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu or ftp.cis.upenn.edu.  The file is called 'xv-???.tar.Z' (where ??? is the version number, currently 2.21); it is located in the 'contrib' directory on export or the 'pub/xv' directory at upenn.  XV reduces all images to 8 bits internally, which means it's not a real good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you'll still get only 8-bit color).  Also, you shouldn't use XV to convert full-color images to JPEG, because they'll get color-quantized first. But XV is a fine tool for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG. CAUTION: there is a glitch in versions 2.21 and earlier: be sure to check the \\\"save at normal size\\\" checkbox when saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.  Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package, also available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z. This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The ImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped displays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the basic free JPEG software.  Both of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple image viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest release, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage, said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original. (The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4 decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next xloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said to do the right thing with 24-bit displays.   MS-DOS:  This covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.  One good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files. The current version, 2.4a, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca (129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg24a.zip.  This is a good basic viewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is not flashy, but it's functional.  Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview.  The current version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU and a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and OS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit on the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do). You may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a bit tricky; read the directions carefully!  A shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is also much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use --- more keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a little slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than screen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both are faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip. Requires a VESA graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zip or vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in VESA driver, so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains that the driver is missing.)  A second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around the net for a while, but I don't know any stable archive location for it. The current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway. The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.  The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest revision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good: it's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is poor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see a good JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.  Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can't get *any* of them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you have hi-color hardware, don't use GIF as the intermediate format; try to find a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right thing with hi-color displays.)  The Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS compilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will convert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.  Handmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF. These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in particular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietary JPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format files are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version 2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip. NOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is not readable on non-PC platforms.  Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation package, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI formats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images. A demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.1 is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch161.zip.  NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet's key archive site for PC-related programs is Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20 runs a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document refers to directory (eg) \\\"msdos/graphics\\\" at Simtel20, that really means \\\"pd1:<msdos.graphics>\\\".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should expect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several Internet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives; most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA mirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files in (eg) \\\"/pub/msdos/graphics\\\".  If you have no FTP capability, you can retrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in comp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA, consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.  Microsoft Windows:  There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images. (Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware, due to Windows' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion programs described above inside a Windows DOS window.)  The newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0 is available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip. Requires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers. But it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing...  JView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the decompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can't create new JPEG files, and it doesn't view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it's an excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip. (Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites, including wuarchive.wustl.edu.)  WinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files; it can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter. It has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and slideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow 286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version, which is roughly 25% faster.)  ColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising contender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it has no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the current version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file pub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will be appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)  DVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen mode, not in a window.  OS/2:  The following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151). Note: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator is not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip     32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4. /pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip     16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc11.zip     Image Archiver 1.01: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.     Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip     PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows     (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview84.zip     PMView 0.84: JPEG/GIF/BMP viewer.  GIF viewing very fast, JPEG viewing     fast if you have huge amounts of RAM, otherwise about the same speed     as the above programs.  Strong 24-bit display support.  Shareware, $20.  Macintosh:  Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation, which is part of the QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed. To use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running System 6.0.7 or later.  (If you're running System 6, you must also install the 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get QuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx. (As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0 in several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However, some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)  Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is not the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for details.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format. Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.  The first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images that are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can convert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big improvement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and QuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can view large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it's the only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a typical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down to fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people like this behavior, some don't.  Overall, JPEGView's user interface is very well thought out.  GIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and PICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest version is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later. GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can load and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it's faster with QuickTime.) Note: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try converting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.  JPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx. This will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing. You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.  Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF converter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this program, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.  Apple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and GIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx. Requires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it's really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime. Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display, and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an unsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not intend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called PICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash it, as it's even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much cleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that Picture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)  Storm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter. This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but it will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on older systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can't use it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a downloaded image file to 'JPEG' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.  If your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance), GIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you don't want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.  More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not all can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version 2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG plug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded JPEG file to 'JPEG' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.  Amiga:  (Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at amiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this archive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good choice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)  HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a general image manipulation tool.  It's cheap (shareware, $20) and can read several formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version is available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger than 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.  Rend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM, and GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even capturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The current version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is supposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under AmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)  Viewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.  If you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages that support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24 and Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and ImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting, effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are distributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro), from ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation software for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another well-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.  The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file AmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.  The Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many based on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks to a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without so much as notifying the authors).  Among these are \\\"AugJPEG\\\", \\\"NewAmyJPEG\\\", \\\"VJPEG\\\", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion, anything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space it's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.  Atari ST:  The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc, from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo. These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.  I have not heard of any free or shareware JPEG-capable viewer for Ataris, but surely there must be one by now?  Pointers appreciated.  Acorn Archimedes:  !ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view JPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG, although this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.  Recent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle JPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be found on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by registering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede, The Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).  There's also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write functionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image format conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not necessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST, Cambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.   Portable software for almost any system:  If none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free JPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You'll also need a viewer program. If your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a display with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa or PPM 24-bit image files.  There are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every day.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find the available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case, purchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether the product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can handle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are not and never will be compatible with anyone else's files.   [6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:  Free, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent JPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code, documentation, and some small test files is available from several places. The \\\"official\\\" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9 or 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release is jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don't forget to retrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP. If you are on a PC and don't know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may prefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on CompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip. If you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest comp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34. (If you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ article \\\"How to find sources\\\", referred to at the top of section 6.)  The free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG \\\"JFIF\\\" format and image files in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats. The core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other programs, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have tested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.  We have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use. Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products. We do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in product literature (see the README file in the distribution for details). We hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with anything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.  The Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you'd like to contribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.   [7]  What's all this hoopla about color quantization?  Most people don't have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware. Typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display 256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors.  This process is called \\\"color quantization\\\".  (This is something of a misnomer, \\\"color selection\\\" would be a better term.  We're stuck with the standard usage though.)  Clearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most images, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at the very lowest JPEG quality settings).  Since JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display on 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for *all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what comes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors. This happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a little differently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets \\\"smeared\\\" into a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to display a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image source.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.  (Incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see posted images described as \\\"256-color JPEG\\\".  This tells me that the poster (a) hasn't read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF. JPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but number of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG.)  On the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to 256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its palette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.) For purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to. This is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you're stuck with the sender's quantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image. Furthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantization algorithm, you're out of luck.  For this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware. JPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's display hardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in this area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG images you already have.  With a GIF, you're stuck forevermore with what was sent.  It's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA display, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it's also due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average GIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!  Finally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display hardware already: 15-bit \\\"hi-color\\\" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on workstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already obsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their display.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively. Thus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images in a machine-independent fashion.   [8]  How does JPEG work?  The buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine transforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy coding.  This article's long enough already, so I'm not going to say more than that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ. This is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files /pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in using the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.   [9]  What about lossless JPEG?  There's a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the final output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG algorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few implementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.  Saying \\\"-Q 100\\\" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image. What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say \\\"-sample 1x1\\\" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial JPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)  Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG algorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye, but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.  At this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG provides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees bit-for-bit accuracy.  If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the JBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG lossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with 6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a Huffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.   [10]  Why all the argument about file formats?  Strictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms; it does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations.  Since we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of official standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to \\\"do their own thing\\\", and as a result their programs aren't compatible with anybody else's.  The closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work that's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined two JPEG-based file formats:   * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a \\\"low-end\\\" format that transports     pixels and not much else.   * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is     a \\\"high-end\\\" format that will let you record just about everything you     ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is     a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,     because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different     and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It's not likely that adding JPEG to the     mix will do anything to improve this situation. Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of JPEG-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards.  I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in picture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the TIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well defined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported \\\"lowest common denominator\\\"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.  A particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTime software for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped inside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and QuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are available to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor that handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF by hand; see section 11 for details.  Another particular case is Handmade Software's programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and Image Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF format.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by HSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be used for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This applies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF format by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format files, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)   [11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?  If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read, it's likely to be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:  1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,     followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'JFIF'.  2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a     \\\"raw JPEG\\\" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---     it's worth a try, anyway.  3.  HSI files start with 'hsi1'.  You're out of luck unless you have HSI     software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they     won't decompress properly with non-HSI programs.  4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred     bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for 'JFIF').  Strip off     everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.  5.  Anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are     lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.     If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),     try stripping off everything before that.  In uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is   \\\"begin\\\" line  M_]C_X ...  whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with   \\\"begin\\\" line  M:'-I ...  If you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of downloading non-JFIF files.   [12]  What about arithmetic coding?  The JPEG spec defines two different \\\"back end\\\" modules for the final output of compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed. The choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the file-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)  Unfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the JPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi. Thus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses from these companies.  (The \\\"fair use\\\" doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best.)  At least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify the potential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not* be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.  There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future.  Stay tuned for further details.   [13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?  It would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could decompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially. Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered image loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the first time around.  The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an identical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current free JPEG software.  It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation output.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.) One of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.  In any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original quality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation. (If you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move. If you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but that's a mighty limited capability!)  The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format (PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are ready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot of compression/decompression time this way :-).   [14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?  As stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original full-color data the GIF was made from, it's far better to make a JPEG from that.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from, here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality.  The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to make sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF; that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in section 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors don't convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality will be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)  Experience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best candidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation. Don't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don't expect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created directly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through JPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file, not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).  Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color border around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts (\\\"ghost\\\" edges).  Do yourself a favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows system, XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this.)  cjpeg's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but for GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher Q setting may not be necessary.)  Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually \\\"dithered\\\" to fool your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store. If you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The trouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency color noise; and JPEG can't compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it). To get around this, you want to \\\"smooth\\\" the GIF image before compression. Smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of the compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image than you'd get without smoothing.  With the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing capability is built in.  Try \\\"-smooth 10\\\" or so when converting GIFs. Values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular fine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong smoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image, which you don't want.  If you are an image processing wizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as pnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg's built-in smoother is a LOT faster than pnmconvol...  The upshot of all this is that \\\"cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10\\\" is probably a good starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the image, you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.   ---------------------  For more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in particular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net. \",\"   I hope you realize how trivial it is to manufacture these compounds.  Given about $10k in lab equipment and chemicals (which are commercially available) and given the knowledge that I have (graduating BS, Ch, 1993) I could  synthesize enough of these compounds to make a serious dent in the population of several major US cities.

In the case of chemical agents, I seriously doubt that you would even know that someone had set up a lab until after the weapons had been used.    Part of the trouble with the chemical-weapons ban treaty between the US and the USSR is that many of the precursors to chemical weapons such as GB and Sarin, etc., is that they have very valid commercial uses, and  it is very easy to divert those precursors to chemical weapons manufacture without anyone knowing about it.   \",\"Has anyone successfully converted Interleaf graphics to CGM, or even heard of it being done????

It sounds like you're suggesting  Bill James had something to do with overhyping the kid to death. Au contraire; he was fairly critical of him after his ROY campaign, noting that he wasn't all-world as a catcher or a hitter. He called him basically average when everyone *else* in the media was predicting the next Johnny Bench or Roy Campanella.      Which reports are those?      I like Hernandez a lot, but if Piazza can catch the ball, you've gotta play him IMHO. He's a much better hitter, although Hernandez isn't a *bad* hitter. Right now, it sounds like Piazza will catch most of the time and Hernandez will be Candiotti's caddy since he can catch the knuckler. As long as they play up to their abilities, the Dodgers could have a very good catching tandem.       I think both are overrated defensively (see Nichols' Law of catcher defense), but that's something that's difficult to prove or disprove from your viewpoint or mine.

In the same way if a company decides that it has  political objectives it might wish to regulate postings in a political manner. This is no worse than Rupert Murdoch using his papers as a political platform for his views.    ah yes you did not quote them, merely refered to them.    Your article consisted of a reference to the first ammendment, your signature and pretty well damn all else.     Are you refering to the initial hearings on an injunction or the judgments on the substantive case?  The initial hearings that the government won were judged on the not unresonable judgment that assertion by the government that the national interest might be harmed would be grounds for prior restraint. The second set of hearings on the substance judged that the government had no case and that the official secrets act could not be used to suppress information in thwe public domain already. The part that they won was over the copyright issue which is rather separate.  Here again the issue of censorship is rather different in the case that information is divulged on the understanding that it will not be communicated to third parties. The first ammendment certainly does not apply in this case as the numerous prosecutions of spies in the US proves.   The crux of the Spycatcher affair was extrateritoriality of British law. The censorship aspect of it arose as a result of the government's ludicrous attempts to prevent summary of the case in the book.     Funny I saw that as a rejection of an assertion that you had made. Of course in rejecting an assertion I have to make a contrary assertion, since this assertion is unprovable I left it at that.   So far I have not seen you demonstrate a command of the contrary opinion to your own. You are attacking my anti-censorship view because I dare to accept the validity of some pro-censorship arguments while rejecting their conclusions.  Plus I am not an absolutist. I have this funny idea that the solution to this problem was not decided in 1789 by a group of white male gentry in secret session and sumarized in a single line. Furthermore I don't think that the issues are half as simple as you imply.   I don't think that you have geered your discourse to any audience save that of proving that you are the only person wearing a white hat. \",\"  The company was probably \\\"Public Missiles, Inc\\\" of Michigan.   Yup.   Nope, it's not illegal. It is, however, closely regulated. In order to  purchase and use the big rocket motors required, it is necessary to be one of the following: a) An employee of a government agency. b) An employee or student at a university doing research involving rockets. c) A member or representative of an educational organization involved in research or other uses of rockets. There are two such organizations:  The Tripoli Rocketry Association and the National Association of Rocketry. Members of either organization must demonstrate proficiency in construction and flight before they are allowed to purchase large motors on their own.  The FAA will issue a waiver of its regulations, upon request, to any  organization which can persuade them it has taken adequate precautions  to avoid conflicts with aircraft. The usual stipulations are: - Only operation up to a specified ceiling is allowed. Depending on the location, this ceiling may be from 5000 to 50000 feet AGL.  - The operator of the rocket is responsible for avoiding any aircraft within the operating radius around the launch site. - Flight into clouds or beyond visual range in haze is expressly prohibited. - The FAA will provide a NOTAM informing other users of the airspace that unmanned rocket operations are taking place at the specified place and time.  Most of the launches that are held (and there are dozens of them every year) are held in areas where air traffic is relatively light, such as over the western deserts (the Black Rock Desert north of Reno is particularly popular since it is 25 x 150 miles of *nothing to hit* on the ground).  The two rocketry associations test and approve motors for their members' use, to insure safety. Depending on motor size, the launcher setback is from 50 to 500 or more feet.   By the way, rockets under 1 lb and powered by an \\\"F\\\" motor are exempt from most Federal regulations on unmanned rockets anyway. See FAR 101, Subpart C, for details.  As for recovery...although the higher altitude rockets can reach up to 50,000 feet, most of them only get to 2,000 to 5,000 feet. The typical rocket is 2 to 6 inches in diameter, and carries a 3 to 6 foot parachute, or multiple parachutes, depending on the payload. Many rockets also carry either a small transmitter or an audio sounder--particularly at launches in the eastern US, where there are more obstructions.  Camera, telemetry transmitter, and video payloads are becoming quite common.   Why not? It's a lot of fun...check out the traffic on rec.models.rockets for information about the model (3 lb and under) and high power (everything bigger) rocket hobbies. As with all dangerous activities, the key is to practice safety. I've been flying consumer rockets ranging up to 4-5 lbs takeoff weight for 27 years, and still have all my extremities intact.   That's another thing. NO EXPLOSIVE WARHEADS OF ANY KIND ARE ALLOWED ON THESE ROCKETS. NONE! Please forgive me for shouting, but that's one of the biggest misconceptions people have about our hobby.   True. But it will not be related to the rocket hobby, unless I get  hit while crossing a road with a rocket in my hand. \",\"  Another CPR Non-Fact.

If you've got $20,000 per seat and high-end hardware, Gain Momentum might be a good choice.  It isn't compatible with HyperCard, but has a similar architecture (and *way* more functionality).  I don't have contact information, but they were recently purchased by Sybase who shouldn't be too hard to find.  If you're running News on SPARC, check out HyperLook (hyperlook@turing.com).  It uses Postscript as a scripting language which is good if you need to do lots of display oriented scripting, but not so good for non-programmers.  It was $995, last I heard.  You might also look at our product MetaCard.

I would just add to Phil's very infomative discussion the following caveat: the fifth amendment applies ONLY in crinial cases.  (\\\"...nor shall any person . . . be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself...\\\"). Thus if the father sued for custody of the children, the case would be civil and the defendant mother would not have fifth amendment protection. Oddly enough, her refusal to give information in a civil case can lead to criminal contempt charges (thus landing her in jail.)  The interesting part of all this is that in a murder trial, the woman CAN plead the fifth as  to the location of the child--this is routine.  A \\\"computer crime\\\"  prosecution thus would seem to be fertile ground for this kind of defense,  where a suit by a party injured by \\\"hackers\\\" would not.  If I am accused,  for example, of sending encrypted kiddie porn over the nets the fifth should  protect my key.  If I am accused of sending copyrighted material, however, it proabably will not (copyright infringement not being a \\\"crime\\\" in the technical sense.)

Hm.  I am not all that great at figuring it out.  But I would maximize the percentage of colony-space that is accessible to humans.  Esecially if there were to be children, since they will figure out how to go everywhere anyways.

This helps get away from the small-town \\\"everybody knows everything\\\" syndrome, which some people like but I don't.  Call it several thousand people.  For physical dimensions, a somewhat similar criterion:  big enough to contain surprises, at least until you spent considerable time getting to know it.  As a more specific rule of thumb, big enough for there to be places at least an hour away on foot.  Call that 5km, which means a 10km circumference if we're talking a sphere.

Zionism agrees with the basic tenet of anti-Semitism, namely that Jews cannot live with non- Jews.  The history and roots of the Holocaust go back a long way. While the industru of death and destruction did not operate before 1942, its roots were firmly placed in the 19th Century. Jewish aspirations for emancipation emerged out of the national struggles in Europe. When the hopes for liberation through bourgeois-democratic change were dashed, other alternatives for improving the lot of the Jews of Europe achieved prominence.  The socialist Bund, a mass movement with enormous following, had to contend with opposition from a new and small, almost insignificant opponent, the political Zionists.  In outline these two offered diametrically opposed options for Jews in Europe. While the Bund was suggesting joining forces with the rest of Europe's workers, the Zionists were proposing a new programme aimed at ridding Europe of its Jews by setting up some form of a Jewish state.  Historically, nothing is inevitable, all depends on the balance of forces involved in the struggle. History can be seen as an option tree: every time a certain option is chosen, other routes become barred. Because of that choice, movement backwards to the point before that choice was made is impossible. While Zionism as an option was taken by many young Jews, it remained a minority position until the first days of the 3rd Reich. The Zionist Federation of Germany (ZVfD), an organisation representing a tiny minority of German Jews, was selected by the Nazis as the body to represent the Jews of the Reich. Its was the only flag of an interantional organisation allowed to fly in Berlin, and this was the only international organisation allowed to operate during this period. From a marginal position, the leaders of the Zionist Federation were propelled to a prominence and centrality that surprised even them. All of a sudden they attained political power, power based not on representation, but from being selected as the choice of the Nazi regime for dealing with the the 'Jewish problem'. Their position in negotiating with the Nazis agreements that affected the lives of many tens of thousands of the Jews in Germany transformed them from a utopian, marginal organisation in Germany (and some other countries in Europe) into a real option to be considered by German Jews.  The best example of this was the 'Transfer Agreement' of 1934. Immediately after the Nazi takeover in 1933, Jews all over the world supported or were organising a world wide boycott of German goods. This campaign hurt the Nazi regime and the German authorities searched frantically for a way disabling the boycott. It was clear that if Jews and Jewish organisations were to pull out, the campaign would collapse.  This problem was solved by the ZVfD. A letter sent to the Nazi party as early as 21.  June 1933, outlined the degree of agreement that existed between the two organisations on the question of race, nation, and the nature of the 'Jewish problem', and it offered to collaborate with the new regime:  \\\"The realisation of Zionism could only be hurt by resentment of Jews abroad against the German development. Boycott propaganda - such as is currently being carried out against Germany in many ways - is in essence unZionist, because Zionism wants not to do battle but to convince and build.\\\"  In their eagerness to gain credence and the backing of the new regime, the Zionist organisation managed to undermine the boycott. The main public act was the signature of the \\\"Transfer Agreement\\\" with the Nazi authorities during the Zionist Congress of 1934. In essence, the agreement was designed to get Germany's Jews out of the country and into Mandate Palestine. It provided a possibility for Jews to take a sizeable part of their property out of the country, through a transfer of German goods to Palestine. This right was denied to Jews leaving to any other destination. The Zionist organisation was the acting agent, through its financial organisations. This agreement operated on a number of fronts - 'helping' Jews to leave the country, breaking the ring of the boycott, exporting German goods in large quantities to Palestine, and last but not least, enabling the regime to be seen as humane and reasonable even towards its avowed enemies, the Jews. After all, they argued, the Jews do not belong in Europe and now the Jews come and agree with them.  After news of the agreement broke, the boycott was doomed. If the Zionist Organization found it possible and necessary to deal with the Nazis, and import their goods, who could argue for a boycott ? This was not the first time that the interests of both movements were presented to the German public as complementary. Baron Von Mildenstein, the first head of the Jewish Department of the SS, later followed by Eichmann, was invited to travel to Palestine. This he did in early 1933, in the company of a Zionist leader, Kurt Tuchler. Having spent six months in Palestine, he wrote a series of favourable articles in Der STURMER describing the 'new Jew' of Zionism, a Jew Nazis could accept and understand.  This little-known episode established quite clearly the relationship during the early days of Nazism, between the new regime and the ZVfD, a relationship that was echoed later in a number of key instances, even after the nature of the Final Solution became clear. In many cases this meant a silencing of reports about the horrors of the exterminations. A book concentrating on this aspect of the Zionist reaction to the Holocaust is Post-Ugandan Zionism in the Crucible of the Holocaust, by S. B. Beth-Zvi.  In the case of the Kastner episode, around which Jim Allen's play PERDITION is based, even the normal excuse of lack of knowledge of the real nature of events does not exist. It occured near the end of the war. The USSR had advanced almost up to Germany. Italy and the African bases had been lost. The Nazis were on the run, with a number of key countries, such as Rumania, leaving the Axis. A second front was a matter of months away, as the western Allies prepared their forces. In the midst of all this we find Eichmann, the master bureaucrat of industrial murder, setting up his HZ in occupied Budapest, after the German takeover of the country in April 1944. His first act was to have a conference with the Jewish leadership, and to appoint Zionist Federation members, headed by Kastner as the agent and clearing house for all Jews and their relationship with the SS and the Nazr authorities. Why they did this is not difficult to see. As opposed to Poland, where its three and  a half million Jews lived in ghettoes and were visibly different from the rest of the Polish population, the Hungarian Jews were an integrated part of the community. The middle class was mainly Jewish, the Jews were mainly middle-class. They enjoyed freedom of travel, served in the Hungarian (fascist) army in fronline units, as officers and soldiers, their names were Hungarian - how was Eichmann to find them if they were to be exterminated ? The task was not easy, there were a million Jews in Hungary, most of them resident, the rest being refugees from other countries. Many had  heard about the fate of Jews elsewhere, and were unlikely to believe any statements by Nazi officials.  Like elsewhere, the only people who had the information and the ear of the frightened Jewish population were the Judenrat. In this case the Judenrat comprsied mainly the Zionist Federation members. Without their help the SS, with 19 officers and less than 90 men, plus a few hundred Hungarian police, could not have collected and controlled a million Jews, when they did not even know their whereabouts. Kastner and the others were left under no illusions. Eichmann told Joel Brand, one of the members of Kastner's committee, that he intended to send all Hungary's Jews to Auschwitz, before he even started the expulsions!  He told them clearly that all these Jews will die, 12,000 a day, unless certain conditions were met.  The Committee faced a simple choice - to tell the Jews of Hungary about their fate, (with neutral Rumania, where many could escape, being in most cases a few hours away) or to collaborate with the Nazis by assisting in the concentration process. What would not have been believed when coming from the SS, sounded quite plausible when coming from the mouths of the Zionist leadership. Thus it is, that most of the Hungarian Jews went quietly to their death, assured by their leadership that they were to be sent to work camps.  To be sure, there are thirty pieces of silver in this narrative of destruction: the trains of 'prominents' which Eichmann promised to Kastner - a promise he kept to the last detail. For Eichmann it was a bargain: allowing 1,680 Jews to survive, as the price paid for the silent collaboration over the death of almost a million Jews.  There was no way in which the Jews of Hungary could even be located, not to say murdered, without the full collaboration of Kastner and his few friends. No doubt the SS would hunt a few Jews here and there, but the scale of the operation would have been miniscule compared to the half million who died in Auschwitz.  It is important to realise that Kastner was not an aberration, like say Rumkovsky in Lodz. Kastner acted as a result of his strongly held Zionist convictions. His actions were a logical outcome of earlier positions. This is instanced when he exposed to the Gestapo the existence of a British cell of saboteurs, Palgi and Senesh, and persuaded them to give themselves up, so as not to disrupt his operations. At no point during his trial or elsewhere, did Kastner deny that he knew exactly what was to happen to those Jews.\",\"To: ad994@Freenet.carleton.ca  JW> 1) Where is there a book or code that will teach me how JW> to read and write pcx,dbf,and gif files?

Ville Siren's slap  shot from the blue line on power play made it 1-1, and Juha Riihijarvi  scored a nice goal in another power play when he close in front of goal  put the puck high over Aslin, 1-2 after the first period.  The Finns started the second period with really good pressure. Korpisalo  made it 1-3 with another goal from close range high over Aslin. Then,  during the Finnish pressure, Sweden turned the game around in 1:47.  Mikael Renberg worked hard behind the Finnish goal, and passed the puck to  Jan Larsson in front, who backhanded the puck low, 2-3. Rundqvist entered  the Finnish zone and passed to Ahlund, and the Finnish defense let Ahlund   skate in and take a shot that Ketterer dropped into the goal, 3-3.  Next, Roger Hansson -behind the goal- sent the puck back to the blue line  where Roger Akerstrom took a slap shot and Ketterer didn't see the puck since  there was traffic in front, 4-3.  Third period started with a nice goal by Stefan \\\"the Shadow\\\" Nilsson. Stefan  and Patrik Juhlin entered the Finnish zone, Patrik passed the puck back to  Stefan who alone with Ketterer made no mistake, 5-3.  Then, Keijo Sailynoja show started. He reduce and equalized the lead in only  21 seconds! First he scored the 5-4 goal, and after that he came in alone   with Aslin but was tripped by Aslin to get a penalty shot. Sailynoja  made a nice penalty shot, showed forehand and put in with a low backhand shot.  The Swedes seemed to head for a win when Mikael Renberg scored the 6-5 goal  late in the game on a nice power play combination. Renberg waited in the slot,  showed that he wanted the puck on the backhand side, Ahlund passed the puck  and Renberg took a turnaround shot low in Ketterer's goal's far side.  But Jari Korpisalo had other plans as he only 28 seconds later scored the  game's final goal to make it 6-6. Korpisalo took a slap shot from a narrow  angle that -maybe- Aslin should have saved.   All in all, a decent game where the defense wasn't the best.  Both teams juggled around the lines a bit in the second and third period  to try no combinations.   Renberg and Rundqvist plays well together in the Swedish team. Larsson-  Nilsson-Juhlin best line overall again, it seems to be a working WC line.  Stillman good on defense.  Some players aren't good enough for the WC though. Hakan Ahlund (faell ner  hjaelmen och jobba!), Roger Hansson, Challe Berglund, Kenny Jonsson  will likely have to leave for NHL pros.   Two-goal scorers Jari Korpisalo and Keijo Sailynoja played well in the  Finnish team. Markus Ketterer didn't have a very good game, we've seen him  a lot better, so Lindfors is probably Finland's starting goalie in the WC.  I heard that Esa Tikkanen will join the Finnish team. It would be inter-  resting to know which other pros coach Matikainen counts on for the WC.   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Starting lines:    SWEDEN     FINLAND    35.

Usually they are, but you get so used to it, it just gets tuned out.  Yes, this is what I've read about it... not just from my own personal experience.    Millions have it, according to my physician.  You just learn to cope with it (like I mentioned earlier) by ignoring it.  It eventually becomes unconscious.

What I was asking is this:  Please show me that the most effective substance-absure recovery programs involve meetinsg peoples' spiritual needs, rather than merely attempting to fill peoples' spiritual needs as percieved by the people, A.A, S.R.C. regulars, or snoopy. This will probably involve defining \\\"spritual needs\\\" (is it not that clear) and showing that such things exist and how they can be filled.  Annother tack you might take is to say that \\\"fulfilling spiritual needs\\\" means \\\"acknowledging a \\\"higher power\\\" of some sort, then show that systems that do require this, work better than otherwise identical systems that do not. A correlation here would help you, but as you point out this might just be demonstrating swapping one crutch for annother. (however, I do feel that religion is usually a better crutch than alchohol, as it is not usually poisonous! :) )  I hope with that clarification, my question will be answerable. I actually did know about the 12 step program, its the question of what it does, rather than what it tries to do, that makes a difference to me. ---    - Dan Johnson And God said \\\"Jeeze, this is dull\\\"... and it *WAS* dull.

Assuming that the helmet/ head assembly takes the same impact, if the shell cracks in one case, then in the other the liner must be dented, or the head gets jiggled. If it's the the liner that's dented, the helmet is just as toast as if the shell were cracked, it won't absorb energy form an impact in that area.

Any suggestions, opinions about post-trace anti-aliasing would be greatly appreciated.\",\"   It's not a bad question: I don't have any refs that list this algorithm either. But thinking about it a bit, it shouldn't be too hard.  1) Take three of the points and find the plane they define as well as the circle that they lie on (you say you have this algorithm already)  2) Find the center  of this circle. The line passing through this center perpendicular to the plane of the three points passes through the center of the sphere.  3) Repeat with the unused point and two of the original points. This gives you two different lines that both pass through the sphere's origin. Their interection is the center of the sphere.  4) the radius is easy to compute, it's just the distance from the center to any of the original points.  I'll leave the math to you, but this is a workable algorithm. :-)   An alternate method would be to take pairs of points: the plane formed by the perpendicular bisector of each line segment pair also contains the center of the sphere. Three pairs will form three planes, intersecting at a point. This might be easier to implement.\",\"I don't know anything about this particular case, but *other* governments have been known to follow events on the Usenet.  For example after Tienanmien Square in Beijing the Chinese government began monitoring cyberspace.

But what's the big deal?  You shouldn't advocate illegal acts in this medium in any case.  If you are concerned about being monitored, you should use encyrption software (available in IGC's \\\"micro\\\" conference).

In an effort to make my 3.5\\\" drive  (normally b:) my a: drive, I switched the order of connections on the cable  from the serial card/floppy/ide controller. I booted up, changed the CMOS settings to reflect the a: drive as the 3.5 and the b: drive as the 5.25. The drive lights didn't come on, and there was a failure trying to read from those drives.  I switched the cables back to their original positions, and then booted-up and restored the original CMOS settings. The lights for the floppies came on during this process, and they stay on for as long as the computer is on. I see that when there is a disk in a:, the drive is spinning, yet there seems to be no disk access. MSD.EXE and Norton SI detect both drives, but when I  try to get detailed information about a: or b:, Norton SI tells me that there is no disk in the drive.  Can anyone offer any suggestions?

This is   a very good dirt bike and has been maintained perfectly.  I never had   any problems with it.    It's a four stroke, 4 valves, liquid cooled engine. It is heavier than    a 250 2 stroke but still lighter than a Honda XR600 and has a lot better    suspension (Ohlins shock, Husky fork) than the XR. For the casual or non   competitive rider, the engine is much better than any two stroke.   You can easily lug up hills and blast through trails with minimum gear   changes.

THE CLIPPER CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY                                 Dorothy Denning                             Revised, April 21, 1993   INTRODUCTION  On April 16, the President announced a new initiative that will bring together the Federal Government and industry in a voluntary program to provide secure communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement.  At the heart of the plan is a new tamper-proof encryption chip called the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" together with a split-key approach to escrowing keys.  Two escrow agencies are used, and the key parts from both are needed to reconstruct a key.   CHIP CONTENTS  The Clipper Chip contains a classified single-key 64-bit block encryption algorithm called \\\"Skipjack.\\\"  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys (compared with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling (compared with 16 for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  The algorithm takes 32 clock ticks, and in Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode runs at 12 Mbits per second.  Each chip includes the following components:     the Skipjack encryption algorithm    F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips    N, a 30-bit serial number (this length is subject to change)    U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip  The chips are programmed by Mykotronx, Inc., which calls them the \\\"MYK-78.\\\"  The silicon is supplied by VLSI Technology Inc.  They are implemented in 1 micron technology and will initially sell for about $30 each in quantities of 10,000 or more.  The price should drop as the technology is shrunk to .8 micron.   ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP  To see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T telephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and we both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure conversation, my security device will negotiate an 80-bit session key K with the device at the other end.  This key negotiation takes place without the Clipper Chip.  In general, any method of key exchange can be used such as the Diffie-Hellman public-key distribution method.  Once the session key K is established, the Clipper Chip is used to encrypt the conversation or message stream M (digitized voice).  The telephone security device feeds K and M into the chip to produce two values:     E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and     E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement field ,   which are transmitted over the telephone line.  The law enforcement field thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U concatenated with the serial number N, all encrypted under the family key F.  The law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after an authorized wiretap has been installed.  The ciphertext E[M; K] is decrypted by the receiver's device using the session key:     D[E[M; K]; K] = M .   CHIP PROGRAMMING AND ESCROW  All Clipper Chips are programmed inside a SCIF (Secure Compartmented Information Facility), which is essentially a vault.  The SCIF contains a laptop computer and equipment to program the chips.  About 300 chips are programmed during a single session.  The SCIF is located at Mykotronx.  At the beginning of a session, a trusted agent from each of the two key escrow agencies enters the vault.  Agent 1 enters a secret, random 80-bit value S1 into the laptop and agent 2 enters a secret, random 80-bit value S2. These random values serve as seeds to generate unit keys for a sequence of serial numbers.  Thus, the unit keys are a function of 160 secret, random bits, where each agent knows only 80.    To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1. S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a 64-bit block R1:          R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .  Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:            R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1]          R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .  R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow agencies.  As a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are written onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part U1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third disk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent 2 takes the second disk.  Thus each agent walks away knowing an 80-bit seed and the 80-bit key parts.  However, the agent does not know the other 80 bits used to generate the keys or the other 80-bit key parts.    The third disk is used to program the chips.  After the chips are programmed, all information is discarded from the vault and the agents leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional assurance that no information is left behind.   The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the room instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2, and the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to the escrow agencies.   The escrow agencies have as yet to be determined, but they will not be the NSA, CIA, FBI, or any other law enforcement agency.  One or both may be independent from the government.   LAW ENFORCEMENT USE  When law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line, they will first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get access to the communications line.  Let us assume that the tap is in place and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with the Clipper Chip.  The law enforcement field is first decrypted with the family key F, giving E[K; U] + N.  Documentation certifying that a tap has been authorized for the party associated with serial number N is then sent (e.g., via secure FAX) to each of the key escrow agents, who return (e.g., also via secure FAX) U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are XORed together to produce the unit key U, and E[K; U] is decrypted to get the session key K.  Finally the message stream is decrypted.  All this will be accomplished through a special black box decoder.   CAPSTONE: THE NEXT GENERATION  A successor to the Clipper Chip, called \\\"Capstone\\\" by the government and \\\"MYK-80\\\" by Mykotronx, has already been developed.  It will include the Skipjack algorithm, the Digital Signature Standard (DSS), the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA), a method of key exchange, a fast exponentiator, and a randomizer.  A prototoype will be available for testing on April 22, and the chips are expected to be ready for delivery in June or July. \",\"Archive-name: rec-autos/part4  [this article is one of a pair of articles containing commonly asked automotive questions; the other article contains questions of general consumer interest, and is broken out to facilitate crossposting to misc.consumers -- rpw]  [last change: 8 February 1993; CT now permits radar detector usage,     new tire-traction q&a -- rpw]                  Commonly Asked Questions  Radar Questions:  Q:  Where are radar detectors illegal?  A:  In the US, currently Virgina and the District of Columbia prohibit     all usage of radar detectors.  New York prohibits their use in     large trucks.  In Canada, they are illegal in Manitoba, Ontario,     Quebec, Newfoundland and PEI (Prince Edward Island).  They     are apparently are illegal through most, if not all, of Europe.     Legislation which would make them illegal is pending in many other     jurisdictions; chances of such legislation passing varies a great deal.  Q:  Where are Radar Detector Detectors used?  Do they really work?  A:  Usage is spreading rapidly; initially they were used only in Canada,     but now they are appearing in New York and Virginia.  It is unsafe     to assume that they are not in use in Connecticut and D.C.     They work by detecting a certain frequency radiated by many currently     available super Het radar detectors; some brands of detector radiate     more strongly than others, and are thus more likely to be spotted.     New radar detectors are becoming available which may not be detected     by the current generation of detector detectors.  Note that a     detector may only be spotted by one of these devices if it is turned     on.  Q:  What is VASCAR?  Is it some kind of Radar?  A:  VASCAR is nothing more than a fancy stopwatch and time-speed-distance     computer.  It depends on the operator pressing buttons as the target     vehicle passes landmarks.  No radar signals are emitted by a VASCAR     system.  Q:  What is Ka band radar?  Where is it used?  Should a radar detector be     able to handle it?   A:  Ka band has recently been made available by the FCC for use in the US     in so-called photo-radar installations.  In these installations, a     low-powered beam is aimed across the road at a 45 degree angle to the     direction of traffic, and a picture is taken of vehicles which the     radar unit determines to have been in violation of the speed limit.     Tickets are mailed to the owner of the vehicle.  Because of the low     power and the 45 degree angle, many people believe that a radar     detector cannot give reasonable warning of a Ka band radar unit,     although some manufacturers of radar detectors have added such     capability anyway.  The number of locales where photo-radar is in use     is limited, and some question the legality of such units.  Best advice:     learn what photo radar units look like, and keep track of where they     are used (or else, don't speed.)  Q:  Do radar jammers work?  Are they legal?  A:  Quick answer:  No, and Not in the USA.     Detailed answer:  Cheap radar jammers do not work well at all.     Jammers that work are expensive and usually the property of the     military.  Jammers are a major violation of the regulations of the     Federal Communications Commission of the USA.  Driving technique and Vehicle Dynamics Questions:  Q:  What are understeer and oversteer?  A:  Understeer and oversteer are terms describing the behaviour of a     car while cornering near the `limit' (limit of adhesion, that is.)     Most drivers do not normally drive hard enough for these terms to     be descriptive of the situations they encounter.  Simply put, they     tell whether the car wants to go straight in a corner (steer `less',     or `understeer') or it wants to turn more in a corner (`oversteer'.)     Understeer is commonly designed into most production cars so that     untrained drivers, inadvertantly traveling too fast, won't get into     trouble.  Understeer may also be induced by using too much throttle     in a corner.  Oversteer is designed into some more performance     oriented cars; it may be induced by lifting on the throttle (Trailing     throttle oversteer, or TTO).  In extreme cases, lifting on the throttle     may induce so much oversteer that the car reacts by fishtailing or     spinning.      Some technical details:  in a corner at speed, the tires on the car     will develop what are called `slip angles'; the slip angle is the     angular difference between the direction that the car is traveling     and the direction that the steering wheel is directing the car to     travel.  In understeer, the front wheels have a greater slip angle     than the rear wheels.  In oversteer, the rear wheels have a greater     slip angle than the front wheels.  Q: What is a rev-matched downshift?  A: When downshifting, the engine must be rotating faster in the lower gear    than it was in the higher gear.  However, during a downshift, normally    you declutch and lift your foot from the throttle, so the revs drop    rather than increase.  In rev-matched downshift, you blip the throttle    before re-engaging the clutch so that the engine will already be up to    the new speed.  This results in a much smoother and faster downshift.  Q: What does heel-and-toe mean?  A: Heel-and-toe is a technique used to do a rev-matched downshift while    braking.  This is normally challenging, because you need the right foot    for both the brake and throttle.  It is called heel-and-toe because you    use one end of the foot on the brake, and the other on the throttle to    match revs for the downshift.  In many modern cars this is a misnomer;    often you must use the ball of the foot on the brake and the right side    on the throttle.     Note that some race car drivers will skip the clutch, and just use the    left foot on the brake and the right foot on the throttle, accomplishing    the same thing.  Q: What is double-clutch downshifting?  A: While your right foot is doing the above, your left foot can do one of    three things:  nothing, declutch once, or declutch twice.  The reason for    declutching twice is to match the speeds of the two shafts in the    transmission to the speed of the engine.  This is usually coupled with    rev-matching, so that while the engine is in neutral and the clutch    engaged, the throttle is blipped and both shafts of the transmission    speed up.     The procedure is as follows:    (0) declutch    (1) move gearshift lever to neutral    (2) engage clutch    (3) match revs    (4) declutch    (5) move gearshift lever to next lower gear    (6) engage clutch     This sounds like a lot of work, but with practice it becomes natural.    The problem that double-clutching solves is normally the function of the    synchronizers within the gearbox.  In transmissions without synchros or    with very worn synchros, double-clutching makes it much easier to shift.    Basically, if you double-clutch well, you are not using the synchros at    all.  This is generally unnecessary on street cars with synchros in good    condition.  Q: What do the numbers for acceleration from 0-60, 1/4 mile, skidpad, and    slalom times in the Auto Magazines really mean?  May they be compared?  A: In short, 1) not as much as the magazines want you to believe, and    2) almost never.     In more detail:  the acceleration numbers (0-60mph and 1/4 mile times    in the US) may be vaguely compared as long as they all come from the    same source.  Testing procedures vary so much from magazine to magazine    that comparing a Road & Track number to a Car & Driver number is quite    pointless.  Keep in mind, too, that the same variation applies from    driver to driver on the street; the driver is a major (often *the*    major) part of the equation.     Skidpads vary, and even if they didn't, skidpad figures are really    only tests of the stickiness of the stock tires; they change radically    when tire compounds change.  DO NOT make any assumptions about the    comparative handling of, say, two sports sedans based on skidpad numbers.    This is not to suggest that skidpads are without value, however. Skidpads    are an excellent educational tool at driving schools.  They are simply    of limited value in the comparison of anything except tires.     Slalom times are slightly more useful; they test some small parts of the    automobile's transient response.  However, they are also heavily influenced    by the stock rubber on the car, and they do not test many corners of the    car's envelope.  They DO NOT tell you all you need to know before making    a buying decision.  For example, they don't tell you what the rear end    of the car will do on a road which suddenly goes off-camber.  When a car    has an adjustable suspension, these tests are usually done in the `sport'    setting, which may be quite unsuitable for daily driving.  The list of    caveats could go on for page after page.  Q: My buddy claims that wide tires don't make any difference, according    to his freshman physics textbook, and that you can't ever accelerate    or corner at more than 1.0G.  Does he know what he's talking about?  A: 1) in short:  he hasn't got a clue.     2) in more detail: the equations for friction used in freshman physics    textbooks presume that the surfaces are smooth,  dry and non-deformable,    none of which properly apply to tire traction except in the case of a    stone cold tire on dry pavement which is far below its proper operating    temperature.     Pavement is _never_ smooth; it is always irregular to a greater or lesser    extent.  Tires, which are not really dry and solid (as rubber is a    substance which in its natural form is liquid, and which has only been    coerced into a semblance of solidity by chemical magic), deform to match    the surface of the pavement which a vehicle is traveling over.  In a tire    at operating temperature, grip is actually generated by shear stresses    inside the deformed rubber, and not by anything even remotely resembling    friction in the freshman physics sense of the term.  The colder a tire    is relative to its operating temperature, the closer its behaviour will    be to the traditional concept of friction; if much hotter than the its    proper operating temperature, the more likely the possibility of some    part of the tire actually ``reverting'' to liquid, which is mostly like    to happen deep in the tread, causing characteristic blisters and chunking.    (This latter, though, is almost completely unlikely to happen in normal    street driving, so unless you're a competition driver or do a lot of    high speed track driving, don't worry about it.)     Because tire traction is completely out of the domain of simple friction,    it does not obey the freshman physics equation at all; thus dragsters    accelerate at more than 1.0G and race cars corner and brake at more than    1.0G.  Because simple friction does not apply, it is actually possible    for different sized contact patches to generate differing amounts of    grip.  An actual analysis of tire behavior would require techniques    such as Finite Element Analysis, due to the complexity of the mechanism.  Misc. Questions:  Q:  What does <name or acronym> stand for?  A:  Here is a list of some of the names which are commonly asked     about; be careful in soliciting the meanings of other names     as misinformation abounds on the net.  In particular, NEVER     ask in rec.humor if you want a useful result.      Saab:   Svenska Aeroplan A.

A:  No.  Porsche is a publicly held company, controlled by the Porsche and     Piech families.  Porsche has extensive business dealings with VW/Audi,     which causes some confusion.  Since currently Porsche is in some     financial difficulty, there is a possibility that Mercedes or VW may     be interested in purchasing the company in the near future, but this     is only speculation at this time.\",\"I've been a Giants season ticket holder for years and never really complained about the old ballyard place. Sure, it's been cold, the food lines were long, and the hired hands were surly, but this was all part of the Giants mystique. Or so I thought.  I went to Tuesday's game (3 - 1 Giants over the Marlins) and the 'Stick was  a much different place. Nothing short of a dome will eliminate the wind, but  everything is a lot better. The lines are a lot shorter, the bathrooms are CLEAN and have running water, and the hired hands were very polite.   The new foghorn (lights up and blows after each homerun) and the wooden fence are very nice, as are the new bleachers. The bleachers start right at the top of the fence and give a great view, and they've got beer stands at the bottome of the bleachers. The only complaint is that the electronic  old-fashioned scoreboard looks electronic - could be better.  These things should have been done a long time ago, but it took a real  businessman (ex - Safeway President Peter Magowan) to figure it out.

Simpler shading models are implemented already, f.i. in x3d (ask archie where to get the latest version). For Gouroud, a fast implementation will be possible utilizing some extension only, either MIT-SHM to do the shade in an image and fast update the window with it, or PEX/OpenGL which should be able to shade themselves. The portable 'vanilla X' way would be to shade in a normal XImage and use XPutImage(), what would be good enough to do static things as f.i. fractal landscapes or such stuff.  To speak about POVRay, the X previewer that comes with the original source package is not that good, especially in speed, protocol-friendlyness and ICCCM compliance.

If you have corrections or answers to other frequently asked questions that you would like included in this posting, send email to leech@cs.unc.edu (Jon Leech).      If you don't want to see the FAQ, add 'Frequently Asked Questions' to your KILL file for this group (if you're not reading this with a newsreader that can kill articles by subject, you're out of luck).      The FAQ volume is excessive right now and will hopefully be trimmed down by rewriting and condensing over time. The FAQ postings are available in the Ames SPACE archive in FAQ/faq<#>.      Good summaries will be accepted in place of the answers given here. The point of this is to circulate existing information, and avoid rehashing old answers. Better to build on top than start again. Nothing more depressing than rehashing old topics for the 100th time. References are provided because they give more complete information than any short generalization.      Questions fall into three basic types:      1) Where do I find some information about space?      Try your local public library first. The net is not a good place to ask     for general information. Ask INDIVIDUALS (by email) if you must. There     are other sources, use them, too. The net is a place for open ended     discussion.      2) I have an idea which would improve space flight?      Hope you aren't surprised, but 9,999 out of 10,000 have usually been     thought of before. Again, contact a direct individual source for     evaluation. NASA fields thousands of these each day.      3) Miscellanous queries.      These are addressed on a case-by-case basis in the following series of     FAQ postings.       SUGGESTIONS FOR BETTER NETIQUETTE      Read news.announce.newusers if you're on Usenet.     Minimize cross references, [Do you REALLY NEED to?]     Edit \\\"Subject:\\\" lines, especially if you're taking a tangent.     Send mail instead, avoid posting follow ups. (1 mail message worth  100 posts).     Internet mail readers: send requests to add/drop to SPACE-REQUEST  not SPACE.     Read all available articles before posting a follow-up. (Check all  references.)     Cut down attributed articles (leave only the points you're  responding to; remove signatures and headers). Summarize!     Put a return address in the body (signature) of your message (mail  or article), state your institution, etc. Don't assume the  'reply' function of mailers will work.     Use absolute dates. Post in a timely way. Don't post what everyone  will get on TV anyway.     Some editors and window systems do character count line wrapping:  keep lines under 80 characters for those using ASCII terminals  (use carriage returns).

The Woman is the Church.  Catholics have always called our Church \\\"Holy Mother Church\\\" and our \\\"Mother.\\\"  An example would be from St. Cyprian of Carthage, who wrote in 251 AD, \\\"Can anyone have God for his Father, who does not have the Church for his mother?\\\"  Hence the image of the Church as a woman, holding a Cross and a Cup, which tell of the Crucifxition of Our Lord, and of the power of His Blood (the grail legend, but also, more significantly, it shows that \\\"This is the Cup of the New Covenant in my blood, which shall be shed for you and for many.\\\" (Luke 22.20), the Cup represents the New Covenant and holds the blood of redemption).  The fact that the woman is holding both and is said to have the whole world for her seat, is that the Catholic Church is catholic, that is universal, and is found throughout the world, and the Church shows the Crucifixtion and applies the blood of redemption to all mankind by this spread of hers, thorugh which the Holy Sacrafice of the Mass, can be said and celebrated in all the nations as Malachi predicted in Malachi 1.11, \\\"From the rising of the sun to its setting, my name is great among the gentiles, and everywhere there is sacrafice, and there is offered to my Name a clean oblation, for my Name is great among the gentiles, says the Lord of hosts.\\\"  And so we acknowledge what St. Paul wrote \\\"For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you show the Lord's death until he comes.\\\" (1 Corinthians 11.26)   You are quite right about the identification of \\\"Babylon the Great, Mother of all Harlots\\\" with Rome.

Personally, I feel that the universal health insurance approach used in Canada, France and Germany -- paying to private health providers in a nominally free market not unlike America's, minus HMO's -- depends a lot on values in those societies different from the U.S.  The basic health needs for life are not viewed as market, but the insurance does allow the market to address that -- basic health care is not viewed on the level of ownership of a VCR as Americans would see it.

Their distribution is very isotropic and the intensity distribution, crudely speaking, indicates we're seeing an edge to the distribution.     Given the enormous  power,  i was just wondering,  what if they are    quantum  black holes or something  like that  fairly close by?     Why would they have to be at  galactic ranges?     Now, in the good old days before GRO data, it was thought the gamma bursters were neutron stars in the galaxy, it was expected that GRO would confirm this by either showing they were a local population (within a few hundred light years) or that they were in the galactic halo. (Mechanism was not known but several plausible ones existed) (also to be fair it was noted that the _brightest_ burster was probably in the LMC, suggesting theorists might be wrong back then...)  As the Sun is not at the center of the galaxy a halo population should show anisotropy (a local disk population is ruled out completely at this stage) - to avoid the anisotropy you have to push the halo out, the energy then gets large, the mechanism of getting NS out that far becomes questionable, and we should start to see for example the Andromeda's bursters.  The data is consistent with either a Oort cloud distribution (but only just) - but no one can think of a plausible source with the right spectrum. Or, it can be a cosmological distances (hence isotropy) and the edge is \\\"the edge of the Universe\\\" ;-) If at cosmological distances you need very high energy (to detect) and a very compact source (for spectrum), ergo a neutron star colliding with another neutron star or black hole. Even then getting the spectrum is very hard, but conceivable.   If we know anything about physics at that level, the bursters are not due to quantum black holes or cosmic strings, wrong spectrum for one thing.  The situation is further complicated by recent claims that there are two classes of sources ;-)  [in the colliding NS they'd actually probably fit relatively easily into the NS-NS and NS-BH collision scenarios respectively]     my own pet theory is that it's  Flying saucers  entering    hyperspace :-)     but the reason i am asking is that most everyone assumes  that they    are  colliding nuetron stars  or  spinning black holes,  i just wondered    if any mechanism could exist  and place them  closer in.

Thiokol provided me with samples and data on a reinforcement to solid motor grains for high accelerations.  Solid motor propellants usually have a substantial percentage of  aluminum in the mix.  For example, the Space Shuttle SRBs are 16 percent Aluminum.  The technique is to use a 'foamed aluminum' structure. The structure looks like the inverse of a set of bubbles (an I suspect some bubbling process is used to form it).  In other words, if you made a bunch of bubbles in molten aluminum, then froze it, this is what you get.  It forms a strong network of effectively aluminum wires in all directions.  The remaining solid fuel mix is infiltrated into the voids, and you get aluminum-reinforced solid propellant.  The foamed-aluminum makes up about 6 percent of the total propellant, so there is still aluminum particles in the bulk grain.  The major improvement is the higher resistance to grain cracking, which is the principal failure mode for solid propellant.

D:d :wq \",\"  Oh, yeah.  Dave Winfield--marginal player.  Guy didn't hit a lick, had negligible power, was a crap fielder and had no staying power.  Dave Winfield, now entering his (I believe) 20th big league season, is still a damn decent hitter.  Admittedly, his defense has slipped a great deal, but in his prime, he had a powerful arm and great range.  Take a look at the stats:  I don't  know where you even BEGIN to make an argument that Winfield and Kingman are similar players.  Kingman was a one-dimension power hitter--he couldn't field, he ran like an anvil, hit for a low average (though, if I remember right, his OBP wasn't THAT hideous...), and (for those who consider such things important) was a absolute-primo-dick.    Eddie Murray?  Yup, only the best 1st baseman of the 80's.  I know that MVP votes are conducted by mediots, but given that he got jobbed out of the MVP he deserved in 1983, it seems that he wasn't overrated by the media.    Lee Smith?  Hmmmm... This one's actually pretty close.  He's had a s solid, dependable career as a closer despite pitching in some nasty parks  (Wrigley, Fenway...).  I'd have to take a closer look at the stats (it's been  a while), but it seems Lee Arthur is of HOF caliber.    You do make a legitimate point about the HOF credentials of relievers, simply racking up a lot of saves doesn't mean a whole hell of a lot if you  blow a bunch, too.  Simply because Minnesota and Boston and (for a month) Atlanta used Reardon as a closer for longer than he should have been one,  the Equalizer has racked up an impressive number of saves.  No way should  HomerMan be in the HOF, IMHO.  Darrell Evans?  Nice career, actually a bit underrated (kinda like Ted Simmons, IMHO), but not a HOF'er.    Lemme ask you this.  Who the hell playing the game ISN'T marginal?    Now, wait a goddamn minute here.  Ozzie Smith absolutely REDEFINED the position of shortstop.  His defense was SO good that he's won something along the lines of 10 Gold Gloves.  Again, Gold Gloves are mediot-biased, and a  good argument could be made that Larkin deserved one or two of Ozzie's more recent awards, but usually, this is tempered by someone else in the early 80's getting the Gold Gloves Ozzie deserved earlier in his career.  Ozzie's offense, you ask?  Good OBP, great speed numbers, in a park which, for most of his career, depressed offense, admittedly, no power ('cept against Tom Niedenfuer :-|), but still, a definite asset offensively.  Yount?  3,000 hits, MVP at two different positions, uh-huh, a real stiff.  His '82 was one of the great years EVER by a player in recent memory, and probably ranks behind only the peak seasons of Wagner and Banks, as far as SS numbers go.  He's a clear HOF'er, IMHO.    Well, as far as Garvey goes, you're right.  Garvey is a \\\"mediot\\\"  candidate, pushed because of his \\\"winning attitude\\\" (a minor factor, if one at all), and his \\\"great defense\\\" (no errors, admittedly, but the range of a tree stump...).  Garvey shouldn't be in the HOF.  SkyJack?  I've said a lot of nasty things about SkyJack in the last year or so, but this is mostly in response to mediots and woofers who talk about Morris' \\\"ability to win\\\" which is nothing more than Morris' \\\"ability to pitch when Toronto to score tons of runs\\\".  At this point, Morris is an average pitcher (although from his early returns in '93, he may be damned  close to done.).  But, in all fairness, Morris was a dominant pitcher in the 80's for up-and-down Tiger teams.  While 1984 was (obviously) a great year for Detroit, the rest of the decade, the team was generally in contention, but not favorites.  Morris' career numbers are quite good, and worthy of HOF \\\"consideration\\\".    Ryan?  Of course, but be careful.  I guarantee you that someone will throw back your earlier logic about \\\"Yount and Smith being shortstops who  hung around a long time\\\".  After all, Nolan never won a Cy...  Damn, he's  just pitcher who hung around for 99 years...  His W-L record is mediocre... (Of course, Nolan's a HOF'er...)  Puck?  Probably, although he's got to play reasonably well for a few more years (10 years, even good ones, aren't enough to make the HOF, most likely).  That said, I believe Puckett WILL make the HOF, pretty much regardless of how the rest of his career turns out (barring something REALLY  tragic or sudden).  He's very popular in the media and with fans, and legitimately has been one of the best CF's in the game since he joined the league.  I've always liked the guy, and I hope he does make it.  And, in the end, I think the Puck will make it in.  But, really, it's too early to sell.   This debate comes up rather frequently on the net, and, believe it  or not, I never tire of it.  It's an interesting subject.  Here's an off the top of my head list of potential HOF'ers from each team.  I probably left a couple of guys off, so feel free to follow up.

In my computerized baseball game, I keep track of a category called \\\"stolen hits\\\", defined as a play made that \\\"an average fielder would not make with average effort.\\\"  Using the 1992 Defensive Averages posted by Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), I've figured out some defensive stats for the second basemen. Hits Stolen have been redefined as \\\"Plays Kurt Stillwell would not have made.\\\"  OK, I realize that's unfair.  Kurt's probably the victim of pitching staff, fluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let's put it this way:  If we replaced every second baseman in the NL with someone with Kurt's 57.6% out making ability, how many extra hits would go by?  To try and correlate it to reality a little more, I've calculated Net Hits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league average fielder would make.  By the same method I've calculated Net Double Plays, and Net Extra Bases (doubles and triples let by).  Finally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or DCON :->.  Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player. I add this number to OPS to get DOPS (Defense + Onbase Plus Slug), which should represent the player's total contribution to the team.  So don't take it too seriously.  The formula for DCON appears at the end of this article.

Basically, it's designed to be added into the OPS, with the idea that \\\"a run prevented is as important as a run scored\\\". The extra outs are factored into OBP, while the extra bases removed are  factored into SLG.  That's why I used PA and AB as the divisors.

I'll accept it (reluctantly) from mobs in Pakistan, but not from you.  What is presented in the fictional dream of a demented character cannot by the wildest stretch of the imagination be considered a reflection on the actual Mohammad.  What's worse, the novel doesn't present the Mahound/Mohammed character in any worse light than secular histories of Islam; in particular, there is no \\\"lewd\\\" misrepresentation of his life or that of his wives.   Don't hold back; he's considered an apostate and a blasphemer. However, it's not for his writing in _The Satanic Verses_, but for what people have accepted as a propagandistic version of what is contained in that book.  I have yet to find *one single muslim* who has convinced me that they have read the book.  Some have initially claimed to have done so, but none has shown more knowledge of the book than a superficial Newsweek story might impart, and all have made factual misstatements about events in the book.   I'll keep an eye out for it.  I have a counter-proposal: I suggest that you see the Viking hardcover by Salman Rushdie called _The Satanic Verses_.

EDT              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As you know, the President is soon  to be on his way, on Amtrack to Camden Yards.  He'll be throwing out  the first pitch.              Q   It's MARC, the Maryland Area Transit, it's not  Amtrack.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, it's not Amtrack?  Well, he's  going from Union Station, you're right.  Excuse me.              Q   George, what exactly are you prepared to do to  break the logjam with  ??? Senate?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, there are  discussions between Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole this morning,  and I think that the President is going to continue to make the point  that he believes that our investment package, our jobs package needs  to be passed as quickly as possible.  We need this investment for  summer jobs, for immunization, for highway construction, for the  important programs that will put people back to work right away this  summer.  And the President continues to believe his program should be  passed.              Q   Will he compromise, that's the question?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, the discussions  are going on this morning in the Senate betwen Senator Mitchell and  Senator Dole, let's see what they come up with.  But the President  believes his jobs program should go forward.              Q   George, would the President be willing to accept $8  billion for one year, which apparently appears to be the compromise  being offered by --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I don't know what is being  offered by either side.  The Senate discussions are going on right  now, let's see what happens today.              Q   Would he go that far -- no matter what the  Republicans have offered so far, would he go that far, $8 billion per  year?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that his  program should be passed at this time.  Clearly, we're going to be  willing to listen to what the Senators might or might not be able to  come up with, but I'm not going to get into figures right now.  Let's  see what happens.              Q   It's reasonable to assume, isn't it, from what has  happened so far that a compromise is going to be necessary in order  to get a vote?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the Republicans seem more  intrested in stopping progress on the President's jobs bill, than in  doing something to create --  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the  Republicans seem more interested in stopping progress on the  President's jobs bill than in doing something to create real action,  real jobs this summer for the American people.  I think there's no  question about that.  There's been some frustration of legislative  activity over the last few days.              Q   So, you'll need to compromise to get your package  through?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We'll see what happens with the  conversations between Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole this morning.              Q      prepared to compromise --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President's prepared to listen  to what Senator Mitchell has to say this morning after his meeting  with Senator Dole.               Q   Does he feel that he has been defeated in his --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not in the least.  In fact, he's  been very successful so far in the beginning of his term.              Q   How?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He passed his budget in record  time, in six weeks, and it's a budget which reduces the deficit by  $500 billion over five years.  And it's a budget which provides for  important investments in our future.  Right now we've also had strong  passage of his jobs program through the House.  Simply because a  minority of Republicans in the Senate choose to perpetuate gridlock  and hold up action on the President's jobs program is not a sign that  he is not succeeding overall.              Q   He can't beat this, can he?              Q   The fact is they can do that?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the Republicans can stop  action.  There's no question about that.              Q   What are you going to do about it?              Q   George, what do you know about these alleged notes  taken by Boris Yeltsin during one of the meetings in which it appears  that the President told Boris Yeltsin not to trust the Japanese; that  when they say yes they mean no?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's a complete  misreading of what happened at the meeting.  The context of the  conversation was that President Clinton was actually reassuring  President Yeltsin at the time about his conversations with Prime  Minister Miyazawa over the Kuril Islands and the Prime Minister's  belief that Japan would play a constructive role in the G-7 process.   I mean this was a casual comment about Japanese courtesy and  etiquette but overall it was in the context of a conversation where  he was reassuring President Yeltsin that he believed the Japanese  were serious about their commitment to the G-7 process.              Q    Are you saying that the President said that when  the Japanese say yes they mean no?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's not -- I don't know the  exact words and there was a much longer discussion about he did say  something along the lines that he believes that on this issue Prime  Minister Miyazawa intends to really go forward with the G-7 process.              Q   Have there been any attempts to explain this to the  Japanese because apparently the Japanese press has picked this up and  there appears to be --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I've seen the reports in the  Japanese press and it actually does put the situation in context.  It  does talk about the Japanese -- understanding the Japanese points of  view.  I don't think it's going to be a problem.  I believe that  there may have been some diplomatic context just to clear things up  but I'm not positive.              Q   George, was the specific comment that was made  specific to the Kuril Island situation or was it a general  observation on Japanese etiquette?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The discussion was about --              Q   The specific comment is what I'm asking about that  has alleged to have been translated from the Russian notes, \\\"when the  Japanese say yes they mean no.\\\"              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, it was a combination.  I mean  I don't think that's the whole sentence.  I think that the specific  comment was a broad, general observation followed up by a specific  finish to the sentence where he said in this case he believes that  Prime Minister Miyazawa means to keep the commitment.              Q   Was he saying it facetiously first?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it was just a casual  observation.              Q   And then you say diplomatic contacts were made to  clear it up.  Has the President sent a message?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, I don't think the President  spoke; I believe that Secretary Christopher has made some calls but  I'm not sure exactly how many.              Q   Well, this obviously is a bigger deal than you're  making it out to be if Christopher has had to make some calls.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, no.  It was just that we got  the reports in Vancouver and the Secretary wanted to make sure that  it was understood and make sure there was absolutely no        MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- reports in Vancouver, and the  Secretary wanted to make sure that it was understood, and make sure  there is absolutely no misunderstanding, and I don't believe there is  on.              Q   What is our position about the Japanese?  That they  may have to say one thing, but actualy mean another?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  The position on the Japanese  is as the President stated to President Yeltsin throughout the two  days.  He said that he had had a good conversation with Prime  Minister Miazawa prior to the Summit.  He reiterated the U.S.  position, the long-standing support for the Japanese position on the  Kuril Islands, but also reiterated Prime Minister Miazawa's  commitment to move forward on the G-7 process and to play a  constructive role.  And I think President Yeltsin was very glad to  hear that.              Q   After listening to Secretary Christopher on Iraq  for the last few days, I'm a little confused.  What is the U.S.  policy?  Do you want to see Saddam Hussein overturned?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's the same policy that Secretary  Christopher has reiterated, and all of the U.S officials have  reiterated.  We expect full and complete and unequivocal compliance  with all U.N. resolutions.  Right now we do not have that compliance.              Q      throwing it out further that if Iraq complies,  Saddam can't stay in office?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.  I think that that's -- our  judgment is that it is not possible for Saddam Hussein to comply with  the resolutions and stay in power.  But the important point is that  we expect compliance by Iraq with all U.N. resolutions, and we will  continue to demand it.              Q   And are you concerned the Iran will become the  dominant power in the area --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Secretary Christopher has also  spoken to Iran over the last several days, and he says we also expect  full Iranian compliance with all international norms, and stopping  support of terrorism.              Q   That's a very glib statement that he won't stay in  power if he complies with U.N. resolutions.  On what logic do you  base that?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right now Saddam Hussein is not  complying with the U.N. resolutions at all.  He is not respecting the  rights of his people, as is required by the U.N. resolution.  He is  not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding inspections.   He is not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding  armaments.              Q   Well, when do you think that if he did comply he  would be out of power?        MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, right now his power rests on  the repression of his people.  If he stopped doing that it would make  it more difficult for him to stay in power.              Q   George, back on the stimulus package, why is it  that you and the President accuse the Republicans of playing pure  politics and perpetuating gridlock?  Why is it that -- what evidence  do you have that they just don't have a genuine idealogical  difference with you that's in good faith?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the fact that several times  in the past the Republicans, many of the ones who are now leading the  fight for the filibuster, have supported the very funding they now  seek to stop, most especially, the highway funding.                Q   George, in regards to that, some of the moderate  Republicans said that the White House erred by not being more open to  them during the -- while the plan was put together, that they had  one, sort of, proforma meeting between the White House and the Senate  Republicans, and that was it.  Does the Administration look back and  thinks perhaps it could have done a better job of working with some - -              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I'm not sure that it's true  that there was only one meeting.  I mean, the President met with the  Republican leadership on at least two occasions before the  introduction of his package.  He met with the entire Senate  Republican Caucus also for lunch, and went up there.  We are  continually in contact with as many Republicans as we can find who  have an interest in the President's package.  We are interested in  what they have to say, as well.  But we believe that this program is  important, and we're going to continue to fight for it.              Q      your all or nothing, do it with the Democrats  alone strategy, did you maybe miscalculate the ability to get it  through?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean, I think that there is  no question that under the Senate rules a determined minority can  frustrate activity.  I mean, there is just no question about that.   You only need 40 plus one to keep going.  40 plus one to keep going  and to stop any action, and that's what the Republicans are doing.              Q      going to rethink the way you attempt to get  other things passed as you go through this process for the rest of  the summer?              Q      work with Republicans and try to woo some  Republicans into your camp?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we're going to continue to  look for the support of Republicans whenever we can get it on the  President's intiatives?              Q   But on this one -- how are you going to do it  differently than you did it on this one because on this one you  really did stiff the Republicans from the beginning and made it clear  that it was a Democratic majority that would get this through and  could get it through and you really didn't need Republican votes?   Are you going to take a different tack when you have to go for  particular votes?  When you have to go through --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't see into the future and  understand every possible turn in the legislative road.  Clearly the  President's going to continue to reach out when he can.              Q   You don't have any regrets then about the way you  have handled it up to now and you don't plan any changes in your  approach in dealing with the Republicans in Congress based on this  experience?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Obviously the President would like  his package passed as quickly as possible and he's going to continue  to press for that.  We will continue to reach out to Republicans,  there's not question about that.  And we'll continue to reason with  them and try and find appropriate avenues for cooperation.  In this  case the Republicans have chosen to unify around a filibuster, around  a plan to frustrate action not a plan to move forward.              Q   They're being denied any other legislative means of  putting their proposals forward.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think they're being --              Q      any ideas.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think their amendments are being  defeated; I don't know that they're being denied.              Q      to present them.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's not exactly true.  I mean  they get the votes --              Q      that theirs can be passed though by the  parliamentary rules under which they're playing.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Unless they get a majority in  support all the way around, no, that's not exactly true.              Q   George, one more on Iraq.  Is the administration  backing any of the Iraqi opposition?  Grooming any new leadership?              Q      backing any of the Iraqi -- leadership?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, I -- again, we're pressing for  Iraqi compliance.  I don't know if we can get into the business of  grooming leadership.  I believe there have been some contacts, at  some levels, with Iraqi opposition groups.  I don't know  about  anything recently.              Q      Jesse Jackson, who, of course, is not the  President's best friend, has, however, been told that there is to be  some kind of town meeting, or some kind of involvement by the  President, pre-empted the ball game -- Los Angeles.  Will he consider  something like that, or any other kind of intervention there?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, the President  appointed Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, about 10 days ago, to be a  special envoy to California, and coordiante cabinet activities around  the California economic situation, including the situation in Los  Angeles.                I believe there will also be visits out to Los Angeles  by the Education -- or have been visits by the Education Secretary,  Mr. Riley.  I believe that Transportation Secretary Pena and HUD  Secretary Cisneros are also going out.  And there may be other visits  by Cabinet officials over the next several days and weeks.  I  wouldn't rule out the possibility of a visit by President Clinton to  California.  Obviously, he is following the situation closely, and is  concerned about making sure that we make the right long term policy  decisions that will help create the kind of economic opportunities  which help prevent disturbances.  But we're going to continue to  watch it.              Q   George, as a follow-up, Reverend Jackson is also  supposed to be outside the ball park today, in Baltimore, with a  group of supporters protesting the lack of minorities in baseball  management.  Does the President have a position on that?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has received  correspondence from Reverend Jackson.  I know that Reverend Jackson  has also spoken with the White House Chief of Staff, Mack McLarty.   He clearly raises serious questions.  There has been some progress in  baseball over the last several years, but still not enough.  But the  President intends to continue to go to the ball game.              Q   Is he going to say anything about it today, or see  Reverend Jackson while he's out there?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if he is going to see  them, but as I said, the President believes that Reverend Jackson has  raised some serious questions, and it's something that, as I said,  even though there has been progress, it's clearly not enough.              Q   Did Reverend Jackson ask him not to go to the ball  game?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure about that.  I believe  the characterization the Reverend Jackson is talking about is an  informational pickett.  I don't know that he asked him not to go to  the ball game, but he sent a long, detailed, formal letter outlining  his concerns with the situation in major league baseball and the  President read it.              Q   George, the Orioles are playing the Rangers, the  managing partner of the Rangers is George W. Bush.  Is he going to be  there, and is he going to meet with the President?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.              Q   What is the Mubarak schedule?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I know that President Mubarak is  coming tomorrow morning for a working meeting, they will have a  lunch, and I believe that he is having dinner tonight with Vice  President Gore.              Q   And joint statements tomorrow --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe so, yes.  At the end,  yes.              Q   Is there evidence, George, that the Egyptians did  warn the U.S. about a potential terrorist bombing -- terrorist  activities?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As reported in The New York Times,  I mean, I think that President Mubarak did say that there has been  general conversations with the Egyptians, as there have been for a  long period of time.  We do have general intelligence sharing, I  mean.  But President Mubarak was very careful to point out that there  was no specific information on this visit that was passed forward.   The President will continue to investigate the situation, but he also  reiterates his belief that we cannot tolerate terrorism of any kind.              Q   George, he did make specific -- or the Egyptians,  apparently, did issue specific warnings about this individual who,  forgive me --this individual who, forgive me the name escapes me at  the moment, and said the Egyptians were more or less rebuffed in  their attempts to get some kind of action.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know if I would  agree with your characterization of the Mubarak interview.  He did  say that they gave general warnings about the possibility of a  network in the United States and upon which we took appropriate  action.  But there was no specific information on this specific  operation at all.              Q   So, the White House doesn't feel that any of the  law enforcement agencies whether it be the CIA or FBI who would have  received this kind of information was lax or derelict in its duty in  not pursuing some kind of --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, not at all.              Q   What's next with Serbia?  It got only a passing  mention in the news conference yesterday --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  You didn't get to ask your  question.              Q   Yes, exactly.  Was there any agreement on concerted  action between the two countries?  And even if there wasn't, what  does the U.S. do next?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the U.S. is clearly going  to move forward in the U.N. today continuing discussions with our  allies on a sanctions resolution and we'll continue to look for ways  to press the Serbians to come to the negotiating table and sign an  agreement.              Q   George, why do you think sanctions is still an  option?  I mean the Serbians make it clear that at least the  leadership is surviving just fine and they feel like they can wait  you out and even the administration officials we had in the other day  said there's no evidence that they're going to have an effect any  time soon.  The Bosnian Serbs have said no to the peace plan.  When  does no mean no and you have to do something different?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean we are doing something  different.  We're moving forward on further sanctions through the  U.N. and those discussions will continue.  We're going to continue to  try and tighten the noose on Serbia, and I think that every  opportunity we have to do that will have an effect over time.              Q   Are we looking again at lifting the arms embargo?  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has said that this is something  that is under consideration.              Q   George, do you have any more on Hugh Rodham's  condition, how he's doing?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As far as I know nothing's changed.              Q   George, -- week after Mr. Mubarak?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's a little unclear.  I think  we'll be able to get you more either tonight or tomorrow morning  after the Mubarak visit.              Q   Is he going somewhere for Easter?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not that I know of.              Q   What more can you tell us about the additional aid  to Russia that the President plans to ask Congress about?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's going to be consulting with  the Congress and with our G-7 partners over the next couple of weeks.   I know that he spoke last evening with Congressman Gephardt and their  delegation before the -- the congressional delegation meets with the  Russians this week and those consultations will continue over the  next several weeks.              Q   Do you expect that package to be of the magnitude  of the one announced Sunday?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not going to discuss the  magnitude.              Q   How about the list of Cold War restrictions, where  do you stand on that --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As the President said yesterday,  he's going to be looking for that list from the Congress this week  and reviewing it.  He believes -- he's going to try and get it this  week and he's going to review the list, and we're going to take a  hard look at it.              Q   But they're making it up?  I mean it's no White  House involvement, Congress is compiling this list?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he's going to talk to the  congressional leaders about compiling the list but I'm certain we'll  be able to get our own researchers working as well.              Q   George, isn't lifting the arms embargo more of a  probability than a possibility?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's something that's under  discussion.              Q   Secretary Christopher has said that it's a matter  of time and -- for months before that happens.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, all I can say is that it's  something that the President is reviewing.  Right now we're working  with our allies in the U.N on a sanctions resolution, and we'll  continue to review other matters.              Q   George, can you tell us anything about the schedule  this week?  Any travel?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They just asked about that.  I  don't have anything more beyond tomorrow's visit with Mubarak right  now.              Q   Are there consultations, George, with any Jewish  American organizations concerning Jackson-Vanick?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As you know the National Conference  of Soviet Jewry has a list of, I believe,        MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- as you know, the National  Conference of Soviet Jewry has a list of, I believe, 200 Refuseniks.   We'll certainly take a look at that and continue appropriate  discussions.              Thanks. \",\"I have two questions:  1) I have been having troubles with my Wordperfect for Windows.

The first period started with a give away from a Canadian defenseman and  Rundqvist came in alone on Ranford but couldn't put the puck over a sliding  Ranford. Later on, Kevin Dineen had a great opportunity but Soderstrom   played very well too. Stefan Nilsson had a couple of great dekes and set up  Jan Larsson but again Ranford came up big. Period ended scoreless but the edge  to Sweden in creating more opportunities.  Second period action saw Tommy Soderstrom making a GREAT save. Mark Recchi  made a backhanded cross ice pass to Lindros, Eric one timed the puck but  Soderstrom was there to make a glove hand save. At the 7-minute mark, Canada  started applying pressure on the Swedes. Sanderson-Dineen-Brind'Amour worked  hard and kept the puck in the Swedes' zone. Dineen gave the puck to Sanderson  who skated around a screened Swedish defenseman, came in on Soderstrom and  made a wrist shot that went it by Soderstrom's far post, 1-0 Canada.  The Swedes picked up their game after that, and Peter Forsberg had a shot  that hit Ranford's post (the inside), went parallel to the goal line and out.  Then Gartner got a penalty and the Swedes a power play. Jan Larsson took  a shot from the slot, Ranford gave a rebound to Larsson who saw Juhlin by  the far post, passed the puck and Ranford was beat, 1-1.  Third period started as the other periods, Swedes having most of the pressure  but the Canadians always dangerous once they were close to the Swede goal.  At 5:54, Canada created some great chances and Arto Blomsten was forced to  cover the puck in the Swede goal crease since Soderstrom lost sight of it.  That resulted in a penalty shot, since a defenseman can't cover the puck in   the goal crease. Geoff Sanderson took the penalty shot (his first ever, he  explained afterwards), and he put it low on Soderstrom's stick side, close  to the post. Excellent penalty shot to give Canada a go ahead goal.  Canada increased the lead on a very suspect offside, Gartner volleyed a  bouncing puck past Soderstrom to make it 3-1. The Swedes ran out of gas  then and couldn't produce as good scoring chances as they had for 2,5 periods.  The 4-1 goal came with only 1 second left, Rod Brind'Amour scoring on a  rebound from Soderstrom, where the Swedish defense already had their minds  in the dressing room.   A very good game (the best in the WC so far?), with both goalies playing  great. Soderstrom best player in Sweden, but Ranford even played better  than Soderstrom, that tells you something about Ranford. Probably the best  goalie in the world, were some comments after the game.  Canada played a very disciplined defense, Ranford pointed out that it is  easy to play well with a good defense. Lindros played A LOT and played well,  Sanderson naturally game hero with two goals.   The Forsberg-Naslund-Bergqvist line Sweden's best along with Larsson-Juhlin-  Nilsson. Swedish defense played well, 197 cm 104 kg Peter Popovic had the  task of neutralizing 192 cm 107 kg Eric Lindros, and managed this very well.  Ranger defenseman Peter Andersson finally got to go to the WC, and considering  that he landed in Germany just a few hours before the game, he played very  well. Swedish coach Curt Lundmark was irritated after the game, partly because  of the Swedes inability to score, and partly because of the linesman's mistake  on the 1-3 goal.

But we know enough about the physics of the situation to do some calculations. There are in fact three effects contributing to leaning the bike over to begin a turn.   1. Gyro effect causing a torque which twists the bike over.   2. Contact patch having shifted to one side, causing bike to fall over.   3. Contact patch being accelerated to the side, causing a  torque which twists the bike over.  Take an average bike/rider, average bike wheel, and at speeds of 5, 15, and 50 mph (say) calculate how much twist of the bars would be needed to produce (say) 20 degrees of lean in (say) 2 seconds by each effect alone. My guess is that at slow speeds 2 is dominant, and at high speeds 3 is dominant, and at all speeds 1 contributes not far off bugger all, relatively speaking.

Just after I completed my 4th set of deep squats.  Today was my weight training day and I was just beginning my routine.  All of a sudden at the end of the 4th set my arm felt like it had gone to sleep.  It was cold, turned pale, and lost 60% of its strength.  The weight I used for squats wasn't that heavy, I was working hard but not at 100% effort.  I waited for a few  minutes, trying to shake the arm back to life and then continued with chest exercises (flyes) with lighter dumbells than I normally use.  But I dropped the left dumbell during the first set, and experienced continued arm weakness into the second.  So I quit training and decided not to do my usual hour on the ski machine either.  I'll take it easy for the rest of the day.  My arm is *still* somewhat numb and significantly weaker than normal -- my hand still tingles a bit down to the thumb. Color has returned to normal and it is no longer cold.   Horrid thoughts of chunks of plaque blocking a major artery course through my brain.

The Branch Davidian group (led by Koresh) is actually one of two off-shoots  of a group known as the Shephard's Rod.  The Shephard's Rod (now  defunct as far as I know)broke off from the SDA Church in the 30's.  The Shephard's Rod broke away from the SDA Church because they felt that the  SDA Church was becoming weak and falling into apostacy.  They felt that they  were the remnant spoken about in Revelation.  About the Koresh group, Koresh gained control of it in 1987 or 1988.  Once  in control, he made himself the center of it. He proclaimed himself as  Christ.  Koresh himself came from an SDA background. He was excommunicated as a young  adult by the local congregation for trying to exert too much control over  the youth in the church.  After this, he joined the Branch Davidians.  They were/are a survivalist cult. This is why they had the stockpile of  weapons, food, a bomb shelter, etc.  They had no intent of raiding the US  government or anything. They were preparing for Armaggedon and were  putting themselves in a self defense position.    In my opinion, if the ATF and the FBI had left well enough alone, we wouldn' t have the blood of 20+ children crying out from the ashes in Waco.  If you want to know about The Shephard's Rod, you might want to visit the  local SDA church and talk to some of the older people.  They could give you  some insight into where Koresh got his theology.\",\"Living things maintain small electric fields to (1) enhance certain chemical reactions, (2) promote communication of states with in a cell, (3) communicate between cells (of which the nervous system is a specialized example), and perhaps other uses.

Special photographic techniques such as applying external fields in Kirillian photography interact with these fields or the resistances caused by these fields to make interesting pictures. Perhaps such pictures will be diagonistic of disease problems in organisms when better understood. Perhaps not.

He was on USA when I first got hooked on Hockey back in 1980 or so.  No, he wasn't always spot on top of the play, and he wasn't overly cute, but those pipes!  That lusty, barrel chested, voice! No pipsqueak was he (unlike some fellas we know!)  I rode into hockey mania on the coattails of Gretzky and the Boys on the Bus.  My first Finals saw the Islanders sweep them.  But I'll never forget the night, a year later, when the Oilers closed it out at home in the pandemonium, the smoke from a million sparklers, the long empty-net goal near the end, and Dan Kelly letting the crowd's reaction tell the story for a few long seconds, then that voice barking through the din \\\"Dave Lumley ... sews it up for Edmonton!\\\"  It sounds stupid, but that early (for me) hockey memory will always bring a thrill.  Since then I've grown a lot more jaded about the game, but I was really saddened by Dan Kelly's passing.  He was one of the good guys.\",\"I'm a biker and a dog-lover.  First and foremost, I want to mention some common sense.  If it's a choice between injuring/killing a dog or getting yourself injured/killed, there is only one rational decision.  Only the most insane animal rights kook would put the dog first.  Second, it's useful to learn how to read a dog's body language.  How you react to a dog who is chasing you because he thinks it's a game (and that you're playing with him) is completely different from how you react to a dog which has hostile intent.  Third, it's useful to learn how to present yourself to a dog.  Dogs are social beasts, and recognize a domination/submission hierarchy.  To a dog, there are two types of fellow-creatures; that which he dominates, and that which dominate him.  You need to unambiguously represent yourself as being of the latter class.  You are God: you are easily angered and your anger is terrible. But God is also amused by one who properly submits to His dominance, and may even on rare occasions dispense a kind word, a kind word, or even (oh joy oh rapture unforeseen) A Dog Bisquit!  Now, how does that all relate to biking?  Well, first, it's a good idea to assume that most dogs who chase motorcycles do so because they think it's a game, and not out of overt hostility.  The MSF suggestion is a very good one; when you see the dog coming, slow down so he determines a particular place of interception.  Just before you (and he) reach that spot, punch the throttle so that when he reaches it you're already long gone.  Dogs take a few seconds to react to new input, and definitely cannot comprehend the acceleration that a motorcycle is capable of.  With a hostile dog, or one which you repeatedly encounter, stronger measures may be necessary.  This is the face off.  First -- and there is very important -- make sure you NEVER face off a dog on his territory.  Face him off on the road, not on his driveway.  If necessary, have a large stick, rolled up newspaper, etc. (something the beast will understand is something that will hurt him).  Stand your ground, then slowly advance.  Your mental attitude is that you are VERY ANGRY and are going to dispense TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT.  The larger the dog, the greater your anger.  Dogs will pick up anger, just as they can pick up fear.  And, since you and he are not on his home territory, it may suddenly dawn on the dog that perhaps he is on your territory, and that you are prepared to fight to the death.  Most dogs will decide that it is a good idea to retreat to their own territory where there is at least a home advantage.  They'll also observe that you are satisfied by that retreat (gesture of submission) and thus they have escaped punishment.\",\" A professor of mine once said \\\"The difference between a Computer Engineer and a Computer Scientist is about $5000\\\" meaning the Engineer makes $5000 more than the CS.

The released information says that any protocol may be used (e.g., DH). From a theoretical point of view, this is probably true. However, from a practical point of view, those chips must have some kind of key exchange protocol built-in. What if it is good old RSA?

Another consideration is any street celebrations over the two convictions on the excessive force charges (Koons for incompetance, and Powell for overreacting --- both guilty as heck even from the view of NYPD cops interviewed) that might get out of hand. )-;  Also, some elements may take the acquittals as an excuse to challenge the cops (a dumb move, obviously).

I have a fourteen year old daugter who experienced a seizure on November 3, 1992 at 6:45AM after eating Kellog's Frosted Flakes.  She is perfectly healthy, had never experienced anything like this before, and there is no history of seizures in either side of the family.  All the tests (EEG, MRI, EKG) came out negative so the decision was made to do nothing and just wait to see if it happened again.  Well, we were going along fine and the other morning, April 5, she had a bowl of another Kellog's frosted kind of cereal, Fruit Loops (I am embarrassed to admit that I even bought that junk but every once in a while...) So I pour it in her bowl and think \\\"Oh, oh, this is the same kind of junk she was eating when she had that seizure.\\\"  Ten  minutes later she had a full blown seizures. This was her first exposure to a sugar coated cereal since the last seizure.  When I mentioned what she ate the first time as a possible reason for the seizure the neurologist basically negated that as an idea.  Now after this second episode, so similar in nature to the first, even he is scratching his head.  Once again her EEG looks normal which I understand can happen even when a person has a seizure.  Once again we are waiting. I have been thinking that it would be good to get to as large a group as possible to see if anyone has any experience with this kind of thing.  I know that members of the medical community are sometimes loathe to admit the importance that diet and foods play in our general health and well-being.  Anyway, as you can guess, I am worried sick about this, and would appreciate any ideas anyone out there has.  Sorry to be so wordy but I wanted to really get across what is going on here.  Thanks.       \",\"Has anyone heard what game ESPN is showing tonight.  They said they will show whatever game means the most playoff-wise. I would assume this would be the Blues-Tampa game or the Minnesota-Red Wings game...  Anyone heard for sure??? \",\" Well, had you been a bit less exuberant in both the tone and substance of your predictions, the responses would probably have been a bit more measured. Be that as it may....  Clemens is always in this form, and Viola isn't really performing beyond what might reasonably have been expected. How do you know that the Sox are responding to them, and not to Al Bumbry, Hobson, or (my most likely suspect) new hitting coach Mike Easler? I certainly am more likely to give Easler credit for Mo Vaughhn's hot start than Clemens or Viola.  This was the optimistic scenario, but not unreasonably so. He hasn't shown much power yet, though.  How can you tell that Dawson is providing the leadership? Perhaps it's Calderon? Perhaps it's Clemens and Viola? Maybe Hobson is finally showing those people skills he was supposed to have when they hired him. Or maybe it's all a myth. And Dawson has been hitting reasonably well, but not as well as Greenwell, Vaughn, Cooper, or Fletcher.  In three games. Why don't we look at this one again in, say, July?  A bit better than could reasonably have been expected. But don't forget that Zupcic looked like Wade Boggs lite for about 75 AB's last year. Beware of small sample sizes. Still, if Fletcher hits as well as he did last year he'd be a great improvement over any Sox leadoff hitter from last year. Be aware that his career numbers seem to indicate that he puts up good numbers as long as he doesn't have to make more than 300 AB or so in a year.  Ummm...sorry, no. I can buy the \\\"in the field\\\" part, and I think he'll be better at the plate than the 1992 Boggs, but in general Cooper, while he'll be a pretty good hitter, couldn't carry Boggs' jockstrap. With a little luck, he could be the fourth or fifth best 3B in the AL (Martinez, Boggs, Ventura, and Palmer will all be better).   See, here is where you make that quick left turn off into the aether. .500 is plausible, third is not unlikely, but phrases like \\\"could run away with the division\\\" are likely to get you a visit from the men in the white coats. It's not really clear that their staff is better than last year. If Russell does well, Darwin doesn't go on the DL, and Hesketh doesn't pitch just barely well enough to avoid losing his spot in the rotation, they could be better. On the other hand, if Hesketh pitches miserably and they're too stupid to move him to the pen and bring up Conroy or somebody, Fossas continues to pitch dismally but they keep giving him innings becasue he's a lefty, and Russell explodes they could be pretty bad.

The name of the company is Secure Communicatiions Technology (Information will be given at the end of this message on how to contact them).     Basically they are disturbed about the announcement for many reasons that we are. More specifically however, Mr. Bryen of Secure Communications brought to light many points that might interest most of the readers.     His belief is that AT&T was made known of the clipper well before the rest of the industry. This is for several reasons, several of which are:   - A company of AT&T's size could never be able to make a decision to use    the new chip on the SAME DAY it was announced.   - Months ago they proposed using their own chip for AT&T's secure telephone    devices. AT&T basically blew them off as being not interested at all.    This stuck them as strange, until now...      Also I spoke with Art Melnick, their cryptographer, he expressed several concerns over the new Clipper Chip:    - The obvious backdoor will be able to let many people decrypt the code.    - Once the key is released to authorities the security of the crypto     system is lost forever. These keys can end up in the hands of any agency     of the government.    - The fact that the escrowed keys never change means that the algorithm     is vulnerable over time to an attacker.    - The classified algorithm may hide another backdoor. But he feels that     it is probably to keep people from forging fake serial numbers, or     changing the keys themselves.    - Additionally he feels that the NSA has probably spent enough time and     money in working on a way to keep this chip from being reversed     engineered, that he feels that reverse engineering it will be very     difficult to do. He feels that they have developed a suitable technique     to protect the chip from this attack. Also he feels that the chip is     hardware encoded with the algorithm and not microcoded onto the chip.  Additonally I spoke with Mr. Melnick about their algorithm. He couldn't tell me much about their new agorithm because it hasn't been patented yet. However he told me a little:   - The algorithm will be released for public review after patents have been    granted for it. This is so the crypto community can see that it is    secure.   - The algorithm is called NEA for New Encryption Algorithm.    The details were sketchy because now it is held as a trade secret    until the patent was issued, but I was told that it will incorporate    the following:      - It will have fast encryption of data (Exact specs not given, but       Mr. Melnick stated \\\"Much faster than what an RS-232 can put out.\\\")      - It is a symmetric cipher, just like IDEA and DES.      - It will use 64 bit data blocks for encryption (like DES and IDEA).      - The key length was not given to me, but Mr. Melnick states that       it is _adujustable_ and is \\\"More than adequate for security.\\\"      - The algorithm is written in C and Assembler in software form, and       can be ported to many platforms (Unlike the the Clipper Chip which       is hardware ONLY and cannot be made into software) This I       consider a definite plus for the NEA for widespread use.      - The algorithm will accomodate public key distribution techniques       such as RSA or Diffie-Hellman. This will also be supported in the       hardware chip.      - Right now the projected cost of the NEA chip will be about 10 dollars       for each!! (Clipper will run 25 each chip [that is if it is produced       enough, which probably won't happen]).      - They currently sell a program called C-COM that uses the algorithm       and a special streaming protocol that does not divide the encrypted       data into \\\"blocks.\\\" This could prevent plaintext attacks if you know       what the block header is. This program operates at all supported       RS-232 speeds and uses the software implementation of the algorithm.      - Most importantly: IT DOES NOT HAVE A BACKDOOR!!    Right now the company is afraid that the new clipper chip will put them out of business. This is a very real possibility. So they really need help in stopping the clipper chip from becoming a standard. If you want to contact them, they can be reached at..

HC4066 is spec'd at something like -3dB @ 200MHz into  50 ohms. The more complex types are generally a little slower and more  resistive.  Plain 4000 series are not so good at handling 5v logic.  Remember that the output load is seen by the input device.\",\" I don't find this a credible argument, for two reasons.  One you have supplied below: unless I care about entering the USA at any time in the future (eg. the Taiwanese backyard cloners - who BTW have been known to decap custom silicon and reproduce it on daughterboards when pirating high-profit arcade machines and the like - who wouldn't care less), I am not  going to care much about US confidentiality, am I?  Only people like the real me, who does care about travelling to various countries for business reasons, will sit up and follow laws like this, but I would contend that we're not the main threat.  I also have grave doubts whether an algorythm widely distributed in silicon could possibly be called \\\"classified.\\\"  It's like handing out military secrets to the whole world in envelopes marked \\\"don't open me.\\\"  I can imagine several credible defences which could be employed if it came to a trial.  One would be the stupidity of the government's actions.   Amusing thought: could they have employed an algorythm which is infeasable for a fast software implementation, but which is easy in custom hardware? In DES, the extensive use of permutation tables (trivial in hardware: you just swap bus lines), but relatively slow in software have had a big effect on the speed difference between hardware and software implementations of that cipher (indeed, I suspect that Lucifer's designers were well aware that it would be, and approved.)  Certain algorythms (usually parallel search algorythms) can be very slow in software, yet can fly in custom hardware. I have no proof of their employment in Clipper -- it is pure conjecture.   However, as a software implementation of this cipher is something that its  designers would have been trying to avoid at all costs, then the inclusion  of such techniques seems credible.  Hmmm... I also wonder what Intergraph thinks about the use of the name \\\"Clipper\\\" for this device. :) \",\": >>My friend recently purchased a LC III and he wants to know if there is : >>such a demon called NuBus adapter for his PDS slot?   : > The LC family of Macs can only : > use PDS cards.

At least, Marvin's friend has not been able to : locate one and neither have I.  What is the fundamental reason for : this?  I think that there do exist NuBus expansion cages (I'm sure I've seen them advertised occassionally), but I think that the main problem is that they cost much more than the difference in price between say a LC and IIvx so unless you need lots of NuBus slots its not worth the bother.  (Of course, it may be that these extra boxes are so expensive because no one buys them because they are so expensive...)  NuBus technology isn't a special Apple Proprietry thing (I have this sneaky feeling that it is licensed from Texas Instruments???) so there is no problem building an expansion box.  The difference between NuBus and PDS is that NuBus is a clever interface with lots of neat toys built in to make sure that lots of cards can work together on the same computer. PDS (processor direct slot) is just that: here are all the connections to the processor. You can do anything with this and it is as quick as it can be, but there's no cooperation. You may be able to get double PDS slot adaptors but you try plugging 2 video cards in, and just watch them conflict! Of course, the extra  electronics in a NuBus slot makes it appreciably more expensive, so guess why Apple doesn't put it in it's cheaper machines?  So, yah pays yer money and yah takes yah choice.\",\"     The problem is, your use of the word \\\"objective\\\" along with \\\"values.\\\" Both definitions three and four are inherently subjective, that is they are particular to a given individual, or personal. You see, what one person may see as worthwhile, another may see as worthless.   Again, your form of measurement in this sentence, that being of \\\"worth\\\" is subjective.     When I find that my usage of a word is different than the usage of that word given by another person, I try to find a standard against which to judge that usage. In most cases, the dictionary is the standard I use. Here is a definiton of objective:  objective ADJ. 1. Of or having to do with a material object as  distinguished from a mental concept. 2. Having actual existance. 3.a. Unenfluenced by emotion or personal prejudice. b. Based on observable phenomenon.  By this definition, science does not have an objective worth, since the phrase \\\"objective worth\\\" is an oxymoron. However you asked something a  little differently this time, you asked for an objective basis for a notion. The fact that the use of science as an intellectual tool is responsible for changes in our world (the changes are material, and thus \\\"objective\\\") would provide an objective _basis_ for an argument. However, the conclusion arrived at from that argument (that science is  \\\"good\\\") is subjective.  I think that the problem here is one of word usage. Take a little time and read the definitions of these words: objective, subjective, worth, value, morality, good, evil. I believe that if you think about the  meaning of them for a while, you will have to conclude that there is no such thing as an objective morality. \",\"Does anybody else think that WS stats should become part of a player's career stats?

I really hope Baines can provide the RF support the O's need. Orsulak was decent but I had hoped that Chito Martinez could learn defense better and play like he did in '91.

No one has made a point for or against       that issue, nor have they compared the LDS position against orthodox      belief. The infernal paradise is held to be Abraham's bosom (Luke 16),       the place of the righteous dead in sheol (equivalent to hades).       The point that was raised by John was that someone could not repent      on their death bed.

My daughter's Christian school sends home a weekly update on school related topics. This week they sent something *very* interesting. It was an article written by the leader of a national (US) Christian school organization about a trip he recently made to Jerusalem. While there, he was introduced to one of the rabbis who is working on a project to rebuild the Temple at Jerusalem. The article included photos of the many furnishings that have already been made in preparation for furnishing the rebuilt temple according to the specifications given in the Bible.   What was even more striking is the fact that the plans for the temple are complete and the group is only awaiting permission from the Israeli government before beginning the building. The other startling fact is the very recent archeological discovery that the original site of the temple is unoccupied and available for building. Previously it has been thought that the original site was underneath what is now a mosque, making rebuilding impossible without sparking a holy war.   Now it appears that nothing stands in the way of rebuilding and resuming sacrifices, as the Scriptures indicate will happen in the last days. Although the Israeli government will give the permission to start, I think it is the hand of God holding the project until He is ready to let it happen. Brothers and sisters, the time is at hand.

Lots of room inside and even with the smaller engine it has enough power for me.  The only problem I found was a small selection on the dealer's lots. They are hot sellers around here.\",\" I must admit that this point has been running through my mind for most of the discussion: one the dice are out there, it won't be long before someone decaps it and, after a bit of work, has full details of the Clipper algorythm.  This isn't trivial to do, but then again, it is not impossibly difficult either.  Any half way decent VLSI design student should be able to take a photograph of a technology s/he is familiar with, and given a description of the input, output, control and supply lines, figure out  the function of various subsystems on the die.  Indeed, this is not an uncommon exercise performed during training (because it makes you think about design decisions made by other designers.  I could speculate that these chips are going to be manufactured using \\\"tamperproof\\\" carriers (unlikely - such techniques are *very* expensive and this thing is supposed to be relatively cheap to produce), or that there will be some legal or legislative framework to prevent publication of the algorythm (unlikely - please correct me if I am wrong but aren't these supposed to be sold internationally?).  I suppose that the most likely reason the algorythm is remaining secret for the moment is that some idiot bureaucrat, untrammeled by the realities of the situation, decided that \\\"well, we should keep it a secret because it is supposed to be secret, isn't it?\\\"  Just some random thoughts... \",\"IRWIN suggests the use of pre-formatted tapes for their tape drives, as you often can't successfully format a tape and need  bulk-erase it before you can format it again.

Feng\",\" Many X servers supporting graphics accelerators do not allow the creation of pixmaps exeeding the size of the screen.  One workaround is to create several smaller pixmaps and add the results. \",\" You're obviously not referring to any of the three above-quoted individuals, because barnacles don't each send $20 to the crew of the ship to keep it moving.  \\\"Get the organization to act on it\\\" is easy to say, but says little about what one really can and should do.  What the organization actually will do is largely determined by the president and directors, as far as I can see.  That's what makes it so important to vote in an election of officers.  It does strike me that the BMWMOA is a lot less politically active (in the state and national arenas, not infighting) than other M/C organizations.  Should we change this?  Or just join the other groups that already are in politics?  (Incidentally, the political hazards to motorcycle riders in the US at the moment don't compare to the problems of some other groups like gun owners.  Just try to take up target pistol shooting in the Northeast or California, and I bet you'll wish you only had to worry about wearing a helmet.  (Why does every thread on rec.moto eventually come around to guns?))\",\" In certain Apple 13\\\" RGB monitors there has been a problem with  the HIGH VOLTAGE CAPASITOR.

You're missing a central teaching of Christianity - man is inherently sinful.  We are saved through faith by grace.  Knowing that, believing that, does not make us without sin.  Furthermore, not all who consider themselves \\\"christians\\\" are (even those who manage to head their own \\\"churches\\\").  \\\"Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.\\\" - Matt. 7:21.   Again, what historical documents do you trust?  Do you think Hannibal crossed the Alps?  How do you know?  How do you know for sure?  What historical documents have stood the scrutiny and the attempts to dis- credit it as well as the Bible has?   Well, it's really a shame you feel this way.  No one can browbeat you into believing, and those who try will probably only succeed in driving you further away.  You need to ask yourself some difficult questions: 1) is there an afterlife, and if so, does man require salvation to attain it.  If the answer is yes, the next question is 2) how does man attain this salvation - can he do it on his own as the eastern religions and certain modern offshoots like the \\\"new age movement\\\" teach or does he require God's help?  3) If the latter, in what form does - indeed, in what form can such help come?  Needless to say, this discussion could take a lifetime, and for some people it did comprise their life's writings, so I am hardly in a position to offer the answers here - merely pointers to what to ask.  Few, of us manage to have an unshaken faith our entire lives (certainly not me). The spritual life is a difficult journey (if you've never read \\\"A Pilgrim's Progress,\\\" I highly recommend this greatest allegory of the english language).   Now I see by your close that one possible source of trouble for you may be a conflict between your politcal beliefs and your religious upbringing.  You wrote that \\\"I (in my own faith) accept and live my life by many if not most of the teachings of christ\\\".  Well, Christ referred to God as \\\"My Father\\\", not \\\"My Mother\\\", and while the \\\"maleness\\\" of God is not the same as the maleness of those of us humans who possess a Y chromosome, it does not honor God to refer to Him as female purely to be trendy, non-discriminatory, or politically correct.  This in no way disparages women (nor is it my intent to do so by my use of the male pronoun to refer to both men and women -  english just does not have a decent neuter set of pronouns).  After all, God chose a woman as his only human partner in bringing Christ into the human population.  Well, I'm not about to launch into a detailed discussion of the role of women in Christianity at 1am with only 6 hours of sleep in the last 63, and for that reason I also apologize for any shortcomings in this article.  I just happened across yours and felt moved to reply.  I hope I may have given you, and anyone else who finds himself in a similar frame of mind, something to contemplate.\",\"From: Center for Policy Research <cpr> Subject: Desertification of the Negev   The desertification of the arid Negev ------------------------------------- by Moise Saltiel, I&P March 1990  I.

The Negev in the Year 2000  Just after the creation of the State of Israel, the phrase \\\"the Jewish pioneers will make the desert bloom\\\" was trumpeted throughout the Western world. After the Six Day War in 1967, David Ben-Gurion declared in a letter to Charles de Gaulle: \\\"It's by our pioneering creation that we have transformed a poor and arid land into a fertile land, created built-up areas, towns and villages in abandoned desert areas\\\".  Contrary to Ben-Gurion's assertion, it must be affirmed that during the 26 years of the British mandate over Palestine and for centuries previous, a productive human presence was to be found in all parts of the Negev desert - in the very arid hills and valleys of the southern Negev as well as in the more fertile north. These were the Bedouin Arabs.  The real desertification of the Negev, mainly in the southern part, occurred after Israel's dispossession of the Bedouin's cultivated lands and pastures. Nowadays, the majority of the 12,800 square-kilometer Negev, which represents 62 percent of the State of Israel (pre-1967 borders), has been desertified beyond recognition. The main new occupiers of the formerly Bedouin Negev are the Israeli army; the Nature Reserves Authority, whose chief role is to prevent Bedouin from roaming their former pasture lands; and vast industrial zones, including nuclear reactors and dumping grounds for chemical, nuclear and other wastes. Israeli Jews in the Negev today cultivate less than half the surface area cultivated by the Bedouin before 1948, and there is no Jewish pastoral activity.  I. Agricultural and pastoral activities of the Negev Bedouin before and after 1948 -------------------------------------------------- In 1942, according to British mandatory statistics, the Beersheba sub-district (which corresponds more or less to Israel's Negev, or Southern, district) had 52,000 inhabitants, almost all Bedouin Arabs, who held 11,500 camels, 6,000 cows and oxen, 42,000 sheep and 22,000 goats.  The majority of the Bedouin lived a more or less sedentary life in the north, where precipitation ranged between 200 and 350 mm per year. In 1944 they cultivated about 200,000 hectares of the Beersheba district - i.e. 16 percent of its total area and *more than double the area cultivated by the Negev's Jewish settlers after 40 years of \\\"making the desert bloom\\\"*  The Bedouin had a very low crop yield - 350 to 400 kilograms of barley per hectare during rainy years - and their farming techniques were primitive, but production was based solely on animal and human labor. It must also be underscored that animal production, although low, was based entirely on pasturing. Production increased considerably during the rainy years and diminished significantly during drought years. All Bedouin pasture animals - goats, camels and sheep - had the ability to gain weight quickly over the relatively rainy winters and to withstand many waterless days during the hot summers. These animals were the result of a centuries-old process of natural selection in harsh local conditions.  After the creation of the State of Israel, 80 percent of the Negev Bedouin were expelled to the Sinai or to Southern Jordan. The 10,000 who were allowed to remain were confined to a territory of 40,000 hectares in a region were annual mean precipiation was 150 mm - a quantity low enough to ensure a crop failure two years out of three. The rare water wells in the south and central Negev, spring of life in the desert, were cemented to prevent Bedouin shepherds from roaming.  A few Bedouin shepherds were allowed to stay in the central Negev. But after 1982, when the Sinai was returned to Egypt, these Bedouin were also eliminated. At the same time, strong pressure was applied on the Bedouin to abandon cultivation of their fields in order that the land could be transferred to the army.  No reliable statistics exist concerning the amount of land held today by Negev Bedouin. It is a known fact that a large part of the 40,000 hectares they cultivated in the 1950s has been seized by the Israeli authorities. Indeed, most of the Bedouin are now confined to seven \\\"development towns\\\", or *sowetos*, established for them.\",\"I'm concerned about a recent posting about WBT/SIL.

Leading the first Armenian units who crossed the Ottoman  border in the company of the Russian invaders was the former Ottoman  Parliamentary representative for Erzurum, Karekin Pastirmaciyan, who  assumed the revolutionary name Armen Garo. Another former Ottoman  parliamentarian, Hamparsum Boyaciyan, led the Armenian guerrilla forces  who ravaged Turkish villages behind the lines under the nickname \\\"Murad\\\",  especially ordering that            'Kill Turks and Kurds wherever you find them and in            whatever circumstances you find them.

In March 1915, the Russian forces began to move toward Van. Immediately, in April 11, 1915 the Armenians of Van began a revolt, massacring all  the Turks in the vicinity so as to make possible its quick and easy  conquest by Russians. Little wonder that Czar Nicholas II sent a  telegram of thanks to the Armenian Revolutionary Committee of Van in  April 21, 1915, \\\"thanking it for its services to Russia.\\\" The Armenian  newspaper Gochnak, published in the United States, also proudly  reported in May 24, 1915 that   \\\"only 1,500 Turks remained in Van the rest having been slaughtered.\\\"  Source: Hovannisian, Richard G.: Armenia on the Road to Independence, 1918.

The estimated population  of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were  Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem.  Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third  of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the   Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan  uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians  as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,  however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the  guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000  inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character   notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian   Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the   southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.\\\"   (See also Map 1.

Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They   found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border   into Turkey. The rest were killed.

The main legal principles of the Turkish State  are summarized in Article 2 of the Constitution:   \\\"The Republic of Turkey is a democratic, secular and social State  governed by the rule of law; bearing in mind the concepts of public  peace, national solidarity and justice; respecting human rights;  loyal to the nationalism of Ataturk, and based on the fundamental  tenets set forth in the Preamble of the Constitution.\\\"  Freedom of culture and religion prevailed during the Ottoman Empire, allowing the many nations and races within its boundaries to remain autonomous. The fact that the Ottoman Empire was the longest lived in recent history may be attributed to these freedoms, despite the lack of any written Constitution. The first attempts to create a written Constitution occurred in 1839 and 1856. Although the documents adopted during these two attempts remained in force only temporarily, they provided the basic elements of a Constitution.  The 1876 Constitution was the first legal document to force a Parliament and the right of election to share the sovereignty of the Emperor. The Constitution of 1906 placed some additional limitations on the Emperor, while increasing the power of the Parliament and the government.  The First World War (1914-1918) brought the Ottoman Empire to an end. By the occupation of Istanbul, the Parliament was dissolved and the Constitution was abolished. The members of Parliament were sent to exile to an island by the occupying forces.  During the Independence War, the \\\"Turkish Grand National Assembly\\\" held their first meeting on April 23, 1920 to serve as the legislative body of the new Turkish state. This assembly prepared the new legal structure of the Turkish Republic. The new Republic was proclaimed on October 29, 1923 and the new Constitution was adopted in 1924. That Constitution served as the legal  backbone of today's modern Turkish Republic. In 1945, Turkey adopted a  multi-party political system. The Constitution of 1924 was replaced by others in 1961 and 1982. All three Constitutions of the Republic have been based on the principles of parliamentary democracy, human rights, national sovereignty, division of powers, private ownership and secularization.  \\\"Major Principles of the Constitution\\\"  The constitution (with 177 Articles) establishes the structure of the Republic within the following principles:  - The Turkish Republic is a democratic, secular and social state governed by    law; - It should be governed to maintain public peace, national solidarity, justice,   human rights and the objectives of Ataturk; - The language of the State is Turkish; - Sovereignty is vested in the nation without any conditions or restrictions.   Sovereignty is exercised by organizations authorized by the nation; - Legislative power is carried by the Parliament elected by the nation. This   power cannot be delegated (transferred) to any one else; - Executive power is exercised by the President, and Council of Ministers; - Judicial power is exercised by the independent courts on behalf of the   Turkish nation; - All individuals are equal, irrespective of language, race, religion, color,   sex, or political beliefs; - Laws cannot be contradict those principles stated in the Constitution.  \\\"Structure of the State\\\"  In accordance with the Constitution, the structure of the state is based on the principle of \\\"division of power\\\" to create a balanced and self-controlled system. The power is divided into \\\"legislative power,\\\" \\\"executive power,\\\" and \\\"judicial power,\\\" balanced to secure freedoms and powers to control each other (self-control).   A. Legislative Power:   The \\\"Turkish Grand National Assembly\\\" is a parliament with one House, elected  by the nation for a term of five years to exercise legislative power on  behalf of the nation. The basic functions of this Assembly are:   - to adopt, to amend, or to repeal laws;  - to approve or to dismiss the Council of Ministers;  - to supervise and to question Ministers or the Council of Ministers;  - to debate, to amend and to approve annual budgets;  - to ratify international agreements;  - to grant amnesty or pardons.   Members of Parliament do not have any liability for their words (either oral  or written) during the course of their legislative duties. The country is  divided into constituencies. The number of representatives of each is  calculated according to its population. Every Turkish citizen over the age  of twenty-one can vote.   Elections are supervised by the \\\"Supreme Council of Elections,\\\" which solves  all disputes or appeals. In each province, the local \\\"Board of Election\\\"  runs and controls the election under the supervision and guidelines of the  Supreme Council. Members of the Council and Boards are elected among   independent judges.   B. Executive Power:   The President of the Republic is the Head of State (not the head of government  as in the Unites States). The main functions of the President are:   - to represent the State and the Country;  - to insure the implementation of the Constitution;  - to coordinate legislative, judicial and executive functions;  - act as the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces;  - to ratify laws and government decrees.    The President is elected by the Grand National Assembly for a period of seven  years. The President may ratify or return the laws for a second debate, may   call for a referendum.   Executive power is exercised by the \\\"Council of Ministers,\\\" headed by the  Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is appointed by the President from the  members of Parliament. The Prime Minister names the Ministers for approval  by the President. The new Government (Council of Ministers) reads their  program at the Parliament and the vote of confidence follows. There are 21 (?)  Ministers in the Council.   Ministers and other members of the administration can be sued in independent  \\\"administrative\\\" courts for their misuse of power, administrative errors or  functions against any law.   C. Judicial Power:   Judicial power is exercised by independent courts. No authority or power can  instruct the judges or public prosecutors of the courts. These cannot be   discharged, replaced or retired by executive authorities except for the  reasons clearly stated by the appropriate laws. There are three categories  of courts in the Turkish judiciary system:   - Courts of justice deal with legal, commercial and criminal cases. The     decisions of these courts may be reviewed by the supreme court of justice    upon the appeal of the parties involved.  - The decisions or functions of the executive power (including the Prime    Minister and Ministers or any governmental department) can be appealed in    administrative courts if these functions or decisions are against the law.    The decisions of these administrative courts may also be reviewed by the    high administrative court.   The laws and decisions of the Grand National Assembly can be examined by the  \\\"Constitutional Court\\\" if they contradict the Constitution. If found  contradictory, this court may cancel the decisions or laws of the Parliament.   Serdar Argic\",\" Educate yourself before you rip on this years manager of the year.

A TTL gate has the basic structure of AND/OR/INVERT, and an inversion of a sum of a product is just exactly ONE gate delay.  The reason to find a minimal sum of products is that this matches a hardware optimization.   A positive-OR gate (such as the 9-gate solution uses) has TWO gate delays (and there's another gate delay in the second term) so that the second solution, while simpler in logic symbols, can  be expected to be something less than optimal in the real world. ECL is similar to TTL, in that it can support an OR/AND gate with the minimum delay (unlike TTL, you get both true and inverse outputs for 'free' when using ECL).   PALs are basically large programmable AND/OR/INVERT gates (with your choice of internal connections between the various sections, and perhaps some latches), so a minimum sum of products ALSO is a way to shoehorn a logic design into  a few PALs.  It's not comparably easy to design with a minimization of logic gates, but some software packages claim to allow you to do so, and will take just about any mess of gates (as a nodelist with 74xxx series logic ICs) and produce a description of a logic cell array to do the same job.  Xilinx's XACT software does this by treating each logic block as a macro, and expanding it all out, then simplifying.\",\"Pardon me for interrupting, but why doesn't anyone ever bring up other possibilities besides more government, less government, or no government and stop there?

The original documentation for the sound hardware (IM-3) documents how to make sound by directly accessing hardware.  Basically, you jam values into all the even bytes from SoundBase to SoundBase+0x170. This was because of how the Mac 128 (and some later machines) generated sound was by scanning this block and D/Aing every even byte (the odd bytes went to the floppy on some machines).  When the Mac II (and Apple Sound Chip) was invented, it was designed to generate stereo sound. It was also designed to be compatible with we had once documented. So storing bytes at the even values at SoundBase meant \\\"I want to play a mono sound\\\" and so it was emulated. But Apple had since retracted the documentation on SoundBase and decided not to document the lowest layers of sound generation. So apple never explained where to stuff bytes if you want to make stereo sound.  Enter game developers. The sound driver and current sound manager are inconveniently lame for making games. Furthermore, people who port from the IBM don't want to learn more APIs. So, it has become popular for game writers to write to SoundBase to make sound, since it is very easy.  Since the Mac II, Apple has had many different kind of sound output hardware, and the only things they have in common are that writing to SoundBase works. On some hardware, (Mac II, IIx, IIcx, IIci at least), writing to SoundBase gets you mono sound through both speakers. On some Macs (Quadra 700/900/950 at least) writing to SoundBase gets you mono sound on the left channel only. Both are technically correct interpretations of the original specification, but one is obviously preferable for asthetic reasons.  If developers use the Sound Manager (and I think the sound driver), mono sounds will (typically) come out through both channels regardless of the underlying hardware. It is possible to specify you want to generate left channel only, but no one does. If developers write to sound base, their games will only come out the left on some games.  The other problem, the original Mac II only producing left channel sound on the internal speaker, while the SE/30 mixes both, isn't really related. It is due to the post generation amplification used on the motherboards of the different machines. It only affects true stereo sounds. Sounds which are actually mono, will play on the internal speaker, no matter what machine you have.  Now, to more directly address the question, the games you list: and also Hellcats, Super Tetris Oxyd (and many more, these are just what I've tested)  Cheat and write to SoundBase and so are only left channel on Quadras.   Other games you list: and also PGA Tour Golf Civilization (and more, these are again only from personal experience)  Use the sound manager and work fine on all machines.  The more of the story is to developers: DON'T CHEAT! Really, I am absolutely, positively not allowed to do what I am about to do, but I'm going say it anyway. Stop cheating on sound! Really soon, you will be sorry, as even those without external speakers will be disappointed with your sound on future hardware. The grace period is about to end. The Sound Manager is understandable now, and works pretty well and will work even better soon, so use it.  In conclusion: To Doug, it isn't a hardware problem, at least, not a bug. To Jon, it isn't a choice to developers as to whether they want to send sound to both channels. If they do it the right way, it is taken care of automatically. If you cheat, there is not way to make it work on all hardware.   Have fun.  Disclaimer number 1: I don't work on sound here at Apple, I'm just pretty well informed. So don't write me with sound questions.  Disclaimer number 2: If it says up above that I wrote anything like \\\"the grace period is about to end\\\" then it is a bug in your news feed, since I am catagorically not allowed to say anything like that.

Cheers, Kent\",\"Read this through once or twice.  Then replace \\\"prince\\\" with \\\"government\\\" or \\\"president\\\", as appropriate, and read it again.    [From Chapter XX of _The Prince_, by N. Macchiavelli, as translated by Daniel Donno.]   In order to keep their lands secure, some princes have disarmed their subjects; others have prompted division within the cities they have subjugated.  Some have nurtured animosities against themselves; others have sought to win the approval of those they initially distrusted.  Some have erected fortresses; others have destroyed them.  Now, although it is impossible to set down definite judgements on all of these measures without considering the particular circumstances of the states where they may be employed, I shall nevertheless discuss them in such broad terms as the subject itself will allow.   To begin with, there has never been a case of a new prince disarming his subjects.  Indeed, whenever he found them disarmed, he proceeded to arm them.  For by arming your subjects, you make their arms your own.  Those among them who are suspicious become loyal, while those who are already loyal remain so, and from subjects they are transformed into partisans.  Though you cannot arm them all, nonetheless you increase your safety among those you leave unarmed by extending privileges to those you arm.  Your different treatment of the two categories will make the latter feel obligated to you, while the former will consider it proper thoat those who assume added duties and dangers should receive advantages.     When you disarm your subjects, however, you offend them, by showing that, either from cowardliness or from lack of faith, you distrust them; and either conclusion will induce them to hate you. Moreover, since it is impossible for you to remain unarmed, you would have to resort to mercenaries, whose limitations have already been discussed. Even if such troops were good, however, they could never be good enough to defend you from powerful enemies, and doubtful subjects.  Therefore, as I have said, a new prince in a newly acquired state has always taken measures to arm his subjects, and history is full of examples proving that this is so.   But when a prince takes posession of a new state which he annexes as an addition to his original domain, then he must disarm all the subjects of the new state except those who helped him to acquire it; and these, as time and occasion permit, he must seek to render soft and weak.  He must arrange matters in such a way that the arms of the entire state will be in the hands of soldiers who are native to his original domain.   ...\",\"  [other uninformed, purposefully ignorant gun control ranting deleted]   I want this man to tell me how in the hell you can take the  explosives used in the WTC bombing, considering that the  consensus seems to be that the explosive was a fertilizer-based one.

Chiu knows the score and is just being silly. However, \\\"decibel\\\" is in fact 1/10th of a bel. He is right on that one, but I don't know if it was accidental or not.  Strictly defined, a bel is the ratio of the log of two power levels, and a decibel is 1/10th of a bel so you have 10X decibels for every bel, hence bel=log(P2/P1) and decibel=10Xlog(P2/P1).  The bel, ohm, volt, farad, ampere, watt, hertz, henry, etc. are all named for pioneers in the field. It's a traditional and fine way to honor researchers who discover new knowledge in a new field. Hertz was one of the most important of the early electronics explorers, but had been left out in having a term or unit named after him until recently, (1960's, prior to that what is now a hertz was a cps.) All the other units were defined many decades earlier.       --  ----------------------------------------------------------------------    \",\"Archive-name: space/schedule Last-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:23 $  SPACE SHUTTLE ANSWERS, LAUNCH SCHEDULES, TV COVERAGE      SHUTTLE LAUNCHINGS AND LANDINGS; SCHEDULES AND HOW TO SEE THEM      Shuttle operations are discussed in the Usenet group sci.space.shuttle,     and Ken Hollis (gandalf@pro-electric.cts.com) posts a compressed version     of the shuttle manifest (launch dates and other information)     periodically there.

Official NASA shuttle status reports are posted to sci.space.news     frequently.       WHY DOES THE SHUTTLE ROLL JUST AFTER LIFTOFF?      The following answer and translation are provided by Ken Jenks     (kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov).      The \\\"Ascent Guidance and Flight Control Training Manual,\\\" ASC G&C 2102,   \\\"During the vertical rise phase, the launch pad attitude is  commanded until an I-loaded V(rel) sufficient to assure launch tower  clearance is achieved. Then, the tilt maneuver (roll program)  orients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a  negative q-alpha, which in turn alleviates structural loading. Other  advantages with this attitude are performance gain, decreased abort  maneuver complexity, improved S-band look angles, and crew view of  the horizon. The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining  downrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (MECO) target  in second stage.\\\"      This really is a good answer, but it's couched in NASA jargon. I'll try     to interpret.      1) We wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.      2) Then, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack  between the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the  \\\"relative wind\\\") and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line  between the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly  negative angle (\\\"a negative q-alpha\\\"). This causes a little bit of  \\\"downward\\\" force (toward the belly of the Orbiter, or the +Z  direction) and this force \\\"alleviates structural loading.\\\"  We have to be careful about those wings -- they're about the  most \\\"delicate\\\" part of the vehicle.      3) The new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more  mass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, or  to change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be  the case if we didn't roll (\\\"performance gain\\\").      4) The new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated  flight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort  maneuvers, the Return To Launch Site (\\\"decreased abort maneuver  complexity\\\").      5) The new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radio  antennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radio  antennae on the Orbiter (\\\"improved S-band look angles\\\").      6) The new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is a  helpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.      7) The new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is  more nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east  (usually).  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity  in the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  Remember:  velocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction.  The Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its  velocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.      This all begs the question, \\\"Why isn't the launch pad oriented to give     this nice attitude to begin with?  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to     achieve that attitude?\\\"  The answer is that the pads were leftovers     from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one     for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main     Engine exhaust.  (You can see the effects of this on any daytime     launch.  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust is     fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the \\\"top\\\"     [Orbiter side] and the \\\"bottom\\\" [External Tank side] of the stack.) The     access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented     basically the same way they were for the Saturn V's.  (A side note: the     Saturn V's also had a roll program.  Don't ask me why -- I'm a Shuttle     guy.)      I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics. He added that the \\\"roll     maneuver\\\" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.     The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons     stated.  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping     the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw     component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  The total     maneuver is really expressed as a \\\"quaternion,\\\" a grad-level-math     concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element     array.       HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL, NASA SELECT      NASA SELECT is broadcast by satellite. If you have access to a satellite     dish, you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R, Transponder 13, C-Band, 72     degrees West Longitude, Audio 6.8, Frequency 3960 MHz. F2R is stationed     over the Atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from     California and points west. During events of special interest (e.g.     shuttle missions), SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite     for these viewers.      If you can't get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry SELECT.     It's worth asking if yours doesn't.      The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is     frequently posted to sci.space.news. Generally it carries press     conferences, briefings by NASA officials, and live coverage of shuttle     missions and planetary encounters. SELECT has recently begun carrying     much more secondary material (associated with SPACELINK) when missions     are not being covered.

Recently, I had a baby boy born with seizures which occured 12-15 hours after birth.

This has been a major learning experience for me and my wife not only in learning the medical problems that faced our son but also in dealing with hospitals, procedures...etc.  I don't want to go into a lot of detail, but his condition was termed  quite severe at first then slowly he began to grow and put on weight as a normal baby would. He was put on the standard anti-convulsion drugs and that did not seem to help out. His MRI, EKG, cat-scans are all normal, but the EEG's show alot of seizure activity.

Blacks have the same (+- 2%) crime report rate, arrest rate, and incarceration rate for violent crimes.  So I doubt that for violent crimes, that there is any inherent bias mechanism present.  There is a wider discrepancy for all crimes for blacks wrt to 3 categories.  Interestingly enough, the discrepancy is the largest in the Southern United States -- where blacks are incarcerated well BELOW the average in the rest of the United States! Which points to an anti-bias-against wrt blacks.  In any case, for violent crimes and burglary and drug selling, blacks are reported 53%, arrested 44%, and are present in jails/prisons 47% (1988).  Considering that 12% of the population is black, 6% are black males, and some percentage of that is out of the high/low age groups, we do have a situation where (if I remember my old calculations right) 4% of the population commits almost half of the really nasty crimes.

You are correct about 'majority.'  Somewhere between 1 out of three and  one out of 10 will at some period in their lives experience a violent  assault.  The risk is generally higher than emergency medical problems like heart attack and stroke.  'Vast' is probably too loose a term.  With approximately 1,000,000 Americans using firearms each year, over a 30 year period we get (roughly, since some may have to do this more than once) 30 MILLION Americans with experience in  using firearms for self defense.  30/250 yields 12 percent of the population. (Yes, I know that is a REAL rough estimate.  We're closer to 270 million now,  but many of these are minors and should be included etc, thus the percentage if anything is low.)  At any rate, most minority groups in this range are not usually referred  to as 'tiny' minorities, so I don't see how the other part of the group  can be referred to as the 'vast' majority.

From one (absurd) perspective, *all* pain is neurologic, because in the absence of a nervous system, there would not be pain.  From another (tautologic) perspective, any disease is in the domain of the specialty that treats it.  Neurologists treat headache, therefore (at least in the USA) headache is neurologic.  Whether neurologic or not, nobody would disagree that disabling headaches are common.  Perhaps my fee-for-service neurologic colleagues, scrounging for cases, want all the headache patients they can get.  Working on a salary, however, I would rather not fill my office with patients holding their heads in pain.\",\"The following press release was distributed April 1 by NASA Headquarters.  Space Station Redesign Advisory Members Named  Along with Dr. Charles M. Vest, recently named by Vice President Albert Gore to head the advisory committee on the redesign of the Space Station, NASA has announced the names of representatives from government and industry and academic experts from across the country to participate in an independent review of the redesign options being developed by NASA.  \\\"I am extremely honored to have been selected to lead this important review panel. America's future in science and technology and as a world leader in space demands our utmost attention and care,\\\" said Vest. \\\"We have assembled a diverse panel of experts that, I believe, will bring the appropriate measures of insight, integrity and objectivity to this critical task.\\\"  The advisory committee is charged with independently assessing various redesign options of the space station presented by NASA's redesign team, and proposing recommendations to improve efficiency and effectiveness of the space station program. Space station international partners also are being asked to  participate and will be named at a later date. The advisory committee will submit its recommendations in June.  Advisory committee members named today include:  Dr. Charles Vest              Dr. Bobby Alford President, MIT                Executive VP & Dean of Medicine                               Baylor College of Medicine  Mr. Jay Chabrow               Dr. Paul Chu President, JMR Associates     Director, Texas Center for                               Superconductivity                               University of Houston  Dr. Ed Crawley                Dr. John Fabian Prof of Aero & Astro          President & CEO MIT                           ANSER  Maj.

The amounts of methanol formed from the ingestion of aspartame-containing foods are completely in the metabolic noise, since you're forming equally minute amounts of methanol from other components of food all the time.  In studies involving administration of high doses of the additive, blood methanol levels were undetectable. Methanol is a poison only in quantities seen in human poisonings, say 5ml and above.  This is a consequence of its oxidation to formaldehyde and formic acid, two quite reactive compounds which at high enough levels can damage tissues like the retina and kidney, because at such high doses the body's detoxification system is overwhelmed.  Interestingly, one treatment for early methanol poisoning is to get the person drunk on ethyl alcohol--vodka or an equivalent.  That's because ethanol is metabolized preferentially over methanol by the enzymes in the liver. If the methanol stays as methanol and isn't metabolized to formaldehyde, it is actually relatively non-toxic. \",\": >And, while we are on the subject, has a captain ever been traded,  : >resigned, or been striped of his title during the season?

Caleb  And let us not forget that the New Jersey Devils traded captain Kirk Muller for Stephen Richer and Chorske\",\"I can only comment on the Kings, but the most obvious candidate for pleasant surprise is Alex Zhitnik. He came highly touted as a defensive defenseman, but he's clearly much more than that. Great skater and hard shot (though wish he were more accurate). In fact, he pretty much allowed the Kings to trade away that huge defensive liability Paul Coffey. Kelly Hrudey is only the biggest disappointment if you thought he was any good to begin with. But, at best, he's only a mediocre goaltender. A better choice would be Tomas Sandstrom, though not through any fault of his own, but because some thugs in Toronto decided  to threaten his career in order to avoid conceding a goal. Other than that, the award goes to Robert Lang, an uninspiring Czech. Robitaille could easily be MVP, but I'd prefer to give it to Rob Blake who is quietly becoming one of the league's premier defensemen, and if the Kings manage to hold onto him and the  rest of our young defense, it could one day mean that we'll let in fewer goals than Hartford.

I've noticed that when I go out and eat in most of the Chinese food restaurants, I will usually get a slight headache and an ununsual thirst afterwards.  This happens to many of my friends and relatives too.  And, heh, we eat Chinese food all the time at home :) (but we don't use MSG when we're cooking for ourselves)  So, when we put one and one together, it can be safely assumed that MSG may cause some allergic reactions in some people.  Stick with natural things.  MSG doesn't do body any good (and possibly harms, for that matter).  So, why bother with it?  Taste food as it should be tasted, and don't cloud the flavor with an imaginary cloak of MSG.  -michael \",\"Hello netters:)  Does anyone out there know any FTP sites for projects, plans, etc of an electrical nature?    -Jason\",\"Hi,  My friend's 1983 Toyota Tercel accelerates by itself without using the gas peddel.

AA and other 12-step abuse- recovery programs are acknowledged as being among the most effective.  Unfortunately, as evidence for God, this can be dismissed by stating that the same defect of personality makes substance abusers as makes  people 'religious', and the debunker could perhaps acknowledge that being religious is a better crutch than being a drug addict, but still maintain that both are escapism.  (And I suspect that there are some atheists who would find the substance abuse preferable to Christianity.)  I think that an essential problem with communication between Christ- ians and atheists is that as Christians we necessarily see ourselves as incomplete, and needing God (the 'God-shaped hole'), while atheists necessarily see themselves as self-sufficient.  If the atheists are right, Christians are guilty of being morally weak, and too cowardly to stand up for themselves; if the Christians are right, the atheists are guilty of considerable arrogance.

Tanks deployed against civilians, let alone FIRING on them with crew served weaponry (a .50 Heavy Machine Gun is crew-served) is something both our press and government howl about instantly when done in some other country.  Against civilians that have, at most, one-shot-at-a-time LIGHT small arms.  Certainly nothing that places the people in or behind the tank in any real danger.  Molotov coctails?  A round from a rifle or pistol deals with anybody approaching with one of those.  And \\\"snipers\\\" too often turn out to be strays from other cops/guard/army gunfire.  I don't know about the other people in this group (or on the net) but the idea of tanks being used to control civilians, in anything that pretends to be a free society is outrageous.  When Big Government feels it is necessary to use that kind of force to stomp out protests (even violent) of the citizens, that suggests that the government is totally out of control, since that is effectively the government declaring war on its own people.  If the government was living up to its responsibility, government of the people BY THE PEOPLE, not the 'lords' and other elites who want to keep their good thing going, the citizens wouldn't feel the need to be resorting to acts that need to be squashed with a military boot.  People do things like that because they have become convinced that it is the only option that remains, other attempts to have grievances redressed have been ignored.  And yes, there is a criminal element that will exploit this, but the fact remains that the government has been unresponsive or such acts wouldn't be apt to happen.  Still not an excuse to open up on civilians with tanks, heavy machine guns, or whatever. Its the old 'might makes right' philosophy that is the hallmark of a government going rogue:  They don't like it? Tough. We will simply squash them under an iron boot.  Actually addressing their grievances in other than token fashion with huge volumes of hot air is just too inconvenient...  Sort of a variation on mushroom management:  Keep them in the dark, Smother them with shit, and Crush them when ready...  And these are the folks that many liberals are trying to arrange things so that they will have a MONOPOLY on coercive force (firearms that are than expensive toys...) by gutting the Bill of Rights (cuz it just isn't PROGRESSIVE or doesn't fit in with MODERN THINKING anymore)...  Unbelievable.  And I do believe amid the smoke, confusion, etc of a real riot situation, that it would be POSSIBLE for a tank to get away with firing the main gun into a building at close range?  One would hear an explosion among many explosions.  It is loud, but it is not going to stand out like a 1000 pound bomb or a tactical nuke.  There would be a hole blown in the wall, and some rubble, but with tanks knocking over walls, and other sources of buildings turning into rubble, and other covering racket such as gunfire, including 50's tacking away, it would not stand out that much, and could be explained by \\\"musta been a gas leak... \\\".  I think it could be done and not be reported under such conditions - it is POSSIBLE.  It is not like a tank driving down a quiet street on a Sunday afternoon, turning and firing, you know.  THAT would stand out, and be pretty impossible to cover up.   \",\"[..]  This statement simply amazes me!  \\\"Through no fault of ATF, the element of   surprise was lost\\\"!

Tommy Soderstrom will get credit for the shutout, but he barely broke a sweat until the third period as the FLYERS defense kept the Leafs from mounting any serious attack.  Injuries:  Pelle Eklund is day-to-day with a bruised thigh.  Roster Moves:  Jason Bowen was added to the lineup for his first NHL game. Jason was the FLYERS second pick in the first round (15th overall) of the 1992 entry draft. 19 years old, 6'4\\\", 210 lbs. In 62 games with the tri-city Americans he had 10 goals, 12 assists and 219 PIM. He plays left wing and defense, he played defense in this game although Bobby Taylor said that Bill Dineen was planning to use him up front as well.  Andre Faust was returned to Hershey. He actually left after the second period of the Kings game, flew to Albany, got the game tying goal in a Bears OT win, and played again for Hershey Sunday night.  Lines:  Fedyk-Lindros-Recchi Beranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen Lomakin-Butsayev-Conroy Acton-Brown  Galley-McGill Yushkevich-Cronin Carkner-Hawgood Bowen  Tommy Soderstrom in goal.  Acton replaced Lomakin in the 3rd period.  Game Summary:  If the FLYERS played like this every night, they'd be in the playoffs this year. The FLYERS hit everything that moved. They created scoring chance after scoring chance. They snuffed out everything that the Leafs tried to do.  Jason Bowen made a good play on his first NHL shift that almost created a goal. He had the puck in the top of the left offensive circle all alone, but instead of taking the shot he found Brind'Amour crashing the net on the other side. A perfect pass and a good shot across Daren Puppa's body should have been a goal, but Puppa made a great save reading the play.  Garry Galley gave the Maple Leafs 7th ranked power play the first chance when he hooked Doug Gilmour at 4:25. The FLYERS lowly 21st ranked penalty killing unit was almost flawless the entire game, and set the tone on this kill. The Maple Leafs got almost nothing but long unscreened shots, and the defense swept away every rebound.  After the power play, the FLYERS got a goal on an ugly play. Rod Brind'Amour gave the puck to Greg Hawgood at the right point, and he sent a drive at the net. Puppa made the save and kicked the rebound right into the feet of Josef Beranek and Bob Rouse, who were wrestling in the slot. Beranek was able to get his stick on the puck and push it out to Dineen who was skating into the slot from the right circle, and he lifted a backhander over Puppa for a 1-0 FLYERS lead at 8:10.  The FLYERS kept the pressure on, and Puppa was the only Leaf keeping the FLYERS from building on their lead for a while. Eventually things settled down and defense prevailed. Each team got an occasional scoring chance, but the goalies were strong. Bowen started giving some Lindros-like checks in his own corners. Then Lindros, who was looking to avenge a hit Foligno gave him, thought he had a chance to even the score. He had Foligno lined up at center ice, leaned into him, and rode him into the center ice boards. The only problem was that Foligno was a little far from the boards, and Mike \\\"Mister\\\" McGeough felt that it warranted a boarding call at 15:38  The Leafs couldn't get anything going on the power play as the FLYERS were very aggressive (for a change) on the kill.  With time running out in the period, Recchi carried through the neutral zone and handed to Lindros as they approached the Leaf's blue line. They were in a crowd with Wendell Clark and Jamie Macoun, Lindros tried a backhand pass to Recchi through the feet of Macoun that connected to Recchi, but then Clark checked Recchi off the puck. Macoun then tried to clear, but it was weak and went right to McGill who had manned the point. He drove it from just inside the blue line. Macoun got his stick on it and deflected it past his own goalie at 19:55.1. Shots were 13-8 FLYERS in the period.  The FLYERS finally got their first chance on the power play when Dave Andreychuk tripped up Rod Brind'Amour in his offensive zone. During the power play, the FLYERS got cheated a little when the puck popped up into the air and Eric gloved it down, but McGeough thought it hit his stick above his head. We could see from our seats at the other end of the ice that it only hit his glove and the replay confirmed, but the faceoff went to the other end. As time was running out in the advantage, Lindros found Galley with a pass across the goal mouth but Puppa made the save. The rebound kicked back to the right corner where Recchi picked it up, passed it out to Eric crashing through the right circle, and Eric one-timed past Puppa at 7:55. With the assist, Recchi moves past Bobby Clarke's 74-75 season, the second best one season total for a FLYER at 117.  Eric moves up to 4th all time in FLYERS rookie scoring with 67 points.  Mike Eastwood took down Al Conroy at 8:30 to give the FLYERS another chance on the power play. Not much pressure before Garry Galley ended the power play with a slash at 9:19. Not much happened on the 4 on 4, although the Leafs had most of the possession. The FLYERS smothered the Leafs short power play. Tempers flared a little at 13:14. Bowen and Pearson got roughing minors, Keith Acton got a bloody face. Dave McLlwain then took a dive and got Greg Hawgood a hooking minor at 13:46 to set up a 4 on 3. The replay showed that Hawgood's stick stopped making contact with McLlwain long before he spun around and fell. Again the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play, led by Dimitri Yushkevich. Bowen made a thundering hit when he came out of the box on Pearson. Berehowski tried to perplex everybody with his sloooowball. He had the puck at the point, and just trickled a pass down the slot. He made all the FLYERS look silly as nobody could get a stick on it, and it got to Gilmour at the side of the net, but Soderstrom stoned him.  The FLYERS picked things up offensively after the kill was over, but didn't get anything home. Shots were 13-10 FLYERS.  The FLYERS were content with the 3 goal lead in the third period, and they decided that if Tommy wanted a shutout, he was going to have to work for it a little.  The FLYERS got most of the scoring chances in the first 7 or so minutes of the period, but couldn't get past Puppa. Then the Leafs got tired of Lindros making road kill out of them, and tempers flared. 2 each for Doug Gilmour and Lindros  (unsportsmanlike conduct) and 2 each for Glenn Anderson and McGill (roughing) all at 7:02. Terry Carkner then took a kneeing penalty at 7:51 on Gilmour.  Again the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play.  At about the 12 minute mark, Dave Andreychuk got a shot away from his left circle that got through Soderstrom. The puck was rolling on it's side, and as luck would have it it turned away from the net instead of turning towards it (think of how a rolling quarter inevitably starts to lean one way or the other). Seconds later Rod Brind'Amour tripped up Gilmour at 12:24 to give the Leafs another chance on the power play. On the advantage, after Soderstrom stoned Andreychuk while lying down, Andreychuk got the rebound through Soderstrom, but from behind the net and it went straight through and was swept away by one of his defensemen. They kept the pressure on, but Soderstrom was equal and preserved the shutout.  Recchi cross checked Ken Baumgartner to get tempers hot and start a brawl at 16:01. No punches thrown, Recchi got the initial minor, Krushelnyski Baumgartner and Lindros each got roughing minors. At 17:02 Rouse and Beranek expressed their mutual dislike for each other and got 2 each for slashing to set up another 4 on 4. Mike Eastwood shoved down Ryan McGill in the FLYERS zone as they were battling for the puck, and while McGill was down he ran his stick across McGill's face. The FLYERS were not happy with that at all. 5-8 Al Conroy paired up with 6-1 Berehowski, and started throwing punches. Upward. Well, Al held his own, much to the delight of the crowd. Each got a couple punches in before going down in a head, and Al got a standing O! Penalties: Eastwood 5 (cross check) + game, Clark, Carkner 10 each. Berehowski and Conroy 5 each (fighting) at 17:49.  So a major penalty for the rest of the game for the FLYERS. The had no interest in stting on the lead. Hawgood, Galley and Brind'Amour played catch until Hawgood found Dineen all alone in the left circle, he controlled the puck and blasted it past Puppa at 18:39.  That was all the fireworks, Tommy Soderstrom would not face another shot. Puppa did, but kept the FLYERS off the board. 4-0 FLYERS, shots were 9-8 FLYERS in the 3rd. Probably the strongest game I've seen from the FLYERS since the All Star break. Shutout number 4 for Soderstrom, all since 1/10. Tied for 2nd most in the NHL, but he's played fewer games than Belfour (6) or the goalie I can't remember that he's tied with.  Next up it's the Winnipeg Selannes Tuesday night in Winnipeg. The FLYERS cannot be eliminated if they win, but a loss coupled with an Islander win that night in Washington would be the official end.  FLYERS up to 71 points on the season in 78 games. Last year they had 75 points in 80 games (5 under .500), so they need at least 8 points in their last 6 games to improve on that only by percentage points (5 under in 84 is better than 5 under in 80).  Tragic number holds at 3 points with 6 games left. The tragic number for 5th is 5 points, I watched the Rangers blow a 4-2 third period lead at home to lose 5-4 before I finished this up. Why 5 points instead of 4? Well, the FLYERS will win the tie-breaker if they catch them, whereas the Islanders win tie breakers against the FLYERS and so need only a tie. The Rangers could crumble down the stretch as they play the Devils, the Pens twice, the FLYERS, and finish up with 2 games against the Caps. So I guess 5th place could be the goal for the team to focus on.

One mechanism is the mailing list, in which mail is sent to a central     distribution point which relays it to all recipients of the list. In     addition to the general lists for space (called SPACE Digest for     Internet users, and SPACE on BITNET), there are a number of more     specialized mailing lists described below.      A second mechanism is Usenet 'netnews'. This is somewhat like a bulletin     board operating on each system which is a part of the net. Netnews     separates contributions into hundreds of different categories based on a     'group name'. The groups dealing most closely with space topics are     called 'sci.space.news', 'sci.space', 'sci.space.shuttle', 'sci.astro',     and 'talk.politics.space'. Contributors 'post' submissions (called     'articles' in netnews terminology) on their local machine, which sends     it to other nearby machines. Similarly, articles sent from nearby     machines are stored locally and may be forwarded to other systems, so     that an article is posted locally and eventually reaches all the Usenet     sites interested in receiving the news group to which the article was     posted.      Gateway machines redirect the Usenet sci.space group into Internet and     BITNET mailing lists and vice versa; the other Usenet groups are not     accessible as mailing lists. If you can receive netnews, its more     flexible interface and access to a wider range of material usually make     it the preferred option.  MAILING LISTS      SPACE Digest is the main Internet list, and is now being run by the     International Space University (in only its second change of management     in over a decade). Email space-request@isu.isunet.edu (message body     should be in the format 'subscribe space John Public') to join. Note     that the moderated SPACE Magazine list is defunct at present for lack of     a moderator. Old copies of SPACE Digest since its inception in 1981 are     available by anonymous FTP. Retrieve  julius.cs.qub.ac.uk:pub/SpaceDigestArchive/README     for further details.      Elements is a moderated list for fast distribution of Space Shuttle     Keplerian Elements before and during Shuttle flights. NASA two line     elements are sent out on the list from Dr. Kelso, JSC, and other sources     as they are released. Email to elements-request@telesoft.com to join.      GPS Digest is a moderated list for discussion of the Global Positioning     System and other satellite navigation positioning systems. Email to     gps-request@esseye.si.com to join.      Space-investors is a list for information relevant to investing in     space-related companies. Email Vincent Cate (vac@cs.cmu.edu) to join.

SEDSNEWS is a BITNET list for news items, press releases, shuttle status     reports, and the like. This duplicates material which is also found in     Space Digest, sci.space, sci.space.shuttle, and sci.astro. Email     LISTSERV@TAMVM1.BITNET saying \\\"SUBSCRIBE SEDSNEWS your name\\\" to join.     Email saying \\\"INDEX SEDSNEWS\\\" to list the archive contents.

As a general note, please mail to the *request* address to get off a     mailing list. SPACE Digest, for example, relays many inappropriate     'please remove me from this list' messages which are sent to the list     address rather than the request address.  PERIODICALLY UPDATED INFORMATION      In addition to this FAQ list, a broad variety of topical information is     posted to the net (unless otherwise noted, in the new group     sci.space.news created for this purpose). Please remember that the     individuals posting this information are performing a service for all     net readers, and don't take up their time with frivolous requests.

I suppose he was going to kill a bunch of people with them? --Ray Cote\",\" Indeed, if the color teal on a team's uniforms is any indication of the future, the Marlins are in dire trouble! Refer to the San Jose Sharks for proof... But I have hope for the Marlins. I was a sometime member of the Rene Lachemann fan club at the Oakland Coliseum, and have a deep respect for the guy. He's a gem. And, of course, Walt Weiss gives that franchise class. But yeah... whoever designed those uniforms was guilty of a paucity of style and imagination. Ugghhh!\",\" That's ridiculous!   They aren't designed, they evolved.  And, much as it discomforts us, in humans a trouble-free birth process was sacrificed to increased brain and cranial size.  Wild animals have a much easier time with birth than humans do. Domestic horses and cows typically have a worse time.  To give you an idea: my family tree is complicated because a few of my pioneer great-great- grandfathers had several wives, and we never could figure out which wife had each child.  One might ask why this happened.  My great-great- grandfathers were, by the time they reached their forties, quite prosperous farmers.  Nonetheless, they lost several wives each to the rigors of childbirth; the graveyards in Spencer, Indiana, and Boswell, North Dakota, contain quite a few gravestones like \\\"Ida, wf. of Jacob Liptrap, and baby, May 6, 1853.\\\"   More like one in ten.  And the consequences can be devastating; I have direct experience of more than a dozen victims of a fouled-up breech birth.   It isn't always fatal.  But it is often fatal, when it happens out of reach of adequate help.  More often, it permanently damages one's health.  Clearly women's bodies _evolved_ to give birth (I am no believer in divine design); however, evolution did not favor trouble-free births for humans.     My, aren't we wroth!  I haven't read a more outrageous straw man attack in months!  I can practically see your mouth foam.  We're statistically sophisticated enough to balance the risks.  Although I can't produce exact statistics 5 years after the last time we looked them up, rest assured that we balanced C-section risks against other risks. I wouldn't encourage my wife to have a Caesarean unless it was clearly indicated; on the other hand, I am opposed (on obvious grounds) to waiting until an emergency to give in.  And bear this in mind: my wife took the lead in all of these decisions. We talked things over, and I did a lot of the leg work, but the main decisions were really hers.   I don't know of very many home birth advocates, even, that think that a first-time mother should have her baby at home.   But people should bother to find out the relative risks.  My wife was unwilling to take any significant risks in order to have nice surroundings. In view of the intensity of the birth experience, I doubt surroundings have much importance anyway.  Somehow the values you're advocating seem all lopsided to me: taking risks, even if fairly small, of serious permanent harm in order to preserve something that is, after all, an esthetic consideration.\",\"  Yup, you said it.  I admire such honesty. ;-)   Fire an Anschutz .22, then come back and talk to us.  You're letting ignorance and possibly fear cloud your thinking.  Either that, or this is sour grapes because we beat you in the Olympic shooting events. Funny, you'd think biathalon would be a natural sport for the norse. ;-)   Precisely.  That makes them the best method of defense for the citizenry. Not everybody has the time to train with a gladius, you know, but for some reason those who prey on others seem to have more free time.  To extend this a bit further, you need only a certain level of competence to beat another with a range weapon.  Getting in their face with a weapon and winning is much more difficult, and requires more training time the average citizen just does not have.  I've spent a few years practicing with a sword.  I can take the common person armed with one (though self-defense isn't the reason I own one).  My kid sister would have an even chance of beating me, gun vs. gun, with only a month of training.  That makes firearms much better, in our eyes.   Excellent point.  Perhaps you aren't so naive after all?   Taken into consideration in what respect?  Though quite wrong, let's make it a blanket statement for weapons in general.  This has been taken into consideration.  We call use of them aggrivated assault, assault with a deadly weapon, assault with intent to kill, attempted murder, and a whole host of others, and tack on extra prison time.   In Norway I suspect it was about the only weapon available.  You conquered your land (among others) a full millenia before we were thought of, and shortly thereafter weapons weren't quite so common.  I suspect that a few world wars made a difference too, since in times of emergency weapons tend to be turned in or donated to needy causes.  I'm curious, though, were the weapons used in the crimes bought shortly before the crime, or were they aquired by other means?  Any requirements other than just registering the shotgun?   \\\"Come on down to honest Erik's Used Swords!  Here's a slightly-used short sword, *THE* battlefield supremacy weapon of the eleventh century!  Only $39.95 with trade-in.  Easy financing!\\\"  Sorry, I couldn't resist.  You guys still slicing each other with long knives, or is this really not a problem?   I'm all for that.  What gets me is that scandanavians (and yes, I'm only a couple generations off the longship) used to be some of the most feared warriors on the planet a mere millenia ago, yet now seem to spend their time sitting in spas and doing a bit of topless sunbathing. Maybe you had a bit more time, and a more homogeneous culture, to become civilized with?   Yes.  We're too damned violent, partially I believe because we are not a homogeneous culture and don't identify ourselves as \\\"Americans\\\" first and foremost.  I'm rather proud of my Norwegian and Danish heritage, whereas I suspect you couldn't care less about that 2% Welsh blood in your veins thanks to a raid in Ireland back in 1055?  The time scale and the homogeneous culture are important.  Equally important is a basic philosophical difference in personal versus collective good. In America, the individual is more important than the masses.  Personal liberties are prized above all.  This is, sadly, changing of late, but I trust you notice how this call for freedom makes laws that restrict individuals for little collective benefit hateful to Americans.  I'd hazard a guess that, were America less interested in freedom and personal liberty and more interested in collective good we never would have sent our armed forces anywhere.  One poor effect of this culture we have is that we're looking out for ourselves and it is quite easy to identify with only a small segment of the population.  My grandmother tells of being discriminated against back in Denmark because she spoke \\\"low Dane,\\\" whereas others spoke \\\"high Dane.\\\"  It was shortly after World War II, as I remember, that \\\"low Dane\\\" was abolished so there was one common dialect.  We cannot fathom such a minor thing being a problem, because we have even more obvious means of identifying an \\\"outsider.\\\"   Take heart, yours is better than 90% of what gets posted by native speakers.

President Clinton's Remarks On Waco With Q/A  To: National Desk  Contact: White House Office of the Press Secretary, 202-456-2100     WASHINGTON, April 20 /U.S. Newswire/ -- Following are remarks by President Clinton in a question and answer session with the press (Part 2 of 2):       Go ahead, Sarah.       Q  There are two questions I want to ask you.  The first is, I think that they knew very well that the children did not have gas masks while the adults did, so the children had no chance because this gas was very -- she said it was not lethal, but it was very dangerous to the children and they could not have survived without gas masks.  And on February 28th -- let's go back -- didn't those people have a right to practice their religion?       THE PRESIDENT:  They were not just practicing their religion, they were -- the Treasury Department believed that they had violated federal laws, any number of them.       Q  What federal laws --       THE PRESIDENT:  Let me go back and answer -- I can't answer the question about the gas masks, except to tell you that the whole purpose of using the tear gas was that it had been tested; they were convinced that it wouldn't kill either a child or an adult but it would force anybody that breathed it to run outside.  And one of the things that I've heard -- I don't want to get into the details of this because I don't know -- but one of the things that they were speculating about today was that the wind was blowing so fast that the windows might have been opened and some of the gas might have escaped and that may be why it didn't have the desired effect.       They also knew, Sarah, that there was an underground compound -- a bus buried underground where the children could be sent.  And they were -- I think they were hoping very much that if the children were not released immediately outside that the humane thing would be done and that the children would be sent someplace where they could be protected.       In terms of the gas masks themselves, I learned yesterday -- I did not ask this fact question before -- that the gas was supposed to stay active in the compound longer than the gas masks themselves were to work.  So that it was thought that even if they all had gas masks, that eventually the gas would force them out in a nonviolent, nonshooting circumstance.       MS. MYERS:  Last question.       Q  Mr. President, why are you still saying that --       Q  Could you tell us whether or not you ever asked Janet Reno about the possibility of a mass suicide?  And when you learned about the actual fire and explosion what went through your mind during those horrendous moments?       THE PRESIDENT:  What I asked Janet Reno is if they had considered all the worse things that could happen.  And she said -- and, of course, the whole issue of suicide had been raised in the public -- he had -- that had been debated anyway.  And she said that the people who were most knowledgeable  about these kinds of issues concluded that there was no greater risk of that now than there would be tomorrow or the next day or the day after that or at anytime in the future.  That was the judgment they made.  Whether they were right or wrong, of course, we will never know.       What happened when I saw the fire, when I saw the building burning?  I was sick.  I felt terrible.  And my immediate concern was whether the children had gotten out and whether they were escaping or whether they were inside, trying to burn themselves up. That's the first thing I wanted to know.       Thank you.       Q  Mr. President, why are you still saying it was a Janet Reno decision?  Isn't it, in the end, your decision?       THE PRESIDENT:  Well, what I'm saying is that I didn't have a four- or five-hour, detailed briefing from the FBI.  I didn't go over every strategic part of it.  It is a decision for which I take responsibility.  I'm the President of the United States and I signed off on the general decision and giving her the authority to make the last call.  When I talked to her on Sunday, some time had elapsed.  She might have made a decision to change her mind.  I said, if you decide to go forward with this tomorrow, I will support you. And I do support her.       She is not ultimately responsible to the American people; I am.  But I think she has conducted her duties in an appropriate fashion and she has dealt with this situation I think as well as she could have.       Thank you.

Was the crucification the will of God or a tragic mistake.  I believe it was a tragic mistake.  God's will can never be accomplished through the disbelief of man.  Jesus came to this world to build the kingdom of heaven on the earth.  He desperately wanted the Jewish people to accept him as the Messiah.  If the crucification was the will of God how could Jesus pray that this cup pass from him.  Was this out of weakness.  NEVER.  Many men and women have given their lives for their country or other noble causes. Is Jesus less than these.  No he is not.  He knew the crucification was NOT the will of GOD.  God's will was that the Jewish people accept Jesus as the Messiah and that the kingdom of Heaven be established on the earth with Jesus as it's head. (Just like the Jewish people expected). If this had happened 2000 years ago can you imagine what kind of world we would live in today.  It would be a very different world.  And that is eactly what GOD wanted.  Men and women of that age could have been saved by following the living Messiah while he was on the earth.  Jesus could have established a sinless lineage that would have continued his reign after his ascension to the spiritual world to live with GOD.  Now the kingdom of heaven on the earth will have to wait for Christ's return.  But when he returns will he be recognized and will he find faith on this earth.  Isn't it about time for his return.  It's been almost 2000 years.  Mike    And the two simplest refutations are these:  (1)  What impact?  The only record of impact comes from the New Testament. I have no guarantee that its books are in the least accurate, and that the recorded \\\"impact\\\" actually happened.  I find it interesting that no other contemporary source records an eclipse, an earthquake, a temple curtain being torn, etc.  The earliest written claim we have of Jesus' resurrection is from the Pauline epistles, none of which were written sooner than 20 years after the supposed event.  (2)  It seems probable that no one displayed the body of Jesus because no one knew where it was.  I personally believe that the most likely explanation was that the body was stolen (by disciples, or by graverobbers). Don't bother with the point about the guards ... it only appears in one gospel, and seems like exactly the sort of thing early Christians might make up in order to counter the grave-robbing charge.  The New Testament does record that Jews believed the body had been stolen.  If there were really guards, they could not have effectively made this claim, as they did.\",\" Paul,  Unfortunately, there are not too many retail outlets that'll stock just about every chip made.  The stuff they will stock are the ones that'll sell, like standard DRAM's, 80386's, 68000's, etc,etc. i.e.  I cna't think of any 'one-stop-shopping' store.  The closest you can get is to pick up a copy of Byte magazine or the Circuit Cellar, Popular Electronics, and the like and flip through them.  Distributors like Wyle Electronics, Hamilton Avnet, Pioneer Electronics, etc, etc, don't normally deal with end-users like ourselves where we only a couple of everything...they only deal with people who buy by the hundreds or more.  Each distributor represents and sells a variety of different non-competing manufacturers.  What do I mean by this? Suppose ABC Electronics sells Intel 80386's.  It's a pretty good bet that they won't be selling any of AMD's 386's, or vice-versa. They also can obtain just about *any* chip you want from a manufacturer they represent.  Who knows?  You might be lucky to be able to buy from one of them. But I'd be suprised if you do.  ALso bear in mind that the 1 or 2 qty prices they will charge you will be *much* greater than what a mail order outlet will charge.  My advice?  If you're gonna be designing anything, try to stick with off-the-shelf stuff.  You're going to get stuck if you use too many esoteric parts sooner or later.  good luck,\",\"NHL RESULTS FOR GAMES PLAYED 4/14/93.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                   STANDINGS       PATRICK              ADAMS              NORRIS              SMYTHE  TM    W  L  T  PT   TM    W  L  T  PT   TM    W  L  T  PT   TM    W  L  T  PT   xPIT  56 21  7 119  xBOS  51 26  7 109  xCHI  46 25 12 104  xVAN  45 29  9  99 yWAS  42 34  7  91  yQUE  47 27 10 104  yDET  46 28  9 101  yCAL  42 30 11  95 yNJ   40 36  7  87  yMON  48 30  6 102  yTOR  44 28 11  99  yLA   39 34 10  88 yNYI  39 37  7  85  yBUF  38 35 10  86   STL  36 36 11  83  yWIN  39 37  7  85  PHL  34 37 11  79   HAR  26 51  6  58   MIN  36 37 10  82   EDM  26 49  8  60  NYR  34 38 11  79   OTT  10 70  4  24   TB   23 53  7  53   SJ   11 70  2  24  x - Clinched Division Title y - Clinched Playoff Berth  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Boston Bruins    (51-26-7)   2   2   0   -   4 Ottawa Senators  (10-70-4)   0   1   1   -   2  1st period: BOS, Roberts 5 - (Juneau) 7:19      BOS, Wiemer 1 - (Juneau, Oates) 17:47  2nd period: BOS, Neely 11 - (Juneau, Murphy) 6:10      BOS, Hughes 5 - (Richer, Kimble) 7:55      OTT, Archibald 9 - (Rumble, Lamb) 11:37     3rd period: OTT, Boschman 9 - (Kudelski) 5:10  Powerplay Opportunities-Bruins   0 of 2    Senators 0 of 4  Shots on Goal- Bruins    13  11  10  -  34   Senators   5   9  12  -  26  Boston Bruins--Moog (36-14-3) (8 shots - 8 saves)  Blue (9:38 second)          (18 shots - 16 saves) Ottawa Senators--Sidorkiewicz (8-46-3) (27 shots - 23 saves)  Berthiaume    (6:36 third) (7 shots - 7 saves)  ATT-10,500  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Washington Capitals   (42-34-7)   0   0   2   -   2 New York Rangers     (34-38-11)   0   0   0   -   0  1st period: NONE  2nd period: NONE  3rd period: WAS, Bondra 36 - (Pivonka, Cavallini) 6:54      WAS, Bondra 37 - (Cote, Pivonka) 10:10  Powerplay Opportunities-Capitals 0 of 2    Rangers  0 of 1  Shots on Goal- Capitals  16  11  12  -  39   Rangers    8   7   8  -  23  Washington Capitals--Tabaracci (7-11-0) (23 shots - 23 saves) New York Rangers--Richter (13-17-3) (39 shots - 37 saves)  ATT-17,897  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  New York Islanders  (39-37-7)   2   1   1   0   -   4 Hartford Whalers    (26-51-6)   2   1   1   1   -   5  1st period: NYI, Ferraro 13 - (Malakhov, King) 1:29      NYI, Hogue 32 - (Thomas, Turgeon) 1:57      HAR, Yake 21 - (Poulin) 4:15      HAR, Yake 22 - (Nylander, Poulin) 16:44  2nd period: HAR, Verbeek 39 - (Cassels, Weinrich) (pp) 2:43      NYI, Thomas 35 - (King, Ferraro) 7:58  3rd period: HAR, Burt 5 - (Sanderson, Cassels) 13:41      NYI, Malakhov 14 - (Hogue) 17:45  Overtime:   HAR, Janssens 12 - (Poulin) 1:08  Powerplay Opportunities-Islanders 0 of 3    Whalers   1 of 3  Shots on Goal- Islanders  16   8   7   1  -  32   Whalers     7  13   7   1  -  28  New York Islanders--Fitzpatrick (16-15-5) (28 shots - 23 saves) Hartford Whalers--Lenaduzzi (1-0-1) (32 shots - 28 saves)  ATT-10,915  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Pittsburgh Penguins  (56-21-7)   2   3   1   0   -   6 New Jersey Devils    (40-36-7)   2   4   0   0   -   6  1st period: PIT, Daniels 5 - (Needham, Tippett) 4:14      NJD, C.Lemieux 29 - (Semak, Driver) 10:19      PIT, K.Stevens 55 - (Tocchet, Murphy) (pp) 12:40      NJD, Zelepukin 22 - (Driver, Niedermayer) 17:26  2nd period: PIT, M.Lemieux 68 - (Stevens, Tocchet) 1:42      NJD, Semak 36 - (C.Lemieux, Zelepukin) 2:27      PIT, McEachern 28 - (Jagr, Barrasso) 4:24      NJD, S.Stevens 12 - (Guerin, Pellerin) 5:45      PIT, M.Lemieux 69 - (sh) 12:40      NJD, Richer 37 - (Nicholls) 15:53      NJD, C.Lemieux 30 - (Semak, Zelepukin) 17:40  3rd period: PIT, Mullen 33 - (Jagr, M.Lemieux) 18:54  Overtime:   NONE  Powerplay Opportunities-Penguins 1 of 5    Devils   0 of 3  Shots on Goal- Penguins   9  11   8   2  -  30   Devils    12  15   9   3  -  39  Pittsburgh Penguins--Barrasso (43-14-5) (39 shots - 33 saves) New Jersey Devils--Billington (21-14-4) (30 shots - 24 saves)  ATT-14,796  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \",\"Your \\\"lite\\\" posting for the day, from rec.humor.funny:  -- \",\" ajteel@dendrite.cs.Colorado.EDU (A.J.

To paraphrase Sartre, the particular is absurd unless it has an infinite reference point.  It is only because of God's own revelation that we can be absolute about a thing.  Your logic comes to fruition in relativism.    Ah, now it is clear.  Ludwig was a desciple of Russell. Ludwig's fame is often explained by the fact that he spawned not one but two significant movements in contemporary philosophy. Both revolve around Tractatus Logico-Philosphicus ('21) and Philosophical Investigation ('53).  Many of Witt's comments and implicit conclusions suggest ways of going beyond the explicit critique of language he offers.  According to some of the implicit suggestions of Witt's thought, ordinary language is an invaluable resource, offering a necessary framework for the conduct of daily life.  However, though its formal features remain the same, its content does not and it is always capable of being transcended as our experience changes and our understanding is deepened, giving us a clearer picture of what we are and what we wish to say.  On Witt's own account, there is a dynamic fluidity of language.   It is for this reason that any critique of language must move from talking about the limits of language to talking about its boundaries, where a boundary is understood not as a wall but a threshold.   vonWrights's comment that Witt's \\\"sentences have a content that often lies deep beneath the surface of language.\\\"  On the surface, Witt talks of the insuperable position of ordinary language and the necessity of bringing ourselves to accept it without question.  At the same time, we are faced with Witt's own creative uses of language and his concern for bringing about changes in our traditional modes of understanding.  Philosophy, then, through more perspicacious speech, seeks to effect this unity rather than assuming that it is already functioning. Yes?  The most brilliant of scientists are unable to offer a foundation for human speech so long as they reject Christianity! In his Tractatus we have the well nigh perfect exhibition of the nature of the impasse of the scientific ideal of exhaustive logical analysis of Reality by man.  Perfect language does not exist for fallen man, therefore we must get on about our buisness of relating Truth via ordinary language.    This is why John's Gospel is so dear to most Christians.  It is so simple in it conveyance of the revealation of God, yet so full of unlieing depth of understanding.  He viewed Christ from the OT concept of \\\"as a man thinketh, so he is.\\\"  John looked at the outward as only an indicator of what was inside, that is the consciousness of Christ.  And so must we.  Words are only vehicals of truth.  He is truth.  The scriptures are plain in their expounding that there is a Truth and that it is knowable.  THere are absolutes, and they too are knowable.  However, they are only knowable when He reveals them to the individual.  There is, and we shouldn't shy from this, a mysticism to Christianity.  Paul in ROm 8 says there are 3 men in the world.  There is the one who does not have the Spirit and therefore can not know the things of the Spirit (the Spirit of Truth) and there is the one who has the Spirit and has the capacity to know of the Truth, but there  is the third.  THe one who not only has the Spirit, but that the Spirit has him! Who can know the deep things of God and reveal them to us other than the Spirit.  And it is only the deep things of GOd that are absolute and true.    There is such a thing as true truth and it is real, it can be experienced and it is verifiable.  I disagree with Dr Nancy's Sweetie's conclusion because if it is taken to fruition it leads to relativism which leads to dispair.    \\\"I would know the words which He would answer me, and understand what He would say unto me.\\\"  Job 23ff  --Rex\",\"Adam Benson Mt. Pearl, NF adamb@garfield.cs.mun.ca   \",\"1. Do a straight encryption of your keyrings and put the         results with misleading names somewhere they won't be noticed         (eg. in the \\\\windows directory; nobody knows what half those         files are).       2. Do a straight encryption of a .BAT file that will decrypt         the keyrings to RAMdisk and will set PGPPATH to point at it.       3. Set up another .BAT file to decrypt and execute the first         (again on RAM disk). Have it take the name of the target file         as an argument so that there is no link between this file and         the (non-existent) batch file referred to by the rest of the         system. Comment it so it looks like a test script for fooling         around with PGP. Set PGPPATH to the PGP directory.       4. Leave the original keyrings that came with PGP in the         directory with PGP; a good indication that you are playing         with, but haven't made serious use of PGP. Add a set of keys         with your name and a really simple passphrase. Never use it,         or use it as your widely published key for low-security         e-mail.       5. When needed, run the second .BAT file. Make sure all         intermediate and plainfiles are generated on RAMdisk.       6. When you hear the concussion grenade, hit the power switch.

He seemed to be a very viable setup guy - but I guess that's not considered that crucial by the club.  I can just remember two years ago so well, though... ...  I'm not that concerned.  Those guys have been relatively consistent over the years and they have no good reasons to decline (no injuries, not old, ...). I expect them to come through just fine.  It's those guys that have not been consistently good that are the worrisome part, even if they are coming through right now.  This sounds like their old road unis.  Pretty dull.

Pb: I want to bring in this (2nd hand, neat price):  - Maxtor XT-B380E (~330M, <15ms, BIOS type 1, ctrller manages   the real geom: 1630cyl, 8hds, 52spt)  - Western Digital WD1007V-SE1 ESDI ctrller: no floppies.   (jumpers set IRQ 14/15, hw port addr 1F0/170,   and BIOS addr CC00/C800, and other floppy/format stuff)  Goal: have the WD ESDI as a secondary/controller and have both disks  simultaneously working. Being able to boot from the ESDI too would be  a nice bonus but is not expected.  Ultimate goal: have room for Linux et al. Ex of scheme I have in mind: boot from IDE (HD or floppy) and mount the ESDI as root. Not booting from ESDI, or even from HD, is acceptable.  I have tried numerous (all!!) combinations to no avail. They work alone, or can coexist witout hang-ups but can't access the ESDI or the IDE,  depending on setup/jumpers.  Useful suggestions might be: - How do I tell the BIOS setup about two ctrllers (I guess the 2nd HD is expected to hang off the same ctrller as the 1st). - Do I need some driver to make it work? - --- \\\" --- some new BIOS/chip for any of these cards? - do I have to buy another controller to make them HDs happy? IDE is cheaper; ESDI is hard to find and rather costly. I'm not  rich or I wouldnt' try to scavenge around, so soft slns are preferred. - adapters of some sort; I can hold a soldering iron, and can change a chip or put a jumper!  Also useful: - BBS or Hot-line of Western Digital. - ftp archives with relevant info. - expert stores in Toronto, Ontario area (that would be a miracle! haven't seen any really knowledgeable ppl in a while) - any hints into inner workings of the system ...  - anything else that helped you in similar situations (prayers :-) )  Direct or posted replies are ok.  Many thanks,    Cat.\",\" [lines deleted]   This list appears to imply, that MS-windows that has a cost listed above at $70, comes with a C compiler, C++ and Fortran. It does not, of course. These are expensive add-ons that drive the price WAY beyond $70. ( I don't know if the same applies to OS/2 )  As far as unix is concerned; There is a free unix, linux, that has cc, ~c++, fortran ( f2c ), Xwindows and many other features besides, with a large number of utilities that can be optionally added. And there is also a free 386BSD I believe. Both these unix's are quite robust.

(It was a few months before _The Abyss_ came out.) As far as I can remember, they mentioned three things that were difficult to do at once with a substitute breathing fluid:   - low viscosity --- if it's too difficult to force the fluid in & out      of the lungs, you can't extract enough oxygen to power your own     breathing effort (let alone anything else)    - diffusion rate --- obviously, not all the air in your lungs is     expelled when you breathe out; and the part that isn't expelled     is the part that's nearest the walls of the alveoli. (alveolus?)     So the trip from the blood vessels to the new air has to be done     by diffusion of the gas through the fluid. Apparently oxygen     tends to diffuse more readily than CO2, so even if you can get enough     oxygen in, you might not be able to get enough CO2 out.    - oxygen/CO2 capacity --- you have to be able to dissolve enough     gas per unit volume.     Oh, and of course, your new breathing fluid must not irritate the lungs or interfere with their healing or anything like that...  \",\" Please don't misuse newsgroup hierarchy names as distributions.

The drives are not listed in the cdrom-faq and therefor, please give your opinions on the drives, i've got the impression that they're not all SCSI.

EDT                     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I guess I'm just prepared to take  questions today.              Q   George, Bob Dole says that the Clinton  administration's policy on Bosnia is a failure and that he wants the  United States to take the lead in lifting the arms embargo so that  the Bosnian Muslims can defend themselves.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As you know, President Clinton has  said that that suggestion is under active consideration.  Obviously,  this is a tragic situation in Bosnia.  And if the Bosnian Serbs don't  come to the negotiating table in a constructive way, we'll look  seriously at pressing for lifting the arms embargo.  In the meantime,  we're going to continue to press for a tough sanctions resolution in  the U.N.  We're going to continue to work on the Serbs to come to the  negotiating table.  But the prospect of an arms embargo is something  the President certainly will consider if the Serbs don't come to the  table.              Q   How much longer are you going to give them to come  to the table, George?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're working on that right now.              Q   It's been a long time.              Q   On February 19th, the President mentioned the value  added tax in Ohio.  And when he was asked about it later by  reporters, he said -- quote -- \\\"That is a radical change in the tax  system of the United States.  It's something I think we may have to  look at in the years ahead.\\\"  Questioned again about it later he  says, \\\"It is not something that is now under consideration.  If we  start considering it, I'll tell you.\\\"  It wasn't a trial balloon or  anything, he said.  I was just discussing the tax response to a  question.  Donna Shalala, quoted in USA Today this morning -- quote - - \\\"Certainly we're looking at a VAT.\\\"  What's gone on?              Q   The same with Alice Rivlin this morning.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The health care task force is  reviewing a number of options.  They haven't made any decisions yet.   And as I have said from this podium time and time again, we're not  going to comment on decisions that haven't been made.              Q   But you have also said from this podium time and  time again --              Q   Wait a minute.  Whoa, Nelly.  Whoa.                Q      that that was not under consideration.              Q   Yes.  Clinton says, \\\"It is not something that is  now under consideration.\\\"  Is that no longer true?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe the working group, as Ms.  Shalala says, has looked at this prospect, but no decisions have been  made of any kind.              Q   Well, I know.  But he said he'd tell us about it if  it was ever under consideration.  I take it that now he is and he  didn't tell us about it or --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Did he say if it was under  consideration or if it was something to be proposed?              Q   \\\"If we start considering I'll tell you.\\\"              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  If it's something to be proposed?              Q   \\\"If we start considering it, I'll tell you.\\\"   That's a direct quote.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The task force has looked at a  number of different options.  They have not made any decisions yet.   The President has not made any decisions yet.  This is -- one of the  proposals under consideration by the task force was to go out and  cast as wide a net as possible for different ideas on how to reform  the health care system.  They have cast a very wide net.  They have  looked at hundreds of different proposals -- probably thousands of  different proposals.  But the President has not made any decisions.              Q   Well, is the President aware of their consideration  of this option?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if he's been briefed  on any preliminary conclusions or anything like that from the task  force on this specific proposal of any kind.  I don't know that  that's gotten to his level.  He started yesterday to go through with  the task force a very wide range of decisions and I don't believe  that that's been presented to him, no.              Q   Well, he's not relying on the USA Today to tell him  what his task force is considering in the way of taxes.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, he's going through it in a very  deliberate fashion.  There are a number of decisions that have to be  made.  I don't know that this proposal has reached that decision- making point.              Q   If this is still under consideration, that's a  change, at least from what we've been told by Dee Dee, I think about  three weeks ago or so.  She said, that is not an option, talking  about the -- had a big argument with somebody over this, so I  remember it specifically -- and said it not once, but twice.  Is that  not the case?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know if this has  been presented to the President as something that is being looked at  at some level in the task force.              Q   It was ruled it out, though.  I mean, unlike other  options that you've kept in the mix, this one specifically was ruled  out.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, this is something that is  being looked at, but no decision has been made of any kind.  I mean,  it doesn't -- it's not necessarily material until you get to the  decision-making phase.  The working groups are looking at hundreds of  different options.              Q   If it was ruled out before and it's not ruled out  now, then something has changed, George.  Yes, no?              Q   When a guy says in February --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the working groups are  looking at the widest possible range of options.              Q   So something's changed.  They weren't looking at it  before; they're looking at it now.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I don't know if the working  groups have gotten to that point yet.  They are casting a very wide  net.              Q   How was it possible that you and Dee Dee were able  to sell -- definitively rule it out as an option previously and now  are saying that, in fact, it is being considered?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, the working groups are  looking at a wide range of options.  They have not --              Q   Do you deny that you and Dee Dee ruled it -- flatly  ruled it out on several occasions in the past month?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't deny that -- I mean, those  are the President's words.  Those are very clear.              Q   Subsequent to the President's words, do you deny  that within the last month you and Dee Dee have both publicly ruled  it out?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know about the timing.  I  think what we did was refer back to the President's words and say  they stand.              Q   So don't they stand any longer?              Q   March 25th, Clinton said for the next four to five  years it was ruled out.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, those words -- the President  did say that in February.  The working groups are on a separate  track, and as I said, I don't believe --              Q   Separate from the President?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't believe this has been  presented to the President.              Q   Are they considering something that the President  --              Q   Has ruled out?              Q      has ruled out?  I mean, will the President  consider a VAT tax?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, the working groups have not  presented this to the President.  They have looked at a wide range of  options.  I suppose that if an argument is made, he will clearly  listen to it.  That does not mean he has decided to do it.              Q   Can we put this another way?  In his answer in  Ohio, he looked at the VAT in terms of restructuring the whole tax  system.  Under those -- that was the circumstance that he said it  might be considered at some future point.  Is that no longer the  case, or is that the only way that he can see a VAT emerging?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I guess I'm not sure exactly what  you're asking.              Q   He talked about the VAT in the context of a  restructured tax system, not as a specific way to finance health  care, for example.              Q   Or anything else.              Q   Or anything else.              Q   It was always in the context of substituting for  other taxes at a time of a dramatic overhaul of the whole tax system.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.              Q   Has that change, too?              Q   Is that still his view?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I haven't spoken about those  specific comments.  I think -- I can just go back to it -- are the  working groups -- have they examined the possibility of a VAT?  Yes,  they have.              Q   Certainly we're looking at a VAT, she said.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They have examined the possibility  of a VAT.  Has it been presented to the President?  Has he made a  decision?  No, he has not.              Q   What kind of a deal do you have when you've got the  President's appointed task force, obviously not oblivious to his  ruling something out except in the context of some huge down the line  reform, goes ahead on its own and considers a tax which he has  specifically ruled out in any context other than much later, and then  goes ahead and announces that that's what they're looking at?  Is the  President concerned about that sort of thing?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that the President's  concern is to make sure he gets the best health care proposal  possible.  He's concerned with making sure that they have the most  thorough process for examining all the possible alternatives, all the  different alternatives.  If a decision is made to go forward with  something like that it's certainly something the President will  explain and justify.  But no decision has been made along those  lines.              Q   What does it mean exactly, though, when the  President rules something out?  Does it mean it can get back on the  table later if a more persuasive argument is made?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's just -- that's indisputably  true.  If you -- but, at the same time, he has not ruled it in.  He  has not made a proposal.              Q   What makes him open to it now when he wasn't open  to it before?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's certainly willing to listen to  the argument.              Q   Was he willing to listen to the argument for a  short-term tax this year, and he wasn't willing to listen to it in  Chilicothe?  He's now open to it --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The context of his comments was  that it was not something -- he wanted to be clear that this is not  something he was proposing, not something he was floating.              Q   Not something he was considering.  Those are his  words -- \\\"It's not something that's now under consideration.  If we  start considering it, I'll tell you.\\\"  You're now acknowledging, are  you not, that it is under consideration and --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm acknowledging that the task  force has studied this proposal.  I am also stating that the  President has not made a decision on it.              Q   But the door is open for the President to  reconsider including this as part of --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Obviously, the working groups are  looking at it.  Again, but the President has not made a decision.              Q   Do you know if they will make a presentation on  behalf of the VAT to him?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know that.  I assume that  if -- I don't know what stage they are it in proposing.  I don't know  that they're going to make the conclusion that this is something they  should present to him.  I know this is something the working groups  are looking at.              Q   Do you understand, George, that none of us are  asking these questions in context of a decision that the President  has made, only about what the President is considering?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I understand that, and I am  acknowledging that the working groups have examined the issue of a  VAT.              Q   And the President will consider it?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I assume that he will consider the  argument if it is presented to him.              Q   Does that mean the President -- that working groups  think that when the President says no, he means maybe?  (Laughter.)              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that means that the working  groups are trying to do the most thorough job possible.              Q   George, can I ask you another question about  Bosnia?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sure.  (Laughter.)              Q   No, he wants us to stay on this.              Q   Let's do gays in the military.  (Laughter.)              Q   No, he got out of that swamp.              Q   I think we've gotten the bottom line on that VAT.   Reggie Bartholomew, your Special Ambassador in Belgrade, today said  that if the Serbs do not accept the agreement that has been worked  out -- quote -- \\\"We will do our part to pursue the lifting of the  arms embargo together with our allies.\\\"  That seems to go a bit  further than what you've just said --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sounds almost exactly what I just  said.              Q   Well, do you accept -- in other words, you accept  what Reggie --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the President has said that  this is something that's under consideration.  It is something he  will consider if the current actions don't bring the Serbs to the  table.              Q   Isn't there some kind of timetable here?                MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, there is a timetable.  There's  going to be a vote on the U.N. resolution in about 10 days.              Q   That's on sanctions, that's on tightening the  sanctions.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's right, that's sanctions.   And we believe that that will ratchet up the pressure, and we hope  that that will bring the Serbs to the table.  As you know, Mr.  Bartholomew also met with Mr. Churkin of Russia, and they are also  working on ways to bring the Serbs to the table.  We will continue to  pressure them in many different ways and this is one possible option  as well.              Q   The question is whether there's a timetable for  consideration or a vote on a decision on lifting the arms embargo,  not the sanctions.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The next vote in the U.N. is on  sanctions.  As far as I know, there are no votes scheduled on lifting  the arms embargo.  But it is something that we have discussed both  internally and with our allies.              Q   Why did Reggie Bartholomew tell the Serbs that the  U.S. would do that?  What was the point of his telling them that?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, clearly, I mean, this is  something that's under consideration, and this is something that we  take quite seriously if they do not come to the table.  They should  know the consequences of failing to come to the table.              Q   Have they been given a deadline?              Q   Warren Christopher has been saying the same thing  and it hasn't seemed to change the Serbs' behavior in the least.  Why  should the Serbs take any heed of a threat to lift the arms embargo  when so far everything that's been done has had no effect on the  fighting in Bosnia?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I just don't accept the premise of  your question.  It has had an effect; the embargo is having an  effect.                Q   What effect?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  If the Serbians choose not to heed  our warnings, then they will face the consequences.              Q   What effect has it had in Bosnia?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the effect that it has had on  the Serbians, it has tightened up -- they are not getting their  shipments through.  We can brief more fully --              Q   In Bosnia, George.  In Bosnia what effect has it  had?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, it's hard to say if it's  stopped the aggression to date.  That is why we're continuing to  press for the Serbians to stop.  But we believe that over time we  will continue to weaken the Serbs and that will have   an effect.   I'm not saying it's going to happen overnight; it clearly hasn't  happened overnight.  But we believe that over time the sanctions can  weaken the Serbs.  If it fails to work and if the Serbs fail to come  to the negotiating table, we'll move forward with the embargo.              Q   Isn't there a working deadline, George, of the 24th  -- the same date as the U.N. -- the scheduled U.N. vote?  Hasn't the  United States said, along with many of the other NATO allies, that if  the Serbs aren't willing to sign on to the peace accord by then, that  we'll seek -- haven't we said that we will seek --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We've said continually we're going  to --              Q   But on that deadline?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't have a specific date, but  we're going to move forward with the resolution, the U.N. resolution,  by around that time.  And if that fails to take effect, if that fails  to bring the Serbs to the table, we will clearly consider other  actions.              Q   Isn't this awfully incremental?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're taking a step-by-step  approach.  We're ratcheting up the pressure and we're going to  continue to do that.              Q   Is there a possibility, George, that by the time  all these incremental steps are taken the Serbs will have achieved  their goals and then what's the purpose?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the purpose is to get the  Serbs to stop the aggression.  We are pursuing that goal on many  different fronts.  We are pursuing it through the U.N.; we're  pursuing it through direct talks; we are pursuing it through  tightening the sanctions.  And we will consider lifting the arms  embargo.  We are turning the screws up on the Serbs and we will  continue to do that.              Q   But if the efforts have been unsuccessful in  getting the Serbs to stop the aggression how effective will any  campaign be to have the Serbs give back what they've gained?  I mean,  once they're entrenched --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't speculate on that.  We're  going to continue to press for them to come to the table now.  We're  going to continue to find ways to stop the aggression.  But I can't  see into the future.              Q   George, on the stimulus package, House Republicans  say they're going to hold a series of town meetings on Saturday to  try and explain the details of your package.  They cite polls which  show that the more people learn about it, the less they like it.   What's your strategy to counter that?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The strategy we have is the one  we're going to continue.  As you saw, the President today pointed up  the very real benefits of the summer jobs program that this package  will provide:  700,000 new summer jobs this summer for kids in inner  cities and suburbs to do productive work.  We are also going to point  out the benefits of the highway money, the investments in highways.   We're going to point up the benefits of immunization.  We're going to  point up the benefits of Head Start.  We are going to say that the  Republicans have a choice:  they can take action to create jobs or  they can perpetuate the gridlock of the last four years.               Q   Does it concern you, though, that the House now,  the House Republicans are after you as well as the Senate?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The House Republicans voted against  it before.  They made a mistake then; they're making a mistake now.              Q   George, does it strike anybody in the  administration that it's a bit strong to describe, as the President  did this morning, the summer jobs program as -- quote -- \\\"a  reaffirmation of a promise of America\\\"?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not at all.  I think it's the  promise of America to give kids a chance to reach their full  potential.               Q   Government-funded jobs?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  To give people a chance to work?   Absolutely.  That is the promise of America.              Q   I want to follow up on something I asked yesterday  -- where does 700,000 summer jobs, where does that figure come from?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That is on top of.  I did look at  it.  There are currently 600,000 summer jobs in the pipeline.  This  will be on top of the 600,000, so it will be a total of 1.3 million.              Q   The 700,000 would be created by the stimulus  package?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.              Q   Where does that number come from?  Because we've  been told all along that the stimulus package would create 500,000  new jobs.  And according to Panetta, that breaks down to something  like 200,000 full-time jobs and 150,000 summer jobs.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, but the summer -- that's when  you do their full-time equivalence.  I mean, 700,000 individuals will  receive jobs this summer.  When you calculate it for the full-time  job effect, you have to do -- I don't know what the exact formula is.              Q   Seven hundred thousand part-time jobs --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- 150,000 or --              Q   One to four because it's three months.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Thank you.              Q   Can I follow up on that?  Did the President  misspeak this morning when he said that some of the government money  for these summer jobs will pay for private -- for kids to work in the  private sector?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not necessarily.  I mean, I think  that there will be grants available.  That's one of the ways that you  pay for the jobs.  At the same time, he's also issued a challenge to  the private sector to hire kids on their own as well.                Q   Tax dollars, for instance, would pay for kids to  work at Time-Warner?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the Time-Warner is actually  somebody coming forward and actually doing a grant.  That's going to  be the bulk of it.  There could be isolated instances, though, where  there would be grants to businesses.              Q   Has the President spoken with any Senate  Republicans this week?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:   No, but there's been a lot of contact with Senate Republicans in the  White House.              Q   At a lower level.  But the President hasn't?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has not, no.              Q   Getting any closer to get the votes?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're continuing to work on it.               Q   Anybody leaning your way?              Q   On Haiti, The New York Times seems to be reporting  something of a breakthrough in Aristide's attitude towards the coup  leaders.  Can you confirm that there has been this change, and what  impact will it have on the process?  And what did Pezzullo have to  say yesterday in his report?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Pezzullo did brief the principals.   I can't confirm what's actually happening in the talks.  I would  leave that to the negotiators themselves.  But Mr. Caputo has  returned to Haiti.  We have received a briefing here at the White  House from Ambassador Pezzullo.  And as we have said time and time  again, we believe that assurances of security are important to a  final resolution to a broader political settlement.              Q   George, yesterday you offered some selective  breakdowns of how the stimulus would impact some states and cities.   Can we get a complete breakdown by state of how these jobs would be  impacted?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we have it for most states,  yes.  And I think we can get it out.              Q   Could you make that generally available?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe we can.              Q   And could you do it by the component of the  stimulus?  In other words --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if we can do -- I know  that we can do it by summer jobs and other jobs.  I don't know how  deeply it can be broken down.  But clearly, we can break it down into  summer jobs and other jobs.              Q   And can I follow up?  Is this the information that  Jeff Eller and the rest of the White House is using in the ads in the  states?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if they're ads, but  they're press releases.              Q   Can you describe what those press releases contain?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  All we're doing is pointing out the  benefits of this package to various states.  For instance, I know  that today Senator Dole is heading up to Vermont and New Hampshire.   And I would point out that the stimulus package, the jobs package  creates 1,000 jobs in Vermont.  It creates 2,000 jobs in New  Hampshire.  And the people of those states should remind him that  this is important.               Q   Where are the releases going?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They go to the states.              Q   To whom?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We can get them.  It's no problem.              Q   Can we get it?              Q   Why don't you put them out here as well?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we can.              Q   This afternoon?  Would that be possible?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'll have to check.  I don't know.   But as soon as we can.              Q   Are you focusing these press releases on states  where there are moderate or pragmatic Republican senators?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we're trying to get as many  as we can.  It's actually quite difficult to pull this together and  we're doing our best.  We're putting them out as we get them.              Q   Why are you so closely tracking Senator Dole's  schedule?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I was just following it.               Q   Are press releases going along to states where he's  visiting?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure.  I think that  probably there are press releases going to Vermont.  (Laughter.)              Q   Will there be a man in a chicken suit waiting?   (Laughter.)              Q   George, as the President goes about the business of  defending what's in his stimulus package, he doesn't address what  seems to be the Republicans' main point, that you're funding it with  deficit spending rather than \\\"if it's so important, why not come up  with the funding for it\\\" seems to be the Republican argument.  And  how do you answer that?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  What was answer is, we are paying  for it over time.  And if you look at our budget, we pay for this  package over time.  We believe right now the economy needs a jump- start for jobs.              Q   You're not claiming, are you, that that doesn't add  to the deficit this year?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm saying we're paying for it over  time.  I didn't say that.              Q   I know that, George.  But I mean, from the  beginning, the question -- we do have annual budgets and things -- deficit spending will pay for that this year, will it not?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  This year they clearly will.  But  over time our budget fully pays for this program.              Q   What you're saying is that there are savings that  would cover this if it were this year in future years?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely.  That's exactly what I  said.              Q   I know that, but there is going to be outstanding  debt, it will add to the national debt from this year --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, we're reducing the deficit by  $500 billion -- $514 billion over the next four years.              Q   You mean you're reducing it below what it would  have been?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Exactly.              Q   In fact, you're adding a very large amount to the  national debt over the period of --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  But we're reducing it far more from  what it would have been.  That's true.                Q   Washington-type reduction.  (Laughter.)              Q   You're getting to be a grumpy old man.              Q   George, has any decision been made about the White  House or the President's participation in the gay rights march coming  up in a week and a half?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're working on the President's  schedule now.  I believe he's going to be at the Senate Democratic  retreat in Jamestown that weekend.              Q   Will he address it by phone?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know about that.  It's a  little far out, but I believe he's going to be in the Senate retreat.              Q   So will he have the leaders in a day or two before  the speech?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.  I would expect that  at some point he would meet with the leaders of some of these groups.   I don't know the schedule on it, though.              Q   Will there be an AIDS czar appointed prior to or in  conjunction with the event?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not sure.              Q   April 22nd is Earth Day.  What is the President  going to do to mark that, and is it the case that he is going to sign  the biodiversity treaty that day?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I know there's been some work on  the biodiversity treaty.  I don't know about signing it that day, but  I would expect he'll have a statement on Earth Day or right around  then.              Q   Where is the work on the biodiversity treaty?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'd have to check with Katie  McGinty.  I just know that there's been some work done, but I don't  know exactly what.              Q   When is Earth Day?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The 22nd, I think.              Q   Why is it you know that he is going to have a  statement on Earth Day but you don't know if he's going to have a  statement on the gay rights march?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I said I don't know if he's going  to meet or when he's going to meet.              Q   Do you have a statement on the gay rights march?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't, actually, no.  I wouldn't  be surprised if he did, though.              Q   Do you have some details on the Miyazawa visit?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's a working visit on Friday and  the President is looking forward to that in discussing a number of  issues including Russian aid and the Japanese stimulus package and  the trade issues between the two countries.              Q   There was some expectations that a second aid  package to Russia was going to be unveiled at the G-7 meeting and, if  I understand, it hasn't happened.  Why is that or what's the status  on that?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The G-7 meeting is still going on  and, as you know, Secretaries Bentsen and Christopher have talked  about the outlines of a possible package.  But we're going to  continue to consult with Congress and our G-7 allies on that.              Q?     We will not then make any kind of announcement  during the two-day meeting?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The meeting's not over yet.                Q   Is that when you're going to make one?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not ruling out the possibility.              Q      the President's going to announce it tomorrow.              Q   Bentsen said that.              Q   Yes, Bentsen said it would be tomorrow.              Q   So did Christopher.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'd have to look at that, but I  believe it is more likely that the announcement will come out of  Tokyo.              Q   George, has there been further consideration here  about going to -- sending the President out to Los Angeles?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know that there's -- it's  not something we've ruled out.  We don't have a date set for it.              Q   George, you all have a position or do you support  Immigration's plan to settle 4,000 Iraqi prisoners in the United  States?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's the first I've heard of it.              Q   George, there was a report today about the --              Q   Fortunately.  (Laughter.)               Q      about the pace of appointments and says that  President Clinton is behind President Bush in the number of positions  that people have been nominated for.  Are you going to speed up the  pace of nominations or where do you stand with it?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We filled 814 of the President's  appointments.  And it's broken down -- we have 384 Schedule C; 147  noncareer SES; 213 PAS full-time.  I'm not sure what that means -- (laughter) -- 70 PA full-time.  And this is about the same -- it's  about the same pace of President Bush.  Obviously, as you move along  farther, once you -- each level of appointment actually has a  multiplier effect and frees up far more appointments.  So we expect  the process to speed up.  But we're at the pace of Bush.  Obviously  we'd like to get these done as quickly as possible.                I would point out that the FBI background checks and the  background check is far more comprehensive and it takes more time  than our predecessors, and that is part of the holdup.  But we're  working on it.              Q   Is that because of Nannygate?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's an awful big part of  it, yes.              Q   In the story this morning, you were at  approximately the same pace as Bush in making appointments, but way  behind in winning confirmations.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's where the background checks  comes into play.  That's the problem.              Q   That's the background checks problem?  Because I  mean, you have a Democratic Senate --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, that's not the -- you make the  appointments, and then it takes quite a bit of time to fill out all  the forms and have the background checks done.  That's exactly where  the problem is.              Q   What's the President doing this afternoon, and  what's on the plan for tomorrow?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's got some meetings -- just  office meetings this afternoon for the most part, on a variety of  issues that -- probably a half-dozen different issues.  And then  he'll be -- tomorrow we'll have an event, probably again focused on  the stimulus and jobs package out of here at the White House.  And  Friday is the Miyazawa meeting.              Q   Will you be releasing his tax return tomorrow,  George?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Either tomorrow or Friday.              Q   Is there going to be a pre-briefing regarding the  Japanese Prime Minister's visit tomorrow?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know about tomorrow, but  we'll probably get something done, as we usually do, for these  visits.              Q   Was Reverend Jackson here this morning and do you  know what that was about?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He was here.  He met with a group  of us here at the White House, including Mack McLarty.              Q   Who?              Q   Reverend Jackson.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Reverend Jackson.  Mack McLarty,  me, Gene Sperling, Bruce Reed, Jeff Watson, Mark Gearan.               Q   Talking about Haiti?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We talked about general urban  policy.  He is about to go to Los Angeles.  He was just back from  Mississippi, where we had a good victory last night; and he's going  on to Los Angeles.              Q   Did he request the meeting?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Actually, no.  He's in continual  contact with the President.  He had written a letter on a variety of  issues, and so we asked him to come in and talk about it.              Q   George, Dole is having a fundraiser for Jeffords  tonight in Vermont.  Have you guys been  in contact with Jeffords at  all on this?        MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think there's been some contact,  sure.              Q   Can you tell us about the contacts?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure --               Q   Do you know who contacted him or what was said?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I know that Howard Paster talked to  him and they just has a general talk about the package.              Q   And did he express his support for it now, or is he  --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't divulge the details of the  conversation, but there have been conversations.              Q   The L.A. Times is reporting that abortion -- elective abortions is likely to be included in the basic health care  package.  Is this something the President is considering?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again --              Q   Along with the VAT?  (Laughter.)              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's certainly something that's  been looked at, but no decisions have been made.              Q   What was the question?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The L.A. Times story on whether  abortions will be covered by the President's health plan.              Q   Did the President in his meeting -- did you in your  meeting with Reverend Jackson ask his advice, solicit his advice  about what kind of stance the White House should take in the wake of  the verdict in L.A.?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, we certainly talked about the  situation in Los Angeles and the long-term prospects for economic  development and other issues.              Q   For instance, did you discuss whether it would be  helpful for the President to go there or not?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, we discussed a wide range of  issues related to Los Angeles.  That was certainly one of them.              Q   Letting you perhaps go out on the way you came in,  I need to go back to Bosnia just for a second and ask --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, good.              Q      your reaction to Margaret Thatcher's comments  that you're just sitting by and watching a massacre.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, we've been pushing very hard  on a number of fronts for more aggressive action.  We will continue  to do that.              Q   Can you tell us if you've made any progress in your  talks on the stimulus package getting a compromise?  I mean, we don't  have any feel except talks are ongoing.  Have you talked to like 20  people or --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know the numbers.  We've  talked to several people and we've had wide-ranging sessions.                Q   Anyone leaning your way?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't get into that.  We're just  going to keep working through Tuesday.              THE PRESS:  Thank you.                                   END                    1:10 P.M.

No doubt.  People are always looking for something to protest about, so it would be no surprise.   Well, look on the, er, bright side.

Let's make things clear: My opposition to H.R. violations in Arab States is total and without qualification. No Arab State is and can claim to be democratic. No Arab state claims to be democratic.  I am born in Palestine (now Israel). I have family there. The lack of peace and utter injustice in my home country has affected me all my life. I am concerned by Palestine (Israel) because I want peace to come to it. Peace AND justice.   If anybody has legitimate claims towards Arab states, he should present his claims and ask for support. Jews who left Arab states are fully  entitled to make claims and should do so, if they consider their case has a merit. It is their basic right to return to these countries, if they wish. If not, they should not complain and compare themselves to the Palestinians who have been struggling for the right of return since Israel was established and whose right is upheld by the United Nations quasi totally. If Jews feel discriminated in Arab countries, they have a legitimate claim that any decent person can and should support.   Human rights violations by Arab States don't justify, legitimate nor are the cause for Israeli breaches of international law and human rioghts. Israeli breaches stem from the Zionist concept, which can only be implemented by negating basic rights to Palestinians.   Israeli trights and Palestinian rights are not symmetrical. The first party has a state and the other has none. The first is an occupier and the second the occupied. For any meaningful relationship to emerge, some symmetry must be established. As long as Israelis and Jews don't realise the necessity of a change of perspective towards the Palestinian people and as long as Israelis and Jews don't want to exorcise their own past towards the Palestinians (the Naqba of 1948, etc.) and refuse to acknowledge that the creation of Israel was dependent upon the removal of most Palestinian Arabs, there will be no base for a real trust.  When I read the first time the list of the 383 Arab villages destroyed by the State of Israel in and after 1948, I got a shock.  I hope others will be touched by this discovery and think about the meaning of such massive destruction and destitution.\",\"I have an Adcom GFA-555 that I got in 1985.

Anyway, I think it would be a great idea to  develop such a product, perhaps in the underground, as it would otherwise  probably become illegal pretty quickly here...  It's really very feasible and shouldn't be too expensive - all that's needed is a box with a phone jack on one side, a DSP in the middle to do codec functions of speech->compressed bytestream, and an RS232 on the other side.  You'd plug your phone into it, plug the RS232 into your computer, and have a good old fashioned normal modem on your other RS232 port.  The CPU in the middle would do the encryption with a version of pgp modified to work on a byte stream.  With v32bis or better modems to carry the bytestream, it should work.  Quality would only be marginally lower than a normal telephone.  At the very highest price, you could use one of those voice-mail compatible modems to do the digitisation - that puts an upper bound of about $500 on the cost of such a box.  In practice, you really ought to be able to get the price well below $100 - I could do it now in software on my cheap&nasty home RISC box (Acorn Archimedes) with the digitising microphone I bought for 25 pounds, if I knew how to write good speech compression software (which I don't).  The reason it won't work of course is that hardly anyone will have one - the only consumer equipment to have encryption will use the wiretap chip. Economics, I'm afraid.  However... we can get about 2Kcps throughput on the internet even with the bottleneck of a v32bis modem.  When we get ISDN for all (ha ha ha) and the new NREN, it might then be trivial to run compressed speech over a tcp/ip connection on the Internet.  Perhaps we should start thinking now of a standard to keep voice on the internet compatible for everyone, and side-step the clipper stuff and use internet for all our phone calls in future :-)  [1/2 joking]\",\"I can't believe this, Howe has an ERA in the 80's He is improving!!!  \",\"   The only way out seems to be death.  ---      \\\" I'd Cheat on Hillary Too.\\\"\",\"    We're looking at a series of chips by WSI, the PSD3xx series.

While I can't offer such a proof, it seems pretty damn plausible that if the government does not regulate a particular area, it cannot become a tool of private interests to pursue their own agendas in that area. I rather suspect that it's the sort of government we have NOW that is more likely to become such a tool, and that it IS such a tool in many instances.   I suspect that this is because \\\"improvement in the human condition\\\" as you define it is not the primary goal of libertarianism, and would not be the primary goal of a libertarian government.

Matthew 5:17    \\\"Think not that I have come to abolish the law and the  prophets; I have come not to abolish them but to fulfil them.  Matthew 5:18   For truly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away,  not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the law until all is accomplished.  Matthew 5:19   Whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments  and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he  who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of  heaven.  Matthew 5:20   For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of  the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.   There are several problems with this.  The most serious is that the Law was regarded by Jews at the time (and now) as binding on Jews, but not on Gentiles.  There are rules that were binding on all human beings (the so-called Noachic laws), but they are quite minimal.  The issue that the Church had to face after Jesus' death was what to do about Gentiles who wanted to follow Christ.  The decision not to impose the Law on them didn't say that the Law was abolished.  It simply acknowledged that fact that it didn't apply to Gentiles.  This is a simple answer, which I think just about everyone can agree to. (A discussion of the issue in more or less these terms is recorded in Acts 15.)  However there's more involved.  In order to get a full picture of the role of the Law, we have to come to grips with Paul's apparent rejection of the Law, and how that relates to Jesus' commendation of the Law.  At least as I read Paul, he says that the Law serves a purpose that has been in a certain sense superceded.  Again, this issue isn't one of the abolition of the Law.  In the middle of his discussion, Paul notes that he might be understood this way, and assures us that that's not what he intends to say.  Rather, he sees the Law as primarily being present to convict people of their sinfulness.  But ultimately it's an impossible standard, and one that has been superceded by Christ.  Paul's comments are not the world's clearest here, and not everyone agrees with my reading.  But the interesting thing to notice is that even this radical position does not entail an abolition of the Law.  It still remains as an uncompromising standard, from which not an iota or dot may be removed. For its purpose of convicting of sin, it's important that it not be relaxed.  However for Christians, it's not the end -- ultimately we live in faith, not Law.  While the theoretical categories they use are rather different, in the end I think Jesus and Paul come to a rather similar conclusion.  The quoted passage from Mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest of the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus shows us how he interprets the Law.  The \\\"not an iota or dot\\\" would suggest a rather literal reading, but in fact that's not Jesus' approach.  Jesus' interpretations emphasize the intent of the Law, and stay away from the ceremonial details.  Indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude towards the Sabbath and kosher laws.  Some scholars claim that Mat 5:17-20 needs to be taken in the context of 1st Cent. Jewish discussions.  Jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a tenth of even the most minor herbs, but neglecting the things that really matter: justice, mercy and faith, and caring about how cups and plates are cleaned, but not about the fact that inside the people who use them are full of extortion and rapacity.  (Mat 23:23-25) This, and the discussion later in Mat 5, suggest that Jesus has a very specific view of the Law in mind, and that when he talks about maintaining the Law in its full strength, he is thinking of these aspects of it. Paul's conclusion is similar.  While he talks about the Law being superceded, all of the specific examples he gives involve the \\\"ceremonial law\\\", such as circumcision and the Sabbath.  He is quite concerned about maintaining moral standards.  The net result of this is that when Paul talks about the Law being superceded, and Jesus talks about the Law being maintained, I believe they are talking about different aspects of the Law.  Paul is embroiled in arguments about circumcision.  As is natural in letters responding to specific situations, he's looking at the aspect of the Law that is currently causing trouble: the Law as specifically Jewish ceremonies.  He certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards of conduct.  On the other hand, when Jesus commends the Law, he seems to be talking the Law in its broadest implications for morals and human relationships, and deemphasizing those aspects that were later to give Paul so much trouble.\",\" Is any education a prerequisite for employment at IHR ?

It seems from the following that the CPSR is atleats starting to question this bogosity:      ---------------------------------------------------------------- April 16, 1993 Washington, DC                 COMPUTER PROFESSIONALS CALL FOR PUBLIC            DEBATE ON NEW GOVERNMENT ENCRYPTION INITIATIVE          Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR) today called for the public disclosure of technical data underlying the government's newly-announced \\\"Public Encryption Management\\\" initiative.  The new cryptography scheme was announced today by the White House and the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), which will implement the technical specifications of the plan.  A NIST spokesman acknowledged that the National Security Agency (NSA), the super- secret military intelligence agency, had actually developed the encryption technology around which the new initiative is built.          According to NIST, the technical specifications and the Presidential directive establishing the plan are classified.  To open the initiative to public review and debate, CPSR today filed a series of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests with key agencies, including NSA, NIST, the National Security Council and the FBI for information relating to the encryption plan.  The CPSR requests are in keeping with the spirit of the Computer Security Act, which Congress passed in 1987 in order to open the development of non-military computer security standards to public scrutiny and to limit NSA's role in the creation of such standards.          CPSR previously has questioned the role of NSA in developing the so-called \\\"digital signature standard\\\" (DSS), a communications authentication technology that NIST proposed for government-wide use in 1991.  After CPSR sued NIST in a FOIA lawsuit last year, the civilian agency disclosed for the first time that NSA had, in fact, developed that security standard. NSA is due to file papers in federal court next week justifying the classification of records concerning its creation of the DSS.          David Sobel, CPSR Legal Counsel, called the administration's apparent commitment to the privacy of electronic communications, as reflected in today's official statement,  \\\"a step in the right direction.\\\"  But he questioned the propriety of NSA's role in the process and the apparent secrecy that has thus far shielded the development process from public scrutiny.  \\\"At a time when we are moving towards the development of a new information infrastructure, it is vital that standards designed to protect personal privacy be established openly and with full public participation.  It is not appropriate for NSA -- an agency with a long tradition of secrecy and opposition to effective civilian cryptography -- to play a leading role in the development process.\\\"          CPSR is a national public-interest alliance of computer industry professionals dedicated to examining the impact of technology on society.

These are indeed provocative questions but they are asked time and again by people around me.  1.      Is it true that the Israeli authorities don't recognize Israeli nationality ? And that ID cards, which Israeli citizens must carry at all times, identify people as Jews or Arabs, not as Israelis ?  2.      Is it true that the State of Israel has no fixed borders and that Israeli governments from 1948 until today have refused to state where the ultimate borders of the State of Israel should be ?  3.      Is it true that Israeli stocks nuclear weapons ? If so, could you provide any evidence ?  4.      Is it true that in Israeli prisons there are a number of individuals which were tried in secret and for which their identities, the date of their trial and their imprisonment are state secrets ?  5.      Is it true that Jews who reside in the occupied territories are subject to different laws than non-Jews?  6.      Is it true that Jews who left Palestine in the war 1947/48 to avoid the war were automatically allowed to return, while their Christian neighbors who did the same were not allowed to return ?  7.      Is it true that Israel's Prime Minister, Y. Rabin, signed an order for ethnical cleansing in 1948, as is done today in Bosnia-Herzegovina ?  8.      Is it true that Israeli Arab citizens are not admitted as members in kibbutzim?  9.      Is it true that Israeli law attempts to discourage marriages between Jews and non-Jews ?  10.     Is it true that Hotel Hilton in Tel Aviv is built on the site of a muslim cemetery ?  Thanks,\",\" Well, first you work out how much cold gas you need, then make the tanks big enough.

When I rebooted, I found that about 15 files had gotten \\\"cross-linked\\\" which is a pretty serious corruption of the hard drive file system.  I am concerned that Quick C in a DOS window has somehow strayed outside its protected mode world and corrupted the smartdrv.exe disk cache and that is what caused the disk problem.  I thought that DOS programs run in DOS windows were pretty well-contained  by Windows.  If that is true, then maybe the Quick C compiler has nothing  to do with it.

Fortunately, it doesn't itch.  The rash  always comes on the day after the fever breaks and no matter what the illness was:  cold, flu, whatever. It started happening about four years ago after I moved to my current town, although I don't know if that has anything to do with anything.  Severity and persistance of the rash seems to vary with the fever: a severe or long-lasting fever brings a long-lasting rash.  A mild fever seems to bring rashes that go away faster.

I am not from Wisconsin, but I have close relatives who live in Port Washington (about 30 minutes north of Milwaukee), I visit the city regularly, and I have been in the Bradley four times to see the Admirals play  and the NCAA Hockey Championships.  It is a beautiful building.  The Pettits and the city like to promote it as the best facility for hockey in North America. As to what will happen with the Admirals if Milwaukee does acquire a franchise, word is the team will move to Green Bay and play in the Brown County Arena. Once again, the Admirals are an independent franchise, and the people of Milwaukee have been supporting them well.  The games I have been to have seen crowds anywhere from 10,000 to 13,000, which are numbers some NHL teams (i.e. the Islanders, Hartford, New Jersey) would be envious of having on some nights. Plus the fact that the city is able to support a minor league franchise without the glamour of having an NHL club affiliated to it is testimony to the amount of hockey interest exists in the city.

But there is a good chance that Markus will join the Pens before next  season. MoDo, though, naturally wants to keep their superstars Forsberg  and Naslund, so the latest news on this is that MoDo is looking for  personal sponsors for Forsberg and Naslund in order to match the kind  of money they would receive in NHL.

Beemers have no EC (tm).\",\" : In any case, I think Viola would have made a better signing.  Why? : Viola is younger, and is left handed (how many left handed starters does : Toronto have?  Well, I agree that Viola is a better signing.  However, why does everyone say that you want lefthanded starters?  I understand lefthanded spot relievers, even though they usually face more righthanded batters than lefthanded batters.  I just don't understand why people insist on lefthanded starters, unless there is a park effect (e.g., Yankee Stadium). Most batters in MLB are righthanded, so righthanded starters will have the platoon advantage more often than lefthanded starters. I guess one argument for lefty starters is that certain teams may be more vulnerable to LHP's than RHP's.  However, this is probably only a factor in the postseason, because teams seldom juggle their starters for this reason during the regular season.  I think you just want the best starters you can get, regardless of whether they are lefties or righties.  Lefthanded starters tend to have higher ERA's than righthanded starters, precisely because managers go out of their way to start inferior lefties (or perhaps because of the platoon advantage).
