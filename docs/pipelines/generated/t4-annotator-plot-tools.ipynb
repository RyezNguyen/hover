But unfortunely the Yards (a definitely excellent ballpark) only holds like 45,000 with 275 SRO spots. Ticket sales for the entire year is moving fast. Bleacher seats are almost gone for every game this year. It's a extremely likelyhood that the O's could sell out every game this year (especially if we lead the division for most of the year like '89).   On another front, the sale of the Orioles to anyone is likely to be forced upon Eli Jacobs who is major debt apparently. Maybe we can get an owner willing to spend on a proven rightfielder free agent in the winter.  Fernando has made the O's as the fifth starter. The O's pitching staff looks pretty good.

B2:      Male sex survey: Gay activity low      A new natonal study on male sexual behavior, the most thorough     examination of American men's sexual practices published since     the Kinsey report more than four decades ago, shows about 2     percent of the men surveyed had engaged in homosexual sex and     1 percent considered themselves exclusively homosexual.      The figures on homosexuality in the study released Wednesday     by the Alan Guttmacher Institute are significantly lower than     the 10 percent figure that has been part of the conventional     wisdom since it was published in the Kinsey report.  The article also contains numbers on the number of sexual partners. The median number of sexual partners for all men 20-39 was 7.3. Compared to the table I have already posted from Masters, Johnson, and Kolodny showing male homosexual partners, it is apparent that homosexual men are dramatically more promiscuous than the general male population.  It's a shame that we don't have a breakdown for straight men vs. gay/bi men -- that would show even more dramatically how much more promiscuous gay/bi men are.\",\" I was trying to avoid a discussion of the whether Clintons views should be endorsed or not.

I remember somebody from MS stating that it doesn't allow two users share one GUI. My interpretation of this was that one user per console but all the networking and RPC based stuff you want.   I believe ftp and rlogin deamons for NT systems will come from third party. Somebody already has a Beta version of an unsecure ftpd on the net. There is no reason why one cannot write a posix based shell like csh on Unix for remote logins.   In general I liked NT when I checked it out. It slow compared to Win3.1 (just like any other real OS). The beta version, although being slow, botts up much faster than my SUN workstation. Windows subsystems also start up a lot faster than X windows. I believe Bill Gates was right when he stated that NT was not for everybody. After playing around with it for a while I was convinced. If I owned a busines using a \\\"business computer\\\" from IBM or some other established vendor, I would consider moving to NT platform because it would provide a much cheaper solution (If you are running SQL servers etc.). It provides the robustness such an application requires.   On the other hand if you like your DOS games, more or less forget about NT. You can always boot to DOS  but in general that defeats the purpose of using NT. Most of NT's features are visible in a networked environment and in such an environment you can't reboot your machine at will. For personal use, I would rather wait for the Win32 based Windows release (whatever you name it) than jump to NT bandwagon. I expect most applications will keep on using Win16 until Win32 becomes widely available.  \",\" Could be the (folk?) song \\\"Clementine\\\".

They were acting in direct contradiction to scripture.  Jesus' Second Coming is something that everyone will know of.  Jesus also predicted that there will be false Messiahs who will use His name.  His prophecy has been fulfilled.   I agree with you there.    Me too.  I have already given my life to God.  If God tells me to lay down my life, it will be to save another life.    Do you judge all Christians by the acts of those who would call themselves Christian and yet are not?  The BD's contradicted scripture in their actions.  They were NOT Christian.  Simple as that.  Perhaps you have read too much into what the media has portrayed.  Ask any true-believing Christian and you will find that they will deny any association with the BD's.  Even the 7th Day Adventists have denied any further ties with this cult, which was what they were.  Do you judge all Muslims by the acts committed by Saddam Hussein, a  supposedly devout Muslim?  I don't.  Saddam is just a dictator using the religious beliefs of his people to further his own ends.

That is, ignoring concerns about government intrusions into individual privacy, is the value of easy wiretaps to investigators greater than the cost to the communications industry, and their customers, to support this wiretap technology?    A rough estimate suggests that wiretaps are worth about five million dollars per year to U.S. law enforcement agencies.

I'm working on estimating this wiretap benefit more accurately, but I'd like to ask hardware experts out there to help me with estimating the costs of the new proposed wiretap technology.  Please send me quotable/citeable estimates for:  - How many chips which would need to be made per year to keep all   phones with wiretap chips? - How much would it cost to make each chip? - How much did it cost to develop this technology in the first place? - How much more would supporting hardware, people, etc. cost, per chip? - What percentage cheaper would encryption chips and support have been   if private enterprise could compete to meet customer encryption needs? - What percentage of phone traffic would be taken up by the proposed   \\\"law enforcement blocks\\\"? - What is the total cost of handling all phone traffic per year?  Put another way, the question I'm asking is, what if each police agency that wanted a particular wiretap had to pay for it, being charged their share of the full social cost of forcing communication to be wiretap compatible?  Would they choose to buy such wiretaps, or would they find it more cost-effective to instead investigate crimes in other ways?\",\" I think in Illinois venereal disease (the old ones, not AIDS) was included.

Thus I've never really believed in God and heaven, although I don't actually believe that they don't exist either - I'm sort of undecided, probably like a lot of people I guess.         Lately I've been thinking about it all a lot more, and I wondered how religious people can be so convinced that there is a God. I feel as though I want to believe, but I'm not used to believing things without proof - just as I can't believe that there definitely isn't a God, so I can't definitely believe that there is. I wondered if most of you were brought up by religious families and never believed any different. Can anyone help me to understand how your belief and faith in God can be so strong.          Another question that frequently crosses my mind is which religion is correct?? How do you choose a religion, and how do you know that the Christian God exists and the Gods of other religions don't?? How do you feel about people who follow other religions?? How about atheists?? And people like me - agnostics I suppose. Do you respect their religion, and accept their beliefs as just as valid as your own?? Isn't there contradiction between the religions?? How can your religion be more valid than any others?? Do you have less respect for someone if they're not religious, or if they follow a different religion than you would if they were Christian??          Also, how much of the scriptures are correct?? Are all events in the bible really supposed to have happened, or are they just supposed to be stories with morals showing a true Christian how to behave??          I generally follow most of the Christian ideas, which I suppose are fairly universal throughout all religions - not killing, stealing, etc, and 'Loving my neighbour' for want of a better expression. The only part I find hard is the actual belief in God.          Finally, what is God's attitude to people like me, who don't quite believe in Him, but are generally fairly 'good' people. Surely not believing doesn't make me a worse person?? If not, I find myself wondering why I so strongly want to really believe, and to find a religion.          Sorry if I waffled on a bit - I was just writing ideas as they came into my head. I'm sure I probably repeated myself a bit too.

If you go 70mph on your dirtbike then feel free to contribute.   Because it wouldn't be a Jeep if it didn't. A friend of mine just bought one and it has more warning stickers than those little 4-wheelers (I guess that's becuase it's a big 4 wheeler). Anyway, it's written in about ten places that the windshield should remain up at all times, and it looks like they've made it a pain to put it down anyway, from what he says.

I would refer you to John Dominic Crossans Book _The Cross That Spoke_ (Pub. Harper and Row, 1988).  The earliest texts which we have make no reference to an empty tomb.  Nor is an empty tomb necessary for a claim of resurrection. Modern Evangelicals/Fundamentalists have completely missed what the point of resurrection is -- Here the work of George Nickelsburg's work  _Resurrection, Immortality, and Eternal Life in Intertestamental Judaism_ (Publ Cambridge, Havard Univ. Press, 1972) is most helpful.  Look At Rom 1:1-3.  Paul here has no need of an empty tomb.  Additionally in 1 Cor 15, Here again there is no mention of an empty tomb. He was raised (note the passive), he appeared, no ascension either.  Resurrection could be accomplished without ever disturbing the bones in the grave.  The whole idea of an empty tomb isn't broached in any of our texts until well after the fall of Jerusalem.  By that time, the idea of coming up with a body would have been ludicrious.  Moreover Mack has argued (convicingly, I think) that the empty tomb story first appears in Mark (we have no texts before this which mention the tomb).         You are quite right here.  Even the Idea of a subjective mystical event as the foundation of the resurrection narratives is currently becoming more untenable. See B. Mack _A Myth of Innocence_.\",\" How is it ever going to be an Off- the Shelf Technology if someone doesn't do it?  Maybe we should do this as part of the SSF design goals. ;-)  Gee fred.

The arrogance being attacked is that we \\\"think we are the only ones who know what the absolutes are\\\".  In short, many evangelicals claim that they are infallible on the matter of religious texts.  In particular, the problem is one of epistemology.  As a shorthand, you can think of epistemology as \\\"how do you know?\\\"  That question, it turns out, is a very troubling one.  The problem with `absolute certainty' is that, at the bottom, at least some of the thinking goes on inside your own head.  Unless you can be certain that everything which happens in your head is infallible, the reasoning you did to discover a source of truth is in question.  And that means you do NOT have absolute justification for your source of authority -- which means you do NOT have absolute certainty.   Let's take the specific example of Biblical Inerrancy, and a fictional Inerrantist named Zeke.  (The following arguments applies to the idea of Papal Infallibility, too.)  Zeke has, we presume, spent some time studying the Bible, and history, and several other topics.  He has concluded, based on all these studies (and possibly some religious experiences) that the Bible is a source of Absolute Truth.  He may be correct; but even if he is, he cannot be certain that he is correct. His conclusion depends on how well he studied history -- he may have made mistakes, and the references he used may have contained mistakes.  His conclusion depends on how well he studied the Bible -- he may have made mistakes.  His conclusion depends on his own reasoning -- and he may have made mistakes.  (Noticing a common thread yet?  8-)  Everything about his study of the world that he did -- everything that happened in his own head -- is limited by his own thinking.  No matter what he does to try and cover his mistakes, he can never be certain of his own infallibility.  As long as ANY PART of the belief is based on his own reasoning, that belief cannot be considered \\\"absolutely certain\\\".  Zeke believes that he has found a source of absolute truth -- but that belief is only as good as the quality of the search he made for it.  Unless he can say that his own reasoning is flawless, his conclusions are in doubt.  Any belief that you hold about absolute sources of truth depends in part on your own thinking -- there is no way out of the loop.  Only an infallible thinker can have absolute certainty in all his beliefs.   This is easy to demonstrate.  Let's go back to our shorthand method of doing epistemology: \\\"how do you know?\\\"  Imagine a hypothetical discussion:   A: The Bible is a source of absolute truth.   B: How do you know?   A: I studied history and the Bible and religious writings and church     teachings and came to this conclusion.   B: How do you know you studied history correctly?   A: Well, I double-checked everything.   B: How do you know you double-checked correctly?   A: Well, I compared my answers with some smart people and we agreed.   B: Just because some smart guy believes something that doesn't mean it is     true.  How do you know THEY studied it correctly?   A: ...  And, as you see, B will eventually get A to the point where he has to say \\\"I can't prove that there are no mistakes\\\" -- and as long as you may have made a mistake, then you cannot be ABSOLUTELY certain.  There is no way out of the loop.   This is where the \\\"arrogance of Christians\\\" arises: many people believe that their own personal research can give them absolute certainty about the doctrines of Christianity -- they are implicitly claiming that they are infallible, and that there is no possibility of mistake.  Claiming that you CANNOT have made a mistake, and that your thinking has led you to a flawless conclusion, is pretty arrogant.   *  People who want to see this argument explained in great detail should try to find _The Infallibility of the Church_, by George Salmon.  He is attacking the idea that the Pope can be knowably infallible (and he does so very well), but the general argument applies equally well to the idea that the Bible is knowably Inerrant. \",\"This past week I've been playing with some of the R-D (Reaction- Diffusion, not to be confused with RDS or R&D) techniques from SIGGRAPH '91.

In the May 10, 1936  edition of 'Hairenik Weekly' the vice-mayor of Bucharest, Rumania is  quoted as saying:  \\\"The Armenians helped us not to become the slaves of the Jewish  elements in our country.\\\"   \\\"And the type of Jew who is imported to Palestine...is not anything  to be proud about. Their loose morals, and other vices were  unknown to the Arabs prior to Balfour Declaration, on top of   all communist activities were the cause of most of the Arab  criticism.\\\"[1]  As Uzun exposed, the Armenians were fascist. Before Pearl Harbor,  the Dashnak daily 'Hairenik' (not to be confused with the Tzeghagrons 'Hairenik Weekly') expressed pro-Nazi sentiments:  \\\"And came Adolf Hitler, after herculean struggles. He spoke  to the racial heart strings of the German, opened the   fountain of his national genius, strock down the spirit  of defeatism...At no period since the World War had Berlin  conducted so realistic, well organized, and planned policy  as now, since Hitler's assumption to power...And whatever  others may think concerning Hitlerism and Fascism as a   system of Government, it is proved that they have revitalized  and regenerated the two states, Germany and Italy.\\\"[2]  [1] Captain George Haig, 'The Case of Palestine,' in Hairenik     Weekly, Friday, September 25, 1936.

Serdar Argic\",\"  Andrew,     How I wish this were true, and how I long for the day in which it will be true.  But alas, it is not true of history.  The Bible does not have a  message -- it has messages.  And some of those are messages of repentance and giving, to turn the other cheek, and do unto the least of these.  But some of the messages are the complete opposite.  Like the isrealites order to  wipe out other tribes including women and children down to cattle, and  punished severely when they were less than complete about the job.  Like jews who are said to have cried out in Matthew, \\\"His blood be upon our heads and our childrens heads\\\" A verse quoted in every pogrom from the crusades to the holocaust.  Have these been misunderstood?  I think not.  They have only been understood too clearly.  It is essential that christians grasp firmly the good the bible teaches, the meek carpenter from Nazareth is a potent  symbol for how we should be, his teachings we must take to heart, but we cannot ignore the other material in the bible which is not to our liking and say those who live by that have misread it.  To say that is only to chose a point of interpretation and declare it normative.  Such can be done with the same legitmacy by anyone.  Instead we must let the text critique the text. Understanding that there is both good and bad in our sacred corpus, we test all things and hold fast to that which is good.   At the risk of sounding heretical (well ok, more heretical) I don't think that doubt is something which requires forgiveness, it is something which requires introspection and reflection.  If that is a sin, then there can be no salvation, for doubt is an inescapble part of being human.  Consider Job.  His friends had no doubt. Whereas Job had no doubt in himself but doubted the wisdom and justice of God.  When God finally did appear he  rebuked the friends and had job make sacrifices for them.  To be a Christian it to always have doubt, or not to have honesty.\",\"      Nothing but errors and omissions here! \",\"Be very careful when you plug in a external monitor and a external speaker.

I was opposed to intervention in Somalia for the same reason I am opposed to intervention in Bosnia - there is no security interest of the United States there which justifies risking the lives of American servicemen, and there are too many crises in the world for us to take on all of them.  In the case of Bosnia, the risks are obviously much greater, and there are other countries in a much better position and with far better reasons to take action than the US.   You continue to misunderstand.  I did not say the reason why people want to intervene is because of racist (<- you seem to be overly fond of using this word, btw.  I said the phenomenon was race-related, which is not the same as racist.  Perhaps this distinction is too subtle for you to grasp) motives - I said the attention and outrage at the entire Yugoslavian situation was a result of it being 1) closer to home, 2) happening to people we can identify with, and 3) relentlessly harped on by the media.  I never said anything about which side would be preferred, which has a lot more to do with the presentation of the conflict than any psychological factors.  I think there is no doubt that despite the fact we intervened in Somalia, the level of attention devoted to there was considerably less than what is devoted to Bosnia, if the newspapers and tv news I see are any guide. \",\"[about the infield fly rule]  Unless he's Deion Sanders, in which case he just heads back to the dugout and waits for his next base-running-blunder opportunity.\",\"The rubber drain plugs under my carpet in my mazda glc leaked like the ones are doing under your spare in the Probe.

Too bad it's so demonstrably false.  Take a look at Great Britain sometime for a  nice history on drug criminalization.  The evidence there shows that during periods of time when drugs (such as heroin) were illegal, crime went up and people did die from bad drugs.  During times when drugs were legalized, those trends were reversed.   Now this is a great example of an ironclad proof.  Gosh, I'm convinced. ( :-} for the humor impaired).  First, assert something for which you have no evidence, then dodge requests for proof by claiming to know what this group was intended for.  As to research, if you'd done any at all, you'd realize that there is plenty of reason to believe that legalizing drugs will have many benefits to society.  There are some plausible arguments against it, too, but they aren't enough to convince me that criminalization of drugs is the answer.

With the IUD what happens is that fertilization may occur, but the device prevents implantation within the wall of the uterus (*not* the vagina). \",\"THE WHITE HOUSE                      Office of the Press Secretary  _____________________________________________________________________ For Immediate Release                                   April 5, 1993                               PRESS BRIEFING                        BY GEORGE STEPHANOPOLOUS                             The Briefing Room    10:10 A.M. EDT              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As you know, the President is soon  to be on his way, on Amtrack to Camden Yards.  He'll be throwing out  the first pitch.              Q   It's MARC, the Maryland Area Transit, it's not  Amtrack.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, it's not Amtrack?  Well, he's  going from Union Station, you're right.  Excuse me.              Q   George, what exactly are you prepared to do to  break the logjam with  ??? Senate?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, there are  discussions between Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole this morning,  and I think that the President is going to continue to make the point  that he believes that our investment package, our jobs package needs  to be passed as quickly as possible.  We need this investment for  summer jobs, for immunization, for highway construction, for the  important programs that will put people back to work right away this  summer.  And the President continues to believe his program should be  passed.              Q   Will he compromise, that's the question?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, the discussions  are going on this morning in the Senate betwen Senator Mitchell and  Senator Dole, let's see what they come up with.  But the President  believes his jobs program should go forward.              Q   George, would the President be willing to accept $8  billion for one year, which apparently appears to be the compromise  being offered by --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I don't know what is being  offered by either side.  The Senate discussions are going on right  now, let's see what happens today.              Q   Would he go that far -- no matter what the  Republicans have offered so far, would he go that far, $8 billion per  year?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that his  program should be passed at this time.  Clearly, we're going to be  willing to listen to what the Senators might or might not be able to  come up with, but I'm not going to get into figures right now.  Let's  see what happens.              Q   It's reasonable to assume, isn't it, from what has  happened so far that a compromise is going to be necessary in order  to get a vote?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the Republicans seem more  intrested in stopping progress on the President's jobs bill, than in  doing something to create --  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the  Republicans seem more interested in stopping progress on the  President's jobs bill than in doing something to create real action,  real jobs this summer for the American people.  I think there's no  question about that.  There's been some frustration of legislative  activity over the last few days.              Q   So, you'll need to compromise to get your package  through?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We'll see what happens with the  conversations between Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole this morning.              Q      prepared to compromise --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President's prepared to listen  to what Senator Mitchell has to say this morning after his meeting  with Senator Dole.               Q   Does he feel that he has been defeated in his --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not in the least.  In fact, he's  been very successful so far in the beginning of his term.              Q   How?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He passed his budget in record  time, in six weeks, and it's a budget which reduces the deficit by  $500 billion over five years.  And it's a budget which provides for  important investments in our future.  Right now we've also had strong  passage of his jobs program through the House.  Simply because a  minority of Republicans in the Senate choose to perpetuate gridlock  and hold up action on the President's jobs program is not a sign that  he is not succeeding overall.              Q   He can't beat this, can he?              Q   The fact is they can do that?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the Republicans can stop  action.  There's no question about that.              Q   What are you going to do about it?              Q   George, what do you know about these alleged notes  taken by Boris Yeltsin during one of the meetings in which it appears  that the President told Boris Yeltsin not to trust the Japanese; that  when they say yes they mean no?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's a complete  misreading of what happened at the meeting.  The context of the  conversation was that President Clinton was actually reassuring  President Yeltsin at the time about his conversations with Prime  Minister Miyazawa over the Kuril Islands and the Prime Minister's  belief that Japan would play a constructive role in the G-7 process.   I mean this was a casual comment about Japanese courtesy and  etiquette but overall it was in the context of a conversation where  he was reassuring President Yeltsin that he believed the Japanese  were serious about their commitment to the G-7 process.              Q    Are you saying that the President said that when  the Japanese say yes they mean no?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's not -- I don't know the  exact words and there was a much longer discussion about he did say  something along the lines that he believes that on this issue Prime  Minister Miyazawa intends to really go forward with the G-7 process.              Q   Have there been any attempts to explain this to the  Japanese because apparently the Japanese press has picked this up and  there appears to be --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I've seen the reports in the  Japanese press and it actually does put the situation in context.  It  does talk about the Japanese -- understanding the Japanese points of  view.  I don't think it's going to be a problem.  I believe that  there may have been some diplomatic context just to clear things up  but I'm not positive.              Q   George, was the specific comment that was made  specific to the Kuril Island situation or was it a general  observation on Japanese etiquette?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The discussion was about --              Q   The specific comment is what I'm asking about that  has alleged to have been translated from the Russian notes, \\\"when the  Japanese say yes they mean no.\\\"              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, it was a combination.  I mean  I don't think that's the whole sentence.  I think that the specific  comment was a broad, general observation followed up by a specific  finish to the sentence where he said in this case he believes that  Prime Minister Miyazawa means to keep the commitment.              Q   Was he saying it facetiously first?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it was just a casual  observation.              Q   And then you say diplomatic contacts were made to  clear it up.  Has the President sent a message?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, I don't think the President  spoke; I believe that Secretary Christopher has made some calls but  I'm not sure exactly how many.              Q   Well, this obviously is a bigger deal than you're  making it out to be if Christopher has had to make some calls.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, no.  It was just that we got  the reports in Vancouver and the Secretary wanted to make sure that  it was understood and make sure there was absolutely no        MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- reports in Vancouver, and the  Secretary wanted to make sure that it was understood, and make sure  there is absolutely no misunderstanding, and I don't believe there is  on.              Q   What is our position about the Japanese?  That they  may have to say one thing, but actualy mean another?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  The position on the Japanese  is as the President stated to President Yeltsin throughout the two  days.  He said that he had had a good conversation with Prime  Minister Miazawa prior to the Summit.  He reiterated the U.S.  position, the long-standing support for the Japanese position on the  Kuril Islands, but also reiterated Prime Minister Miazawa's  commitment to move forward on the G-7 process and to play a  constructive role.  And I think President Yeltsin was very glad to  hear that.              Q   After listening to Secretary Christopher on Iraq  for the last few days, I'm a little confused.  What is the U.S.  policy?  Do you want to see Saddam Hussein overturned?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's the same policy that Secretary  Christopher has reiterated, and all of the U.S officials have  reiterated.  We expect full and complete and unequivocal compliance  with all U.N. resolutions.  Right now we do not have that compliance.              Q      throwing it out further that if Iraq complies,  Saddam can't stay in office?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.  I think that that's -- our  judgment is that it is not possible for Saddam Hussein to comply with  the resolutions and stay in power.  But the important point is that  we expect compliance by Iraq with all U.N. resolutions, and we will  continue to demand it.              Q   And are you concerned the Iran will become the  dominant power in the area --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Secretary Christopher has also  spoken to Iran over the last several days, and he says we also expect  full Iranian compliance with all international norms, and stopping  support of terrorism.              Q   That's a very glib statement that he won't stay in  power if he complies with U.N. resolutions.  On what logic do you  base that?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right now Saddam Hussein is not  complying with the U.N. resolutions at all.  He is not respecting the  rights of his people, as is required by the U.N. resolution.  He is  not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding inspections.   He is not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding  armaments.              Q   Well, when do you think that if he did comply he  would be out of power?        MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, right now his power rests on  the repression of his people.  If he stopped doing that it would make  it more difficult for him to stay in power.              Q   George, back on the stimulus package, why is it  that you and the President accuse the Republicans of playing pure  politics and perpetuating gridlock?  Why is it that -- what evidence  do you have that they just don't have a genuine idealogical  difference with you that's in good faith?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the fact that several times  in the past the Republicans, many of the ones who are now leading the  fight for the filibuster, have supported the very funding they now  seek to stop, most especially, the highway funding.                Q   George, in regards to that, some of the moderate  Republicans said that the White House erred by not being more open to  them during the -- while the plan was put together, that they had  one, sort of, proforma meeting between the White House and the Senate  Republicans, and that was it.  Does the Administration look back and  thinks perhaps it could have done a better job of working with some - -              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I'm not sure that it's true  that there was only one meeting.  I mean, the President met with the  Republican leadership on at least two occasions before the  introduction of his package.  He met with the entire Senate  Republican Caucus also for lunch, and went up there.  We are  continually in contact with as many Republicans as we can find who  have an interest in the President's package.  We are interested in  what they have to say, as well.  But we believe that this program is  important, and we're going to continue to fight for it.              Q      your all or nothing, do it with the Democrats  alone strategy, did you maybe miscalculate the ability to get it  through?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean, I think that there is  no question that under the Senate rules a determined minority can  frustrate activity.  I mean, there is just no question about that.   You only need 40 plus one to keep going.  40 plus one to keep going  and to stop any action, and that's what the Republicans are doing.              Q      going to rethink the way you attempt to get  other things passed as you go through this process for the rest of  the summer?              Q      work with Republicans and try to woo some  Republicans into your camp?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we're going to continue to  look for the support of Republicans whenever we can get it on the  President's intiatives?              Q   But on this one -- how are you going to do it  differently than you did it on this one because on this one you  really did stiff the Republicans from the beginning and made it clear  that it was a Democratic majority that would get this through and  could get it through and you really didn't need Republican votes?   Are you going to take a different tack when you have to go for  particular votes?  When you have to go through --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't see into the future and  understand every possible turn in the legislative road.  Clearly the  President's going to continue to reach out when he can.              Q   You don't have any regrets then about the way you  have handled it up to now and you don't plan any changes in your  approach in dealing with the Republicans in Congress based on this  experience?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Obviously the President would like  his package passed as quickly as possible and he's going to continue  to press for that.  We will continue to reach out to Republicans,  there's not question about that.  And we'll continue to reason with  them and try and find appropriate avenues for cooperation.  In this  case the Republicans have chosen to unify around a filibuster, around  a plan to frustrate action not a plan to move forward.              Q   They're being denied any other legislative means of  putting their proposals forward.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think they're being --              Q      any ideas.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think their amendments are being  defeated; I don't know that they're being denied.              Q      to present them.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's not exactly true.  I mean  they get the votes --              Q      that theirs can be passed though by the  parliamentary rules under which they're playing.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Unless they get a majority in  support all the way around, no, that's not exactly true.              Q   George, one more on Iraq.  Is the administration  backing any of the Iraqi opposition?  Grooming any new leadership?              Q      backing any of the Iraqi -- leadership?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, I -- again, we're pressing for  Iraqi compliance.  I don't know if we can get into the business of  grooming leadership.  I believe there have been some contacts, at  some levels, with Iraqi opposition groups.  I don't know  about  anything recently.              Q      Jesse Jackson, who, of course, is not the  President's best friend, has, however, been told that there is to be  some kind of town meeting, or some kind of involvement by the  President, pre-empted the ball game -- Los Angeles.  Will he consider  something like that, or any other kind of intervention there?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, the President  appointed Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, about 10 days ago, to be a  special envoy to California, and coordiante cabinet activities around  the California economic situation, including the situation in Los  Angeles.                I believe there will also be visits out to Los Angeles  by the Education -- or have been visits by the Education Secretary,  Mr. Riley.  I believe that Transportation Secretary Pena and HUD  Secretary Cisneros are also going out.  And there may be other visits  by Cabinet officials over the next several days and weeks.  I  wouldn't rule out the possibility of a visit by President Clinton to  California.  Obviously, he is following the situation closely, and is  concerned about making sure that we make the right long term policy  decisions that will help create the kind of economic opportunities  which help prevent disturbances.  But we're going to continue to  watch it.              Q   George, as a follow-up, Reverend Jackson is also  supposed to be outside the ball park today, in Baltimore, with a  group of supporters protesting the lack of minorities in baseball  management.  Does the President have a position on that?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has received  correspondence from Reverend Jackson.  I know that Reverend Jackson  has also spoken with the White House Chief of Staff, Mack McLarty.   He clearly raises serious questions.  There has been some progress in  baseball over the last several years, but still not enough.  But the  President intends to continue to go to the ball game.              Q   Is he going to say anything about it today, or see  Reverend Jackson while he's out there?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if he is going to see  them, but as I said, the President believes that Reverend Jackson has  raised some serious questions, and it's something that, as I said,  even though there has been progress, it's clearly not enough.              Q   Did Reverend Jackson ask him not to go to the ball  game?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure about that.  I believe  the characterization the Reverend Jackson is talking about is an  informational pickett.  I don't know that he asked him not to go to  the ball game, but he sent a long, detailed, formal letter outlining  his concerns with the situation in major league baseball and the  President read it.              Q   George, the Orioles are playing the Rangers, the  managing partner of the Rangers is George W. Bush.  Is he going to be  there, and is he going to meet with the President?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.              Q   What is the Mubarak schedule?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I know that President Mubarak is  coming tomorrow morning for a working meeting, they will have a  lunch, and I believe that he is having dinner tonight with Vice  President Gore.              Q   And joint statements tomorrow --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe so, yes.  At the end,  yes.              Q   Is there evidence, George, that the Egyptians did  warn the U.S. about a potential terrorist bombing -- terrorist  activities?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As reported in The New York Times,  I mean, I think that President Mubarak did say that there has been  general conversations with the Egyptians, as there have been for a  long period of time.  We do have general intelligence sharing, I  mean.  But President Mubarak was very careful to point out that there  was no specific information on this visit that was passed forward.   The President will continue to investigate the situation, but he also  reiterates his belief that we cannot tolerate terrorism of any kind.              Q   George, he did make specific -- or the Egyptians,  apparently, did issue specific warnings about this individual who,  forgive me --this individual who, forgive me the name escapes me at  the moment, and said the Egyptians were more or less rebuffed in  their attempts to get some kind of action.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know if I would  agree with your characterization of the Mubarak interview.  He did  say that they gave general warnings about the possibility of a  network in the United States and upon which we took appropriate  action.  But there was no specific information on this specific  operation at all.              Q   So, the White House doesn't feel that any of the  law enforcement agencies whether it be the CIA or FBI who would have  received this kind of information was lax or derelict in its duty in  not pursuing some kind of --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, not at all.              Q   What's next with Serbia?  It got only a passing  mention in the news conference yesterday --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  You didn't get to ask your  question.              Q   Yes, exactly.  Was there any agreement on concerted  action between the two countries?  And even if there wasn't, what  does the U.S. do next?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the U.S. is clearly going  to move forward in the U.N. today continuing discussions with our  allies on a sanctions resolution and we'll continue to look for ways  to press the Serbians to come to the negotiating table and sign an  agreement.              Q   George, why do you think sanctions is still an  option?  I mean the Serbians make it clear that at least the  leadership is surviving just fine and they feel like they can wait  you out and even the administration officials we had in the other day  said there's no evidence that they're going to have an effect any  time soon.  The Bosnian Serbs have said no to the peace plan.  When  does no mean no and you have to do something different?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean we are doing something  different.  We're moving forward on further sanctions through the  U.N. and those discussions will continue.  We're going to continue to  try and tighten the noose on Serbia, and I think that every  opportunity we have to do that will have an effect over time.              Q   Are we looking again at lifting the arms embargo?  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has said that this is something  that is under consideration.              Q   George, do you have any more on Hugh Rodham's  condition, how he's doing?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As far as I know nothing's changed.              Q   George, -- week after Mr. Mubarak?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's a little unclear.  I think  we'll be able to get you more either tonight or tomorrow morning  after the Mubarak visit.              Q   Is he going somewhere for Easter?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not that I know of.              Q   What more can you tell us about the additional aid  to Russia that the President plans to ask Congress about?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's going to be consulting with  the Congress and with our G-7 partners over the next couple of weeks.   I know that he spoke last evening with Congressman Gephardt and their  delegation before the -- the congressional delegation meets with the  Russians this week and those consultations will continue over the  next several weeks.              Q   Do you expect that package to be of the magnitude  of the one announced Sunday?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not going to discuss the  magnitude.              Q   How about the list of Cold War restrictions, where  do you stand on that --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As the President said yesterday,  he's going to be looking for that list from the Congress this week  and reviewing it.  He believes -- he's going to try and get it this  week and he's going to review the list, and we're going to take a  hard look at it.              Q   But they're making it up?  I mean it's no White  House involvement, Congress is compiling this list?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he's going to talk to the  congressional leaders about compiling the list but I'm certain we'll  be able to get our own researchers working as well.              Q   George, isn't lifting the arms embargo more of a  probability than a possibility?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's something that's under  discussion.              Q   Secretary Christopher has said that it's a matter  of time and -- for months before that happens.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, all I can say is that it's  something that the President is reviewing.  Right now we're working  with our allies in the U.N on a sanctions resolution, and we'll  continue to review other matters.              Q   George, can you tell us anything about the schedule  this week?  Any travel?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They just asked about that.  I  don't have anything more beyond tomorrow's visit with Mubarak right  now.              Q   Are there consultations, George, with any Jewish  American organizations concerning Jackson-Vanick?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As you know the National Conference  of Soviet Jewry has a list of, I believe,        MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- as you know, the National  Conference of Soviet Jewry has a list of, I believe, 200 Refuseniks.   We'll certainly take a look at that and continue appropriate  discussions.              Thanks. \",\"Yes,  Take Interstate I-70 to the route 48 exit.  Go south on 48 about 2-1/2 miles.  Trun right on Shiloh Springs Road.  The hamvention is at the Harrah arena, which is about 1 mile west and on the north side of the Road.  Parking at the arena is limited.  Lodging is probably entirely booked-up within a 40 mile radius.  Good luck.                  |                |                 48               I75                 |                | ----------I70----------....---------                 |                |                 |                |           X     |                | (mall)  --------|                |    S. Springs   |  It is possible to park at the mall to the west.  There are shuttle busses running between the arena and the mall.  If possible, get a Montgomery County, OH map from your local AAA office.  It should be free if you are an AAA member.  If you don't already have definite plans, now is not a particularly good time to start to think about going to the hamvention.   \",\" They tried their best not to show it, believe me. I'm surprised they couldn't find a sprint car race (mini cars through pigpens, indeed!) on short notice.  George\",\"   I think that you are changing the meaning of \\\"values\\\" here. Perhaps it is time to backtrack and take a look at the word.  value n. 1. A fair equivalent or return for something, such as goods or service. 2. Monetary or material worth. 3. Worth as measured in  usefulness or importance; merit. 4. A principle, standard, or quality considered inherently worthwhile or desirable. 5. Precise meaning, as of a word. 6. An assigned or calculated numerical quantity. 7. Mus.  The relative duratation of a tone or rest. 8. The relative darkness or lightness of a color. 9. The distinctive quality of a speech or speech sound.   In context of a moral system, definition four seems to fit best. In terms of scientific usage, definitions six or eight might apply. Note that these definitions do not mean the same thing.  In my mind, to say that science has its basis in values is a bit of a reach. Science has its basis in observable fact. Even the usages of the word \\\"value\\\" above do not denote observable fact, but rather a standard of measurement. I would conclude that science does not have its basis in values, and so your statement above fails. In fact, if one concludes that a scientific set of measurements (values) are based on systems derived from observation, then it must follow that in a scientific context, there is no such thing as there is no such thing as \\\"objective values.\\\"  Back to the present. This has nothing to do with a moral system anyhow. Just because the word \\\"values\\\" is used in both contexts does not mean that there is a relationship between the two contexts.  If one is to argue for objective values (in a moral sense) then one must first start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective. Considering the meaning of the word \\\"objective\\\" I doubt that this will ever happen.  So, back to the original question:  And objective morality is.....?  If you can provide an objective foundation for \\\"morality\\\" then that will be a good beginning. \",\" I think you meant Quadra 800 ..... (but a Centris 800 probably would be a real nice machine... :)  )  But yeah, it needs 80ns not 60ns.  Joel \",\" Ok, so there are in fact two distinct components transmitted by the chip; the real message encrypted with the \\\"conventional\\\" key, and the serial number and encrypted \\\"conventional\\\" key encrypted with the (IMHO kind of bogus, as the whole concept of \\\"one key that millions of people use which can't be changed\\\" doesn't seem reasonable) \\\"family key\\\".  Suppose I analyze the output of this chip and I'm able to determine which bits are the encrypted packet which contains the serial number and session key.  Suppose I also design a simple algorithm based on this information which takes the data containing the encrypted session key and twiddles a bit (or several) before it's sent down the line.  Mind you, I'm sure the NSA thought of this along with a dozen other attacks I can't imagine, and the system is probably somehow designed so that manipulation of this information will cause a compliant receiving chip to somehow fail to decrypt successfully.  But how? What if the two parties agree in advance on some kind of consistent bit-twiddling scheme, so the decryption chip sees the restored \\\"proper\\\" bitstream but an eavesdropper gets a E[K; UK] packet that's wrong?  I suppose this could be easily defeated if the chip \\\"sends\\\" that information out many times in slightly different ways, making it effectively impossible to be certain you know all the information being sent.\",\"I hope that this comes off as a somewhat unbiased assesment of WFAN and WIP(I go to school in Philadelphia, and I listen to both stations on a consistant basis.)  Now that the fan has Mike Lupica on from 10 to noon, they have a person who can get the  big name guests for interviews, and not just of local importance He did have Dave Cheketts and Fred Wilpon on his show, but he  had Bob Costas and Magic Johnson on too.     Now here are my opinions of the two stations competing talent: Morning show:   In my opinion, I think Imus is much better than Bruno, Cataldi,  and Morganti, even though I would feel different if Morganti had a better crew of people to work with.  To me, WIP tries to copy Imus but make it all sports as a theme.  In terms of sports, Imus lacks the blanketing of the airwaves, but he interjects humor and politics into his show. 10 AM to 12 Noon:   I think Chuck Cooperstein and Lupica are equal in their abilities to host a radio show, but I think Chuck has the advantage over Lupica in terms of dealing with the caller who is asking about who the local team is going to draft in the sixth round.  Lupica and the other hosts on FAN get better interview guests, but I heard the PD of WIP say that they were not interested in interviews with celebrities unless it was a major story.   I would consider this even because they are two different styles of host.  12 Noon to 2 PM:   At this point, I would have to give a big advantage to  Jody McDonald over Len Berman because Lenny has only been on for a couple of weeks.  I just think JM has the ability to transcend the \\\"homer\\\" mentality of the Philadelphia fan base.  This is most evident when the IGGLES(Philadelphia  spelling) play the Cowboys because JM is a huge Dallas fan. Where else can you have people call up and predict a 93-0 score without the egging of the hosts(re:WIP morning 'guys') I do agree that JM was great on the FAN weekend overnight and I miss hearing him over the current crop of rotating hosts.  I feel that JM is the best sportstalk host on  either station by a good margin.  If you are in NY and you can't get WIP, JM does fill in on the weekends sometimes.  2PM to 4PM:   This is the time when JM goes up against Francesa and  Russo(fatso and froot loops) and I become the most divided in my loyalties.  Mike and the dog are very entertaining, but they often go an hour or so without calls or even 10 to 20 minutes without talking about sports.  MATD do get great guests and that is the basis for their show, so it is like the 10 to 12 debate.  Another plus is the appearances by Mike and Chris on Imus in the Morning, which are often hilarious.    4 PM to 7 PM:   MATD go up against Fredericks and Missanelli.  I like Mike Missanelli but I just can't stomach Steve Fredericks.   I know that SF came from Philly originally, but when he was at the FAN, he was a NY homer as much as he is a Philly homer now.  I don't listen to WIP much after 4 PM unless there is a game on that night, but you will see later for the  reason.  That is why I give the advantage to FAN.  7 PM to Midnight:   S&M are on WIP until 8 and then it is the man who makes Eli that calls MATD all the time seem like a novice on charges of racism, G Cobb.  This man is so grating on my nerves that if I listen to him for a few minutes I go nuts.(I know that is biased, but listen to his show) On FAN, there is usually a game on, Knicks, Rangers, Mets Jets, or St. John's basketball.  If the game is on the west coast, then it is usually Howie Rose.  Of course I think dead air would be better than G Cobb on WIP, but WIP does air Sixers and Flyers games during the season. (If this is the sports station, why did they lose the IGGLES to WYSP(home of Howard Stern in Phil.)) During the summer, it is all talk on WIP.   Overall, I would have to give the advantage to WFAN, with the exception of 10 to 12, and 2 to 4 where it is even, and 12 to 2 where WIP has the advantage.                   Rich\",\"...

Most atheists are perfectly willing to acknowledge the existence and ministry of Jesus--but are quite capable of rationalizing the miracles and the resurrection into  misunderstandings, hoaxes, or simple fabrications.  They can always make an analogy with the _Iliad_, a book that tells the story of the historical Trojan War, but also talks about gods and goddesses and their conversations.   I don't think it's possible to convince atheists of the validity of  Christianity through argument.  We have to help foster faith and an understanding of God.  I could be wrong--are there any former atheists here who were led to Christianity by argument?\",\"Well, I'm back from Tokyo, so here are the standings after the April 13 update.   - Andrew  USENET Hockey Draft Standings Week 27  Posn Team    Pts Proj Cash Last Posn  1.

( I hope that this is the proper place to post this subject)    Why does a lead acid battery discharge and become dead (totally unuseable) when stored on a concrete floor?     I decided to bring the battery in from the lawn mower and the motorcycle from the unheated garage this year, *to preserve them* and I just went to use them and noticed that not only do they not work, but  they act like the two terminals are shorted.

Atheism was a characteristic of the Lenin-Stalin version of Socialism, nothing more. Another characteristic of Lenin-Stalin Socialism was the centralization of food distribution.  Would you therefore say that Stalin and Lenin killed millions in the name of rationing bread?  Of course not.    In earlier posts you stated that true (Muslim) believers were incapable of evil.  I suppose if you believe that, you could reason that no one has ever been killed in the name of religion.  What a perfect world you live in, Bobby.      Bobby is referring to a rather obscure law in _The Good Atheist's  Handbook_:  Law XXVI.A.3: Give that which you do not believe in a face.    You must excuse us, Bobby.  When we argue against theism, we usually argue against the Christian idea of God.  In the realm of Christianity, man was created in God's image.   \",\"April 1, 1993   I am participating in an NL-league that uses standard Rotisserie rules except that the following catagories are used:  For position players:  lowest batting average  strike-outs  caught-stealing  errors  For pitchers:  losses  blown saves  higest ERA  'taters allowed  This is the fifth year that I've participated in this Blowtisserie league.  Last year I won the pennant due primarily to the fact that I had terrible pitching.  I would like to lower my batting average which is rather high because I do have Jose Offerman (who made up for this by helping me lock first place in errors).

Of cause, the R4-version  did not know about the xpTableWidgetClass (we used tableWidgetClass    instead - caught from the net in times of R3) and XpTableChildPosition    (formerly XtTblPosition).  Since compiling with R5, the program causes a zero width or height error  (on sparc-stations). The trouble-shooter is the (re)computation of the  model_init_table - table widget: though its childs (label and asciiText   widgets) exist, XtQueryGeometry returns a prefered width and height of    zero.   Thus the following asignment cannot perform anything else but set the    width and height of the newly created widget to zero. No wonder XtPopup   or XtManage- Child create zero width or height errors (dependent on    whether width and height of the shell widget are set in the resource    file or not).    Question: Does anyone know, why XtQueryGeometry returns so low prefered    values when working on table widgets or perhaps what    to do about?   I'll be happy, if someone is able to help me.

Most of the other models are in the same class, but aren't the first cars you would think of. I threw in the Escort/Tracer because it has a good amount of Japanese technology and has similar reliability stats.  I didn't include domestic small cars such as the Cavalier, Sunbird, Shadow, Sundance, Tempo, and Topaz, since I think Saturn is going after cars that have at least some degree of Japanese roots.  The SC1/SC2 was meant to compete against the following cars:  Toyota Paseo Honda Civic Si/Civic Coupes/del Sol Si Nissan NX1600/NX2000 Mazda MX-3 Isuzu Impulse Geo Storm Ford Escort GT   If you look at the prices of these cars, they're more expensive than they're 4-door counterparts.  The is good reason for this.  It is a more upscale and trend-driven market.  Even though many of these models are based on sedan platforms, their interior, etc. is good enough to warrant slightly higher prices.  Here are some of the platform derivations I can think of:  Tercel -> Paseo Sentra -> NX1600/NX2000 Civic -> del Sol 323 -> MX-3 (not sure on this one) Stylus -> Impulse/Storm  To illustrate, a Tercel starts at around $8000, while the Paseo starts at around $11,000.  Even a 4-door Tercel will cost less than a 2-door Paseo.  Now, you might be saying that the Tercel doesn't offer the power that some 4-doors offer.  What I mean is that there is no 4-dr Tercel with a comparable powerplant as its sport coupe derivative.  Let's take another example: the Isuzu Stylus XS and Impulse XS/Storm GSi.  Both have the same powerplants (a 1.6L 140hp engine), but the smaller 2-dr coupes are generally more expensive. Again, this is because the two-door sport coupe market is a more fashion-oriented and trend-setting segment.  People are willing to pay more money for this type of car.     In short, even though the SC1/SC2 may be smaller, hence \\\"less\\\" car, it's market orientation dictates a slightly higher price than its mechanically equivalent sedan (SL1/SL2) version.

The training course will discuss the applications of satellite data concerning natural resources, renewable energy and the environment.  The training course, organised for the benefit of francophone African experts, will be hosted by ESRIN, the European Space Agency's establishment in Frascati, which is responsible for coordination with the users of data from ESA's remote sensing satellite. Twenty-four experts in the field of remote sensing, selected from 19 francophone countries from northern, western and central Africa, and three regional African centres, will attend the two-week session. The course will focus on remote sensing techniques and data applications, particularly ERS-1 data.  The ERS-1 satellite, developed by ESA and launched in 1991 with the European Ariane launcher, carries an advanced radar instrument and is the first in a series of radar remote sensing missions that will ensure availability of data beyond the year 2000. The aim of the training course is to increase the potential of experts using the practical applications of radar remote sensing systems to natural resources, renewable energy and the environment, with particular emphasis on applications to geology and mineral prospecting, oceanography and near- coastal areas, agriculture, forestry and meteorology.  The education and practical training programme was developed jointly by the United Nations and ESA. The facilities and the technical support, as well as lecturers and information documents for the training course, will be provided by the Agency. Lecturers at the training course will include high-level experts from other European and African organisations active in remote sensing applications. Funds for the training course are being provided by the United Nations    Trust Fund for New and Renewable Sources of Energy; the primary contributor to that Fund is the Government of Italy.\",\" There was a recession, and none of the potential entrants could raise any money.

I fully agree with you that there is a big distinction between the *process* of science and the end result.    As an end result of science, one wants to get results that are objectively verifiable.  But there is nothing objective about the *process* of science.    If good empirical research were done and showed that there is some merit to homeopathic remedies, this would certainly be valuable information. But it would still not mean that homeopathy qualifies as a science.  This is where you and I disagree with Turpin.  In order to have science, one must have a theoretical structure that makes sense, not a mere collection of empirically validated random hypotheses.  Experiment and empirical studies are an important part of science, but they are merely the culmination of scientific research.  The most important part of true scientific methodology is SCIENTIFIC THINKING.   Without this, one does not have any hypotheses worth testing.  (No, hypotheses do not just leap out at you after you look at enough data. Nor do they simply come to you in a flash one day while you're shaving or looking out the window.  At least not unless you've done a lot of really good thinking beforehand.)    The difference between a Nobel Prize level scientist and a mediocre scientist does not lie in the quality of their empirical methodology.   It depends on the quality of their THINKING.    It really bothers me that so many graduate students seem to believe that they are doing science merely because they are conducting empirical studies.  And it bothers me even more that there are many fields, such as certain parts of psychology, where there seems to be no thinking at all,  but mere studies testing ad hoc hypotheses.    And I'm especially offended by Russell Turpin's repeated assertion that science amounts to nothing more than avoiding mistakes.  Simply avoiding mistakes doesn't get you anywhere.    -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems  less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \",\"Finally got my computer fixed and I'd like to sum up.

I honestly hope that people who believe in the bible understand that it is just one of the religious texts out there and that it is one of the poorer quality ones to boot.

[1]  Born 1964 Secretary-Typist Azsantekmontazh Trust Sumgait Construction and Installation Administration Secretary of the SMU Komsomol Organization  Resident at Building 17/33B, Apartment 15 Microdistrict No. 3 Sumgait [Azerbaijan]   On the 27th my sister Marina and I went to the movies the seven o'clock show, at the theater that is across from the City Party Committee, about 50 yards  away. The SK theater. They were showing an Argentinian film, \\\"The Abyss.\\\"  Before the film we noticed about 60 to 70 people standing near the podium at  the City Party Committee, but they were silent, there's no conversation  whatsoever, and we couldn't figure out what was going on. That is, we knew it  was about Karabagh, but what it was exactly, what they were talking about, if  someone gave a speech or not, we didn't know. We bought our tickets. There  were 30 or 40 people in the theater. This was a very small number for that  large movie theater. The film started. About 30 minutes later they stopped the film. A crowd burst in. About 60 people. They came up onto the stage. Well  mostly they were young people, from 16 to 23 years old. They demanded that an  Armenian woman come up onto the stage. They used foul language and said that  they were going to show what Azerbaijanis were capable of, what they could do  to Armenian girls. I thought that's what they meant because they had demanded  a girl specifically. Marina and I were sitting together. I told her to move  over, there were some Russian girls sitting nearby. So that if someone  recognized me or if something happened, they would take me, and not Marina.  It got quiet, 2 or 3 girls jumped up to run out, but the door was closed--it's only opened at the end of the   show--and they returned to their seats.  Everyone in the theater was looking at one another, Russians, Azerbaijanis,  people of various nationalities. But no one reacted at all, no one in the  auditorium made a sound. They were silent, looking at one another, and  gradually started to leave. Some guy, a really fat one, says, \\\"OK, we've  scared them enough, let's leave.\\\" They leave slowly, pompously. It seemed to  me that those people were not themselves. Either they had smoked a bunch of  \\\"anasha\\\", or had taken something else, because they all looked beastly, like  they were ready to tear anyone apart. Then it was all over, as though nothing  had happened at all. The film started up again, it was one of those cheerful  films which should have only brought pleasure, made you happy to be alive. We  could barely sit to the end. So it had started at seven it was over by nine,  and it was dark . . .  Marina and I were walking home, Lenin Street, that's the center of town. Lenin Street was packed, just packed with young people. They were shouting,  something about Karabagh and something about Armenians. We weren't especially  listening, because the way we were feeling we didn't know if we were going to  make it home or not, and just what had happened anyway? Public transportation  wasn't running. Incidentally, when we came out of the theater we saw police,  policemen standing there. The director of the movie theater was looking at the doors, because when they were leaving they had broken the glass, the doors  there are basically all glass. Everything was broken. He stood there grief- stricken, but looking as though nothing really big had happened, like some  naughty boys had just broken them quite by accident, with a slingshot. Well,  since he looked more or less calm I decided that, nothing all that super  serious had happened. We went out very slowly; we wanted to catch a bus, we  live literally one stop away. We didn't want to go on foot, not because it was dark, but because something might happen. We flagged down a cab, but the  driver didn't want to take us. We told him we live near the bus station, and  he said he'd take us to the bus station and not a yard farther. I said, well,  OK . . .  So we got into the cab and managed to get there. Something incredible was  happening at the bus station. There was a traffic jam. Public transportation  was at a standstill and everyone was shouting \\\"Ka-ra-bagh,\\\" they're not going  to give up Karabagh. I go home and tell my family what's going on, and there's immediate panic in the house. Mamma says, what should we do? Like the end had  come, they were going to come, kill us, that's it . . . Somehow we managed to  cheer ourselves up: Nothing that bad could happen. Where are we living anyway, just what kind of social order do we have? Somehow we manage to calm Mamma  down. And we went to bed. But no one could sleep. Everyone made as though  nothing had happened.  That was on Saturday. In short, the day went by. We didn't go anywhere and  didn't call our relatives. No one did anything. Because . . . life goes on. That day I realized something was approaching, but what exactly, I couldn't guess.  On the 28th everything was like it was supposed to be, we lived like we always had. There were five of us at home: Mamma, Papa and us, three sisters: Lyuda,  Marina, and I. My sister Lyuda was in Yerevan at the time. We sat at home and  no one went out. Later we learned that a demonstration had started that  morning. It all started . . . They were smashing up stores. We were sitting at home and didn't know anything about it. Then a girlfriend of mine, Lyuda  Zimogliad, came by at around three o'clock I think. We worked together, we did our apprenticeships together, she's a Russian girl. She said that something awful was happening in town. I asked, \\\"Don't they want Armenians? Well what  are they after, if they're already in that state?\\\" She says, no, nothing like  that, it's just a demonstration, but it's awful to watch it. Somehow, it feels like a war has broken out. Public transportation has been stopped . . . The  cabs, the buses, well it's just a nightmare.  Then Papa decides to go to the drugstore, my mother was having allergy  problems at the time . . . He left the house and our neighbor, Aunt Vera, asked him, \\\"Where are you going? Stop! There are such terrible things going on in the courtyard; aren't you afraid to go out?\\\" Papa didn't know what she was talking about. She simply pushed him back into the entryway. He came home  and told Mamma. Mamma said, \\\"Well, if Aunt Vera was talking like that it means that something is really going on.\\\" But we didn't go see her, she's a Russian, she lives across from us. I had to see my friend out. Around five o'clock I  tell Lyuda, \\\"Ok, look, it's time for you to go, it's late already, I'll see  you out.\\\" Mamma says, \\\"You don't need to go, it's too late already, you can  see what the situation in town is.\\\" So we decided to stay home. Dinner was  ready. Mamma says, \\\"Let her eat with us, then she can go.\\\" We sat down at the  table. But no one was hungry, no one was in the mood, we just put everything  out on the table to calm ourselves down, and make it appear that we're eating. We turned on the television, and the show \\\"In Fairy-Tale Land\\\" was coming on.  We cleared the table.  We hear some noise out in the courtyard. I go out on the balcony, but I can't  see what's going on, because the noise is coming from the direction of the bus station, and there is a 9-story building in the way. There is mob of people  . . . I can't figure out what's happening. They're shouting something, looking somewhere, I can't make out what is going on. I go down to a neighbor, she's  an Azerbaijani; we've been friends of her family for about 25 years. I go down to look from their place. I see people shouting, looking at the 5-and 9-story  buildings near the bus station. Just then soldiers set upon them, about 20  people, with clubs. The mob runs off in different directions. I even see  several people from our building. They are looking and laughing . . . I decide that means it's not all that bad if they are laughing: it means they're not  killing anyone. But now the crowd suddenly dashes toward the soldiers. One of  the soldiers cannot manage to get away, they start stomping on him with their  feet, everyone's kicking him . . . I become ill and go home, and explain in  general terms that horrible things are going on out there . . .  can't speak . . . Well, they've probably killed that soldier, the way that crowd is . . . If each of them kicked him just once . . . They took his club away from him and started to beat him with it. But it was far away and I couldn't see if he got up and left or not.  I become terrified and go home and say, \\\"Lyuda, don't go anywhere, stay at our place, because if you go out they could kill you or . . . \\\" Then the crowd  runs over closer toward our building and stands at the 12-story building and  starts shouting something. We go out onto the balcony. All of our neighbors  are also out on theirs, too. Everyone is standing, staring. The mob is  shouting and about 5 minutes later comes running toward our building. As it  turns out, at the 12-story building the Azerbaijani neighbors went down and  kept them from coming in. There's only one entryway there, they could stop  them.  They all run up to our building. Mamma immediately starts closing the windows, afraid that they might throw stones. They have stones and they break the  windows, all of them. There are very many people. We have a large courtyard,  and it's packed with people. They spill up to the first floor so they don't  crush each other. They crawl up on trees, posts, and garages. It's just a huge cloud of people. They break and burn the motorcycle of the Armenian Sergey  Sargisian, from our building. We close the windows and immediately hear  tramping in our entryway. They come up to our fifth floor with a tremendous  din and roar. It's incomprehensible. Mamma told me later that they were  shouting Father's name, \\\"Grisha, open the door, we've come to kill you!,\\\" or something like that. I don't remember that, I was spaced out, kind of. Mamma  says, \\\"Into the bedroom, quickly!\\\" In the bedroom we have two tall beds, part  of our dowry; Mamma says, \\\"Hide there, they probably won't come in there,  they'll ask something, say something, and leave.\\\" She says, \\\"We'll tell them  that we live alone here.\\\" I can't imagine that my parents will stand out in  the hall alone talking with some sort of beasts . . . I go to them and say  that I'll stand together with them, I'll talk with them if they come, maybe I  can find a common language with them, all the more so if they know me: I speak  Azerbaijani more or less, and I can find out what they want. I told Marina and Lyuda to hide under the bed, and my sister Lyuda, I can't remember if I told  her anything or not.  Then . . . they open the door: it's like they blew on it and it broke and fell right into the hall. The crows bursts in and starts to shout: Get out of here, leave, vacate the apartment and go back to your Armenia; things like that. I tell them, \\\"What has happened, speak calmly. One of you, tell me, calmly, what has happened.\\\" In Azerbaijani, they say, \\\"Get out of the apartment, leave.\\\" I  say, \\\"OK. Go downstairs. We'll gather everything we need and leave the  apartment.\\\" I realize that it is senseless to discuss any sort of rights with them, these are animals. They must be stopped. The ones standing in the doorway, the young guys, say, \\\"There are old people and one girl with them. Too bad!\\\" They take two or three steps back. It seems as though I have pacified them with our exchange. Then someone in the courtyard shouts,  commanding them: \\\"Don't you understand what you are saying? Kill them?\\\"  And that was it! That was all it took. They grab Papa, carry him into one room, and Mamma and me into another. They put Mamma on the bed and start  undressing her, beating her legs. They start tearing my clothes, right there,  in front of Mamma. I don't remember where they went, what they did, or how  much time passed. I had the feeling that they beat me on the head, on my body, and tore my clothes, all at the same time, I don't even know what I said. The  atrocities started. I was savagely raped in that room. They argued among  themselves who would go first.  Later, I remember, I came to. I don't know if I'm dead or alive. Someone comes in, someone tall, I think, clean-shaven, in an Eskimo dogskin coat, balding.  He looks around at what's happening. At that instant everything stops. It  seems to me that he is either their commander or . . . that somehow everything depends on him. He looks and says, \\\"Well, we're done here.\\\" They are beating Mamma on the head. They break up the chairs and beat her with the chair legs  . . . She loses consciousness, and they decide that she's dead. Papa . . . was out cold. They want to throw Lyuda off the balcony, but they can't get the  window open. Apparently the window frames are stuck after the rain and the  windows can't be opened. They leave her next to the window. She was thinking  about being thrown out the window and passed out. She's not a real strong  person anyway . . . He looks at me and sees that I'm saying something, that I'm still twitching. Well, I start saying the opposite of what I should be,  which is humbling myself and pleading. I start shouting, cursing . . . they  don't get any entreaty out of me. I  already know that I'm dead, why would I  humble myself before anyone? And he says that if that's what I think, since my tongue is so long . . . maybe he thinks that I still look quite appealing  . . . In short, he commands that I be taken outside.  I no longer saw or remembered what was happening to Marina and Lyuda, I don't  know if they are alive or not. They take me outside. They are dragging me by  my arms, by my legs. They are hitting me against the wall, the railings,  something metal . . . While they are carrying me someone is biting me, someone else is pinching me . . .I don't even know. I think, my God, when will death  come? If only it were sooner . . . Then . . . they carry me out, throw me near the entryway . . . and start kicking me. I lose consciousness . . . What  happened after that, how many people there were, I don't remember.   I come to after a while, I don't remember how long. A neighbor is bringing me  clothing. I'm entirely covered with blood, she puts a dress on me. I remember  that I said the same words over and over again: \\\"Mamma, what happened, Mamma,  what have they done to us, where are we, whose house are we at?\\\" I can't make  sense out of anything. There is a guy standing over me, I sort of know him, he served in Afghanistan, his name is Igor, he brought me indoors. When they all  went to the third entryway and killed a person there, Igor gathered his  courage, took me into his arms, and brought me to the neighbors', even though  he's small-minded, he put himself at risk. Igor Agayev is Azerbaijani; he  served in Afghanistan. There are three brothers. The older brother also served there, I think; now he's stationed here, on the border, in Armenia. Igor  brought me to the neighbors', and then helped me come to my senses, saying,  \\\"Karina, I know you, calm down, I'm not one of them.\\\" How do I know who's who  and what's what? I come to, and they clean me up. I was covered in blood. Then Papa . . . I saw Papa, I saw Mamma. And Marina, too . . . Igor was there when  they dragged Marina and Lyuda out from under the bed . . . Marina . . . Lyuda  said that she was Russian, they said, we'll let you go, we aren't touching the Russians, go. And while they are dragging Marina out she decides she's going  to tell them she's Azerbaijani. Igor immediately grabs Marina's and Lyuda's  hands, because he knows Marina, and knows that she is Armenian and is our  sister, and takes her to the second floor to a neighbor's and starts pounding  on the door so she will open up. She opens the door and Igor pushes them in  there. So they survived.  My sister Lyuda lost consciousness after the bandits started stealing things. While they were going downstairs, taking things downstairs, then coming back  up again, Lyuda seized the opportunity and crawled under the bed and stayed  there. Then, when she was herself again, she found a torn night shirt and put  it on, and some sort of robe and went to a neighbor's on the fourth floor, the one whose apartment I had watched the crowd from, the friend of ours, and  knocked on the door. The neighbor opened and said, \\\"I'm not going to let you  in the apartment because I'm afraid of them. But I'll give you some stockings  and we'll leave the building.\\\" Lyuda says, \\\"I'll stay at your place because of what's going on, they keep going up and down the stairs.\\\" It was just for a  moment, just a moment in life, but the neighbor wouldn't consent. Lyuda came  back to our place and lay under the bed . . .  I came to. Mother was there. I can't remember my supervisor's telephone  number, but something had to be done. Somehow I remembered and called, and he  came to get us. He didn't have any idea what was going on. He thought we were  simply afraid, he didn't know that they were killing us and that we had passed between life and death. He came and got us and took us to the police precinct. There they looked us over. I was having trouble walking, my lungs hurt badly,  it was hard to breathe . . .  My supervisor's name is Urshan Feyruzovich Mamedov. He's the head of our  administration. They took us there. When we were leaving, I saw a great number of buses full of soldiers at the entrance to town. The buses were ordinary  passenger buses. There were very many soldiers. We left around eleven, right  after eleven. If these people could stop what was happening they could save a  great many lives . . . Because the crowd was moving on, toward the school, and what was going on there . . . I think everyone know not only in Sumgait, not  only in Yerevan. Because there they murdered them all one after the next,  without stopping. After us.  I think 14 people died in Microdistrict No. 3, and 10 to 12 of them were from Buildings 4, 5, and 6. In our building one person died, and one old woman died from Building 16, that's the building in front of ours. There young  Azerbaijani men stopped the mob and wouldn't let it into their building.  Incidentally, when we were at the neighbors', Marina called our relatives to warn them, so they would all know what was happening. I called a aunt in  Microdistrict No. 5. They have three neighbors who are Armenians. I said, \\\"Run quickly, I can't explain what's going on; hide, do what you can, just stay alive. Hide at Azerbaijanis', ones who won't give you away.\\\" At that moment  three people came in, policemen. I think they were Azerbaijanis. I was in such awful condition, my face was completely distorted my lips were puffed up,  there was blood, my eye was swollen, no one thought I would ever see anything  out of that eye again . . . my forehead was badly cut, and one-half of my face was pushed out forward. No one would have thought that I would survive, get my normal appearance back, and be able to grasp anything at all. I started to  scream at those people, why did you come, who sent you here, no one wants you  here, haven't you killed people people yet, what are you doing here? One of  the soldiers said, \\\"Don't scream at us. We're Muslims, but we're not from the  Sumgait police. They called in from Daghestan.\\\" So at that point the  Daghestan police were there.  When we got to the police precinct there were an awful lot of police there, there were soldiers, police with dogs, ambulances, firemen . . . I don't know, maybe they were waiting for people to bring them the goners and the seriously  injured to treat them there in the police precinct. I don't know what they  were there for. There were also doctors from Baku there. They examined Lyuda  and me and said, \\\"These women need to go to the Maternity Home, but we don't  know what to do with the rest.\\\"  So they took us, and I lost contact with my parents, my boss, everyone. My  boss said, \\\"Don't worry, I'll find you, no matter where you are, no matter what happens.\\\" We went to the hospital. There we were examined by a department head from the Sumgait Maternity Home, Pashayeva, I think her name was. She  examined us. The ambulance was from Baku; I figured out that the Sumgait  ambulances hadn't done anything, they didn't respond to any calls. People  called and neither the police nor the ambulances showed any sign of life.  That doctor looked me over and I could tell from her behavior that something very good had happened, for she became quite glad. I even thought to myself,  \\\"God, can it be that nothing all that bad is wrong?\\\" She looks me over and  says, \\\"Now why are you suffering so? You don't know what your people have been doing, your people did even worse things.\\\" And I think, great, I have to deal  with her . . . And I felt so bad, I thought, why don't I just die so as not to have to hear more stuff like this from people like her? Here I am in this  condition and being told about something that our people did. I just didn't  have the energy to say, \\\"How could our people possibly be smart enough to  think of something that yours haven't already done?\\\" I stayed there. Then they brought in another woman, Ira B., she was married, and she was raped in her  own apartment, too. There were three of us, Ira, Lyuda, and 1. The next  morning they took Lyuda and Ira away. They didn't do anything to help us. This was in the old Maternity Home, in the combined block. They didn't do anything  more than examine me, that was it. I didn't want any shots or tranquilizer,  nothing. What shots could have calmed me down? I didn't even want to look at  them.  I lay in the ward. Either it just worked out that way or they did it on pur- pose, but I was alone. I was alone even though the wards were packed. That same evening a woman came by and asked me what was wrong with me, that my face was disfigured. She asked what had happened to me, and I said, \\\"Better to ask  your brother what happened, there's no point in asking me, your brother can  better explain what happened.\\\" She fell into a faint. All the doctors threw  themselves at her, and the doctor categorically forbade anyone to come into my ward.  Then people from work came to see me, my boss, his daughter; they brought me  clothing, because I was literally naked. The only thing I had on was a dress,  but the woman who gave it to me was very short, and the dress was way up  above my knees, and the woman orderly said, \\\"I can't believe you put on such a short dress, who are you showing off your legs to here?\\\" I went back to my  ward thinking, just one more thing from something. People from work came and  brought me something in a sack, apples, I think, three or four pounds, but I  couldn't take them. I had become so weak that it was just embarrassing. I said that I couldn't take the apples, and really didn't have any appetite. No one  had to bring me anything. Some woman took the sack . . . And, oh yes! . . .  Then I heard that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history should  be hidden or torn up completely so that no one would know that I was an  Armenian, maybe they wouldn't figure it out from looking at me. So they must  have been thinking that there would be some kind of attack, that something  else would happen. That it would be worse. Or, perhaps, someone was outside on the street, I don't know. In any case, I didn't sleep a wink that night.  The next morning they picked me up, a whole police detail, put me in a bus,  and off we went. I didn't even know where they were taking me. They took me to the club where the troops were, the very one I was in that ill-fated evening. I got off the bus. Near the City Party Committee there were a great many  troops, tanks, armored personnel carriers; the whole scene was terrible. I saw  a few people I knew there, and that calmed me a little. I had already thought  that I was the only one left. So there were five or six of us left in Sumgait  after that night. I still didn't know what happened to my parents, they didn't  come to see me in the hospital, and my boss told me that everything was fine.  I didn't know whether to believe him or not. Maybe he was just trying to calm  me down, maybe something happened on the way. Then I went to the club and saw  a lot of people I knew. They all knew one another, they were all kissing each  other and asking, \\\"What happened, what went on?\\\" Two days later they came to  see me from work. They were there all the time. Each day they came, showed  interest, and were constantly bringing me money. They did everything they  could. Of course I'm most thankful to my boss, the only one of my colleagues  who didn't lose his presence of mind and who didn't change his opinions,  neither before, nor after, nor in the heat of the moment, no matter what  happened. He constantly took an interest. A sincere interest, from the heart  . . . Then, about two days later, the secretary of the Party Committee came,  not from our Party organization, but from the First Trust, which ours is part  of, Comrade Kerimov, a very important figure in our town. He made arrangements with the emergency medical personnel to take me away, because if I sat down by myself I couldn't get up or lie down again. There was something wrong with my lungs, it was hard to breathe. They examined me there several times, there I  lay were several doctors, they all thought that . . . that it must just be  from all the blows, I don't know. They didn't diagnose anything in particular. When I was in the Maternity Home I even asked . . . I made it a point of  insisting that they take me to the trauma section because I felt so awful.  There was no way something inside wasn't broken, my ribs . . . Well they took  me there and took x-rays and said that everything was fine. There were  emergency medical workers on duty in the club. The mother of one of Marina's  friends was there. She was the head doctor at the Sumgait Children's Clinic.  They had every kind of antifever agent in the world, which was exactly what I needed at that moment, I thought. I said that I was having great difficulty breathing, I couldn't seem to get enough air, something was wrong with me. They put tight bandages around my chest and waist. Later I overheard some people saying that I had been cut all over. I think they just saw me being all bandaged up and decided that my breasts and face had been cut . . . But I wasn't cut.  They took us to the Khimik boarding house. We lived there a long time. Soon  appeared representatives . . . They were agitating. At first people would not  talk to them, and drove them off. One of the Armenian women shouted, \\\"We  demand that Seidov come!\\\" The response was, \\\"It's Seidov who sent us.\\\" Seidov  is the Chairman of the Azerbaijani Council of Ministers. The woman said,  \\\"We'll only see Seidov's daughter, have her come here, we'll do the same  things to her that they did to our daughters, and then we'll deal with you  agitators.\\\" And so on. More of them said, \\\"Have Seidov himself come.\\\" This  went on day in, day out. The agitators kept coming and coming, this drove us  out of our wits. Then people gradually started departing for Yerevan because  they realized it was senseless to stay. Everything got on our nerves: The  smell, the small children. There were children at the SK club, children who  had literally just come out of the Maternity Home. What were they doing in a  club that didn't even have running water all the time? At first we had to pay  to eat there. They even overcharged us, as it turned out. On the second day  someone told us that they would bring us food for free. The children were ill. Everything stank there. Well imagine about 3,000 people in a small movie  theater with seating for no more than 500. You couldn't sit or lie down, it  was impossible to even move. The stench was awful. Even the smallest infants  took ill overnight there. I heard that they were arriving seriously ill in  Yerevan, the infants. They have to be washed, they have to be bathed, not to  mention that we, the adults, were ill and needed care. People were fainting  right and left. I just don't know, everyone was crying, everyone . . . Only  the young people, the men, somehow managed to keep it together. But the women  were in a constant state of panic. It seemed to everyone that they would come  any minute and kill and stab. It seemed clear that we had been gathered  together purposely, like during the war, so that they could burn the movie  theater and there wouldn't be a single Armenian left. Then people went up to  the attic. I didn't see them, I only heard them, because I was lying down and  couldn't get up. I lay right on the stage, we had some room there. Apparently  they caught two people with either oil or gas. I think they wanted to burn the theater. Maybe someone saw them, I didn't. I was in no condition to open my  eyes.  Everyone was suspicious of everyone else. They would ask, \\\"Aren't you an  Azerbaijani? I think I saw you somewhere, I think you're an Azerbaijani.\\\" They led out all the men and started letting them back in by checking their passports, relatives might be covering for each other. Half of the people did not have any documents. There were people who had run out of their homes in  nothing but a pair of pants and slippers, or wearing just a shirt, not like they should have, with their IDs.  So on the 28th, on Sunday, I think, the police did nothing to help us. On Monday everything resumed where it had left off on Block 41A. They didn't  spare a soul there: not children, not pregnant women, nobody. They killed, they burned, they hacked with axes, just everything possible. They murdered  the Melkumian family whom I knew, my mother worked with them. Their daughter- in-law went to school with my older sister. They were brutally murdered. Only  the two daughters-in-law survived. By a miracle one was able to save herself,  she ran away, the neighbors wouldn't take her in, so she ran about the  building until she found refuge. She was pregnant and had two small children.  This all continued on Monday in Block 41A, on the 29th, when the troops were  already in the city.  They murdered people, they overturned automobiles, and they burned entire  families. They say they didn't even know for sure if the people were Armenians or not. I heard that the Lezgins suffered, too. I'm not sure myself, I didn't  see any Lezgins who had been injured. They burned cars so it's very difficult  now to say exactly who died and who didn't. It was very difficult to identify  the corpses, or rather, what remained of the corpses after they were doused in gasoline and burned . . . it's all very hard to imagine, of course I heard  that many people disappeared without a trace, from the BTZ plant two people,  including a woman who worked the night shift, Aunt Razmella, who also lived in Microdistrict 3.  They were stopping buses between Baku and Sumgait. In the evening people who  had been visiting Baku were returning to Sumgait, and people from Baku were  going home from Sumgait, and there were students, too. They were simply  savagely murdered. They were stopping the buses, the drivers immediately did  what they were told because there was just no other way to deal with that  hoard of brutally minded people. They stopped the buses, dragged the Armenians out and killed them on the spot. I didn't see it myself, but I heard that they put them all in a pile so as to burn them. Later it was hard to discern from  the corpses, well you can't call them corpses, you had to figure out from the  ashes who it was. l heard that two fellows saved two women, one a student, Ira G., if I'm not mistaken. She was in the hospital a long time after that, and  she still can't figure out who saved her. She was also brutally raped and  beaten and thrown onto a pile of corpses. The fellow pulled her out of that  whole pile of corpses, put his coat on her, took her into his arms, and  carried her to the city. I still can't imagine how he managed to do that.  I heard that from Engels Grigorian. He knows her, apparently. Well a lot of  people went to that hospital anyway. She was in the hospital and singing a  song in Armenian, and they wrote the words down, and, I think he still has  that piece of paper, because he says that a lot of people now have that song,  the one she sang in the hospital where she lay in such bad shape. They  couldn't find the guy who saved her. He left her in someone's apartment and called the ambulance, she was in such awful shape that, probably, like me, she couldn't remember anyone's face.  I think that I knew one of the people who broke into our house, maybe I had  talked with him once. But I received so many blows everything was just knocked out of my head. I can't remember to this day who he was. Then, it seems, I saw the Secretary of the Directorate's Party organization, where Marina works. She goes to school and works, she goes to night school at AZI, and works by day at the Khimzashchita Construction and Installation Administration. I'm the  Secretary of the Komsomol organization at our administration and often met  with the secretaries of Party and Komsomol organizations. We had joint  meetings. I know them all, I've even talked with them, and he, I know, is from Armenia. An Azerbaijani, but from Armenia. It became obvious that many of  those people were Azerbaijanis born in Armenia.  They took me to various police stations, to the police precinct, and to the Procuracy, because the USSR Procuracy got involved in the case, and I iden- tified the photographs of people who I could more or less recognize. They showed me the people who were in our apartment, they're working on our case, but I can't even recognize them, although it was proved that they were the ones, they're processing it somehow. They tell me that they know that someone held me by the arm and someone else held me by the leg when they were  dragging me. There was someone else in our apartment who did not even touch  me, he just stole a blanket and an earring or something like that. All these  people, all of them, as much as I've heard about them and seen them, they were all from Kafan.  The Secretary of the Party organization is named Najaf, Najaf Rzayev. He was  there when everything started. It must have been him because I didn't  recognize anyone else in the crowd whom I knew besides him. All the more since I told him, \\\"Listen, you do something, because you know me.\\\" He turned away  and went toward the bedroom, where Marina was. Well you couldn't see Marina  anyway. There was such a noisy confusion of people that you couldn't make out  anyone. All of it flew right out of my head, and then gradually I became  myself again, at the City Party Committee . . . There were military people  there. I told them what went on, and they wrote it all down. I told them his  name. On March 8 the Secretary of our First Trust Party organization, the one  we're part of, came to see us, his name is Najaf Rzayev. I tell Mamma, \\\"If he's here despite the fact that I gave his name, it means that either his  alibi has been confirmed or, probably, that they think I'm crazy, not  responsible for my words.\\\" He said, \\\"What did they do to you, how awful,  myself, I hid an Armenian family.\\\" Then after some time goes by he comes back  again and says something entirely different: \\\"I wasn't at home, my family and  I went to Baku.\\\" I said, \\\"Marina, what is he saying? He said something totally different before.\\\" After that I didn't go to see our Procurator, our case is  being handled by a procurator from Voronezh, Fedorov by name. Fedorov told me  that Rzayev's case had just gotten to him, and there were so names involved.  What are they doing with Rzayev? Did he prove his alibi or not? They just think that since I was hit in the  head I can't say anything for sure, whether it was him or not. It will be an  insult if he was in our apartment and doesn't have to pay for it, but at the  same time  I'm afraid to say I'm a hundred percent sure that it was he. Because no mat- ter who I name, they tell me, no, you're wrong, he didn't do that, that one wasn't there. All the faces have gotten mixed up in my mind. Who did what exactly I can't say.                                                       When they took me outside there was a whole crowd there, but I didn't see it,  because I had my eyes closed all the time. It seemed to me that I always got it because of my eyes, people were always hassling me, for some reason it  always seemed to me that my eyes are responsible. When they were beating my  face I thought they were trying to put my eyes out. So I had my eyes closed,  they took me outside and started to beat me. A young guy, 22, held my arms, he works at the BTZ plant. And right nearby, across the road from us, Block 41,  is where all this was going on. Right across the road from us. The BTZ  dormitory is over there, that's where he lives. Now he's in custody, they even have proved, as far as I know, that it was he who killed Shurik Gambarian, the clarinet player from the third entryway of our building. One person in our  building was killed, it was that man.  A guy comes by who shared a room with the guy who was holding me. He saw that he was holding me by the arms and that he was beating me, but he didn't come  over, he just looked and then went into the dormitory. A while after it was  all over, people started making announcements in town saying that  investigators had been summoned. That guy went and told them everything. Now  they've caught him, everything's been proved. Now, evidently, they've been beating him, I don't know what they're doing with them over there, but he  himself said that he was working the night shift at the plant. Some young guy  came to the plant and said, \\\"Everyone who wants to kill Armenians come to the  bus station on Saturday at ten.\\\" That was it. He said, the ones who wanted to, went. This was at the BTZ plant, during the night shift, probably, late Friday night. It was at night, they were at the sauna together. And he said, what do  you mean, do you understand what you are saying? The others were silent,  probably, in their hearts they were thinking, I'm going to go. But they didn't say anything to one another. He said that he thought it important to to go,  because he had heard a lot about what had happened in Kafan, that they had  killed their Azerbaijani sisters, their mothers, burned villages, and all of  that. That guy was also born in Kafan. That is certain. And Marina says that  the Secretary of the Party organization is from Armenia, too.                                                             from  I've participated in the investigation a couple of times. I'm satisfied with them thus far. They summoned us and asked about what happened, and every word  I said was recorded. I met some guy there . . . By the way, he was an  Armenian. I said that he was in our apartment, but what he did, I don't know.  His last name was Grigorian, Eduard Grigorian. He s from Sumgait, from  Microdistrict 1. He was sentenced I think, to five years, not his first time.  His mother is Russian. I met with him at the KGB in Baku, at the Azerbaijani  KGB. They took us there and showed me photographs. There were so many  photographs, I think they even photographed those people who were caught at  curfew, and I've got them all confused. I say, the face was about like this,  the guy in the white coat with the red clasps. But he could take that coat off and burn it somewhere, and it would be like looking for a needle in a  haystack. Well. This guy, Grigorian, I said, he was in our apartment, but he  is so light-complected that he looks like a Lezgin. I don't know what he did,  I can't remember. Maybe he beat me or raped me. But he was in our apartment.  At the KGB he started asking me, pleading with me, there's no need for this,  all this stuff, look me in the eyes, you're like a sister to me. I took a look at him and thought, \\\"My God, Heaven forbid that I should have a brother like  you.\\\" But they were satisfied with my responses, because I said everything  without great certainty. I was there with Mamma. Then Lyuda came in, but when  she came in she got sick immediately. She wanted to kill him, she crawled over the table at him. She recognized him. When she came to, Lyuda was lying on the balcony, the mob threw her there and all of them ran into the bedroom. We had  all kinds of boxes with dishes in them, the dowries for all three sisters.  They stole everything in the apartment, leaving only small things. At that  moment Lyuda came to and started remembering everything. Well, seeing the  faces, hearing the voices . . . Two people were saying they could burn the  apartment. Another says, why burn the apartment when I've got three kids and  no place to live. So this guy was in temporary housing, he didn't have  anywhere to live, he was from Sumgait. They were sure that they would get the  apartment. Besides, the neighbors were Azerbaijani. Why should they burn the  apartment, they might burn Azerbaijanis. That's what they said. How did they  know there were Azerbaijanis there, if they just picked a place, thinking that Armenians lived there? We have a list of the residents for our part of the  building, our name is in there, but how could they know that Azerbaijanis  lived on the other side of the wall from us? So they didn't set fire to our  apartment.  I don't know, I was in such bad shape that if all of it had come to a halt  when I was outside, if someone had asked me what was happening, I would have said that a civil war was going on. Well, maybe not civil . . . but probably civil, because when they were beating me I opened my eyes and saw that all the neighbors were standing on their balconies and watching, like at a free horror film. So a civil war was going on, and only the Armenians were being fought. If it were a world war or something like that, they would have been fighting everyone. But they only fought us. Then I met some women from  our building, some Azerbaijanis. They are crying, they tell me, \\\"Karina, we  saw all of it, how could it happen?\\\" They're asking me! Well I just don't know what to call it if a normal girl can stand there and watch what happened to  me. I think that if it were the other way around either I wouldn't have been  able to take it, or I would have tried to avert it, like that one Azerbaijani  woman did in front of our building. A woman lives there, an awful, dissipated  woman, if you can call her a woman, the dissipated life she leads. Two  Armenian families live there, in her part of the building. She came out on the balcony and saw what was happening to me and started to scream and curse. She  came down to the entryway and said, \\\"You'll come in this entryway over my dead body.\\\" So not one of them took it in his head to go in that entryway. Some  folks were saying that those people were so out of control that they didn't  even know what they were doing. I don't think that's true. They knew very well what they were doing if they didn't even lift a hand against that woman. They  couldn't have cared less about her, but the fact that she was an Azerbaijani  stopped them.  They were just beasts, they had smoked so much. When they came to our place  they were all chewing something. I noticed: Everyone who came into the  apartment was chewing something. I think, my God, maybe I just think that?  Maybe I'm losing my mind? But no, they're all chewing something. Maybe it is  some kind of drug, it must be, because . . . At first glance they all seemed  to be such normal people, young, clean-shaven, looking exactly as if they had  come to some sort of celebration. But they were shouting something. They didn't talk, they shouted, as though there were deaf people there. They  screamed and screamed: \\\"Yeah, killing, killing, we're killing the Armenians!\\\"  Only they didn't shout \\\"kill,\\\" they shouted \\\"gurun ermianlary.\\\" Gurun  literally means \\\"kill,\\\" or \\\"destroy.\\\"  That's how it was! I'll continue. We hid in a captain's apartment, he's an Azerbaijani, his wife is a Tatar. We were sitting in their apartment, their  kids were out in the yard. Their kids knew a whole lot. This was in our part  of the building, on the third floor. When Mamma came to and couldn't find Lyuda she took Papa's hand, this was while the looters were stealing things, but they didn't pay attention because they were stealing things. Apparently they had already ceased killing and switched to stealing. Mamma found the courage to . . .  A boy said to my mother \\\"Where's the gold?\\\" Mamma said he must have been 12  to 14 years old. He even looked Russian, he was so fair-skinned. But the  Azerbaijanis from Armenia are fair-skinned. I noticed they were all on the  fair side. He shouted, they were all smashing things, and he asks Mamma where  the gold is. We kept our gold in the wardrobe with our important papers. In a  little black bag, we kept everything in there. Mamma doesn't really like to  wear gold. She probably never even wore those things from the time they were  bought for her. They took everything that was lying on the cheval glass. Mamma thinks that the gold saved us. Because they threw themselves at the gold, and  Mamma grabbed Papa, who was trying to breathe. They had closed his mouth,  bound his hands, and put a pillow and a chair on his face . . . They had  shoved something into his mouth so he would suffocate. Mamma grabbed him and  tore all that stuff off . . . He had something in his mouth, he was having  trouble breathing, his nose was filled with blood. Mamma grabbed him and  started running from the fifth down to the first floor because no one wanted  to open their doors to them. Mamma said that by accident, completely by  accident that person opened his door, he was sleeping, and said, half-awake,  \\\"What's happened?\\\" He sees that they are bloody. Mamma said, \\\"At least go and  find out what's happening to my daughters, even if they've burned them or  murdered them, at least bring the corpses.\\\" He went looking for us. At that  moment Lyuda was under the bed. She says that after they left it seemed that  someone was calling her name. When he quietly called her she couldn't get out  from under the bed. She wanted to get out and was calling softly. She thought  she was shouting, but in fact she was either silent or was only talking to  herself, it just seemed to her that she was shouting. When she got out from  under the bed everyone was gone. And again . . . She thought that she had lost her mind. I'll never leave here, never! To hell with it! It just seems that  way to me, I'll come to eventually. But then, when everything had settled  down, stopped, that mall brought Lyuda down, and Igor carried me in from outside. Or first I was brought in, then Lyuda, I don't remember what order it happened in.  And Mamma said, \\\"Listen, they're all running around down there, shouting  something or other, and running toward the other building.\\\" It had more or  less calmed down where we were. Who's dead, who's alive, we don't know. I  tried to call my girlfriend. I had basically come to. Mamma says, \\\"Listen; let's go upstairs, at least get a mattress or something. We don't know how  long we'll be here. Maybe they didn't burn everything.\\\" I don't get it, all women have that feeling, they want to get something from their homes, maybe  not everything was taken? I tell Mamma, \\\"Mamma, what do you need any of that  for? To hell with it! We're alive, forget the rest of it, all of it!\\\" She says, \\\"No, let's go get at least something. Maybe we'll leave here, spend the  night at someone else's.\\\" Mamma went upstairs, and their little boy, their son Alik, was standing on the lookout. lIe was standing there to see if they were  coming. They only managed to run up there and grab something one time. He  shouts, \\\"Come back, they're coming!\\\" They didn't have enough time to get a  lot, mattresses from one apartment, a blanket from another . . . Mamma got my  knitting . . . Someone managed to grab our old things, the ones we never wore, out of the hall . . . Someone took Father's old coveralls. The neighbor, his  wife, Mamma and Papa . . . Marina went with them. I was in no condition to  leave. Neither was Lyuda. We just sat. They ran out and we closed the door and just then we hear that the mob is on its way toward our place upstairs,  they're dragging something again. They were going toward the other building,  maybe over by the school, or . . . There was an unfinished building over there, people said they were going toward the basement or the unfinished  building, they could gradually carry everything over there. Then things more  or less calmed down. I tried to call my boss.  Later there was more noise. We were on the third floor, in a one-bedroom apartment, and a woman lives in the one-bedroom place on the second floor, Asya Dallakian. She's an old woman, retired. She wasn't at home, at that time she was usually in the country, she has a married daughter there, and her grandson is in the army. She is only very rarely in town; she gets her retirement money and the apartment is essentially vacant. They started pounding on her door and broke it down. She had two or three beds in there,  something like that, she's a 60-to 70-year-old woman who really does not even  live there. Probably she had some pots, a couple of metal bed frames and  mattresses, and a television. When her grandson came she bought a television.  They started wrecking everything. I started getting sick again. I think, \\\"My  God, what is going on around here? When will this end?\\\" We turned off the  lights and sat. As it turns out the people who weren't afraid, the ones who  knew what was going on, knew not to turn off the lights. We didn't know, but  they didn't come to where we were all the same. They all knew very well that  he was a captain. He went out and closed the door, and we sat in his  apartment. His last name was Kasumov. He's an exserviceman, retired, works up  at the fire station at some plant or other. He went out and stood at his door. They tell him, \\\"Comrade Captain, don't worry, we won't harm you, you're one of us.\\\" He went upstairs, and they say, \\\"Aren't you taking anything from this  apartment?\\\" He says, \\\"I don't need anything.\\\" And the women who were standing  in the yard . . . we have a basement, full of water . . . the women who were  standing in the yard saw. Those guys, they left everything they stole on the  first floor and ran upstairs again. The women threw everything they had time  to into the basement, to save our property. Some things were left: dirty  pillows, two or three other things and a rug. A guy came downstairs, really  mad, and he says, \\\"Where's the rug? I just put it right here!\\\" They tell him,  \\\"Some guy came and took it and went off toward the school.\\\" He ran off in that direction.  Oh! I forgot the most important point. When Igor picked me up in his arms,  there were women standing there who saw everything that was going on. They  just didn't tell me about it for a long time. The wife of that military man,  she didn't want to kill my spirit, I was already dead enough. Later she told  me, that after they murdered Uncle Shurik in the third entryway one of them,  the ringleader, apparently a young man, said, \\\"Where's the girl who was here?\\\" And he became furious. The woman tells him, \\\"She came to . . . \\\" She didn't know what to say: Think something up? Someone carried her off? Then they would comb the whole house and find me and our whole family. So the woman says, \\\"She came to and went to the basement.\\\" Now, our basement is full of water. So the  whole mob dashes off to the basement to look for me or my corpse. They took  flashlights; they were up to their waists in water, water which had been  standing there for years, and soot, and fuel oil. They climbed down in there  to get me. Then one of them said, \\\"There's so much water down there, she  probably walked and walked and then passed out and died. She met her death in  the basement. That's it, we can leave, no problem!\\\" I didn't know that, and  when I was told, I felt worse. Two times worse. A lot worse! So they didn't  just want to pound me flat, something more awful was awaiting me . . .  After that we of course didn't want to live in Sumgait any longer. We really  didn't want to go back to our apartment. When we moved, I went up there and  started to quiver and shake all over, because I started remembering it all.  Although the neighbors all sobbed, it was all . . . so cheap . . . The people  who sat in their apartments and didn't help us at a time like that. I think  that they could have helped! I don't think that they were obligated to, but  they could have helped us! Because that one woman was able to stop that whole  brutal crowd by herself. That means they could have, too. It would have been enough foe one man or women to say, What do you think you're doing?\\\" That's  all! That would have done it. There were 60 apartments in our building. Not  one person said it! When I was lying on the ground and all those people were  standing on their balconies I didn't hear anyone's voice, no one said what are you doing, leave her alone . . . Mamma even told one of the neighbor women  that if it had been an Azerbaijani woman in my place they would have dropped a bomb if it would have killed even one Armenian. They would have stood up for  one of their own. True, they say that our neighbor from the fourth entryway,  an old/ sick woman tried to stop the pogrom. The Azerbaijanis have a custom:  if a woman takes her scarf and throws it on the ground, the men are supposed  to stop immediately. The old woman from the fourth entryway did that, but they stomped her scarf into the ground, pushed her off to the side, and said, \\\"If you want to go on living, you'll disappear into your apartment.\\\" So she left. That trick didn't work on them.  Even the neighbors who helped us move told me, OK, fine, calm down, forget  that it happened. I said I'd only forget it if I told them right then that it had happened to their daughter--and if that didn't have any effect on them,  then I would forget everything, too. Imagine that it happened to your sister.  And no one did anything. Anything.

Christ was hardly the only person who claimed to be the Messiah--in fact, a number of \\\"Messiahs\\\" were active in the area from the time of the Roman conquest to after the fall of Masada.   Many of the statements made by the apostles--especially their repeated attempts to give Jesus a sword (give him military power) point to the fact that they didn't realize the true nature of his reign until after the fact.  Many of the statements in the Bible can be seen as being oriented toward explaining  this new definition of \\\"Messiah\\\" to the Jews who were being preached to.\",\" IMO any good player should score on power plays because of the man advantage.

It is very unlikely, however, that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car.  Ham rigs for cars put out around 100 watts.  It is possible that a 100 watt radio would cause interference to consumer electronic 100 feet  away.  Most TVs, stereos, and VCRs have very poor RF shielding. If you experience the problem frequently, it may be  caused by a ham, CBer, or other radio operator in a base station nearby.    The interference may have been caused by a radio  transmitter used for other purposes, such as police, fire, etc.  If you heard voices over your stereo, I think you are correct in assuming that the source is an RF transmitter.  If you have frequent trouble, you may want to try the RF ferrite chokes available at Radio Shack.  The interference is probably being picked up by your speaker wires, and those chokes can be installed on the wires very easily (without cutting them). Good instructions are included with the chokes. If that does not solve the problem, you may want to search your neighborhood for a radio operator.  Look for antennas on the roof or car.  Talk to him/her about your problem.  There are things a radio operator can do to reduce interference.  -- \",\"  You are absolutely daft.  No flame required.  You lack a brain.    Well... at least you're educated, it seems.

Thank You, \",\"    John, The problem here is that you have taken one peice of my response, without bothering to connect it with the other parts.  I have repeatedly noted that one needs to take the problematic historcity of acts and then examine the work of John Dominic Crossan and Burton Mack.  Once you have taken the time to examine recent developments in biblical scholarship, I think you will  grasp more clearly what I am saying.     Certainly this is an issue as I think the situation in Waco shows most  clearly.  If all that is required is that people are willing to die for a belief for it to be true, then surely David Koresh is the son of God.  No, the spurrious arguement that the resurrection had to be true for people to be willing to die must be put to rest.  The other problem is that it is so  monologocentric.  Even if the resurrection was a big deal (which it doesn't seem to have been for either Q, Thomas, or even John to a certain degree) there are a lot of other things which the Early Christians could have been doing together that would have been worth dying for.  It is my belief that even the idea of a mixed race community, which brought down regional/national boundaries in the name of koinonia could have been enough for people to be willing to die.  Radical communties do that (e.g. Jonestown, Waco, Warsaw, etc) But my original point was that roman persecution (which is the only persecution we have documented proof of) was not about whether a carpenter came back from the dead.  Such a claim was not unique nor particularly abhorent to the roman or greek mind.  My point is that avoidance of military and civic duty (i.e. emperor worship) would have been much more problematic -- which has nothing to do with the resurrection at all.  When nero used christians as human  torches to light up his dinner party it wasn't because the believe in a  risen savior, it was because they were supposedly involved in incest and cannablism.  The argument that christians were martyred for the resurrection just cannot stand up to critical examination.\",\"   Must there be a \\\"why\\\" to this?  I ask because of what you also      assume about God-- namely, that He just exists, with no \\\"why\\\"      to His existence.  So the question is reversed, \\\"Why can't      we assume the universe just exists as you assume God to      \\\"just exist\\\"?  Why must there be a \\\"why\\\" to the universe?\\\"   It may be that one day man not only can create life but can also      create man.  Now, I don't see this happening in my lifetime,      nor do I assert it is probable.  But the possibility is there,      given scientists are working hard at \\\"decoding\\\" out \\\"genetic      code\\\" to perhaps help cure disease of a genetic variation.      Again, though, must there be \\\"why\\\" or a \\\"divine prupose\\\" to      man's existence?   As far as we can tell, man falls into the \\\"mammal\\\" catagory.  Now,      if there were something more to the man (say, a soul), then      we have yet to find evidence of such.  But as it is now, man      is a mammal (babies are born live, mother gives milk, we're      warm-blooded, etc.) as other mammals are and is similar in      genetic construction to some of them (in particular, primates).

As I've noted before, I'm not necessarily disputing the benefits of  eliminating anti-competitive legislation with regard to auto dealers, barbers, etc.  One need not, however, swallow the entire libertarian agenda to accomplish this end.  Just because one grants the benefits of allowing anyone who wishes to cut hair to sell his/her services without regulation does not mean that the same unregulated barbers should be  free to bleed people as a medical service without government intervention.   (As some/many libertarians would argue.)    On a case by case basis, the cost/benefit ratio of government regulation is obviously worthwhile.  The libertarian agenda, however, does not call for this assessment.  It assumes that the costs of regulation (of any kind) always outweigh its benefits.  This approach avoids all sorts of  difficult analysis, but it strikes many of the rest of us as dogmatic,  to say the least.  I have no objection to an analysis of medical care, education,  national defense or local police that suggests a \\\"free market\\\" can provide a more effective, efficient means of accomplishing social objectives than is provided through \\\"statist\\\" approaches.   With some notable exceptions, however, I do not see such nitty-gritty, worthwhile  analysis being carried out by self-professed libertarians.    jsh\",\"  I've seen a listing of a Seagate 1G IDE hard drive.

Does He grade on a curve, does He cheat? That is interesting. Not to mention thought provoking. My own concept is that He is a Father and we are His children. In that He loves us, with a love that we can never understand until we are with Him. The Bible says that He looks on the heart as the final measure. From that perspective, in a grading context, the heart is the final test. Specifically, most Christians would agree that there is only one Heaven and one Hell. From that perspective, it is Heaven or Hell. You either go to one or the other. The \\\"grading\\\" on a pass/fail basis is done by God the Father with intervention by Jesus the Son. Not by others. For only God sees the heart. The Bible says of the heart, \\\"...who can know it.\\\" I would say there has always been, and always be, an unchanging method. That is what makes a relationship with Christ so secure. In an uncertain and ever changing landscape He is always the same. Yesterday, today and tomorrow. Concerning whether or not our childhoods are considerd as part of the test, my own conviction is no. Were that the case I certainly wouldn't be going to Heaven. The Bible speaks very plainly about the love and care Jesus had for and about children. The reality is that we are all children. Some of us just have bigger bodies and grey hair. But the Father, our Father is always there. Like most Fathers He wants only the best for His own. There maybe decipline, but there is more love. It's sometimes looks like Christianity is a test, to see who makes it and who doesn't. Those who do pass=Heaven, and those who don't go to the other place. But it is really much more than that...

Eddie Murray was a superb first baseman for a *long* time.  Winfield as produced consistently for almsot 20 years, and excellently on several occasions.    Dave Kingman's *best* year was like Darryl Strawberry's *typical* year with the Mets.    Darrell Evans, too, did a whole lot more than just hit homers, which  *is* all that Kong did.      Whom are you talking about?  Yes, Eddie Murray is marginal, but that's because he's 38 years old.  He wasn't marginal for a *long* time.    Not.    Smith has hung around for a long time AND fielded the position better  than anyone else ever has.  Yount stopped being a shortstop about a decade ago, in case you hadn't  noticed.  One of his two MVP awards was as a centerfielder.    Like whom?  There are many players in the Hall who aren't anywhere near as goos as the guys you're running down.   That's already the case, by some standards.  But the *bad* players in the  Hall are all from the 20's and 30's.  Recent picks have generally been excellent.   No, but who cares?  Was Stan Musial anywhere near as good as Babe Ruth? Not really.  But he obviously belongs there.  The Hall has generally had about the top 1% of major leaguers.  As  more players come through the game, more will be in that top 1%.    And, yes, it's pretty easy to argue that Smith,. Yount, Evans, Winfield, etc. are in the top 1%.  Dave Kingman on the other hand, was a liability throughout most of his career.  Of course, Garvey *hasn't* gotten a lot of HOF press, so I don't know what you mean.    As for Ryan, is his W-L better than Morris'?  That's what a lot of voters tend to look at.  And Morris *was* awfully good for a decade, and doesn't lead MLB history in walks allowed, either.\",\"Can anybody tell me if they know where I can obtain the source code for a polygon filling algorithm, or any other graphics orientated mailing lists that may be able to help me.

Quite the reverse...\",\" Stop! Hold it! You have a few problems here. Official history says that  the first accusations of homosexuality in the SA came from OUTSIDE of the Nazi  party, long BEFORE the Nazis ever came to power. So this objection is a red herring, even if established history is wrong on this point. Moreover, none of  the histories I've read ever made mention of Hitler or anyone else ever using  homosexuality as a pretext for purging Roehm. A point I saw reiterated was that Hitler and the party covered up these accusations. If you are going to accuse official history of being a fabrication, you should at least get your facts right. The pretext for purging Roehm was that he was planning to use the SA in a coup against Hitler. Nowhere is there mention of using allegations of homosexuality as a pretext for the purge, nor as a justification afterwards (it is possible that the histories I've read have not mentioned this, but I doubt it - would it be in Hitler's best interest to admit to the world that his former right hand man was a homosexual?).   Anyway, as I said before, it is always possible that I have missed references  to the Nazis making use of charges of homosexuality against the SA after the  night of the long knives - but this does not prove that they were false. Even  the Nazis could tell the truth when it was to their advantage. In any case,  this does not deal with accusations of homosexuality in the SA during the  1920's.   Ah, yes. I forgot this was being posted to alt.conspiracy. I can smell the paranoia from here. Since the Nazis never officially charged Roehm with  homosexuality (at least, not according to what I've read), I'd like to know  what tainted \\\"evidence\\\" you are talking about. Since the accusations were made  by persons outside of the Nazi party, long before it came to power, and those  accusations were common knowledge to journalists and others in Germany in the  1920's and 30's, just how would it be possible for the Nazis to go back in  time and plant \\\"tainted\\\" evidence? How exactly does one doctor newspapers  which were circulated around the world, without the discrepancies being  obvious? What actual incidences of Nazi doctoring evidence on this matter do you know about? And what about the testimony of people who were involved in  these matters, some of whom were not Nazis? And what is the point of making a  false accusation of homosexuality if you do not publicize it? Since the point  here seems to be to discredit established history, then the burden of proof  falls on the revisionist. The revisionists had better do their homework  before making accusations. Otherwise they simply look like conspiracy nuts.   This is just about the *only* thing we agree on.   I suspect that the notion that there might have been bad people - Roehm and  his SA buddies - who were homosexuals must disturb some people. The feeling seems to be that if a nasty individual is accused of homosexuality, that this must be an attempt to bash homosexuals. This fear - often justified - is what lies behind this distrust of official history, or so it seems to me. But this is not a good justification for trashing accepted accounts of this subject. If  you really think that historians are so incompetent, why don't you write them  and ask where they got their sources on this subject, if you can't tell from  their footnotes? I'm a graduate student in history. Writing to professors and tracking down sources is old hat. But my time is limited and this is not my specialty - and neither you nor anyone else have said anything that would cast one shred of doubt on existing evidence. I'm not going to waste my time trying to debunk someone's paranoia. Do the research yourself.   Given that you already consider all evidence \\\"tainted\\\", what on earth would constitute concrete particulars? And since when have concrete particulars been considered \\\"shrewd guesses\\\"?  I suggest that those who do not trust popular historians (Irving et al) - historians writing for a popular audience do not, as a rule, provide copious  footnotes - should try instead reading academic historians, who usually  provide footnotes to all their sources in immmense detail. This is the place  to start looking. Assuming that one really wants to know the truth.  I'll bet the folks on alt.pagan are tired of this subject already. My apologies - we seem to have gone off on a bit of a tangent. I forget which gods are responsible for keeping strings within appropriate newsgroup subject boundaries...\",\"Here is an annoying problem. Whenever I save an icon which contains dark colors like dark red or dark purple, these colors are converted to the bright colors. This happens with every icon editor including the image editor that came with SDK. I don't have this problem with .BMP files either; only with .ICO files or icon libraries. The problem is with the icon colormap field in the icon file header. Checking the file with a binary editor, I can see that the masks are OK. By editing the colormap manually (copying from another icon that I didn't edit) I can fix the colors. Does anybody know what may be causing this problem?

(Or is it only applicable in cases like this?)  :-  I remember an article of about a year ago which stated that besides his wife, Saddam also has a mistress.  Assad's brother has a wife and *several* mistresses, and those 'emirs' in the Gulf have, within their lifetimes, wives in the double digitas (only they manage to keep four at a time).   This is all irrelevant.  It takes a *lot* more than infidelity to make these leaders ruthless and corrupt.  Maybe Netanyahu thought he could 'cleanse' himself by making such a public confession.

In terms of laws regarding individual rights, restrictions on police searches, etc... (all closely related to crime) Canadian laws parallel England's and differ greatly from those of the United States.     Actually, they do not have \\\"roughly the same... urban economy\\\",  and extremely different ethnic composition.   However, if you account for economic and ethnic differences, the difference disappears completely: Seattle's minorities are predominatly poor, while Vancouver's are middle or upper class. The rates for whites in both cities were found to be identicle, while the rate for poor, Seattle minorities was almost three times as great as for the well-to-do minorities of Vancouver. The pattern seems to be one of poverty and race relations, not one of gun control.   That is a gross distortion: \\\"Self-defense\\\" does not mean killing the attacker. There were 21 cases of civilians killing their  attacker in self-defence. But such cases represent less that 0.5% of the crimes prevented by armed self-defence; for every case you cite, there were over 200 other cases of self-defence where the crime was prevented but the attacker was not killed. (0.5%, by the way, is the most conservative possible figure, based on the National Crime Survey's estimate of 80,000 crimes prevented by armed self-defence each year. Most other  studies on the subject put the figure at 500,000 to 600,000. Those figures would imply less than 0.08% of sucessful self-defences involve killing the attacker.)   So, more correctly, there over 4000 (possibly as many as 25,000)  cases of civilians acting in self-defence, only 21 of which resulted in the death of the attacker. This is a significant factor, in comparison to the 592 homicides. If memory serves, homicides make up approximately 1% of the violent crimes the study considered, so the fair comparison would be 40 - 250 homicides prevented and 592 homicides. Clearly, the study can not be close to accurate, since it ignored these cases of self-defence.\",\"   Both of these symptoms are related - tachycardia. Getting a flushed face is due to the heart pumping the blood faster than a regular pulse.  I suspect this is related to an increase in sodium levels in the blood, since note *sodium chloride* monosodium glutamate. Both are sodium compounds. Our bodies require sodium, but like everything else, one can get too much of a good thing.   Again, this could be related to increased blood flow from increased heart rate, from the sodium in the MSG. Distended crainial arteries, essentially. One of many causes of headaches. There is no discrepency her, necessarily.    Well stomache ache and vomiting tend to be related. Again, not necessarily a discrepency. More likely a related reaction. Vomiting occurs as a response to get rid of a noxious compound an organism has eaten. If a person can't digest the stuff (entirely possible - the list of stuff people are allergic to is quite long), and lacks an enzyme to break it down, gastrointestinal distress (stomach or belly ache) would be expected.     These are respiratory reactions, and are now considered to be similar to vomitting. They are a way for the body to dispose of noxious compounds. They are adaptiove responses. Of course, it is possible some other food or environmental compound could be responsible for the symptoms. But it's important to remember that a lot opf these effets can be additive, synergystic, subtractive, etc, etc. It would be necessary to know exactly what was in a dish, and what else the person was exposed to. Respiratory does sound suspicious BUT  resopiration and heart rate are connected.  Things in the body are far from simple...very inetractive place, the vertebrate body.    People respond in a myriad of ways to the same compound. It depends upon what it is about the compound that \\\"pisses off\\\" their body. Pollen, for example, of some plants aggrivates breathing in many people, because, when inhaled, it sets of the immune system, and an histamine attack is launched. The immune system goes overboard, causing the allergic person a lot of misery. And someone with an allergy to some pollens will have trouble with some herb teas that contain pollens (Chamomile, linden, etc). Drinking the substance can perturb that person's system as much as inhaling it.    See above. And don't think that heart rate changes, and circulatory problems are not serious. They can be deadly.  and brain damage.   The area of the brain effected is the neuroendocrine system controlling the release of gonadotropin, the supra-hormone controlling the cyclical release of testosterone and estradiol, as well as somatostatin, and other steroids. Testing for effective dose would be, uh, a wee bit unethical.   poisoning.   Absolutely. But it could also be some synergystic mess from eating , say, undetected shrimp or mushrooms (to which many are allergic), plus too much alcohol, and inhaling too much diesel fumes biking home, plus, let's say, having contracted flu from one's sig. other 3 days before from drinking out of the same glass. Could be all sorts of things.  But it might be the MSG.    If noone else got sick, its likely not food poisoning. Probably stomach flu or an undetected thing the guy's allergic to.   Anyway, the human body's not a machine; people vary widely in their responses, and a lot of reactions are due to combinations of things.\",\"MLB Standings and Scores for Tuesday, April 6th, 1993                   (including yesterday's games)  NATIONAL WEST       Won  Lost   Pct.

We will therefore render every possible assistance to an injured   man, and therefore should not be part of any organisation which causes   people harm (even medical corps of the army etc).  Christians are by faith \\\"citizens of the commonwealth of Israel\\\"   (Ephesians 2:11-12), and also recognise that \\\"God rules in the kingdoms of   men\\\", and therefore we should not be taking part in any of the struggles   of those nations which we are not part of due to our faith.  We are to be \\\"strangers and pilgrims\\\" amongst the nations, so we are just   passing through, and not part of any nation or any national aspirations   (this can also be applied to politics etc, but that's another story). We   are not supposed to \\\"strive\\\" or \\\"resist evil\\\" (even \\\"suffer yourselves to   be defrauded\\\") it is therefore incosistent for us to strive to assist in   preserving a state which Christ will destroy when he returns to set up   God's kingdom.  Our duty to the state.  \\\"Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar's and unto God   the things which be God's\\\" (Luke 20:25). \\\"Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power   but of God; the powers that be are ordained of God. Whosoever resisteth   the power, resisteth the ordinance of God\\\" (Rom 13:1-2). \\\"Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake; whether   it be to king as supreme... for so is the will of God that with well doing   ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men\\\" (1 Pet 2:13-15)  These scriptures make it clear that submission to the powers that be is a   divine command, but it is equally clear from Acts 5:19-29 that when any   ordinance of man runs counter to God's law, we must refuse submission to   it. The reason for this is that we are God's \\\"bond servants\\\" and His   service is our life's task. An example of the type of thing is in Col   3:22-23 where bondservants were to \\\"work heartily as unto the Lord\\\" - so   also we should work as if our boss was God - i.e. \\\"Pressed down, shaken   together, and running over\\\"... oops - a bit of a side track there...  In the contests between the nations, we are on God's side - a side that is   not fighting in the battle, but is \\\"testifying\\\" to the truth.  When we believe in God and embrace His promises, we become \\\"fellow   citizens with the Saints and of the Household of God\\\", and are no longer   interested in associations of the world. Think of this in relation to   unions etc as well. Paul tells us to \\\"lay aside every weight\\\" that we may   run \\\"the race that is set before us\\\", and if we are wise, we will discard   any association which would retard our progress - \\\"Thou therefore endure   hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. No man that warreth entangleth   himself with the affairs of this life, that he may please him who hath   chosen him to be a soldier\\\" (2 Tim 2:3-4).  One of these entanglements he warns about is \\\"be ye not unequally yoked   together with unbelievers\\\". One of the obvious applications of this is   marriage with unbelievers, but it also covers things like business   partnerships and any other position where we may form a close association   with any person or persons not believing the truth about God (in this case   the army). The principle comes from Deut 22:10 - remember that as well as   them being different animals of different strengths, one was clean and one   unclean under the law. These ideas are strongly stressed in 2 Cor 6:13-18   - I suggest you read this. The yoking also has another aspect - that of   servitude, and Jesus says \\\"take my yoke upon you\\\", so we are then yoked   with Christ and cannot be yoked with unbelievers. We have already seen   that we are bondservants of Christ, and Paul says \\\"become not ye the   bondservants of men (1 Cor 7:23 RV).  An example from the Old Testament: the question is asked in 2 Chr 19:2   \\\"Shouldest thou help the ungodly...?\\\". The situation here is a good   example of what happens when you are yoked together with unbelievers.   Jehoshaphat was lucky to escape with his life. Here are the facts: 1. He had made an affinity with Ahab, who had \\\"sold himself to work   wickedness before the Lord\\\" (1 Kings 21:25). 2. When asked by Ahab to form a military alliance, he had agreed and said   \\\"I am as thou art, my people as thy people\\\" (1 Kings 22:4) - an unequal   yoking. 3. He sttod firm in refusing the advice of the false prophets and insisted   on hearing the prophet of the Lord (trying to do the right thing), he   found that he was yoked and therefore couldn't break away from the evil   association he had made.  God says to us \\\"Come out from among them and be ye separate, and touch not   the unclean thing, and I will receive you and ye shall be my sons and   daughters\\\" (2 Cor 6:17).  This is more or less what I have found out so far - I'm still looking into   it, as I don't think I've answered all the questions raised by Alastair   yet. Heres a summary and a few things to think about:  The Christian in under command. Obedience to this command is an essential   factor in his relationship with Christ (John 15:10,14).  Total dedication to this course of action is required (Romans 12:1-2).  Disobedience compromises the close relationship between Christ and his   followers (1 Pet 2:7-8).  We are to be separated to God (Rom 6:4). This involves a master-servant   relationship (Rom 6:12,16).  No man can serve two masters (Matt 6:24,13,14).  All that is in the 'Kosmos' is lust and pride - quite opposed to Gos (1   John 2:16). Christs kingdom is not of this world (i.e. not worldly in   nature) - if it was, his servants would fight to deliver him. If Christ is   our master and he was not delivered by his servants because his kingdom   was not of this world, then his servants cannot possibly fight for another   master.  Strangers and pilgrims have no rights, and we cannot swear allegiance to   anyone but God.  The servant of the Lord must not war but be gentle to all (2 Tim 2:24) -   this does not just apply to war, but also to avoiding strife throughout   our lives. There is a war to be waged, not with man's weapons (2 Cor   10:3-4), but with God's armour (Eph6:13-20).  I'll probably post some more when I've had time to look into things a bit   further. \",\"being a mere female, I have often found I can't really take the big offensive line with asshole car drivers, so I found a more subtle and nastly ooops I mean nasty way to get back at them.

The athiest's position is that there is no PROOF of the existence of God.  As much as some people accept their Church, their priests or straight from their own scriptures as the \\\"proof\\\", this does not  satisfy atheists.  Atheists DO believe in recognisable authorities.  If they were as dogmatic as you claim they are, they would be trying to prove 1 + 1 =2 every time they got up.  What they dispute is that Churches, priests, scriptures etc. represent true authorities and know the TRUTH.   Are you asking us to believe blindly?  You are trying to deny that part of us that makes us ask the question \\\"Does God exist?\\\" i.e. self-awareness and reason.  If we do not use our ability to reason we become as ignorant as the other animals on this earth.  Does God want us to be like that?  You are right that science and reason cannot PROVE anything.  However, if we do not use them we can only then believe on FAITH alone.

Bill Mayne\",\"  Dennis, I have worked on or written proposals worth tens of millions of $$. Customers included government (including NASA), for profit and non-profit companies. All expected a wrap (usually called a fee). Much of the work involved allocating and costing the work of subcontractors. The subcontractors where universities, for-profits, non-profits, and even some of the NASA Centers for the Commercialization of Space. ALL charged fees as part of the work. Down the street is one of the NASA commercialization centers; they charge a fee.  Now, I'm sure your a competent engineer Dennis, but you clearly lack experience in several areas. Your posts show that you don't understand the importance of integration in large projects. You also show a lack of understanding of costing efforts as shown by your belief that it is reasonable to charge incremental costs for everything. This isn't a flame, jsut a statement.  Your employer DOES charge a fee. You may not see it but you do.    Well there you are Dennis. As I said, they simply include the fee in their overhead. Many seoparate the fee since the fee structure can change depending on the customer.   Integration, Dennis, isn't overhead.   Dennis, Reston has been the only NASA agency working to reduce costs. When WP 02 was hemoraging out a billion $$, the centers you love so much where doing their best to cover it up and ignore the problem. Reston was the only place you would find people actually interested in solving the problems and building a station.   When you have a bit more experience Dennis, you will realize that integration isn't overhead. It is the single most important part of a successful large scale effort.   The story you refer to said that some NASA people blamed it on Congress. Suprise suprise. The fact remains that it is the centers you support so much who covered up the overheads and wouldn't address the problems until the press published the story.  Are you saying the Reston managers where wrong to get NASA to address the overruns? You approve of what the centers did to cover up the overruns?   You should know Dennis that NASA doesn't include transport costs for resuply. That comes from the Shuttle budget. What they where saying is that operational costs could be cut in half plus transport.   I do hope you can find the time to tell us just why it was wrong of Reston to ask that the problems with WP 02 be addressed.

The NHL, to be precise.  And in the NHL, there exist these things called \\\"ties\\\".  A tie occurs when a game ends with the score for each team equal.  Each team gets one point for a tie.  There also exits these things called \\\"wins\\\".  A win is when one team has a higher score than the opponent.

Another team has a record of 40 wins, 38 losses and 6 ties.  The first team has (38*2)+10 = 86 points.  The second team has (40*2)+6 = 86 points.  WOW!  They *both* have the same number of points, but the number of wins is different!  How did they do that??!?!?!?!  That's amazing.  So, Rex, when people talk about wins being the first tiebreaker, well, then that's what it means.  In our example, the second team would win the tiebreaker and therefore have the \\\"better\\\" record, even though both teams had the same number of points.  If you didn't understand this post, Rex, maybe you should go back and read it again, very slowly. :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-)  --     Keith Keller    LET'S GO RANGERS!!!!!

If you were using a IIfx, that might be another story.  Make sure there is only one terminator in the cabling and it must be at the end.  Some boxes have internal terminators; some can be switched out and others are socketted.  These count.  If the box with internal terminations cannot be put on the end to terminate the cabling, they have to be disabled, ie, switched out or pulled out of their sockets.  If you have 2 boxes with internal terminations, the terminations in one box has to be disabled...., etc.  I am sure that this has been covered by the \\\"experts\\\".  My experience with SCSI boxes that connect to the Mac indicates that they must have some software package for the Mac to 'talk' to them.  My PLI MO drive and Sharp scanner has one for each.

The road surface isn't much different to a typical TX freeway. They are better in terms of lighting, safety, signs, roadmarkings etc. I'd have no problem driving 130 on most US freeways, as it is, I save it for the backroads, which really are more likely to be dangerous.   It would have to be quite severe. I don't recall any US freeway, without road damage warnings, that i would regard as unsafe at 130 in any decent, well damped car. Note that my definition of decent, well damped, would exclude most typical American sedans.   I don't know where you live, but I would be much more worried about cops, other traffic etc. than the road surface at 130. It just isn't that fast or that dangerous. If you have a Probe GT, no problem. The 4cyl models I have driven would be likely to be unpredictable at higher speeds.\",\"Why do spacecraft have to be shut off after funding cuts.  For example, Why couldn't Magellan just be told to go into a \\\"safe\\\" mode and stay bobbing about Venus in a low-power-use mode and if maybe in a few years if funding gets restored after the economy gets better (hopefully), it could be turned on again.    For that matter, why exactly were the Apollo lunar experiments \\\"turned off\\\" rather than just \\\"safed\\\".  Was it political (i.e. as along as they could be used, someone would keep bugging congress for funds)?  Turning them off keeps them pesky scientists out of the bureaucrat's hair....    I've heard the argument that an active but \\\"uncontrolled\\\" spacecraft causes \\\"radio noise.\\\"  I find that hard to believe that this could be a problem in a properly designed \\\"safe\\\" mode. This safe mode could be a program routine which causes the spacecraft to go to least fuel using orientation, and once a (week, month, year, whatever) attempts a signal lock on Earth. At that time, if funding has been restored, the mission can continue.  If no signal is recieved, the spacecraft goes back to the safe mode for another time period. As we would know when the spacecraft is going to try to contact Earth, we could be prepared if necessary.    As another a spacecraft could do at the attempted contact is beam stored data towards Earth.  If someone can receive it, great, if not, so it's lost and no big deal. By making the time and signal location generally known, perhaps someone in the world might be able and willing to intercept the data even if they're not willing to contact the spacecraft.  I see this as being particularly useful for spacecraft which could have an otherwise long life and are in or are going to places which are otherwise unaccessible (Jupiter/Saturn Orbit, exiting the solar system, etc).

That is, we  observe in nature that every cause has an effect, and every effect was produced  by a cause.  The existence of the natural realm, as an effect itself, cannot be  its own cause; it must therefore have a supernatural cause.  God, on the other hand, is a supernatural being, and is therefore not subject  to such natural laws as the law of cause and effect.  As a supernatural being,  God's eternal existence does not imply a previous cause the way the existence  of a physical, natural cosmos does.  Thus, those who believe in the  supernatural have a valid basis for accepting the existence of uncaused  phenomena such as the eternal God, whereas those who deny the existence of the  supernatural are faced with the dilemma of a physical universe whose very  nature shows that it is not sufficient to explain its own existence.  This is, of course, an oversimplification of a complex topic, but I just wanted  to clarify some important differences between the supernatural (God) and the  natural (the universe), since you seem to mistake them as being  interchangeable.\",\"   I think George is referring to switch.zip in the ~ftp/pub/pc/win3/drivers/video directory.

Ward Survey Research Center University of Utah\",\" Bill, I have taken the time to explain that biblical scholars consider the Josephus reference to be an early Christian insert.  By biblical scholar I mean an expert who, in the course of his or her research, is willing to let the chips fall where they may.  This excludes literalists, who may otherwise be defined as biblical apologists.  They find what they want to find.  They are not trustworthy by scholarly standards (and others).  Why an insert?  Read it - I have, a number of times.  The passage is glaringly out of context, and Josephus, a superb writer, had no such problem elsewhere  in his work.  The passage has *nothing* to do with the subject matter in which  it lies.  It suddenly appears and then just as quickly disappears.  Until you can demonstrate how and why the scholarly community is wrong about the Josephus insert, your \\\"proof\\\" is meaningless and it should not be repeated here.  What's more, even if Josephus happened to be legitimate, it would \\\"prove\\\" nothing.  Scholars speak of the \\\"weight of evidence.\\\"  Far more independent evidence would be required to validate your claim.  Until forthcoming, your belief is based on faith.  That's OK, but you exceed your rights when you pass faith off as fact.  As for the gospels, there are parallels, but there are also glaring inconsistencies and contradictions.  Shouldn't a perfect canon be perfect?  Shouldn't there be absolutely no room for debate?  I suggest you read _Gospel  Fictions_ by Randel Helms, and _The Unauthorized Version_ by Robin Fox (for  Herb Huston, no known kinship or familial relationship, but we do indeed share  an evolutionary ancestry).  The fact that there are inconsistencies, gaps and contradictions does not deny your position.  On the other hand, neither do the gospels \\\"prove\\\" your faith.  Independent evidence is necessary, and I know of none (which we have already discussed, and so far you have not provided any).  Until then, its faith.  Moreover, you have committed a fundamental error in logic.  You have attempted to \\\"prove\\\" your claim with that which you want to prove.  Its no different than saying \\\"I am right because I say so.\\\"    Your logic is full of circles.  It reminds me a bit of the 1910 Presbyterian  General Assembly.  The assembly defined five fundamentals (this is where \\\"fundamentalist\\\" came from) of orthodox Protestant Christianity, to wit: 1) Jesus performed miracles, 2) Jesus was born of a virgin, 3) Jesus was bodily resurrected, 4) Jesus' crucifixion atoned for human sin, and - here is the clincher - 5) the bible is the inerrant word of God.  Presbyterians construe \\\"inerrant\\\" broadly as spritually inerrant.  Fundamentalists take the first four as literally true, and then validate them with a literally inerrant bible, which contains the first four, and which is the only thing known to  contain the first four.    Smoke and mirrors and wands and hand waving if ever there was!  Its faith, Bill.  You don't have any more or better truths than anyone else.  Whatever works for you.  Just don't foist it on others.   Regards,\",\"Howdy,  I'm a little new to this newsgroup, but I would like to tap some of the knowledge and expertise available here.  The Subject:  After-market cruise controls  The Background: I recently broke my ankle in a road-bicycling accident (4 places, five  screws, yuk! :-( ).  In two weeks I will be returning to Texas (my home) from my school (BYU) in Provo, Utah.  As you can imagine, trying to drive nearly 1300 miles with a broken right ankle isn't just the epitome of a good time.  My car does not have a cruise control, so I would have to do all the pedalling (ha ha) with my messed-up ankle.  My question: What is the general opinion of after-market cruise control units?  I realize that a cheap CC (cruise control) from, say, Pep Boys, isn't going to be as good as a factory or professionally installed unit (if there is such a thing).  And I uderstand that I probably can't expect much in the way of accuracy, looks and that sort of thing;  But anything's gotta be better than trying to drive with a hosed ankle.  I have a 1984 Jeep Cherokee, 4 speed, standard, 4*4, 2.5L engine with kettering(sp?) ignition (y'know, distributor cap, rotor, that set-up--not electronic.  Maybe you could've guessed it being an '84, but I'm just trying to give information as completly as I can).  I found a CC unit for 80 bucks.  It seems to use the vehicles vacuum system  instead of an electric servor/motor.  Is this good or bad?  If I did buy this CC, which vacuum hose should I tap?  It has two speed sensors:  One magnetic, and one that gets a signal from the  negative side of the distributor, kinda like a tach pick-up, or so I understand.  I can use either one.  Which is best?  The manual says (I read it in the store today) that the magnetic/axle set-up is more accurate, but harder to install.  Is there really a big difference?  It has a sensor for the brake pedal, just like other CCs, but does NOT have a sensor for the clutch pedal.  So if I wasn't paying real close attention I might push the clutch in while the cruise is trying to get the speed up.  Which would wind the engine up kinda high until I got my wits about me and turned  the thing off.  I'm pretty coordinated, so this doesn't bother me, if it were for my girlfriends car, *then* it would bother me, but I'm ok with it.  The installation also calls for an attachment to a steady-on brake signal and a switched-on brake signal.  I think I can get a switched brake signal from the correct side of the brake light blade fuse.  Am I right?  But I'm not sure where to get the steady-on brake signal, or, for that matter, what exactly it is?  Any ideas as to what the manufaturer wants and where to get it?  I think I can figure the other things out.  Like how to hook-up the negative side tach-type sensing gizmo and the cabin control unit, and the ground and all that miscellaneous business.  But I need a little help with:   1.  Is it worth the money and safety risk (if any) for such a      device?  2.  Is there any particularly good after-market CC?  3.  Are \\\"professionally\\\" installed CCs signifacantly better and      worth the cabbage?  4.  If the unit I saw (sorry, no manufacturer or model number, just      that it is at Pep Boy and its $80) is sufficient for my simple       needs, how do I get the thing installed properly (specifically,      the questions above)?  My father and I built a \\\"Veep\\\" (Volkswagen powered Jeep CJ-2A) when I was in high school, so I consider myself fairly good with tools, electronics, and cars.  So the installation doesn't scare me.  I just want to be certain that I get the thing installed correctly as my Cherokee is just a wee bit more complicated than my Veep. :-)  I appreciate your time in reading my post, and I would appreciate any expertise or opinion anybody has on the subject.

The difference now is that such strains have become virulent.  In the old days, such TB was weak.  It didn't spread to other people very easily and just infected the one person in whom it developed (because of non-compliance with medications).  Non-compliance and development of resistant strains has been a problem for a very long time.  That is why we have like 9 drugs against TB.  There is always a need to develop new ones due to such strains.  Now, however, with a virulent resistant strain, we are in more trouble, and measures to assure compliance may be necessary even if they entail force.  --  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gordon Banks  N3JXP      | \\\"Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and geb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon.\\\" \",\"          But that's just the problem.

Noring's anal-retentive idee fixe on having a fungal infection in his sinuses is not even in the same category here, nor are these walking neurasthenics who are convinced they have \\\"candida\\\" from reading a quack book.   So? \",\" It should have been made fairly clear that the *most* Crimson would ever get was a 150 (75 old style) MHz CPU upgrade.  Certainly this was mentioned on comp.sys.sgi on more than one occasion as being likely.  If our sales folks were saying otherwise, they were either confused, or less than honest/ethical, or somebody further up the chain inside SGI was misleading them.   There were 4 versions (20, 25, 30, 35), although admittedly the 30 came out at the same time as the 35, over a period of 2 1/2 years.  The chassis simply couldn't be pushed any further.  I'd say 4 years was a pretty good lifespan, myself, for a system design in this day and age.  Getting the 35 to work caused a lot of gray hairs in both the hardware and product design groups; we would have been out of our minds to push it further, and I *know* that was made clear, almost from the day the 35 started shipping.  We had one last kicker in the form of the Elan graphics, which made 3 graphics versions over its lifespan, which I also think is pretty good.   Please, by all means send a complaint letter through SGI support or sales on your concerns.  There should be no reason for sales folks to misrepresent future upgrades to customers (sure, sometimes there will be confusion for a while, over whether an upgrade will be available, but that shouldn't last too long, and doesn't seem to be what you are referring to).  Yes, the sales folks *do* get bonus's at the end of some (all?) quarters, but that is pretty common industry wide, and sometimes that can result in good deals for customers (sometimes it probably pushes folks into systems that aren't what they need, I'm sure, but nobody is *forcing* you to buy at end of quarter, after all...)   They don't get all that long a lead time either; although certainly they get presentations on possible new products, and their opinions may well influence the end product, but that also is life in the industry.  We can't design systems that meet just their needs, or we won't sell too many systems, after all (which is not to say that we don't have some niche products, like Reality Engine).   But surely you don't expect a system you buy now for a five year period to be constantly upgradable over that entire five year period?  That's a rather unreasonable expectation, in my experience (with workstations/microcomputers).  Supported, and parts available, yes, but certainly not upgradable to the latest and greatest!   I missed your first posting, but as I say, by all means share your frustation with somebody at a level inside SGI where it might have an effect (not immediate, I'm sure, but complaints aren't going to be ignored, and *may* affect future plans, if we  hear similar things from more than one person/site).  All of the above is, as usual, my personal opinion, not SGI's.\",\"(note: this is not about the L.A. or NY Times)  A few times a year, a funny thing happens: the bike engine runs perfectly.  Completely smooth.  Not that it runs poorly normally, but on these days, it is exceptional.  My theory is that the air density and moisture content of the air are such that I get complete combustion.  Needless to say, it puts me in a great mood.  The mood lasted for about 20 miles.  Heading north on the 405 freeway, about a mile or two south of the 10, my throttle stopped responding.... and I was between lanes.  Nothing to do but make  my way over 4 lanes to the shoulder... initially by gliding, then by pushing.  At least traffic was heavy enough so that cars did not mind stopping for me.  Turned out to be a screw unscrewed inside my Mikuni HS40  carb.  I keep hearing that one should keep all of the screws tight on a bike, but I never thought that I had to do that on the screws inside of a carb.  At least it was roadside fixable and I was on my way in hardly any time. ____________________________________________________________________________    Death is life's way of telling you you've been fired  -- R.

Apple can't deliver that right now because the 040 saps too much power, radiates far too much heat, and is too large for a notebook. How does one get around that without designing a new chipset? Use existing PowerBook technology to your best advantage. The Duo Dock gives Apple a unique ability to give users that 040 power in a \\\"Semi-Portable\\\" fashion. By plunking the 040 into the Dock, you've got \\\"quadra\\\" power at your desk. On the road, that 33mhz 68030 should be able to handle most of your needs. Okay, not the BEST solution, but its an answer to a no-win situation. :-) So, does this mean one will be able to use the PowerBook's processor in parallel to the dock's processor?

It started happening about four years ago after I moved to my current town, although I don't know if that has anything to do with anything.

[AFS]     Just a quick comment:: [AFS] [AFS]     Armenians killed Turks------Turks killed Armenians. [AFS] [AFS]     Simple as that. Can anybody deny these facts?  Jews killed Germans in WWII -- Germans killed Jews in WWII, BUT there was  quite a difference in these two statements, regardless of what Nazi  revisionists say!  [SY] My grand parents were living partly in todays Armenia and partly in [SY] todays Georgia. There were villages, Kurd/Turk (different Turkic groups) [SY] Georgian (muslim/christian) Armenian and Farsi... Very near to eachother. [SY] The people living there were aware of their differences. They were  [SY] different people. For example, my grandfather would not have been happy  [SY] if his doughter had willed to marry an Armenian guy. But that did not  [SY] mean that they were willing to kill eachother. No! They were neighbors.  OK.  [SY] Armenians killed Turks. Which Armenians? Their neoghbors? As far as my [SY] grandparents are concerned, the Armenians attacked first but these  [SY] Armenians were not their neighbors. They came from other places. Maybe  [SY] first they had a training at some place. They were taught to kill people, [SY] to hate Turks/Kurds? It seems so...  There is certainly a difference between the planned extermination of the Armenians of eastern Turkey beginning in 1915, with that of the Armeno- Georgian conflicts of late 1918! The argument is not whether Armenians ever  killed in their collective existence, but rather the wholesale destruction of Anatolian Armenians under orders of the Turkish government. An Armenian- Georgian dispute over the disposition of Akhalkalak, Lori, and Pambak after the Turkish Third Army evacuated the region, cannot be equated with the extermination of Anatolian Armenians. Many Armenians and Georgians died in this area in the scramble to re-occupy these lands and the lack of preparation for the winter months. This is not the same as the Turkish  genocide of the Armenians nearly four years earlier, hundreds of kilometers away!  [SY] Anyway, but after they killed/raped/... Turks and other muslim people [SY] around, people assumed that 'Armenians killed us, raped our women', [SY] not a particular group of people trained in some camps, maybe backed [SY] by some powerful states... After that step, you cannot explain these  [SY] people not to hate all Armenians.   I don't follow, perhaps the next paragraph will shed some light.  [SY] So what am I trying to point out? First, at least for that region, [SY] you cannot blame Turks/Kurds etc since it was a self defense situation. [SY] Most of the Armenians, I think, are not to blame either. But since some [SY] people started that fire, it is not easy to undo it. There are facts. [SY] People cannot trust eachother easily. It is very difficult to establish [SY] a good relation based on mutual respect and trust between nations with [SY] different ethnic/cultural/religious backgrounds but it is unfortunately [SY] very easy to start a fire!  Again, the fighting between Armenians and Georgians in 1918/19 had little to do with the destruction of the Armenians in Turkey. It is interesting that the Georgian leaders of the Transcaucasian Federation (Armenia, Azerbaijan,  and Georgia) made special deals with Turkish generals not to pass through  Tiflis on their way to Baku, in return for Georgians not helping the Armenians  militarily. Of course, as Turkish troops marched across what was left of Caucasian Armenia, many Armenians went north and such population movement  caused problems with the locals. This is in no comparison with events 4 years  earlier in eastern Anatolia. My father's mother's family escaped Cemiskezek ->  Erzinka -> Erzerum -> Nakhitchevan -> Tiflis -> Constantinople ->  Massachusetts.   [SY] My grandparents were *not* bloodthirsty people. We did not experience [SY] what they had to endure... They had to leave their lands, there were [SY] ladies, old ladies, all of her children killed while she forced to [SY] witness! Young women put dirt at their face to make themselves [SY] unattractive! I don't want to go into any graphic detail.  My grandmother's brother was forced to dress up as a Kurdish women, and paste potato skins on his face to look ugly. The Turks would kill any Armenian young man on sight in Dersim. Because their family was rather influential, local Kurds helped them escape before it was too late. This is why I am alive  today.  [SY] You may think that my sources are biased. They were biased in some sense. [SY] They experienced their own pain, of course. That is the way it is.  But [SY] as I said they were living in peace with their neighbors before. Why  [SY] should they become enemies?  \",\"op that worked was the \\\"Macintosh |> >Software\\\" loop (whatever that means). |>  |> I doubt this is a Quadra-specific problem.

In fact, it is often chosen (besides its other merits) because it shoots like a revolver does basically.  It can limit the training time (read budget $$$) due to the fact there are no 'external' safties other than the trigger, hence less training time required.    Smith & Wesson (among other types) are chosen due to the fact taht they do have the external safties (hammer drop,as well as mag drop) which if properly used have saved many lives when 'Mr. Bad' snatched the gun from the officer and tried to shoot said officer the gun was on safe and would not fire.  This point had been made in many articles in various  gun magazines.  If fact, one author (can't remember who) staged a little test where he had a revolver and a S&W on safe laying on a table and asked people with little firearms experience to on his signal, grab the gun and shoot a target.  He timed the people using each gun.  The revolver times were pretty close, but some of the times with the S&W were in minutes, or the person just gave up because they could not figure out the saftey.   You don't often see Colt 45 autos issued due to the light trigger which can be accidentally fired in a stress situation, opening the issuing city,county, etc.. to lawsuits, bad press, etc..   Of course any problem can be overcome with enough training, but such training is not always available to budget crunched departments.  I know if I were a Cop I would want something like a S&W just for the off chance of the gun getting taken away.  The safety doesn't guarantee that 'Mr. Bad' won't figure it out and shoot me, but it could buy enough time to draw a second gun and shoot 'Mr. Bad' before it's too late.   Don't think I am too biassed here just because I have had 3 Glocks in my possession at one time, because I have had a .45 as well.  In fact, it was my first handgun.  Remember, the ultimate 'safety' is YOU the operator, and no safety is going to stop an negligent discharge (note I don't say accidental) if you break the rules of gun handling.   As per the part of being light weight and looking cool, I agree 100%.  I wouldn't rule it out as a first purchase.  \",\"   Just wondering, do you mean the \\\"Lectorium Rosicrucianum\\\"?

He stressed how likely it was the the Branch Davidians would commit mass suicide.  He was concerned with the safety of the children.   What did the FBI do to defuse the situation,  Did they try to reassure Koresh?  DId the FBI offer medical assistance to the BD?  Did the FBI offer them a supply of water when the BD pump stoped working?  Did the permit Koresh to communicate with anyone outside the compound?   What the FBI did was harass the Branch Davidians as much as possible. They kept powerful lights shining on the compound, shut off their electrical power, put their pump out of action, assaulted their ears with loud noise, cut off their communication with the outside and kept limiting their permitter.  The stated goal was to put pressure on David Koresh.   Was the FBI attempting to get Koresh to surrender or were they hoping to get Koresh so mad that he and some of his followers would attack the the tanks.   It appears that the tactics employed by the FBI did drive Koresh over the edge.  The blame for the deaths should be shared by both the federal experts whose tactics drove Koresh over the edge and the fools at the ATF who planed the raid.   Stupidity and incompetence of the BATF and the FBI leadership have resulted in the needless death of 90 innocent people.   If every thing had gone as planned 90 people would be alive today.

It's in the hands of cops, and while I am sure most of the time they are good, their security will not be as good as the escrow houses.   What this effectively means is that if they perform a wiretap on you, at the end of the wiretap, they should be obligated to inform you that a tap was performed, and replace (for free) the clipper chip in your cellular phone so that it is once again a code known only to the escrow houses.  Do the police normally reveal every tap they do even if no charges are laid?   In many ways, it would be a positive step if they had to. Judges set time limits on warrants, I assume.  At the end of the time limit they should have to renew or replace your chip.

Nonetheless, he noted that everything will be decided upon at the meeting of the Arab foreign ministers in Damascus. The newspaper also reports that threatening phone calls were recently made to houses of several of the senior members of the Palestinian delegation to the peace talks. The threats, in Arabic, demanded that the delegates not go to Washington to, \\\"sell out the Palestinian people.\\\" One caller threatened, \\\"Should you go, you will not find your family alive upon your return.\\\" The newspaper states that such phone calls were received, as far as is known, at the houses of Faisal al-Husseini, Hanan Ashrawi and others. \",\" I must admit that this point has been running through my mind for most of the discussion: one the dice are out there, it won't be long before someone decaps it and, after a bit of work, has full details of the Clipper algorythm.

The idea of resurrection is one which can be found in a host of different forms in the religions of antiquity.  The problem was not the resurrection which was a mediorce issue for a tiny fragment of the Jewish population  (the Saducees) but was a non issues for everyone else.  The real problem was that Christians were pacifist and preached there was only one god.  When the state operates by a system of divinitation of the emperor -  monotheism  becomes a capital offense.  The Jews were able to get exemption from this, and were also not evangelistic.  Christians were far more vocal, and gentile, and hence dangerous and were therefore targets of persecution.  Also since Christians were a relatively powerless group, they made good scapegoats as is seen by Nero's blaming them for the burning of Rome.  Let's not cloud the issues with the resurrection.  randy\",\"   What are the volumes that it speaks besides the fact that he leaves your  choices up to you?

Further striking bigoted and racist attitude of  certain Greeks still exists in our day. Most Greeks insist even  today, that the 537 year-old capital of the Ottoman Empire should  be called not by its rightful name of Istanbul, but by its half  a millennium-old moniker 'Cons*(whatever).'  Everyone knows that New York City was once called 'New Amsterdam' but Dutch people do not persist on calling it that today. The name  of Stalingrad too is long gone, replaced by Volgagrad. China's Peking traded its name for Beiging long ago. Ciudad Trujillo of the Dominican Republic is now Santa Domingo. Zimbabve's old colonial capital Salisburry became Harrare. These changes have all been accepted officially by everyone in the world.  But, Greeks are still determined on calling the Turkish Istanbul  by the name of 'Cons*.'  How can one explain this total intransigence? What makes Greeks so different from other mortals? 18-year-old questionable democracy? Why don't they seem to reconcile with the fact, for instance, that Istanbul changed hands 537 years ago in 1453 AD, and that this predates the discovery of the New  World, by 39 years. The declaration of U.S. independence in 1776 will come 284 years later.  Shouldn't then, half a millennium be considered enough time for  'Cons*' to be called a Turkish city? Where is the logic in the  Greek reasoning, if there is any? How long can one sit on the  laurels of an ancient civilization? Ancient Greece does not exist,  any more than any other 16 civilizations that existed on the soil  of Anatolia.  These undereducated 'wieneramus' live with an illusion. It  is the same mentality which allows them to rationalize that Cyprus is a Greek Island. No history book shows that it ever was. It belonged to the Ottoman Turks 'lock, stock and barrel' for a period of well over 300 years.  In fact, prior to the Turks' acquisition of it, following bloody naval battles with the Venetians in 1570 AD, the island of Cyprus belonged, invariably, to several nations:  The Assyrians, the Sumerians, the Phoenicians, the Egyptians, the Ottoman Turks, of course in that order, owned it as  their territory. But, it has never been the possession of the government of Greece - not even for one day - in the history of the world. Moreover, Cyprus is located 1500 miles from the Greek mainland, but only  40 miles from Turkiye's southern coastline.  Saddam Hussein claims that Kuwait was once Iraqi territory and the Greek Cypriot government and  the terrorist Greek governments think that Cyprus also was once part of the Greek hegemony.  Those 'Arromdians' involved in this grandiose hallucination should wake up from their sweet daydreams and confront  reality. Again, wishful thinking is unproductive, only  facts count.  As for Selanik,    <<Those Jews who survived these assaults in Southeastern Europe fled   particularly to Salonica, whose Jewish population increased substantially   as a result, from 28,000 in 1876 to 90,000 in 1908, more than half the   total population, though even there increased persecution by local Greeks   led many Jews to flee elsewhere in the Ottoman Empire, particularly to   the great port of Izmir.    Despite all the pressure from Ottomans and foreign Jews alike, the ritual   murders and other assaults by Christians on Jews went on and on. Greek   efforts to decimate the Jewish population of Salonica culminated in 1912   and 1913, following Greek conquest of Salonica during the first Balkan War,   when many of its Jews, were either killed or terrorized into leaving...>>    <<Though Greece was obligated by the post World War I treaties to allow   Jews and other minorities to use their own languages in education and to   practice their religions without hindrance, a law was issued in 1923   which forbad all inhabitants from working on Sunday, stimulating a new   Jewish exodus as it was intended to do. Between 1932 and 1934 there was a   series of anti-Semitic riots in Salonica, with the Cambel quarter, where   most of the remaining Jews lived, being burned to the ground. This   was followed by regulations requiring the use of Greek and prohibiting   Hebrew and Judea-Spanish in the Jewish schools. A start was made also   on expropriating the land of the principal Jewish cemetery in Salonica   for use by the new University in order to derive the Jews out [47]. By   killing and driving out large numbers of Jews, the Greeks left a   substantial Greek majority in the city for the first time, and starting   Salonica Jewry on the way to its final decimation by the Nazis during the   occupation of Greece starting in 1941.    Salonica and Izmir of course were not the only places of refuge for   Jewish refugees entering the Empire during its last century of existence.   Istanbul, Edirne, and other parts of Rumelia and Anatolia received   thousands more. Nor were Jews the only refugees received and helped by   the government of the Sultan. Thousands of Muslims accompanied them in   flight from similar persecutions wherever Balkan christian states gained   independence or expanded. The Russian conquest of the Crimea and the   Caucasus starting in the late eighteenth century, and particularly during   and after the Crimean War, combined with the same independence movements   in Southeastern Europe that had caused so much suffering and flight among   its Jews caused thousands of helpless, ill, and poverty-stricken Muslim   refugees to accompany them into the ever shrinking boundaries of the   Ottoman Empire, with the Istanbul government struggling mightly but vainly   to house and feed them as best it could. From 1850 to 1864 as many as   800,000 Crimean Tatars, Circassians, and other Muslims from north and   east of the Black Sea had entered Anatolia alone, as many as 200,000 more   came during the next twenty years, while 474,389 refugees entered in 1876-   1877 as a result of the Ottoman wars with Russia and the Balkan states,   with an equal number gaining refuge in the European portions of the   Empire.>>  [47] Robert Mantran, 'La structure sociale de la communaute juive de   Salonqiue a la fin du dix-neuvieme siecle', RH no.534 (1980), 391-92;   Nehama VII, 762; Joseph Nehama (Salonica) to AIU (Paris) no.2868/2,   12 May 1903 (AIU Archives I-C-43); and no.2775, 10 January 1900 (AIU   Archives I-C-41), describing daily battles between Jewish and Greek   children in the streets of Salonica.

We Catholics do believe that God's revealed truth that is not explicitly recorded in the Bible can be and is passed on through the Tradition of the Church. It should be noted that the Tradition of the Church, otherwise known as Sacred Tradition, is not the same as ordinary human traditions. However, we do not believe that additional truth will be revealed to the Church.  Public revelation, which is the basis of Catholic doctrine, ended with the death of St. John, the last Apostle.  Nothing new can be added.  Theologians study this revelation and can draw out implications that were not recognized previously, so that the Council of Nicea could define statements about the theology of the Trinity and the Incarnation that were not explicitly stated in the Bible and had been disputed before the council, but there was no new revelation at Nicea or at any subsequent council.  Cardinal Newman's _An Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine_, written while he was still an Anglican, is an excellent discussion of of this point.

Thats hard to top.\",\" I attribute my success to several factors:  Very low fat.  Except when someone else has cooked a meal for me, I only eat fruit, vegetables, and whole grain or bran cereals.  I estimate I only get about 5 to 10 percent of my calories from fat.  Very little sugar or salt.  Very high fiber.  Most Americans get about 10 grams.  25 to 35 are recommended.  I get between 50 and 150.  Sometimes 200.  (I've heard of people taking fiber pills.  It seems unlikely that pills can contain enough fiber to make a difference.  It would be about as likely as someone getting fat by popping fat pills.  Tablets are just too small, unless you snarf down hundreds of them daily.)  My \\\"clean your plate\\\" conditioning works *for* me.  Eating the last 10% takes half my eating time, and gives satiety a chance to catch up, so I don't still feel hungry and go start eating something else.  I don't eat when I'm not hungry (unless I'm sure I'll get hungry shortly, and eating won't be practical then).  I bike to work, 22 miles a day, year round.  Fast.  I also bike to stores, movies, and everywhere else, as I've never owned a car. I estimate this burns about 1000 calories a day.  It also helps build and maintain muscle mass, prevent insulin resistance (diabetes runs in my family), and increase my metabolism.  (Even so, my metabolism is so low that when I'm at rest I'm most comfortable with a temperature in the 90s (F), and usually wear a sweater if it drops to 80.)  Cycling also motivates me to avoid every excess ounce.  (Cyclists routinely pay a premium for cycling products that weigh slightly less than others.  But it's easier and cheaper to trim weight from the rider than from the vehicle.)  There's no question in my mind that my metabolism is radically different from that of most people who have never been fat.  Fortunately, it isn't different in a way that precludes excellent health.  Obviously, I can't swear that every obese person who does what I've done will have the success I did.  But I've never yet heard of one who did try it and didn't succeed.   I'm sure everyone's weight cycles, whether or not they've ever been fat. I usually eat extremely little salt.  When I do eat something salty, my weight can increase overnight by as much as ten pounds.  It comes off again over a week or two. --  Keith Lynch, kfl@access.digex.com\",\"[Deletions]  Geez, Dal must have slipped something into Ted's drink sometime.  Comparing Prince to Pagnozzi offensively is laughable.  Prince has never hit well in the minors and he's now 27 years old, I think.  Pagnozzi was not a bad hitter in the minors.  (I'll bring in the numbers tomorrow assuming I don't have another brain cramp and forget.)  He had a very good year at Louisville  before coming up to the majors.  As I recall, the hype on Pagnozzi coming up in the organization was good hit, decent fielding.  When he got to the  majors and didn't hit as well as expected (not as much playing time?), he  became Exhibit 312 in Nichols' Law of Catcher Defense and got the reputation  as an outstanding defensive catcher.  It's not clear he ever learned to hit.  His four years with more than 100 AB--  Born 31 July 1962 Year     AB      BA     SLG     OBA   1988    195    .282    .320    .328 1990    220    .277    .373    .321 1991    459    .264    .351    .317 1992    485    .249    .359    .290   No power, less-than-league-average walks, peak year when he turned 28,  now declining.  If Ted is going to invoke Pagnozzi as a model for Prince, given that Prince has underperformed Pagnozzi in the minors, it's not a rosy picture.  BTW, I'm still unhappy with moving Zeile, who had the same reputation  coming up in the Cardinal organization as Pagnozzi, except that he was a much, much better hitter, to 3rd where he could be an average hitter and a below average fielder instead of a well-above average hitter as an average (or below average) fielding catcher.  Harold\",\"     For discussion purposes, I will ignore dynamic effects like pulses in the exhaust pipe, and try to paint a useful mental picture.  1.  Unless an engine is supercharged, the pressure available to force air into the intake tract is _atmospheric_.  At the time the intake valve is opened, the pressure differential available to move air is only the difference between the combustion chamber pressure (left over after the exhaust stroke) and atmospheric.  As the piston decends on the intake stroke, combustion chamber pressure is decreased, allowing atmospheric pressure to move more air into the intake tract.  At no time does the pressure ever become \\\"negative\\\", or even approach a good vacuum.  2.  At the time of the exhaust valve closing, the pressure in the combustion chamber is essentially the pressure of the exhaust system up to the first major flow restriction (the muffler).  Note that the volume of gas that must flow through the exhaust is much larger than the volume that must flow through the intake, because of the temperature difference and the products of combustion.  3.  In the last 6-8 years, the Japanese manufacturers have started paying attention to exhaust and intake tuning, in pursuit of almighty horsepower.  At this point in time, on high-performance bikes, substitution of an aftermarket free-flow air filter will have almost zero affect on performance, because the stock intake system flows very well anyway.  Substitution of an aftermarket exhaust system will make very little difference, unless (in general) the new exhaust system is _much_ louder than the stocker.  4.  On older bikes,  exhaust back-pressure was the dominating factor. If free-flowing air filters were substituted, very little difference was noted, unless a free-flowing exhaust system was installed as well.  5.  In general, an engine can be visualized as an air pump.  At any given RPM, anything that will cause the engine to pump more air, be it on the intake or exhaust side, will cause it to produce more horsepower. Pumping more air will require recalibration (rejetting) of the carburetor.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\",\"I've gotten very few posts on this group in the last couple days.

Game is so different here in Europe compared to NHL. North-ame- ricans are better in small rinks and europeans in large rinks. An average european player from Sweden, Finland, Russian or Tsech/Slovakia is a better  skater and  puckhandler than his NHL colleague. Especially defenders in NHL are mainly slow and clumsy. Sel{nne has also said that in the Finnish Sm-league game is more based on skill than in NHL. In Finland he couldn't get so many  breakaways because defenders here are an average much better skaters than in NHL. Also Alpo Suhonen said that in NHL Sel{nne's speed accentuates because of clumsy defensemen.  I have to admit that the best players come from Canada, but those regulars aren't as skilful as regulars in the best european leagues.

Foul (Any illegal contact with the other player or his stick with your    body or stick). If you get 5 you are out for the game.  2. Unsportsmanlike contact. (An intentional foul). This inlcludes all the    current flavours of roughing, fighting and boarding. If you get two you    are thrown out of the game, and fined.  3. Technical foul. Bad mouthing the ref, by player or coach. Penalty shot    is awarded. Two and you are thrown out of the game.  Besides the penalty shot for one technical, if the team gets 5 penalties in a period, the opposing team gets a penalty shot for every additional one, until the end of the period. The victim gets two shots if he/she was in the act of shooting when the foul ocured.  This works well for several reasons. First, penalty shots are the most exciting thing in hockey, right? So, it follows that the more the better. Next, when the player is setting up for a penalty shot, the network can take a commercial. Finally, with only three penalties, the network announcers (Don Meredith, Dick Vitale, John Madden, Pat Summerall, and Marv Levy, among others) will be able to tell the viewers what happened before the PA announcer says it.  Oh, one other rule. When a goal is scored (10-20 times a period), the play cannot resume until the PA announcer announces it. This way, the network can sneak in a few more commercials. Then, once the PA announcer has told them who scored, the TV announcer can tell you the viewer, and even have a  chance of pronouncing his name right.  Seriously, though, I actually went to see a NBA basketball game last week, for the first time in my life. I was amazed how boring it was. The play is so slow they actually had fans come out for things like free-throw shooting contests DURING THE PERIOD!. Of course the 'Laker Girls' get to do their  routines at least 6-8 times during the game, and not just between periods either. There is a whistle every 30 seconds on average, maybe less. The game is 48 minutes, with 2 minutes between quarters 1-2 and 3-4 and a 10 minute halftime, and it still takes over 2 hours.  The reason for this has to be TV. There is plenty of room to throw in commercials, and have the announcer jabber while nothing else is happening. On TV, basketball is fairly entertaining, IMHO. But, it is better to watch it on TV than to be there. If this is the road the NHL is following, then it truly is a sad day.  Enough for now.\",\": I would like to get your opinions on this: when exactly does an engaged : couple become \\\"married\\\" in God's eyes?  Some say that if the two have : publically announced their plans to marry, have made their vows to God, and : are unswervingly committed to one another (I realize this is a subjective : qualifier) they are married/joined in God's sight.  The way I read Scripture, a couple becomes married when they are *physically* married, i.e. when they first have sexual intercourse.  e.g. the end of Genesis 2 (quoted from memory) ``for this reason, a man shall leave his parents and be joined to his wife, and they will become one flesh'' (Jesus also quotes this scripture referring to marriage).  If you read through Genesis in particular, you will often come across the phraseology: ``[man] lay with [woman], and she became his wife''. This implies that she became his wife when they lay together, i.e. at the point of intercourse.  Compare this with Jewish tradition: Joseph, when he heard that Mary was pregnant, had it in mind to divorce her quietly -- but Mary and Joseph were *betrothed*, not married. i.e., they were in a binding relationship (which required a divorce to get out of), but *marriage* would not occur until Mary and Joseph went to bed together.  Compare with Christ and the Church (Ephesians 5, Revelation 19): the church is described as the ``bride'' of Christ, but the *marriage* of the Lamb takes  place when Jesus returns. i.e., we are in a binding love-relationship with Jesus, but we are still looking forward to the time when the marriage will take place. I see this as the spiritual equivalent of sexual intercourse, because it represents the most intimate fellowship possible between man and God.  In summary, engagement should be honoured as a binding relationship, but it is not marriage. A civil ceremony is not marriage either. Marriage occurs at the point when the betrothed couple go to bed together. (I don't mean to demean the civil or church ceremony -- ours was great! I don't mean to be too pedantic.) Historically, I think I am correct in stating that the civil ceremony (i.e. a marriage recognised by the state), has only been around in the West since Napoleon, who introduced it to keep tabs on the people (although I'm ready to be corrected on that point!)  This view obviously raises some questions:  What about those who have had sex with one or more partners, without considering marriage. Are those people also ``married''?  If it is true that marriage occurs at the point of intercourse, is it necessary to be married in the eyes of the state? (I would say Yes, because this honours the laws of our nations in the West. Although it is not illegal to sleep together though unmarried in most Western countries, I believe that it is God- honouring to proclaim our marriage to the state and to our friends before actually consummating our marriage. Its to do with our being salt and light, and also to do with how people will perceive us; i.e. it is culturally insensitive to declare yourself married without going through a civil ceremony.)  --   ----- Michael Davis (cs89mcd@brunel.ac.uk)\",\"UPI Washington DC, Update Desk   4/15/93    For the past several months the Clinton administration has been   stymied by mixed signals coming from the economy.

The unemployment figures seem stalled at the 7% mark.  last month,   in an effort to understand this problem, President Clinton appointed   a blue ribbon panel to try to resolve the apparent conflicting   economic signals.  This panel was chaired by Vice President Gore.    Today the panel released their results, providing a shocking conclusion.   \\\"It's the guns\\\" Vice President Gore said.  Apparently NRA members, and other   \\\"gun-nuts\\\" are purchasing firearms at in record numbers, pulling the   economy out of the recession.  \\\"Their buying them five times faster than   ever before, and stockpiling left and right\\\", the Vice President said.      However, since many domestic firearm and ammunition manufacturers have   been experiencing hard times during the past few years, including several   declarations of bankruptcy by many leading American gun makers, they have   not rushed to increase hiring to meet the new demand.    \\\"We want to see if this run will continue before hiring more people\\\", said   the President of Colt industries.  \\\"As long as Clinton is in office, we   suspect it will\\\", he added.    In response to this new information, President Clinton announced a new   Gun Control measure to be introduced into Congress this session.  It's    called the \\\"Ban-One-A-Month\\\" Gun Control Bill.  Under the terms of this law,   every make and model of all firearms will be written on individual index    cards.  The cards will all be put in a big hat and the President will draw   one card every month.  Sixty days later that gun will be banned from any   further manufacture/importation or sale in this country, except to the   politically connected and to members of the National Police Force.    The President said, \\\"This law will benefit America two ways.  When the   Gun-Of-The-Month is announced every thirty days, the gun-nuts will run   out and buy thousands of them, boosting the economy even more.  In addition,   over the long run, we will get all of these icky-evil guns off of the   street.\\\"  He also announce the appointment of Sarah Brady to oversee   this program, citing her \\\"Honesty, and unbiased view on the subject   of gun control\\\".    Senators Metzenbaum, DeConcini, Feinstein, and Boxer have proposed an   amendment to the Bill which would add additional index cards containing   caliber designations for all know ammunitions.  \\\"Their stockpiling,   stockpiling, stockpiling\\\" screamed Metzenbaum during a press conference   at the national Headquarters of Handgun Control Inc.    Senators Simon, Metzenbaum, and Moyenhan also introduced an amendment   that would make all guns illegal to possess once the last card has been   drawn from the hat.  Senator Simon was quoted as saying, \\\"First we'll   fuck em, then we'll kick em out of bed in the morning\\\", during a press   conference he held in the second floor Mens Restroom of the Senate   building.  He of course was referring to the fact that he would allow   the people to purchase the guns to help the economy, but would require   the BATF to seize all of the guns in America sometime in the year 2008,   after all of the cards have been drawn.    The head of the BATF responded by saying, \\\"We will have to see if this   thing in Waco is over by then.  We may be too busy to seize all those   guns\\\".    US House Representatives Pat Schroeder and David Skaggs of Colorado   declared this proposed law as being \\\"reasonable gun control which won't   affect anybodys Constitutional right to own sporting guns\\\".    - end article -    For the humor impaired :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)                                   Bill Vojak                                 vojak@icebucket.stortek.com     NRA, ILA,                                 Colorado Firearms Coalition ------------------------------------------------------------ The CBS Nightly Propaganda With Dan Rather.

We can just call them house Jews, fools, or anti-Semites from Jewish families.

Once you've found a bike you're interested in, call some insurance companies for rates. Some bikes are much cheaper to insure than you might think (my EX-500 only costs me $127/year in St. Louis; I'm 27)  For a first bike, I recommend 500cc's or less. And a bike short enough to get both feet on the ground when you stop.   The one piece of advice EVERYONE will give you is to take a Motorcycle Safety Foundation Rider's Course. See a dealer for details. In some states, completion of such a course can give you a break on insurance. It will also teach you to ride properly from the beginning, so you won't learn any bad habits.  Good luck. Riding a motorcycle is the most fun you can have, naked or otherwise.\",\"Hi, I just have a small question about my bike.  Being a fairly experienced BMW and MZ-Mechanic, I just don't know what to  think about my Honda.  She was using too much oil for the last 5000 km (on my trip to Daytona bike  week this spring), and all of a sudden, she trailed smoke like hell and  was running only on one cylinder.  I towed the bike home and took it apart, but everything looks in perfect  working order. No cracks in the heads or pistons, the cylinder walls look  very clean, and the wear of pistons and cylinders is not measurable. All  still within factory specs. The only thing I could find, however, was a  slightly bigger ring gap on the right cylinder (the one with the problem),  but it is still way below the wear-limit given in the Clymer-manual for  this bike.  Any syggestions??? What else could cause my problem??? Do I have to hone  the cylinder walls (make them a little rougher in a criss-cross-pattern) in  order to get better breaking in of my new rings??? Won't that increase the  wear of my pistons?? Please send comments to   sruhl@mechanical.watstar.uwaterloo.ca Thanks in advance. Stef. \",\"                                                         ^^^ Wow!

The empirical evidence of the last two decades is that more people will show up to see the Bruins play the Sabre umpteen times than see the Bruins play the Captials in the first round.  Maybe hockey has increased in popularity sufficiently that this will no longer be the case.  The experiment is worthwhile with the uneven distribution of the expansion teams, but I prefer the divisional  playoff.\",\"  A nice formulation for the introduction of the first encryption devices with built-in trapdoors - just like the Feds wanted...   Bla-bla.   Indeed, and the current proposal does nothing to prevent the latter.   This doesn't say much. There are many incredibly weak encryption algorithms in commercial use today...   Except from the government.   Nope. The criminals won't be stupid enough to use the new chip, they'll use something secure. This technology provides only means to intercept the phone conversations of people who are stupid enough to use it.   That is, the government has the keys. It doesn't matter much if they are in one or in two of its hands...   Correct. It does, however, provide those Americans with the false sense of privacy.   If the screening is not public, it cannot be trusted. Some people do not trust DES even today, after all the examinations - only because some parts of its design were kept secret.   So they'll use a different technology to hide their illegal activities. So will those law-abiding citizens, who do not trust their government not to misuse its abilities to decrypt their conversations.   Except from the government.   Huh? Later it says that the new technology will be export restricted.   In short, the new technology can:  1) Protect the law abiding citizen's privacy from the casual snooper.  It cannot:  1) Protect him from the government, if it decides to misuse its ability to decrypt the conversations.  2) Protect him from the criminals who succeed to break the new encryption scheme or to steal the keys, or to bribe the people who handle them, etc.  3) Prevent the criminals from using secure encryption for communication.    Correct. However, it does not provide them that much privacy as it claims.    Two candidates: the NSA and the Mafia.    That is, \\\"trust us\\\".   \\\"Security through obscurity\\\".   If it's not entirely open to public examination, it cannot be trusted. Besides, who can prove that the devices used for examination and the ones built into your phones will be the same?    The NSA and the FBI?    Why did they \\\"forget\\\" the Academia?    Doesn't this smell to monopolism?    Like the Mafia?   This is the main question, why was it buried at the end?   \\\"We'll see\\\".   \\\"Trust us\\\".   In short, \\\"If we decide to outlaw strong crypto, we'll tell you\\\".   Since the US government seems to consider strong crypto as munitions and since the US constitutions guarantees the right to every American to bear arms, why is not every American entitled, as a matter of right, to an unbreakable commercial encryption product?   Bullshit. The proposed technology provides a false sense of security, encryption devices with built-in capabilities for breaking the encryption, does not prevent the criminals to use strong crypto, and is a step to outlaw strong crypto.    Who was the optimist who believed that the new administration will leave the export controls on strong crypto devices?  OK, I'm not American, it's not my business, but I just couldn't resist to comment... The whole plot looks so totalitaristic... It's up to you, Americans, to fight for your rights.

And, much as it discomforts us, in humans a trouble-free birth process was sacrificed to increased brain and cranial size.  Wild animals have a much easier time with birth than humans do. Domestic horses and cows typically have a worse time.  To give you an idea: my family tree is complicated because a few of my pioneer great-great- grandfathers had several wives, and we never could figure out which wife had each child.  One might ask why this happened.  My great-great- grandfathers were, by the time they reached their forties, quite prosperous farmers.  Nonetheless, they lost several wives each to the rigors of childbirth; the graveyards in Spencer, Indiana, and Boswell, North Dakota, contain quite a few gravestones like \\\"Ida, wf. of Jacob Liptrap, and baby, May 6, 1853.\\\"   More like one in ten.  And the consequences can be devastating; I have direct experience of more than a dozen victims of a fouled-up breech birth.   It isn't always fatal.  But it is often fatal, when it happens out of reach of adequate help.  More often, it permanently damages one's health.  Clearly women's bodies _evolved_ to give birth (I am no believer in divine design); however, evolution did not favor trouble-free births for humans.     My, aren't we wroth!  I haven't read a more outrageous straw man attack in months!  I can practically see your mouth foam.  We're statistically sophisticated enough to balance the risks.  Although I can't produce exact statistics 5 years after the last time we looked them up, rest assured that we balanced C-section risks against other risks. I wouldn't encourage my wife to have a Caesarean unless it was clearly indicated; on the other hand, I am opposed (on obvious grounds) to waiting until an emergency to give in.  And bear this in mind: my wife took the lead in all of these decisions. We talked things over, and I did a lot of the leg work, but the main decisions were really hers.   I don't know of very many home birth advocates, even, that think that a first-time mother should have her baby at home.   But people should bother to find out the relative risks.  My wife was unwilling to take any significant risks in order to have nice surroundings. In view of the intensity of the birth experience, I doubt surroundings have much importance anyway.  Somehow the values you're advocating seem all lopsided to me: taking risks, even if fairly small, of serious permanent harm in order to preserve something that is, after all, an esthetic consideration.\",\"-| I just installed a Motorola XC68882RC50 FPU in an Amiga A2630 board (25 MHz -| 68030 + 68882 with capability to clock the FPU separately).

Speaking as an atheist (heterosexual, for what it's worth), this is one of the least attractive parts of some varieties of Christianity.  Although I'm sure it's possible to argue theologically that we shouldn't make analogies between discrimination on the basis of sex and race and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, morally the case looks unanswerable (for those outside religion): the three forms _are_ analogous; we shouldn't discriminate on the basis of sex, race or sexual orientation.  I found the moderator's FAQs on the subject instructive, and recommend everyone to read them.  There seem to be three different levels of acceptance:  1) Regard homosexual orientation as a sin (or evil, whatever) 2) Regard homosexual behaviour as a sin, but accept orientation (though presumably orientation is unfortunate) and dislike people who indulge 3) As 2, but \\\"love the sinner\\\" 4) Accept homosexuality altogether.  My experience is that 3 is the most common attitude (I imagine 1 and 2 are limited to a few fundamentalist sects).  I suppose I can go along with 3, except that I have this feeling that a 14--15 year old living in a community with this attitude, on discovering that they were more attracted to members of the same sex, would not feel the love of the community, but would rather feel the pressure not to exhibit their feelings.  I'm not saying that the community (in particular the parents) would not love the child, but I suspect the child would not feel loved.\",\"[deletia- sig]  [deletia- formalities]  I probably should let this pass, it's not worth the time, and it's not really intended for me. But I couldn't resist. A personal weakness of mine. Jerkius Kneeus. Tragically incurable.   Not so; I can prove that the existance of God is disputable by showing that people dispute it; This is easy: I dispute that God exists. Simple.  I missed your \\\"Traditional Proofs\\\" treatise, but the proofs I remember from the Summa Theologic (the 5 ways I think it was) were rather poor stuff. The Ontological argument is about a billion times better, imho.  I would think you'd want non-traditional proofs, considering the general failure of the traditional proofs: at least the ones I know of. (I am thinking of the Ontological Argument, the Cosmological Argument and the Teleological argument. Those are the ones traditional enough to have funny names, anyway.)   This is the real question. So to discuss it, I'll assume God exists. Otherwise, there is no heavenly authority to babble about.   Please show this is the case. I am familiar with the First Cause argument, and I'll accept (for the sake of argument) that there is a First Cause, even though I find some of its premices questionable. The rest you'll have to show. This includes that the First Cause is God.   Got it. I deny that God is all good. So there.   This isn't self-consistent: if humans must renew the relationship, then God (incarnate or not) can't do it. Well, unless you think God is human. Granted, God made himself 'human', but this is nonetheless cheating: The intent of the statement is clearly that man has to fix the problem he caused. God fixing it- even by indirect means- contradicts this.   Why?  Also, why assume said claim is true anyway?  If *I* claim to be Truth, are you bound by reason to follow me?   :)  Undoubtably. Do you mean to imply we should all obey the commands of the Marines without question? You seem to imply this about God, and that the Marines are similar in this respect.. If this is not what you are trying to say, they please explain what it is you are saying, as I have missed it.   Why? Why not question it? Even if it *is* truth, we cannot know this certainly, so why is it so irrational to question? Perhaps we will thus discover that we were wrong.  You assert that God is Truth and we can't question Truth. But I assert that God is not Truth and anyway we can question Truth. How is it my assertion is less good than yours?   Oh?  I hereby deny 1+1=2.  I hope you'll agree 1+1=2 is the truth.  Granted, I look pretty damn silly saying something like that, but I needed something we'd both agree was clearly true.  Now, you'll notice no stormtroopers have marched in to drag me off to the gulag. No heaven lighting bolts either. No mysterious net outages. I seem to be permited to say such things, absurd or not.   They are certainly not true. At least, the ones Newton derived are not true, and are indeed wildly inaccurate at high speeds or small distances. We do not have a set of Laws of Physics that always works in all cases. If we did, Physics would be over already.  Science is all about Questioning this sort of truth. If we didn't, we'd still follow Aristotle. I'd generalize this a little more: If you want to learn anything new, you MUST question the things you Know (tm). Because you can always be wrong.   Even presupposing that Truth may not be Denied, and may not be Questioned, and that God is Truth, it only follows that God may not be Denied or Questioned. NOT that he must be obeyed!  We could unquestioningly DISobey him. How annoying of us. But you have not connected denial with disobedience.  ---    - Dan \\\"No Nickname\\\" Johnson And God said \\\"Jeeze, this is dull\\\"... and it *WAS* dull.

I wrote that human brains \\\"are infested with sin\\\", and can be trusted only in limited circumstances.    Which just moves the problem back one level: how do you tell if your conscience is properly formed?  The only way to tell is to presuppose that you are capable of judging the formed-ness of your own conscience.  In other words, you can only be sure that your conscience is `properly formed' if you assume that your evaluation can be trusted.  Assuming your conclusions saves you a lot of time, I'll grant, but it's not a valid way of reasoning.  Unless you are infallible, your judgements about your own thinking cannot be certain.  Therefore, it is not possible to be certain your conscience is `properly formed'.  (Whatever that is supposed to mean.)   Mr Boundary then gives another paradigm example of the problem:   The Church is `by necessity' the infallible interpreter of divine revelation? How do you know?  Presumably, you believe this because of some argument or another -- how do you know that the argument contains no mistakes?  You write:   But there is a huge difference between `confidence in our ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true' and `infallible'.  I am confident about a lot of things, but absolute certainty is a very long way from `confident'.  This discussion is about the arrogance of claiming to be absolutely certain (really, go check the subject line).  Saying you are absolutely certain is significantly different than saying you are confident.  When you say that you are confident, that invites people to ask why.  Except in very limited circumstances, when you say that you are absolutely certain, it invites people to dismiss you as someone who does not have any idea of his own fallibility.   I have yet to meet anyone who believed in a knowably-infallible source of truth who would admit the possibility of errors in his reasoning.  All of them -- every last one -- has claimed that he was himself infallible. The result has been to convince me that they had no idea what was going on.   Darren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu  [This particular discussion may not be entirely relevant to the original criticism.  I get the feeling that the original poster regarded as arrogant the very idea that there are right and wrong answers in religion, and that the difference can have eternal consequences.  When I say that I think there is a hell and that he is at least in significant danger of ending up there, I will admit that -- as you say -- the reasoning processes I used to reach this are fallible.  Thus at least in principle I could be wrong.  But these basic facts are clearly enough taught in the Bible that I think it's unlikely that I'm misinterpreting it.  (In order to get this level of confidence, I've tried to frame my statement sufficiently carefully as to sidestep a number of the more controversial issues.  I haven't, for example said that all non-Christians will definitely end up in hell, and I haven't attempted to describe hell in any detail.)  I have a feeling that my view is going to be regarded as arrogant and intolerant even though I acknowledge that I'm fallible and so there's some chance I'm wrong.  Don't get me wrong -- I think there are a lot of genuinely arrogant Christians, and often criticism of us is justified.  But in at least some cases I think the criticisms constitute blaming the messenger. If the universe is set up so that there are eternal consequences for certain decisions, it's not my fault -- I'm just telling it the way I think it is.  You may think God is immoral for setting things up that way.  It's one of the critiques of Christianity that I find it most difficult to respond to.  But it's not arrogance for me to tell what I think is the truth.\",\"Well i'm not sure about the story nad it did seem biased.

Having lived in Europe I realize that incidences such as the one described in the letter have occured. The U.S. media as a whole seem to try to ignore them. The U.S. is subsidizing Israels existance and the Europeans are not (at least not to the same degree). So I think that might be a reason they report more clearly on the atrocities.

Questions: ========= The software is Netware 286 Level II and I can see burnt on to the screen SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a. However, to configure netware for level II (mirrored or duplexed disks) requires a second disk, yes?   So how is the Novell Server 286A normally configured?  1. Can I install SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a as Level I, or is this what is causing my serialisation error? 2. Is the Novell Server 286A normally equipped with two hard drives, one of which has failed? 3. Would this mean I can not install the network software because it will not be serialised for this hardware with a failed drive? 4. What else can cause a serialisation error? 5. What happens if the keycard fails? 6. Am I doing something wrong? Can someone knowledgeable offer some comments and guides.  Thanks for your time.  Apology: ======= I appreciate that I have posted this request somewhat widely. As I'm dealing with somewhat archaic hardware and software I'm hoping that by casting my net further, I'm more likely to capture someone who has met this system before. I believe I can justify the groups to which I am posting. Please feel free to correct me if you feel this is an inappropriate place to post this.  \",\"  Not acceptable. Syria and Lebanon have a right to determine if they wish to return to the situation prior to the French invasion where they were both part of the same \\\"mandate territory\\\" - read colony.  Israel has no right to determine what happens in Lebanon. Invading another country because you consider them a threat is precisely the way that almost all wars of aggression have started.    Again territorial expansion by force.    The UN defines them as occupied. They are recognised as such by every nation on earth (excluding one small caribean island).    So the Adam thinks that peace is possible with continued occupation and  a continued military presence? That is a completely unsustainable situation because the USA is bankrupt and simply cannot afford to finance the Israeli ecconomy any more. There is no money for such an occupation.    They were moved in as part of a deliberate policy to prevent the return of the occupied territories. Machiavelli described the reasoning in the Prince. The clear intention was to create a constituency which the Likud beleived could not be deprived of the land stolen from the indigenous population.  The pretexts under which the settlers aquired land was through the  redefinition of much land used in common as \\\"public land\\\". The assertion that the village common on which the village depends for food belongs to an invader simply because no individual has title is clearly an excuse. When the land is used to build a condominium for aliens brought in to occupy the land for a foreign power there is a clear breach of the Geneva convention which stipulates that land use in occupied territories must not be changed.   No amount of self justifying on the part of Likud and hard linner appologists will change the fact that the majority of world governments, and all of those that actually have any power have condemned this practice.    Theyu also are a liability. We are talking about civilian encampments that would last no more than hours against tanks,   Don't fool yourself. It was the gulf war that brought the Israelis to the negotiating table. Once their US backers had a secure base in the gulf they insrtructed Shamir to negotiate or else.  If the creation of settlements had gone on any longer the USA would have cut the money supply.   Not at all. They can chose to live in an arab state or return to Israel.   The existence of a comunity does not give the right for another country to annexe territory, not in Bosnia, not in the West Bank.   Unless the new boundaries drawn up are those of 48 there will be no peace. Araffat has precious little authority to agree to anything else.   The real issue is not the land treaty but the trade treaty. Since the Palestinians will remain heavily dependent on Israel indefinitely it is this that will be the guarantor of peace. another factor will be the return of lands confiscated by the Israeli state within Israel and the dismantling of the shadow structures which allow discrimination against non-Jews within what is nominaly a secular state.   The irony is that in return for a guarantee that the palestinian state has a non descrimination law in order to protect the remaining settlers the Israeli state is going to be forced inot the same position. This will mean outlawing of discrimination such as that which prevents arabs from buying or using much of the land.   \",\"can anyone give me more information regarding endometriosis?   i heard it's a very common disease among women and if anyone can provide names of a specialist/surgeon in  the north carolina research triangle  park area (raleigh/durham/chapel  hill) who is familiar with the condition, i would really appreciate it.  thanks.   --Naomi\",\" My speculation does not include or depend upon a trapdoor in RSAREF.

The air flow of small 3.5 inch fans can be reduced by about 50% by using a 1 to 4 uF capacitor.  Use a good grade nonpolarized unit with working voltage rating around 250 volts.  Note that some impriical study is usually required to experimentally determine the best size capacitor for a given application.  For DC powered applications, try the Radio Shack 12 volt box fan. It can run and start reliably from as low as about 4.5 VDC.  It is exceptionally quiet, but at admittedly low flow.

It was in the early '60's.  He had had more than a few books published by that time, but he was down on his luck financially.  Rumor was that he was hunting urban pigeons with birdshot for food.  He viewed himself as a resourceful man, and (IMO) decided to check out gracefully if he couldn't support himself.  The worst part is that John Campbell, the long-time editor of Astounding/Analog SF magazine had cut a check for Piper's most recent story, and said check was in the mail.  If Campbell had known Piper's straits, I'm sure he would have phoned to say hang on. Campbell was like that.  I wish it had happened differently.

I don't usually subscribe to these newsgroups so I would really appreciate it if someone could possibly e-mail me the answer to my problem. I have been using Windows 3.1 since buying it last winter but I have just now come across an annoying bug. I now have about 8 different groups in program manager but it seems that everytime I install something new that makes a new group, it promptly disappears after I turn of windows! This happened when I installed Excel and WinFax Pro v.3. They both created their own groups but when I turned off windows and reran them, they were gone. I had to manually pull them up as new items and put them in a previously existing group as all new gropus disappear as soon as I turn off windows.  my set up:    precision 386dx-25 w/ 4 megs    Trident 8900c with 1 meg     Windows 3.1 running in 800x600 colour mode    logitech mouseman     Thank you in advance!

Let us imagine that the executive branch actually could extract keys from the escrow houses without anyone knowing, or telling. Now what? Dick has 80 bits of data. What the hell's he gonna do with it?   1) Trot around to the telco and say 'we'd like an unauthorised decrypting tap'. Uh huh.  2) Break in to watergate and install his own tap (so his people still do have to break in, neat, huh?) record some noise, then get the Executive Branch Phone Decryption Box (huh? they've got one? Goodness, wait 'til the washington post gets hold of this) and decrypt the noise.  3) More likely, stare at the key, and say 'Oh, hell it's not worth all this bloody hassle'   Truth is, even granted *lots* of covert power on the part of the Executive Branch, this system is *more* difficult to tap with than POTS gear. The fact that it is easier to tap than some hypothetical system neither you nor I am going to place on our phones is neither here nor there.   The only rational concerns I am seeing raised are:   a) is the key really just chopped in half, and not some XOR arrangement? That is, has some egregious technical error been built in to the plan?  b) is this is the first step toward strict regulation of strong encryption?     This is b), of course. I suspect not. If the government actually wanted to make such regs, they'd just do it. A few hundred people on Usenet yelling about it wouldn't even slow the machine down.   Besides, who is this mysterious 'they' who's going to take away all our rights the instant we let our guard down? Congress? That gang of buffoons can't even balance their checkbooks. The FBI?

Hiermee ontstond de tweede universiteitssterrenwacht ter wereld. Aert Jansz, de eerste waarnemer, en zijn opvolgers voerden de Utrechtse sterrenkunde in de daaropvolgende jaren, decennia en eeuwen naar de voorhoede van het astronomisch onderzoek. Dit jaar is het 350 jaar geleden dat deze historische benoeming plaatsvond.  De huidige generatie Utrechtse sterrenkundigen en studenten sterrenkunde, verenigd in het Sterrekundig Instituut Utrecht, vieren de benoeming van hun 'oervader' middels een breed scala aan feestelijke activiteiten. Zo is er voor scholieren een planetenproject, programmeert de Studium Generale een aantal voordrachten met een sterrenkundig thema en wordt op de Dies Natalis aan een astronoom een eredoctoraat uitgereikt. Er staat echter meer op stapel.  Studenten natuur- en sterrenkunde kunnen op 26 april aan een sterrenkundesymposium deelnemen. De onderwerpen van het symposium zijn opgebouwd rond een van de zwaartepunten van het huidige Utrechtse onderzoek: het onderzoek aan de zogeheten 'compacte objecten', de eindstadia in de evolutie van sterren. Bij de samenstelling van het programma is getracht de deelnemer een zo aktueel en breed mogelijk beeld te geven van de stand van zaken in het onderzoek aan deze eindstadia. In de eerste, inleidende lezing zal dagvoorzitter prof. Lamers een beknopt overzicht geven van de evolutie van zware sterren, waarna de zeven overige sprekers in lezingen van telkens een half uur nader op de specifieke evolutionaire eindprodukten zullen ingaan. Na afloop van elke lezing is er gelegenheid tot het stellen van vragen. Het dagprogramma staat afgedrukt op een apart vel. Het niveau van de lezingen is afgestemd op tweedejaars studenten natuur- en sterrenkunde. OOK ANDERE BELANGSTELLENDEN ZIJN VAN HARTE WELKOM!  Tijdens de lezing van prof. Kuijpers zullen, als alles goed gaat, de veertien radioteleskopen van de Radiosterrenwacht Westerbork worden ingezet om via een directe verbinding tussen het heelal, Westerbork en Utrecht het zwakke radiosignaal van een snel roterende kosmische vuurtoren, een zogeheten pulsar, in de symposiumzaal door te geven en te audiovisualiseren. Prof. Kuijpers zal de binnenkomende signalen (elkaar snel opvolgende scherp gepiekte pulsen radiostraling) bespreken en trachten te verklaren. Het slagen van dit unieke experiment staat en valt met de technische haalbaarheid ervan. De op te vangen signalen zijn namelijk zo zwak, dat pas na een waarnemingsperiode van 10 miljoen jaar genoeg energie is opgevangen om een lamp van 30 Watt een seconde te laten branden! Tijdens het symposium zal er niet zo lang gewacht hoeven te worden: de hedendaagse technologie stelt ons in staat live het heelal te beluisteren.  Deelname aan het symposium kost f 4,- (exclusief lunch) en f 16,- (inclusief lunch). Inschrijving geschiedt door het verschuldigde bedrag over te maken op ABN-AMRO rekening 44.46.97.713 t.n.v. stichting 350 JUS. Het gironummer van de ABN-AMRO bank Utrecht is 2900. Bij de inschrijving dient te worden aangegeven of men lid is van de NNV. Na inschrijving wordt de symposiummap toegestuurd.

It's beyond my grasp why some object that Mary, who was far greater than either Enoch or Elijah, should not benefit from the same privelege they recieved.  She was after all, Mother of God, full of grace, and immaculate.   And in St. Germain of Constantinople and St. John of Damascus, and in St. Andrew of Crete, among others.  And it should be noted that the Monophysite Chruches of Egypt and Syria also hold to this belief as part of divine revelation, even though they broke away from the unity of the Chruch in 451 AD by rejecting the Council of Chalcedon.  It might be argued by some Protestants that the Catholics and Orthodox made this belief up, but the Monophysites, put a big hole in that notion, as they also hold the belief, and they split from the Chruch before the belief was first annunciated in writing (as far as is known, much has been lost from the time of the Fathers).\",\"There has been quite a bit of discussion about house wiring and grounding practices here.  A few points need to be clarified:  The Equipment GROUNDING conductor, Green, green with a yellow stripe, bare, or the metal sheath or pipe of SOME wiring methods, is used as a safety ground, to carry fault currents back to the circuit breaker panel, and to limit the voltage on the metal case of utilization equipment or other metal objects.  It should never (except for a few exceptions to be discussed later) carry the normal operating current of a connected load.  Some equipment has filters in the power supply which may cause some slight current flow through the grounding conductor.    Much communications or audio equipment is sensitive to noise or slight voltages on the grounding conductor, and may require special wiring of the grounding conductors to provide reliable operation  (\\\"orange\\\" outlets are often used for this, with insulated grounding conductors wired back to the panel box, and in many cases back to the service.  Anyone installing such a system should read both the section on grounding in the National Electric Code and publications on installing quiet isolated ground systems.  The code requires the insulated grounding conductors (green wires) to run with the current carrying conductors back to the panel box, and, if required, back all the way to the service entrance , where it is bonded to the service ground (water pipe or rod)  Many of these systems are installed illegally or unsafely, where they do not provide a safe ground or a quiet ground or either.   The GROUNDED conductor of a circuit, often called the NEUTRAL, which is referred to in the code as the \\\"identified\\\" conductor and is supposed to be white or natural grey.  This conductor is supposed to be connected to ground in most electrical systems at a single point, generally at the service entrance panel.  This connection is through the Main Bonding Jumper.  (In many household service panels, the main bonding jumper is actually a bonding screw which attaches the neutral busbar to the case of the panel)    The Grounded conductor (neutral) is generally a current carrying conductor.  In the case of a 120 volt circuit it is one of the two conductors completing the circuit from the panel to the load device.    Since the grounded conductor (neutral) is only connected to the grounding conductor (bare or green) at the service entrance, if the load is any distance from the service and draws any significant current, there will be a small but measurable voltage between the grounded and grounding conductors at the load, under normal operating conditions.  If you should (incorrectly) connect the grounded (neutral) conductor to the grounding conductor at the load, some of the neutral current will flow instead through the grounding conductor.  Since there will now be current flowing through the grounding conductor, it will also no longer be quite at ground potential at the load end.  If the load equipment has a metal case, which is connected to the grounding conductor through the \\\"U\\\" ground plug, the metal case is now also no longer quite at ground potential.  The difference (under normal, non short-circuit conditions) may be only a few tenths of a volt, but it could also be a volt or two.  This normally does not present a shock hazard.    HOWEVER, if you let the metal case of the grounded equipment come into contact with an independently grounded object such as a water or gas pipe, a radiator, a metal air conditioning duct or such, part of the neutral current will try to flow through this aalternate ground path.  If the contact is not solid, you will get a significant arc (a low voltage, but possibly moderate current arc) Under the wrong conditions, this arcing could start a fire.  It is possible in some cases that the sneak ground current   could also flow through a wire of inadequate size, causing it to overheat.  With the incorrect non single-point grounding of the neutral, if there is a short circuit from hot to neutral, the high short circuit current which may flow will cause a much higher voltage on the grounding conductor, which increases the possibility for shock or fire.    Also if you incorrectly multiply connect the neutral and ground, the voltage on the ground system is seen as noise bu computer or audio equipment, often causing malfunction.  I have spent some hours tracking down such shorts in technical facilities where they were inducing severe hum into equipment.  The Neutral is usually bonded to the ground at the distribution transformer as well as at the service entrance of each dwelling.  This is done primarily for lightning protection, so that induced lightning currents have a short path back to ground, and also to assure that the currents drawn by shorts to grounded objects like pipes draw enough current to trip circuit breakers or blow fuses quickly.  The bad side of this is that not all the neutral current from the dwelling goes through the neutral wire back to the transformer.  Some of it flows through the grounding electrode (water pipe, etc.) this may cause corrosion in the pipes and possibly in things like underground fuel oil tanks, and it may also cause measurable AC magnetic fields due to the large loop between the \\\"hot\\\" conductors in the service and the neutral current in the water pipe and ground.  There are those who feel these fields may be unhealthy.  (don't flame ME on this, I'm just telling you where the field comes from, not it's health effect, as far as I'm concerned, the jury is still out on this.)  Note that the bonding jumper is only installed at the main panel, NOT at any sub distribution panels.  This is one reason why it is illegal to run service entrance cable with the sheath used as a neutral to a sub panel, you must have a seperate insulated conductor for the neutral.  The sheath can be used in this application only as the groundING conductor.  If the neutral is bonded to the grounding conductor in the sub panel, say by forgetting to remove the bonding screw, all the grounding conductors of the loads on that panel will be above ground, with the possible problems listed above.  The code makes exceptions for ranges and dryers, as well as feeds from one building to another.  In the cases of the range and dryer, the neutral may be used as the equipment ground under certain conditions, instead of a seperate wire.  Every time the code is revised, these exceptions come up for review.  These exceptions were, in fact the first required safety grounds, in the days before U ground outlets and such.  The appliance manufacturers don't want to have to redesign their ranges and driers, and the contractors don't want to have to run four wire cable (with four fairly heavy, expensive wires) in place of three wire to the appliances.  No question it would be safer with seperate neutrals to the stove, but the neutral current is low for most burner settings (since most current is in the 220 volt \\\"hots\\\" except at some low settings, the wires are large gauge, and there are few reported cases of injury or damage.  So far, the exceptions have survived. In the case of feeds between buildings, it's primarily for lightning protection.  People doing wiring should be aware what is and what isn't a legal grounding conductor.  Obviously, the bare wire in \\\"romex\\\" 'with ground' is.  Anywhere there is a green wire installed, such as in a portable cord, that is a good grounding conductor.  The sheath of BX clamped in BX connectors in metal boxes is a legal grounding conductor (in the US). (BX has an aluminum band run under the steel sheath to lower the resistance of the sheath.  You can just cut this aluminum band off at the ends, you don't have to bond it to anything, it does its job by touching every turn of the BX sheath.) Conduit or EMT (thinwall tubing) is generally a legal grounding conductor, but may require a bonding locknut where it enters a box or panel, particularly for larger pipes.    \\\"Greenfield\\\" (looks like big BX, but you pull your own wires in the empty sheath after you run it) is NOT a legal grounding conductor, as it doesn't have the aluminum band to bond it, and the spiral steel has too much resistance and inductance.  You have to run a seperate green grounding conductor inside the greenfield.  \\\"Wiremold\\\" is also not a legal grounding conductor, as the paint on the boxes often prevents good contact, and the \\\"feed\\\" to the wiremold extension is often from a box in the wall that may not be well connected to the first wiremold box.  I have personally discovered cases where the entire run of wiremold and the cases of everything plugged into all the outlets on the run were \\\"hot\\\" with 120 volts (Why do I get a shock every time I touch my computer and the radiator here in the office?) because there was no ground wire in the wiremold and one of the outlets had shorted to the edge of the wiremold box.  You must run a ground wire back in the wiremold from the outlets at least to the first box in the original wiring (conduit, BX, etc.) where you can \\\"bond\\\" the wire to the box with a screw, bnding clip, or whatever.  On another issue, while you should ground the green wire/lug on GCFI outlets when ever there is a place to ground them, it is legal in the NEC to use them without a ground if no ground is available.  It is better to have the protection of the Ground fault interrupter than no protection if you don't install it.  The interrupter doesn't depend on the ground to trip.  It is desirable to connect the ground if available, because if the ground is connected, the interrupter will trip as soon as a faulty device is plugged in, whereas without the ground, it will not trip until someone or something provides a ground path.  For those questioning the legal use of ungrounded GCFI's, read in the NEC, 210-7 (d) exception. (This is the 1990 code, my '93 code is in the city, but I know the rule hasn't changed.  It might be renumbered though.)   We have only touched the surface concerning grounding ;-} , there is much more to this subject, but most of you have fallen asleep by now.

Gregg is not, as I understand his posts, giving any support to the bounty on Rushdie's life.  If that's correct, end of one point...  Gregg is using the concept of legal in a way most Westerners don't accept. His comments about Islamic Law I think make a great deal of sense to him, and are even making a _little_ sense to me now - if a person is a member of a group (religion or whatever) they bind themselves to follow the ways of the group within the bounds of what the group requires as a minimum. The big bone of contention here that I'm picking up is that in the West we have secular governments that maintain, more or less, a level of control and of requirements outside the requirements of optional groups.  I think the majority of us reading this thread are in tune (note - I didn't say \\\"in agreement\\\") with the idea that you are finally responsible to the secular government,  and within that to the group or groups a person may have chosen.  With that in mind, it not possible under secular law (\\\"legally\\\" as most people would define the term) to hold a person to a particular group once they decide to separate from it.  Only if the secular authorities agree that there is a requirement of some sort (contractual, etc) is there any secular _enforcement_ allowed by a group to a group member or past group member.  A religion can, and often does, believe in and require additional duties of a group member.  And it can enforce the fulfillment of those duties in many ways - ostracism is common for example.  But the limit comes when the enforcement would impose unwanted and/or unaccepted onus on a person _in conflict with secular law_.  This is the difference.  In a theocracy, the requirements of the secular authorities are, by definition, congruent with the religious authorities. Outside a theocracy, this is not _necessarily_ true.  Religious requirements _may_ coincide or may not.  Similiarly, religious consequences _may_ or may not coincide with secular consequences (if any).  Regards,  Dew\",\" Confident, or merely crazed?

Do some arithmetic, please...  Skipjack has 2^80 possible keys.  Let's assume a brute-force engine like that hypothesized for DES:  1 microsecond per trial, 1 million chips.

It supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  Throughput is  16 Mbits a second. [...]   F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips  N, a 30-bit serial number  U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted    with the chip  The key K and message stream M (i.e., digitized voice) are then  fed into the Clipper Chip to produce two values:        E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and      E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement block.    Three questions: 1) It looks like each 64 bits of input gives you 4*64 bits of output:   E[M;K] = 64 bits   E[K;U] = E[ 80 bits ] = 128 bits   E[ E[K;U], N ; F ] = E[ 128 + 30 bits ] = 192 bits    Do you really need to transmit all 256 bits each time,    or do you only transmit the 192 bits of wiretap block at the beginning?       All 256 would be really obnoxious for bandwidth-limited applications    like cellular phones (or even regular phones over   2) how do the 4 DES modes interact with the two-part output?    Do the various feedback modes only apply to the message block,    or also to the wiretap block?  Or, if the wiretap block is only    transmitted at the beginning, does it get incorporated into    everything through feedback modes, but not during ECB mode?  3) Does the Clipper Chip check the wiretap block itself?    Does the block have to be present at all?    Since the receiving chip doesn't know the transmitter's U,    it presumably can't check the validity of E[K;U], so it's     limited to checking the *form* of the wiretap block,    and maybe checking the serial number for reasonableness    (unless there's some sort of back-door structure that lets    it recognize a valid E[K;U].)        In that case, can you replace the wiretap block with a DIFFERENT    wiretap block, presumably an old valid one to avoid attracting attention?    (The chip won't do it, so you postprocess the output.)    Regular people can do one with their own serial number and a dummy key;    paranoid people can use someone else's serial number.     On the other hand, if I could think of that solution so easily,    presumably the NSA could too - have they done something to block it,    like use message encryption that's really E[M; K,U,N] ?

Would most of the North-americans now playing in the NHL be willing to play for a team in Europe?  I do not think that the majority of hockey players are necessarily interested in expanding their cultural experience to that level. (I know I would but I am not a pro hockey player)  When one recalls some players remarks in the last few years it makes me wonder how a European expansion could be achieved.  Remember these:  - Lindros did not want to play in Quebec (for more than $ reasons) - Nicholls ... in Edmonton. - R. Courtnall wanted to be traded to LA only. - C. Lemieux said he would refuse to go to Edmonton earlier this year.

We typically request that your contest X    include a current description of the IOCCC. X X    In order to be included in this file for given year, we must X    receive a current description no EARLIER than Jan 1 00:00:00 UTC and X    no LATER than Feb 15 00:00:00 UTC.

X X    GOALS OF THE CONTEST: X X        * To write the most Obscure/Obfuscated C program under the rules below. X        * To show the importance of programming style, in an ironic way. X        * To stress C compilers with unusual code. X        * To illustrate some of the subtleties of the C language. X        * To provide a safe forum for poor C code.  :-) X X    The IOCCC is the grandfather of USENET programming contests.  Since X    1984, this contest demonstrated that a program that simply works X    correctly is not sufficient.  The IOCCC has also done much to add X    the arcane word 'obfuscated' back into the English language. X    (see \\\"The New Hacker's Dictionary\\\" by Eric Raymond) X X    You are strongly encouraged to read the new contest rules before X    sending any entries.  The rules, and sometimes the contest Email X    address itself, change over time.  A valid entry one year may X    be rejected in a later year due to changes in the rules.  The typical X    start date for contests is in early March.  Contest rules are normally not X    finalized and posted until the beginning of the contest.  The typical X    closing date for contests are in early May. X X    The rules and the guidelines may (and often do) change from year to X    year.  You should be sure you have the current rules and guidelines X    prior to submitting entries.  To obtain them, send Email to the address X    above and use the subject 'send rules'.

In studies involving administration of high doses of the additive, blood methanol levels were undetectable. Methanol is a poison only in quantities seen in human poisonings, say 5ml and above.  This is a consequence of its oxidation to formaldehyde and formic acid, two quite reactive compounds which at high enough levels can damage tissues like the retina and kidney, because at such high doses the body's detoxification system is overwhelmed.  Interestingly, one treatment for early methanol poisoning is to get the person drunk on ethyl alcohol--vodka or an equivalent.  That's because ethanol is metabolized preferentially over methanol by the enzymes in the liver. If the methanol stays as methanol and isn't metabolized to formaldehyde, it is actually relatively non-toxic. \",\"Hi Xperts!    I have a Sparc-1 with very limited disk space on /usr partition.    previously, i was able to run all x-windows applications  and then     i upgraded my system to sun o.s. 4.1.3 and realized that , the hard disk did not have enough space to load openwindows. My immediate alternative was to load only the neccessary files to boot the system. This resulted in not loading openwindows. As a result of which none of the X-libraries got loaded.     I am trying to load just the libraries and include files and bin/X11 files  required for running X-windows and compiling my programs written for Xlib and Xaw. In a desperate effort to regain x-windows, i retrieved /usr/lib/libX*.* files from the tape . /usr/bin/X11/*  and /usr/include/X11/* . Is this enough for running X-windows    BUt i did not get /usr/lib/X11/fonts/  sub directories . these are mainly 100dpi, 75dpi  and misc.   when i run xinit, the error message says /usr/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi etc are not in the default path. But the problem is i cannot load any of those directories as there is no disk space.

On the other hand, I don't see \\\"Clipper\\\" as providing  a secure channel--it just prevents casual eavesdropping.  This is part of why  I am not worried about it per se.  Trying to look at Clipper as a serious  security tool is simply ludicrous.  It's a voice scrambler, nothing more.  There is still plenty of market for real crypto.   They cost an arm and a leg, though. \\\"Clipper\\\" is obviously aimed at the mass  market.  It certainly won't put Cylink out of business.   This is old news.  I can do this now.   There ARE restrictions.  Example: We're a networking software vendor with a  large overseas share of our market.  We cannot currently ship PEM, or even  simple DES, in our products without case-by-case approval from the Department  of State.  ITAR presents a material trade barrier to US firms trying to  compete in international information systems markets.  Sure, you can use whatever freebie software you want to talk over BBS's in  the USA.  I, on the other hand, want strong crypto (PKCS, for example) to be  the *default* for electronic mail, worldwide.  I want priests to be able to  hear confession over email.  I want lawyers to be able to talk to clients in  confidence over email, or doctors talk with patients.  I want to be able to  order products from my favorite Japanese mail-order catalog over the net.  I  want to be able to sign contracts, transact business, and so on  electronically.  This is so far infeasible as a result of the current restrictions on  crytographic systems, especially beyond the borders of the USA.  Clipper is irrelevant, and if it distracts the authorities into feeling safe,  all the better.  Its only danger is if it emboldens them into trying to put  more restrictions into place, on the theory that it is \\\"good enough for  anyone who has nothing to hide.\\\"  That argument is, of course, utter BS, just  as much as \\\"no one needs an assault rifle\\\". \",\"  Most of the points you made about Lopez v. Berryhill/Olson have been made by others, and realizing that Lopez must be the second coming of Frank Thomas, I have relented and praised the unmistakeable wisdom of his supporters.   See?  This is essentially what everyone was doing  -  comparing Lopez to one of the best players in the game.  I'm really looking forward to seeing this can't-miss superstar now.  As for Thomas, I remember being an advocate of his being brought up in 1990 even though he was only 21 or 22 (can't remember).  But who did the Sox have at first? Calderon?  Martinez?  Kittle?  The spot was there.  The talent was there.  Sure, I say go for it.  I am not convinced that Lopez is anywhere near as talented as Thomas was after his AA season in 1989, and I am not convinced that Olson/ Berryhill are nearly as bad as Kittle/Martinez were.

So were their non-Christian contemporaries (the more familiar you are with late Republican Rome or the Pricipate, the weirder those people will seem -- forget the creative filtering done by Renaissance and Eighteenth Century hero worship.)  So are modern non-Christians.  And Christians.  You are pretty weird, yourself, with your rather acid dismissal of Luther and of Protestantism -- and in apparently buying into a simplistic propaganda model about Catholicism *not* being faddish.   Sure, it's so large that global fads take longer cycles than they do in smaller denominations (and local ones are not usually visible unless you do a lot of traveling to exotic lands :-)).  May I recom- mend, as a salutary antidote to this nonsense Philippe Aries' book _The Hour of our Death_, a longitudinal study of death customs in  Western [specifically Catholic] Christendom?  And it won't help to escape into the obscurity of the first Christian century.  Paul was pretty weird, too; as were Peter and the others in the (apparently quite weird) circle around Jesus.  What I think you might find helpful is a bit more charity -- try to understand these weirdos and nutcases with the same respect and love you would expect others to show YOUR notions.  We *are* commanded to love one another, after all.  And Brown's book is, in fact, a heroic attempt to SEE the groupings he talks about as motivated in love and the gospel and their social contexts.  (If anything, Brown is *too* heroic here -- he manages to overstrain himself at times :-))  I don't suggest that we *follow* any of these old cult paths -- and it raises hard questions from the skeptic inside me that so much of early Christianity *was* like the weird (Christian and non-Christian) cults we see today.  To that extent, I think you raise a serious problem (and perhaps your phrasing is implicitly self-deprecatory and ironic.)  But the first principle for *answering* these questions is respect and love for those we do not understand.  And it helps to *work* at under- standing (as long as we do not get overwhelmed by revulsion and begin to withdraw our respect for them as people.)  I would advise, in other words, MORE historical reading (Brown's other books are also good, most especially his bio. of Augustine; also try Robin Lane Fox's _Christians and Pagans_, maybe the Paul Veyne ed. _History of Private Life_, some of Foucault's books on sexuality in the ancient world ...)

I'm new here, and only vaguely religious, but I want to know what some of you people think.  Specifically, are there an infinite number of Heavens, and a person goes to the one that he/she deserves?  Or is it simply Heaven or nothing (Hell?) Also, are we \\\"graded\\\" by those around us, or has there always been some unchanging method?  Is the person's childhood taken into account?  I'm sure these must sound like over-simplifications to most of you, but I figure that you're the experts.        -Quinn  [Eschatology is an area on which Christians do not agree.  I suspect that's because our primary source of information is prophets and visionaries, and their writings tend to be highly symbolic.  However both Jesus' teachings in the Gospels and books such as the Revelation to John talk primarily about the difference between eternal life and eternal death.  On a number of occasions Jesus does say things that imply some sort of differentiation, e.g. Lk 10:14 and a number of similar passages where Jesus says things like \\\"even XXX will be better off than you in the judgement.\\\"  Also, I Cor 3 talks about someone who gets into heaven, but by the skin of his teeth, as it were.  But these passages are not normally interpreted as suggesting separate heavens, so much as differing levels of prestige or punishment in heaven or hell (and not all Christians would even go as far as that).  The only Christian group I know of that believes in multiple heavens is the Mormons, and they are very far from mainstream Christianity (far enough that many of our readers would not call them Christian).  Their ideas in this area involve specific Mormon revelations, in addition to the Bible and \\\"Holy Tradition\\\" of a more generic Christian sort.  Note that many Christians will cringe at the very thought of associating grading with God.  The whole point of Christ was to free us from the results of a test that we couldn't possibly pass.  If you like test analogies, God grades on a very strict and unbending scale, but he also cheats -- he replaces our test papers with an exam that was prepared by the teacher, before actually doing the grading. Because some people end up in heaven and others in hell, it's easy to see why you'd be inclined to think of it as grading.  While there are differences among branches of Christianity on details, I think we all agree that in one way or another, God cheats.  I am personally very sceptical about anyone who claims to know exactly how far God's cheating extends.  Will he accept people who don't explicitly acknowledge Christ, but somehow still follow him in their hearts?  Many Christians believe that this is possible, at least in principle, but certainly not all do.  Jesus provided us with a clear description of how to be saved, but it's not clear to me that he provided an exact description of how he's going to place the dividing line.  Certainly he made it clear that we can't expect to know whether other individuals are saved or not.\",\"Pardon me for interrupting, but why doesn't anyone ever bring up other possibilities besides more government, less government, or no government and stop there? It seems to me that the problems with society go MUCH deeper than government. Democracies seem to reflective of the majority of society, both the good and the bad. If you take away the government, you still have the structural flaws in society, except this time, with no restraints. Yes? No?  Why doesn't anybody ever discuss communal society, like a kibbutz? I never studied it on depth, but from what I've heard, the kibbutz in Isreal was very successful. It is also very close to what Aristotle and Socrates believed was the best.  Sorry to detract from the discussion.   But what good is change if there is no tracable improvement in the human condition? Who would ever support the change if you tell them it won't  improve their lives? I know that there are, and will be, libertarians  who will jump in now and say that it WILL improve our lives. I can deal with that. All I'm saying is that improving the human condition must be the PRIMARY goal of any organization.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \\\"Who said anything about panicking?\\\" snapped Authur.           Garrett Johnson \\\"This is still just culture shock. You wait till I've       Garrett@Ingres.com settled into the situation and found my bearings. THEN I'll start panicking!\\\" - Douglas Adams  \",\"  \\\"Deeply rooted rivalry?\\\" Ahem, Jokerit have been around since 1967 and joined the top flight only in the early '70s. Helsingfors IFK have been around since 1897 but fans only started taking hockey seriously in the 1960s so I think you're exagerating here.   That's a rather bold claim, in the light of how successful the Canadian & American Olympic teams have been . . . and they've had to play according to our set of rules and on international ice. The 1992 Olympic teams contained about as much talent as your average expansion team. Canada had Eric Lindros, Sean Burke, Joe Juneau and Chris Kontos. Another four or five have been deep subs in the NHL. As for the Yanks, Keith Tkachuk, Scott Lachance, Bret Hedican, Shawn  McEachern, Steve Heintze, Ted Donato, Joe Sacco and Bill Guerin have been  3rd/4th line players in the NHL, while Robb Stauber has done well for the  Kings in goal. Nothing more. In fact, I'm sure that an All-Star team assembled from the best Finnish League teams would do no better in the NHL than Hartford  or Tampa Bay currently are doing. --- But what happens if _all_ top-class Finnish & Swedish players gradually end up with Helsinki & Stockholm as the North American-based ones gradually retire and no Canadian/American team is allowed to draft new players from Scandinavia?  Here is what THE HOCKEY NEWS scouts think of our NHL-based players:  (28-30=superstar) (23-27=star) (18-22=NHL regular+) (13-17=NHL regular) ( 8-12=role player)  FINLAND:    D-Jyrki Lumme.......20 D-Teppo Numminen....20 D-Peter Ahola.......13  C-Jari Kurri........25 C-Christian Ruuttu..16  R-Teemu Selanne.....27  L-Esa Tikkanen......20 (Obviously, Selanne's ratings would be higher today than they were in January)  SWEDEN: D-Ulf Samuelsson....21 D-Fredrik Olausson..20 D-Niklas Lidstrom...18 D-Calle Johansson...18 D-Kjell Samuelsson..17 D-Tommy Sjodin......13 D-Tommy Albelin......7  C-Mats Sundin.......26 C-Thomas Steen......18  R-Thomas Sandstrom..22 R-Ulf Dahlen........18 R-Michael Nylander..13  L-Per-Erik Eklund...18 L-Johan Garpenlov...16 L-Mikael Andersson..15 L-Jan Erixon........14  This would be interesting. Clearly, Finland's top five players (Winnipeg's Selanne & Numminen, Vancouver's Lumme, Los Angeles' Jari Kurri and New York's Tikkanen) are right up there with any five-man unit Pittsburgh & co. have. But I have my doubts about the home-based Finnish players - the national team did well in the Canada Cup and World Championships largely due to the efforts of Markus Ketterer (the goalie), 3-4 or the players listed above and luck. There's presumably a lot of decent players in Finland that wouldn't be superstars at the highest level but still valuable role players, however. My guess would be that the Finnish Canada Cup team would be a .500 team in the NHL. --- Sweden is easier to judge because they have more players in North America. Their points total (16 players) is 274 - seven more than Ottawa's 22 top players combined! If we estimate there are six more NHL regulars back home in  Sweden, an all-Swedish team would assemble about 350-360 skill points. Deducting some points from Pittsburgh, NY Rangers and other teams that rely on Swedish players, the Swedish team would finish in sixth place - about as high as Boston, Vancouver, Calgary and Montreal on paper! So, the \\\"dynasty\\\" talk isn't completely unfounded here. An all-Finnish/all-Swedish team might have an advantage because the players would be playing at home half of the time, won't have to adapt to a foreign country and a foreign language, and presumably play the wide-open European variant of hockey rather than have to learn the North American checking game. However, if free agency becomes a factor the top  Scandinavian players still might end up playing for large-market teams after a  couple of years the same way Edmonton's \\\"dynasty\\\" crumbled in the late '80s.  Some fringe players likely will be drafted by other NHL teams as having an  exclusive talent pool might be a bit unfair after all. I'd settle for a  compromise, prohibit all European teams from signing a North American during  the first two rounds but allow them to keep their top two players. After this,  the amateur draft should be open to anyone.  \",\"  The Japanese are still on the learning curve as far as nuclear power goes. This means that unlike the Germans (who do great things all by themselves) the Japanese tie up with foreign companies. The major one is Mitsubishi (who else) who have a sharing agreement with GE I think. No chance of a new design.   Sodium has *lots* of chemical problems. Like it eats stainless steel. Very slowly but it gets there in the end. Not what I call a desired property. As for design difficulties, what does sodium do there? It is a bitch and it is only its chemical properties (flwed though they are) that means it gets used. Two loops? That's not a design problem? Isolation from air and water? That doesn't cause design problems? In comparison BWR's a dream rides!   Don't get none of that in a Liquid Sodium Breeder! More steel, more complexity.

How can Kovalev be a surprise?   Fence-sitting...look at Philly's record with Eric and without... there is no doubt.  Soderstrom is probably the biggest surprise.

Basically, there are two ways to steer a horse, plow-rein and neck-rein.  Plow-reining steers him by keeping the reins separate, and you pull in the direction you wish to go.  Neck-reining steers a horse by holding the reins together in one hand, and pulling against the horse's neck in the direction you wish to go.  When training a plow-steering horse to neck-rein, one technique is to cross the reins under his necks.  Thus, when neck-reining to the left, the right rein pulls against the right side of the neck, but the left side of the bit (which the horse is used to from his plow-reining days).  Are you sorry you asked yet? \",\" Here's something I posted about this a few years ago.  It's not fully up to date with all the new variations (some of which are just different manufacturer's synonyms):  ------ In practical terms, ignoring the technological details, this is my view of the families (NB I am not a giant corporation, which influences my views on things like availability and backward compatibility):  74 The original.  Speed good, power consumption fair.  Effectively  obsolete now; use 74LS or later, except for a *very* few oddball  functions like 7407 which are hard to find in newer families.  74H Modification of 74 for higher speed, at the cost of higher  power consumption.  Very obsolete; use 74F.  74L Modification of 74 for lower power, at the cost of lower speed.  Very obsolete; use CMOS.  74S Later modification of 74 for even higher speed, at some cost in  power consumption.  Effectively obsolete; use 74F.  74LS Combination of 74L and 74S, for speed comparable to 74 with lower  power consumption.  Best all-round TTL now, widest variety of  devices.  74F Fast as blazes, power not too bad.  The clear choice for high  speed in TTL.  Availability and prices generally good.  74AS Failed competitor to 74F, although a few 74AS parts do things  that are hard to find in 74F and thus are still useful.  74ALS Possible replacement for 74LS.  Generally souped up.  Still fairly  new, availability and prices possibly a problem.  74C Fairly old family, CMOS devices with TTL pinouts.  Competed with  4000 series, not too successfully.  Obsolete; use 4000 or newer  CMOS 74 families.  4000 (Thrown in as the major non-74 non-ECL logic family.)  The old CMOS  family, still viable because of *very* wide range of devices, low  power consumption, and wide range of supply voltages.  Not fast.  Very forgiving and easy to work with (beware static electricity,  but that comment applies to many other modern logic families too).  There are neat devices in this family that exist in no other.  The  clear choice when speed is not important.  74HC A new attempt at 74-pinout CMOS.  Fast compared to old CMOS, power  consumption often lower than TTL.  Possibly a good choice for  general-purpose logic, assuming availability and affordability.  CMOS logic levels, *not* TTL ones.  Beware very limited range of  supply voltages compared to older CMOS, also major rise of power  consumption at faster speeds.  74HCT 74HC with TTL logic levels.  Much the same comments as 74HC.  Read  the fine print on things like power consumption -- TTL compatibility  in CMOS involves some compromises.  10K (Thrown in for speed freaks.)  The low end of ECL.  Various sources  claim that it is *easier* to work with than super-fast TTL for  serious high-speed work.  Less forgiving, though:  read and follow  the rules or it won't work.  Availability to hobbyists limited,  can be expensive.  100K (For real speed freaks.)  Hot ECL.  Harder to handle than 10K, and  inconvenient packages.  Much more useful datasheets, however.  As for compatibility between families:  the 74 families (except 74C and 74HC) are all more or less logic-level compatible, but how many 74X devices you can drive from one 74Y output varies enormously with X and Y.  You just have to read the specs and do the arithmetic.  74C and 74HC are compatible with the others with a bit of hassle.  4000 compatibility can be a bit of hassle or a lot of hassle depending on what supply voltage 4000 is using. 10K or 100K to anything else is considerable hassle.  Me?  I use 4000 and 74LS with a sprinkling of 74F.  74HC[T] and 10K are interesting but I haven't used either significantly yet.\",\"Do you know if there is an airport nearby?

I read a recent article in Personal Computer World mainly about the new digit audion formats (DCC and MD) but at the end talked about how nice it would be to use these for data storage with a brief calculation of how much data you could store. The author had been talking to someone from Sony about these formats and mentioned this to get the reply \\\"MD is a purely audio format, we wouldn't use it for data\\\", then when pressed for info about MO the Sony man basically admitted that it was no more than a slight adaptabtion on MD!

That's a somewhat overbroad statement.  I'm sure there are HMOs in which the fees for lab tests are subtracted from the doctor's income.  In most, however, including the one I work for, there is no direct incentive to under-order.  Profits of the group are shared among all partners, but the group is so large that an individual's generated costs have a miniscule effect.  I don't believe that we under-order.  Then again, I'm not really sure what the right amount of ordering is or should be.

I found 3 shareware Workspace Managers, from Australia's MS-WINDOWS archive (monu6.cc.monash.edu.au), which mirrors some sites in the U.S.  The three I found were:  1. WORKSPACES 1.10 (wspace.zip)                                 This was the smallest and simplest    of the workspace managers that I found.  It is very easy to use.    It displays a small window, containing 6 buttons, plus an extra    button for configuration purposes.  One annoying feature was the    title window that is first presented when it is run - you must press    a key (not a mouse button!) for the thing to go away.  Also, it would    have been nice if there was an \\\"ALWAYS ON TOP\\\" setting for the little    window containing the workspace buttons.  Maybe some user-specified    strings on the buttons instead of the numbers one to six might be    a nice feature.  The simplicity and ease of use of this workspace    manager makes it an attractive package.  2. WORKSHIFT 1.6 (wrksft16.zip)                                While this workspace manager offered a    few features that WORKSPACES 1.10 lacked, it was quite time consuming    to set things up.  With WORKSPACES 1.10, all but the first workspace    is initially empty.  With WORKSHIFT 1.6, you need to take \\\"snapshots\\\"    of how you want each of your workspaces to look like - i.e. what     applications they contain.  Also, the main window is quite large,    but this does allow you to have a small view of what is in each workspace.    With WORKSPACES 1.10, there was no facility for viewing what was in    a workspace without switching to it.  WORKSHIFT 1.6 provides this    viewing functionality which is quite useful.  3. BIGDESK 2.30 and BACKMENU (backdesk.zip)                             This is an interesting package, which contains    a few other goodies as well as a workspace manager.  Other goodies    include \\\"Backmenu\\\", which provides a pop-up root menu when you    press a certain mouse button - just like in X-Windows.  The menu    is totally configurable, offering unlimited depth of cascading menus,    which is provides quite handy access to applications.  You could    say it is a menu-based alternative to the program manager.  Also    bundled in \\\"backdesk.zip\\\" is a program called \\\"WRUN\\\", which allows    you to run windows applications from a DOS shell under WINDOWS    instead of using the File Manager to run applications.      The actual workspace manager is called BIGDESK 2.30.  BIGDESK works quite    differently to the other two workspace managers in that it    doesn't provide a certain number of disjoint and separate workspaces.    In fact, it basically enlarges your desktop by a configurable amount,    and you choose which region of the desktop you want your screen to    focus in on.  This means you can have windows overlapping between different    viewing regions, unlike the first two workspace managers in which    each workspace was isolated from the other one.  The BIGDESK control window    allows to to move windows around your enlarged desktop.  Basically    the control window provides a small scale view of your viewing area    while your actual computer screen provides a large scale or blow-up    of a particular section.\",\"I am in the process of installing X11R5 on my Sun Sparcstation 2 and have run into a problem.

If you read Aviation Week, the C-5 line can be reopened and the C-5s would be delivered a year earlier and cost a billion less for the  program. Politically, though, the C-17 is popular pork.  Agreed. Congress took money from NASA and FHA to fund the second Seawolf. The shipyards are still building Los Angeles Class submarines and there is a lack of ASW foes to contend with. The Navy is considering reducing the number of attack subs to 40 (Navy Times) and that would entail getting rid of or mothballing some of the current Los Angeles class.  Politically, General Dynamics is in Connecticut and we will get Seawolf subs whether we need them or not.  In addition, more bases need to be closed. Probably Long Beach Naval Station and others. The Navy is talking about three main bases on each coast being  required to home port a total fleet of 320 ships.  The question is whether Les Aspin and Clinton will be able to face down a pork happy Congress. \",\" The difference in the litigation environment is reflected in the fees.  Lack of defensive medicine and near-absence of malpractice is really why we spend less using the most expensive approach of pure insurance in Canada (along with France and Germany) without HMO's --- the NYT has admitted that malpractice insurance fees are an order of magnitude lower in Canada but doctors take-home pay is almost equal to American doctors; also, minimal bureaucracy 'cos the system is so-o-o simple (early March).  Part of the deal for using the all-insurance approach like the French and Germans do (hey, why don't they criticize France and Germany?  Is it because too many people take French and German in college to make the accusations stick? (-;) was to preserve the doctors independance. Since the provincial wings of the CMA are the ones that go to bat when the fee schedule hikes are presented, the politically-bent doctors were just cackling when they realized the CMA would grow in strength rather than diminish, especially when unopposed unlike in socialized medicine approaches like Britain's National Health Service.   For non-life threatening things, market arguments adequately cover why certain procedures are in scarcer demand.  I have MD friends who can't make a living as specialists back in Manitoba not due to the insurance rates but because they won't get enough customers -- the CMA medical monopoly's grip on doctors licencing (as in the US) aside -- so they must move to larger places.  However, this does not refute debunking of waiting lines for urgent AND routine care, as has been done in the U.S. by Consumers Reports, health policy studies cited by Prof. Dennis E. Shea on USENET, CNN, NYT, etc.  Doug Fierro has posted a NYT article from 3 weeks ago about Canada's health insurance approach, on Talk.politics.medicine.  There is one small error in the article: not all of our hospitals are private.   Of course, the one thing to note is that in the Canada/France/Germany case, private insurance *offloaded* the basic coverage to the public sector.  They realized they were keeping low-risk/high-profit extra insurance for things like private/semi-private rooms (vs. ward accomodation), dental, glasses, etc. for corporate or personal benefits, they'll have nothing to do with you if you want to be covered for basic care.  At that point, they wouldn't even consider a \\\"voucher\\\" approach to broker the universal coverage and sell policies to make up the difference in the federal guidelines and market stuff.   It is \\\"free\\\" in that there are no deductibles nor copayments (two things which I advocate to make the Canadian insurance look more like real health insurance -- which actually it is).  I know that when working in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec, I was aware that I was paying for health insurance - e.g., in Toronto, OHIP fees were listed on my pay stub; Manitoba did not collect at paycheque time, but only annually at income tax time (built into the tax rate).  Only fiscal naifs will proclaim that it's free, along with the Canadian Left for that is part of their brainwashing agenda.  The French do have copayments, though.  France Magazine's Summer  1992 edition has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance coverage, including a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For  1-30 days, you're covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100% afterward.  With extra private insurance, you can get into a private hospital and be covered for any differences beyond the public hospital rate.  The public insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same cash amount for a private hospital and the difference is paid out-of-pocket or according to your supplementary private insurance. Over 2/3rds of French have some form of extra private insurance.  So, the other 30% of health costs in Europe are out of private funds, not gleaned from other taxes.  The GDP figures are combined public and private expenditures for total outlay using the same methods that yield the 13-14% figure for the U.S.   Health insurance does exist in Canada and in Western Europe, its just that it doesn't cover basic care.  You can opt out in Canada and Germany, but you'll have to go uninsured as a result because there are too few other people that do so --- i.e., no market.  When private insurance realized how much money they'd make without the risks involved in basic insurance (e.g., neurosurgery) versus deluxe amenities (e.g., having to call Granada TV to replace a rental set on the fritz in someone's private hospital room), they started to pat themselves on the back for their social responsibility.  In Quebec last spring, a consortium of private insurers publicly warned against any thoughts of privatizing routine, low cost parts of that province's public health insurance plan.  gld\",\": HI, I was wondering if anyone would be able to help me on twwo related : subjects.

Notes   =====      - Cypherpunk remailers tend to be unstable because they are often     running without site administrator knowledge. Liability issues     are wholly unresolved.      - So far, all encryption is based on public-key cryptography and PGP     software (see the question on cryptography).     - Encryption aspects (message text, destination address, replies)     vary between sites.    - Multiple chaining, alias unlinking, and address encryption are     mostly untested, problematic, or unsupported at this time.  _____ <8.2> What are the responsibilities associated with anonymity?       Users   -----    - Use anonymity only if you have to. Frivolous uses weaken the     seriousness and usefulness of the capability for others.   - Do not use anonymity to provoke, harass, or threaten others.   - Do not hide behind anonymity to evade established conventions on     Usenet,  such as posting binary pictures to regular newsgroups.   - If posting large files, be attentive to bandwidth considerations.     Remember, simply sending the posting to the service increases     network traffic.   - Avoid posting anonymously to the regular hierarchy of Usenet; this     is the mostly likely place to alienate readers. The `alt'     hierarchy is preferred.   - Give as much information as possible in the posting (i.e.     references, etc.) Remember that content is the only means for     readers to judge the truth of the message, and that any     inaccuracies will tend to discredit the entire message and even     future ones under the same handle.   - Be careful not to include information that will reveal your     identity or enable someone to deduce it.  Test the system by     sending anonymized mail to yourself.   - Be aware of the policies of the anonymous site and respect them.      Be prepared to forfeit your anonymity if you abuse the privilege.   - Be considerate and respectful of other's objections to anonymity.   - ``Hit-and-run'' anonymity should be used with utmost reservation.     Use services that provide anonymous return addresses instead.   - Be courteous to the system operator, who may have invested large     amounts of time, be personally risking his account, or dedicating     his hardware, all for your convenience.    Operators   ---------    - Document thoroughly acceptable and unacceptable uses in an     introductory file that is sent to new users.  Have a coherent and     consistent policy and stick to it. State clearly what logging and     monitoring is occurring. Describe your background, interest, and     security measures. Will the general approach be totalitarian or     lassaiz-faire?   - Formulate a plan for problematic ethical situations and anticipate     potentially intense moral quandaries and dilemmas. What if a user     is blackmailing someone through your service? What if a user     posts suicidal messages through your service? Remember, your     users trust you to protect them.   - In the site introductory note, give clear examples  of situations     where you will take action and what these actions will be (e.g.     warn the user, limit anonymity to email or posting only, revoke     the account, 'out' the user, contact local administrator, etc.)   - Describe exactly the limitations of the software and hardware.     Address the bandwidth limitations of your site. Report candidly     and thoroughly all bugs that have  occurred.  Work closely with     users to isolate and fix bugs. Address all bugs noted below under     ``(in)stability of anonymity''.   - Document the stability of the site---how long has it been running?     What compromises have occured? Why are you running it? What is     your commitment to it?   - Include a disclaimer in outgoing mail and messages.  Include an     address for complaints, ideally appended to every outgoing item.      Consult a lawyer about your liability.   - Be committed to the long-term stability of the site. Be prepared     to deal with complaints and `hate mail' addressed to you.  If you     do not own the hardware the system runs on or are not the system     adminstrator, consult those who do and are.   - Be considerate of providing anonymity to various groups.  If     possible, query group readers.   - Keep a uniformity and simplicity of style in outgoing message     format that can be screened effectively by kill files.  Ensure     the key text `Anon' is  somewhere in every header.   - Take precautions to ensure the security of the server from     physical and  network-based attacks and infiltrations.    Readers   -------      - Do not complain, attack, or discredit a poster for the sole reason     that he is posting anonymously, make blanket condemnations that     equate anonymity with cowardice and criminality, or assail     anonymous traffic in general for mostly neutral reasons (e.g. its     volume is heavy or increasing).   - React to the anonymous information unemotionally.  Abusive posters     will be encouraged further if they get irrationally irate     responses.  Sometimes the most effective response is silence.   - Notify operators if very severe abuses occur, such as piracy,     harassment, extortion, etc.   - Do not complain about postings being inappropriate because they     offend you personally.   - Use kill files to screen anonymous postings if you object to the     idea of anonymity itself.   - Avoid the temptation to proclaim that all anonymous postings     should be barred from particular groups because no `possible' or     `conceivable' need exists.

Note that anonymous server operators have the capability to mask   anonymous postings under which the above method will not work; so   far this practice is not widespread, but it may become more common   as a countermeasure to widespread anonymous filtering.    _____ <8.4> What is the history behind anonymous posting servers?    Originally anonymous posting services were introduced for   individual, particularly volatile newsgroups, where anonymity is   almost the preferred method of communication, such as talk.abortion   and alt.sex.bondage.  One of the first was one by Dave Mack   started in ~1988 for alt.sex.bondage. Another early one was   wizvax.methuen.ma.us run by Stephanie Gilgut (Gilgut Enterprises)   but was disbanded due to  lack of funds.  The system provided   anonymous return addresses. n7kbt.rain.com (John Opalko) took up   the functions of this server, including reinstating the anonymous   alias file. The group ``alt.personals has been chewing through   servers like there's no tomorrow.''      Spurred by the disappearance of `wizvax' and interested in   researching the idea, Karl Kleinpaste   <Karl_Kleinpaste@godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu> developed his own system   from scratch in six hours. By this time the idea of extending the   server to new, more `mainstream'  groups was starting to emerge,   and he explored the possibility partly at the specific request  by   multiple users for anonymity in other groups. ``The intended   advantage of my system was specifically to allow multiple group   support, with a single anon identifier across all.  This was   arguably the single biggest deficiency of previous anon systems.''    K. Kleinpaste posted a message on rec.nude asking users whether an   anonymous service would be welcome there, and judged a consensus   against it.     K. Kleinpaste introduced what he calls a ``fire extinguisher'' to   `squelch' or `plonk' abusive users in response to complaints, and   used this in three cases. Nevertheless, after a few months of   intense traffic he was eventually overwhelmed by the abuses of his   server. ``Even as restricted as it was, my system was subjected to   abuses to the point where it was ordered dismantled by the   facilities staff here. Such abuses started right after it was   created.''    In ~Nov 1992, Johan Helsingius (julf@penet.FI) set up the most   controversial anonymous site to date. anon.penet.fi is based on   scripts and C code written by K. Kleinpaste and supports anonymized   mail, posting, and return addresses. He initially wanted to confine   the service to Scandinavian users but expanded it to worldwide   accessability in response to 'lots' of international requests.      J. Helsingius policy of allowing anonymous posting to every Usenet   newsgroup has been met with strong and serious ideological   opposition (e.g. by news adminstrators in news.admin.policy).   Because of the relative newness and recent emergence of the medium,   abuses by anonymous posters  tend to have higher visibility than   ``routine'' abuses. His total commitment to preservation of   anonymity is also controversial.    For example, in a highly controversial and publicized case in ~Feb   1993,  an anonymous user posted a supposed transcript of desperate   crew dialogue during the Challenger shuttle disaster via   anon.penet.fi to sci.astro. Despite that the transcript had been   posted in the same place up to a year earlier (then   non-anonymously) and actually originated not with the poster but a   New York news tabloid, subsequent responses consisted largely of   vociferous outrage at the poster's use of anonymity, reverberating   through many newsgroups.       The original poster, using the same anonymous handle, later conceded   that the story ``seemed likely to have been fabricated,''   suggesting the plausible possibility that the original intent was   not to provoke outrage but gauge reactions on the authenticity of   the story (albeit crudely), free of personal risk from perceived   association with the item.  The ensuing commotion generated queries   for the original article by late-entering readers. The anonymous   user later posted deliberately offensive comments at his   detractors.    Despite piercingly irate and outraged complaints, and even the vocal   opposition and verbal abuse of K. Kleinpaste and eminent news   operators, J. Helsingius has largely avoided use of the ``fire   extingisher'' and the ``group bouncer'' mechanisms that limit the   scope of the service. As of ~March 1993 the anon.penet.fi site is   best described as `inundated': it has registered over 13,000 users   in its initial three months of operation, forwards ~3000 messages a   day, and approximately 5% of all Usenet postings are anonymized   through the site. The immense popularity is probably largely due   to the capability for `global' anonymity which has allowed users to   find creative uses in diverse areas not previously envisioned.    Johan Helsingius has been subject to extraordinary pressure to   dismantle his server in ~Feb 1993. At one point K. Kleinpaste   threatened publicly to organize a sort of vigilante group of irate   news operators to  send out revocation commands on all messages   originating from the site.  J. Helsingius has also alluded to   threats of flooding the  server.  The server has crashed several   times, at least once due to a saturation `mailbombing' through it   by an anonymous user.  Mr. Helsingius reports spending up to 5   hours per day  answering email requests alone associated with the   service's administration. In response to the serious threats he   disabled global group access temporarily for one week and   encouraged his users to defend the service publicly.      Based on fast-moving dialogue and creative suggestions by   ``cypherpunks,'' J. Helsingius has identified many security   weaknesses and valuable new features for the service, and is   currently in the process of code development and testing. He is   planning on upgrading the IBM compatible 386 machine to a 486 soon   to handle the voluminous load and is  considering integrating a new   system with very sophisticated functionality, including multiple   email aliases, alias allocation control, public-key encryption,   etc.    A very sophisticated anonymous posting system was set up in Dec.   1992 by D. Clunie <dclunie@pax.tpa.com.au> that used cryptography   in both directions (to/from) the server for the highest degree of   confidentiality seen so far.  However, it was running on a public   access account, and he had to shut it down after only several   weeks, upon receiving requests and conditions apparently ultimately   originating from NSF representatives. D. Clunie has released the   software to the public domain.    Recently the idea of a newsgroup devoted to `whistleblowing' on   government abuses has received wide and focused attention, and   group formation is currently underway.  In the basic scenario the   group would allow people to post pseudonymously using remailers,   and even establish reputations based on their authentifiable   digital signatures. The traffic may eventually reach reporters in   the mainstream news media.  deltorto@aol.com has volunteered to   attack multiple aspects of this project, including distributing   easy-to-read documentation on posting, anonymization, and   encryption.

Mitchell                           March 23, 1993   INTRODUCTION:   In order to increase public interest in space-based and lunar operations, a real miniature lunar-like environment is being constructed on which to test tele-operated models. These models are remotely-controlled by individuals located world-wide using their personal computers, for EduTainment purposes. Not only does this provide a test-bed for simple tele-operation and tele-presence activities but it also provides for the sharing of information on methods of operating in space, including, but not limited to, layout of a lunar colony, tele-operating machines for work and play, disseminating educational information, providing contests and awards for creativity and achievement and provides a new way for students worldwide to participate in Twenty-First century remote learning methods.   Because of the nature of the LTM1 project, people of all ages, interests and skills can contribute scenery and murals, models and structures, interfacing and electronics, software and graphics. In operation LTM1 is an evolving playground and laboratory that can be used by children, students and professionals worldwide. Using a personal computer at home or a terminal at a participating institution a user is able to tele-operate real models at the LTM1 base for experimental or recreational purposes. Because a real facility exists, ample opportunity is provided for media coverage of the construction of the lunar model, its operation and new features to be added as suggested by the users themselves.   This has broad inherent interest for a wide range of groups:  - tele-operations and virtual reality research  - radio control, model railroad and ham radio operation  - astronomy and space planetariums and science centers  - art and theater  - bbs and online network users  - software and game developers  - manufacturers and retailers of model rockets, cars and trains  - children  - the child in all of us   LTM1 OVERALL DESIGN:   A room 14 feet by 8 feet contains the base lunar layout. The walls are used for murals of distant moon mountains, star fields and a view of the earth. The \\\"floor\\\" is the simulated lunar surface. A global call for contributions is hereby made for material for the lunar surface, and for the design and creation of scale models of lunar colony elements, scenery, and machine-lets.    The LTM1 initial design has 3 tele-operated machinelets:  1. An SSTO scale model which will be able to lift off, hover and land;  2. A bulldozerlet which will be able to move about in a quarry area; and  3. A moon-train which will traverse most of the simulated lunar surface.    Each machinelet has a small TV camera utilizing a CCD TV chip mounted on  it. A personal computer digitizes the image (including reducing picture  content and doing data-compression to allow for minimal images to be sent  to the operator for control purposes) and also return control signals.   The first machinelet to be set up will be the moon-train since model trains with TV cameras built in are almost off-the-shelf items and control electronics for starting and stopping a train are minimal. The user will receive an image once every 1 to 4 seconds depending on the speed of their data link to LTM1.   Next, an SSTO scale model with a CCD TV chip will be suspended from a servo-motor operated wire frame mounted on the ceiling allowing for the SSTO to be controlled by the operator to take off, hover over the entire lunar landscape and land.   Finally, some tank models will be modified to be CCD TV chip equipped bulldozerlets. The entire initial LTM1 will allow remote operators worldwide to receive minimal images while actually operating models for landing and takeoff, traveling and doing work. The entire system is based on commercially available items and parts that can be easily obtained except for the interface electronics which is well within the capability of many advanced ham radio operator and computer hardware/software developers.   By taking a graphically oriented communications program (Dmodem) and adding a tele-operations screen and controls, the necessary user interface can be provided in under 80 man hours.   PLAN OF ACTION:   The Diaspar Virtual Reality Network has agreed to sponsor this project by providing a host computer network and Internet access to that network. Diaspar is providing the 14 foot by 8 foot facility for actual construction of the lunar model. Diaspar has, in stock, the electronic tanks that can be modified and one CCD TV chip. Diaspar also agrees to provide \\\"rail stock\\\" for the lunar train model. Diaspar will make available the Dmodem graphical communications package and modify it for control of the machines-lets. An initial \\\"ground breaking\\\" with miniature shovels will be performed for a live photo-session and news conference on April 30, 1993. The initial models will be put in place. A time-lapse record will be started for historical purposes. It is not expected that this event will be completely serious or solemn. The lunar colony will be declared open for additional building, operations and experiments. A photographer will be present and the photographs taken will be converted to .gif images for distribution world-wide to major online networks and bbs's. A press release will be issued calling for contributions of ideas, time, talent, materials and scale models for the simulated lunar colony.   A contest for new designs and techniques for working on the moon will then be announced. Universities will be invited to participate, the goal being to find instructors who wish to have class participation in various aspects of the lunar colony model. Field trips to LTM1 can be arranged and at that time the results of the class work will be added to the model. Contributors will then be able to tele-operate any contributed machine-lets once they return to their campus.   A monthly LTM1 newsletter will be issued both electronically online and via conventional means to the media. Any major new tele-operated equipment addition will be marked with an invitation to the television news media. Having a large, real model space colony will be a very attractive photo opportunity for the television community. Especially since the \\\"action\\\" will be controlled by people all over the world. Science fiction writers will be invited to issue \\\"challenges\\\" to engineering and human factors students at universities to build and operate the tele-operated equipment to perform lunar tasks. Using counter-weight and pulley systems, 1/6 gravity may be simulated to some extent to try various traction challenges.   The long term goal is creating world-wide interest, education, experimentation and remote operation of a lunar colony. LTM1 has the potential of being a long term global EduTainment method for space activities and may be the generic example of how to teach and explore in many other subject areas not limited to space EduTainment. All of this facilitates the kind of spirit which can lead to a generation of people who are ready for the leap to the stars!   CONCLUSION:   EduTainment is the blending of education and entertainment. Anyone who has ever enjoyed seeing miniatures will probably see the potential impact of a globally available layout for recreation, education and experimentation purposes. By creating a tele-operated model lunar colony we not only create world-wide publicity, but also a method of trying new ideas that require real (not virtual) skills and open a new method for putting people's minds in space.

The federal government has an interest in the intent of the perpetrators in the pursuit of preventing violations of civil rights. It's the way they broke the back of the Klan, by putting a lot of people away for a very long time for harrassing blacks specifically. It is a principle that has been well recognized as constitutionally valid since over 100 years ago. It has been used whenever a select group was getting bashed or harrassed more than any other person would just for being part of a minority. It is the only way we made the defeat of the south stick after the Civil War. People who harrassed free blacks, when normally they wouldn't find themselves harrassing just anyone walking around were expeditiously tried and jailed for 5 to 8 years until nobody wanted to try it anymore. Now with the 14th amendment guarantee of equal protection under the law, the law can use multiple crime and severe penalty involving intent as much as is needed to protect even one human that is a hated minority to somebody. They can call out the national guard just for them, as they did the school girls in Alabama during desegregation in the 1950's, and the president can nationalize the state militia and turn the guns of the militia that were being used to bar blacks right around to point at the thousands in the crowd with an order to shoot that they would have to obey or face possible death by firing squad under the Uniform Code of Military Justice for failing to obey a direct order while under arms! And by god, they did! Those southern boys turned right around an fixed bayonets! And the governor was left standing and was arrested by the federal marshalls that had brought the order to nationalize the guard. And that's why we need such an ability in federal jurisdiction. -RSW \",\"  The CR purchase would be the Ford Probe GT.  john  \",\"Hi,  I just compiled the X11R5 distribution for a Sun3/SunOS4.1.1.

I haven't seen it, or any followup traffic relating to it in these groups or other groups which I subscribe to.  So, I am posting it here so others can read it, check it out, and comment on it, and provide ideas for handling these sorts of things.  I have no verification to the accuracy or lack of accuracy of this article, but if accurate, I find it extremely disturbing, especially in light of various abuses of the SSN number regarding privacy, (I understand it is now to be required in CA to renew a drivers license, or to register a car) and other proposals regarding 'smart' national Identity Cards, wiretap proposals, and such.  One simply wonders what other gems are in the wings ready to be sprung on the people by our government.  Perhaps suggestions and ideas for preventing this and other such proposals from acquiring the force of law would be useful.  The cost simply outweighs any possible benefits, IMO.  BTW, reading this makes me think of some ideas a Prof Denning has been promoting, in an even more disturbing form.  That said, with no further comment, the article follows:  ------------ Begin included article ---------  Note:  This file will also be available via anonymous file transfer from csrc.ncsl.nist.gov in directory /pub/nistnews and via the NIST Computer Security BBS at 301-948-5717.      ---------------------------------------------------                           THE WHITE HOUSE                    Office of the Press Secretary  _________________________________________________________________  For Immediate Release                           April 16, 1993                   STATEMENT BY THE PRESS SECRETARY   The President today announced a new initiative that will bring the Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary program to improve the security and privacy of telephone communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement.  The initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.  For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.  Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.  A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" has been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new, relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today.  This new technology will help companies protect proprietary information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals.   A \\\"key-escrow\\\" system will be established to ensure that the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique                                   2   \\\"keys,\\\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately in two \\\"key-escrow\\\" data bases that will be established by the Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap.  The \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans.  To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings.  The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield criminals and terrorists.  We need the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" and other approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system), the President has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:       --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to           employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;       --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone           calls and data, under proper court or other legal           order, when necessary to protect our citizens;       --   the effective and timely use of the most modern           technology to build the National Information           Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and           the competitiveness of American industry in the global           marketplace; and        --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export           high technology products.  The President has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.                                    3  The Administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a National Information Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks (\\\"information superhighways\\\") will transmit video, images, HDTV programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone system transmits voice.  Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law.  Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet.  The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available.

A:   No.  \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with      no new authorities to access the content of the private      conversations of Americans.  Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on      a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation      encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to      decipher the message?  A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a      court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They      would then present documentation of this authorization to      the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and      obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug      smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are      stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key      escrow system.  Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?  A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent      entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the      Administration have yet to determine which agencies will      oversee the key-escrow data banks.  Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure      how strong the security is?    A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption      systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will      remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow      system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of      cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all      potential users that there are no unrecognized      vulnerabilities.  Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?  A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the      Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in      this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the      President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet      officials.  Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?  A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on      encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify      as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have      briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the      decisions related to this initiative.  Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?  A:   The government designed and developed the key access      encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the      microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product      manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip      manufacturer that produces them.  Q:   Who provides the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\"?  A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,      California, and will sell the chip to encryption device      manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed      to other vendors in the future.  Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices?   A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating      the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" into their devices.       Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological      solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be      willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more      powerful encryption devices?  A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be      considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow      mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product      that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive      than others readily available today, but it is just one      piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to      encryption technology, which the Administration is      developing.       The Administration is not saying, \\\"since encryption      threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,      we will prohibit it outright\\\" (as some countries have      effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \\\"every      American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an      unbreakable commercial encryption product.\\\"  There is a      false \\\"tension\\\" created in the assessment that this issue is      an \\\"either-or\\\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,      and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,      balanced approach such as is proposed with the \\\"Clipper      Chip\\\" and similar encryption techniques.  Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton      Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from      that of the Bush Administration?    A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption      technology in telecommunications and computing and are      committed to working with industry and public-interest      groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'      privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law      enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime      and terrorism.  Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use      the government hardware?  A:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control      requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is      required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The      same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the      attractions of this technology is the protection it can give      to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this      in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a      case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these      devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan      to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability      of these products.  ----------- End included article -----------  \",\"Hi all,  I've been locked in a small closet chained to a lab bench for the last week or two without access to really important information.

Armenian invaders burned and sacked the fatherland of  Urartus, massacred and exterminated its population and presented to  the world all those left from the Urartus, as the Armenian civilization.  All reliable Western historians describe how Armenians ruthlessly exterminated 2.5 million Muslim women, children and elderly people of  Eastern Anatolia and how they collaborated with the enemies of the  Ottoman Empire between 1914-1920.  It is unfortunately a truth that Armenians are known as collaborators of the Nazis during World War II and that, even today, criminal/Nazi members of the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism Triangle preach and instigate racism, hatred, violence and terrorism among peoples.   And x-Soviet Armenia continues its anti-Turkish policy in the following  ways:  1. x-Soviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide in order to shift international public opinion away from its political responsibility.  2. x-Soviet Armenia, employing ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism  Triangle and criminal/Nazi Armenians, attempts to call into question the  veracity of the Turkish Genocide.  3. x-Soviet Armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism through the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to  silence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests.  4. Using all its human, financial, and governmental resources, x-Soviet Armenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence through terrorism, bribery and other subversive methods, non-Turkish supporters of the Turkish cause, be they political, governmental and humanitarian.  Using all the aforementioned methods, the x-Soviet Armenian government  is attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community from making the Turkish Case a contemporary issue.  Yet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian government and its terrorist and revisionist organizations, in the last decades, thanks to the struggle  of those whose closest ones were systematically exterminated by the Armenians, the international wall of silence on this issue has begun to collapse, and  consequently a number of governments and organizations have become  supportive of the recognition of the Turkish Genocide.

In the Brock2 model, Bill James calculated predicted RBIs as RBI=.235*(Total Bases) + Home Runs.  This  completely ignores the context, which was all that Brock2  could do, since context was unknown to it.  So I thought I'd take that idea as a starting point and look how good a fit to the data you get by comparing (RBI-Home Runs) to SLG*RISP.  I've started with team data, using data from the Elias's that I've picked up over the years when a) I could afford them and b) I could stomach the thought of increasing Elias's profits. That gave me the years 1984-1986, 1988, and 1990.  (I don't  have team RBIs for '87 or I could add that year.)  If you run a simple least squares fit to the data you get   (RBI-Home Runs) = 0.81*SLG*RISP.  The correlation between the LHS and the RHS is 0.86, which is significant at a ridiculously high level.  So, I feel like the fit is good at the team level.  I've no started to move on to  the player level and have looked at 4 players (Will Clark, Ozzie Smith, Joe Carter, and Don Mattingly).  I hope to  add quite a few more during my copious free time this year.  It doesn't do too badly, except the equation underpredicts the low HR hitter (Smith), which may be a fault of the model or it could just be Ozzie.  The results:                             RBI-HR          Years        Actual   Predicted Carter  (84-88,90)     400       402.6 Clark   (87,88,90,92)  269       269.6 Matt'ly (84-88,90)     471       460.8 Smith   (84-88,90)     317       280.6  I think we can make a case (and I hope to make it stronger) that RBIs can be predicted simply from knowing how a player slugs overall and how many men are in scoring position when he comes up.  More later, Harold\",\"  Again, you missed Jesus's point.  If you read the surrounding passages you would understand what Jesus means by \\\"life in the world.\\\"  But as is, you bumbled around, asserted your standard axiom that the Bible is bunk, and came up with the wrong idea.  Also, you do not know exactly what Jesus means by eternal life.    Brian K., do you expect to jump in the middle of the quantum mechanics book and understand Hermite polynomials having not read the surrounding material?  Why do you such with the Bible?  For an idea what Jesus means by the world, look up references to it in your concordance.  For a good description, the whole Book of Ecclesiastes is game.  For  eternal life, check out John 17:3, John 3:15-16.  You will find that eternal life is quite different than what you think.

If you see a 8551 made by MOS or CSG, take it, its a 6551A.   I know no fixed version of the 6551. There are different possibilities to work around this bug. The easiest is to tie _CTS to GND and use _DSR or _DCD as _CTS. It should be easy to fix the software, _DSR is bit 6 and DCD ist bit 5 of the Status Register (Read 6551 with RS1 = low and RS0 = high).  Using the _CTS-line can lead into big trouble. The 6551 _instantly_ stops transmission if _CTS goes high. This means, that you may get only a half byte...  Gerrit \",\"Hi,  I would like to hear the net.wisdom and net.opinions on IDE Controllers.

Good luck,  - Pete ____________________________________________________________________________\",\"According to what I have read on Biblical idioms, speaking \\\"in X's name\\\" is a standard Aramaic/Hebrew legal idiom for what we today would call Power of Attorney.  A person from Jesus' culture authorized to conduct business \\\"in John's name\\\" had full authority over John's financial affairs, but was held under a solemn fiduciary obligation to work only for John's benefit and consonant with John's wishes.  It was not required for the steward to preface each business transaction with \\\"in John's name\\\"; it was sufficient to have valid power of attorney and be operating in good faith. (Note the overlap here between legal and religious definitions of \\\"faith\\\".)  With this cultural background, praying \\\"in Jesus' name\\\" does not mandate a particular verbal formula; rather it requires that the petitioner be operating faithfully and consciously within an analogous \\\"fiduciary\\\" relationship with Jesus and for the purposes of His Kingdom.  The message of \\\"praying in Jesus' name\\\" is thus closely aligned with the parable of the talents and other passages about God's delegation of Kingdom business to his stewards, both resources and responsibilities.  This idea of praying \\\"in Jesus' name\\\" is not only present but prominent in the Lord's Prayer, although the verbal forumula is absent.  The act of praying the words \\\"In Jesus' Name\\\" may be beneficial if they cause us to clarify the relationship of our requests to the advancement of God's Kingdom.  For that reason, I'm not quite ready to say that the praying the formula is without meaning.  Prayers to God for other purposes (desperation, anger, thanksgiving, etc.) don't seem to be in this category at all, whether uttered by Christian or non-Christian, whether B.C. or A.D. (that's B.C.E. or C.E. for you P.C. :-).  I don't see anything in Christ's words to contradict the idea that God deals with all prayers according to His omniscience and grace.

The motherboard booklet says the board is a \\\"391 WB/H.\\\"  I have 4 1x3 simms on board.  The machine also uses a Super IDE I/O Card (model PT-604). (of course niether the motherboard or the I/O card booklet clearly state who the manufacurers are) I'm also using a Trident 8900C SVGA card.   Anyway, that's all of the pertinent info I can think of. My problem is that the computer often freezes or displays \\\"Parity Error -- System Halted\\\" messages depending on whether I set the Memory Parity Error Checking to \\\"disabled\\\" or \\\"enabled\\\" in the setup of the bios (makes sense). Its AMI bios (so it must be an AMI board?).   I just took it back to the dealer and they replaced all of the SIMMS but I keep getting the same error (more frequently now).  It all worked at the dealer and didn't start screwing up 'till I got home (figures).   I've tried to take out all of the SIMMS and even re-inserted them in reverse order, making sure that the connections were solid.

Jim,  There are a couple of things about your post and others in this thread that are a little confusing. An atheist is one for whom all things can be understood as processes of nature - exclusively. There is no need for any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything. There is no purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by physics, chemistry, biology, etc.; everything is random, nothing is determnined. This would also have to include human intelligence of course and all its products. There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it acquire intelligence, it's just a happy accident. For an atheist, no event can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less value than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about- an event can have value.  The products of our intelligence are acquired from our environment, from teaching, training, observation and experience and are only significant to the individual mind wherein they reside. These mental processes and the images they produce for us are just electrical activity and nothing more; content is of no consequence. The human mind is as much a response to natural forces as water running down a hill. How then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing the values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? On what grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? It seems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, you have to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but what in nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke to establish your values. Since every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what difference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or otherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The only way an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the objection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn't like it - that's it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer that it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries no weight in any \\\"absolute\\\" sense. That you don't like what God told people to do says nothing about God or God's commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled with a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That your objections -seem- well founded is due to the way you've been conditioned; there is no \\\"truth\\\" content. The whole of your intellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality. I didn't make these rules, it's inherent in naturalistic atheism and to be consistent, you have to accept the non-significance of any human thought, even your own. All of this being so, you have excluded yourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil, etc. and cannot participate. Your opinion about the Bible can have no weight whatsoever.\",\"Hi All,  Would anyone out there in 'net-land' happen to have an authentic, sure-fire way of making this great sauce that is used to adorn Gyro's and Souvlaki?

Our editors need to be able to see how many spaces are in text but the character  displayed is a large hollow box.  They overlap each other and characters on each side, which is useless.  I believe the character used by W4W is the period-centred (0183). This character shows up with the windows Charmap display as the hollow box which tends to confirm this.  I have edited the corel font with Fontmonger and changing the font graphics for the 0183 character makes no difference to the font output in Charmap or W4W.

For one, you seem unable to master your lack of desire to understand even the slightest concept of the Bible.  Seems that ignorance has you mastered.  How about sexual sins?  Gotta any of those secret desires in your head that you harbor but can get control of?   Do you dehumanize women when they walk past you?  Do you degrade them to a sex object in your head?  Are you the master of that kind of thinking?  Do you insult people unknowingly, then regret it later.  Yet do it again the next time opportunity presents itself?  Are you truly the master of yourself?  I have admitted that I am not the master of my thought life at all times. That I sometimes say things I do want to say, and then repeat my mistake unwantingly.  I have admitted to myself that I cannot control every aspect of my being.  There are times I know I shouldn't say something, but then say it anyway.  There are times I simply forget a lesson. I, in fact, am not my own master.  I need help.  Jesus promised me this help.  And I took him up on his offer.  I have willfully let Jesus be my master because Jesus knows what is better for me than I myself do.  And why not?  Does not the creator know his creation better than the creation?  Does Toyota know what's better for the Corolla than the Corolla?   Then I guess ignorance is bliss for you.  Because Brian, you enjoy not having a clue about the Bible.       Can you witness motherly love with your senses?  How does caring and concern for you register with your senses?

You have life forever.  You can choose to either live it in hell in eternal torment where there is no communication whatsoever, or can choose to  live it in paradise with God.  That is what my God says.  And that was the issue.  Your made-up theism is what it is--made up.  It's wishful thinking.    Is this the religion of Kendigianism?  Most people are not Christian.  Most people, including Christians,  are not fond of feeling that they are imperfect.  Is \\\"the world an undesireable place\\\" a doctrine of Kendigianism?  It has nothing to do with my God.  Does Kendigism have magical mystical prayers as a part of its worship? Mine doesn't.  Does Kendigianism believe that the world will be holy again?   Mine doesn't.  Does Kendigianism also dictate that one must obey what the priest tells them like good little sheep?  Mine doesn't.  Is this a bunch of lies you tell yourself so that you can justify being  ignorant of the Bible?  Brian, following Christ has nothing to do with the doctrines of Kendigianism. You would find any of your doctrines in the Bible.   I don't follow Kendigianism. I follow Christ.   Also, to try to again show you your ignorance of Christ and the Bible in regards to \\\"priests\\\",  have you not read about the sole Melchizedek priest in Hebrews 7 and 8?  Have you not read what the purpose is of the Old Testament Levitical priesthood and why there should NOT be priests today?  Yes, guess what?  The Catholics messed up.

So you have no reason to lead a good life. Leading a good life is meaningless.   Why do you do such a meaningless thing?   Has the resurrection sunk in?  Jesus is alive.  Jesus is NOT dead.

Incidentally, my MP has responded to my questions on that issue, and it appears that the UK and other `approved' countries will get the secure A5 encryption, and `dodgy' countries will get A5X.  Existing mobile equipment will drop to clear mode when used with A5X systems, but newer equipment will use A5/A5X/clear depending on the capabilities of the base station.  The cops/feds do *not* need to be able to get hold of your private key to listen in to cellular conversations.  Encryption is not end-to-end, but  cellphone to base-station - it *has* to be this way so that cellular users and fixed installations can talk to each other.  For cellular to cellular calls, the transmission is decrypted at the base-station, passed to another base-station and re-encrypted.  The cops/feds can listen to the unscrambled call *provided* they get a warrant to tap into the cellular provider's equipment.  The only reason for wanting a crackable system is so they can listen without having to obtain a warrant.  But, maybe the Clipper system is secure, and they really do need a warrant to get the key out of escrow before they can listen in using a scanner (see above - they don't *have* to go down this route anyway).  I have my doubts, but even if true once they have the key they will *never* again need a warrant to tap into that particular phone whenever they want.  `Well, Judge, it appears he wasn't a drug-dealer after all, so naturally we'll stop listening in'...

I'm willing to speculate that the DX2-50 with local-bus will be 2-4 times  as fast as the DX-50 and probably as expensive (or cheap ;-)!\",\"For those Leaf fans who are concerned, the following players are slated for return on Thursday's Winnipeg-Toronto game :     Peter Zezel, John Cullen    Mark Osborne and Dave Ellett are questionable to return on Thursday.\",\"ITEM: Klipsch Forte 2 Speakers CONDITION: Mint AGE: 6 months old  PRICE: $1000/pair (retail: $1400/pair)\",\"The stragegy of the government is interesting.  The real fear comes from them doing more than this.  This is a voluntary program, and thus harder for us to object to on the surface.  Their strategy is a business one rather than legal one.  They are pushing to get a standard in place, a secret standard, and if they get it as a standard then they will drive competitors out of the market. It will be legal to sell better, untapable encryption that doesn't have registered keys, but it will be difficult, and thus not a plan for most phone companies.  You see, with clipper chip phones you'll be able to talk to any cellular company, or other phones or ports because they will follow the standard.  AT&T has already announced a clipper chip encryption product.  The government has marketed hard to get major vendors to use these chips.   If they get enough market share, they will rule.  And thus there will be very little market for systems that can't be tapped by the police.  The public isn't that concerned about it now, after all.  They freely do calls that anybody with an old TV can listen to today!  They won't pay big extra bucks for proprietary phones that secure them only from the police.  Well, some people will buy these phones, but they will only work with other proprietary phones, so the market will be small and the phones expensive.  Unless they are made in numbers large enough to sell them cheap, only the Mob will buy them.

The first part of the plan is to begin a comprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues such as export controls which have effectively denied most people easy access to robust encryption, and law enforcement issues posed by new technology.  However, EFF is very concerned that the Administration has already reached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry, before any public comment or discussion has been allowed.  Apparently, the Administration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone equipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed by the National Security Agency.  The so-called \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" is an 80-bit, split key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into chips manufactured by a military contractor.  Two separate escrow agents would store users' keys, and be required to turn them over law enforcement upon presentation of a valid warrant.  The encryption scheme used is to be classified, but the chips will be available to any manufacturer for incorporation into its communications products.       This proposal raises a number of serious concerns .  First, the Administration has adopted a solution before conducting an inquiry.  The NSA-developed Clipper Chip may not be the most secure product. Other vendors or developers may have better schemes. Furthermore, we should not rely on the government as the sole source for the Clipper or any other chips.  Rather, independent chip manufacturers should be able to produce chipsets based on open standards.  Second, an algorithm cannot be trusted unless it can be tested. Yet, the Administration proposes to keep the chip algorithm classified.  EFF believes that any standard adopted ought to be public and open.  The public will only have confidence in the security of a standard that is open to independent, expert scrutiny.    Third, while the use of the use of a split-key, dual escrowed system may prove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and law enforcement needs, the details of this scheme must be explored publicly before it is adopted.  What will give people confidence in the safety of their keys?  Does disclosure of keys to a third party waive an individual's Fifth Amendment rights in subsequent criminal inquiries?  These are but a few of the many questions the Administrations proposal raised but fails to answer.  In sum, the Administration has shown great sensitivity to the importance of these issues by planning a comprehensive inquiry into digital privacy and security.  However, the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" solution ought to be considered as part of the inquiry, and not be adopted before the discussion even begins.  DETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL:  ESCROW  The 80-bit key will be divided between two escrow agents, each of whom hold 40-bits of each key.  The manufacturer of the communications device would be required to register all keys with the two independent escrow agents.  A key is tied to the device, however, not the person using it.  Upon presentation of a valid court order, the two escrow agents would have to turn the key parts over to law enforcement agents.  According to the Presidential Directive just issued, the Attorney General will be asked to identify appropriate escrow agents.  Some in the Administration have suggested that one non-law enforcement federal agency (perhaps the Federal Reserve), and one non-governmental organization could be chosen, but there is no agreement on the identity of the agents yet.  CLASSIFIED ALGORITHM AND THE POSSIBILITY OF BACK DOORS  The Administration claims that there are no back doors -- means by which the government or others could break the code without securing keys from the escrow agents -- and that the President will be told there are no back doors to this classified algorithm.  In order to prove this, Administration sources are interested in arranging for an all-star crypto cracker team to come in, under a security arrangement, and examine the algorithm for trap doors.  The results of the investigation would then be made public.  The Clipper Chipset was designed and is being produced and a sole-source, secret contract between the National Security Agency and two private firms:  VLSI and Mycotronx.  NSA work on this plan has been underway for about four years.  The manufacturing contract was let 14 months ago.  GOVERNMENT AS MARKET DRIVER  In order to get a market moving, and to show that the government believes in the security of this system, the feds will be the first big customers for this product.  Users will include the FBI, Secret Service, VP Al Gore, and maybe even the President.  At today's Commerce Department press briefing, a number of people asked this question, though:  why would any private organization or individual adopt a classified standard that had no independent guaranty of security or freedom from trap doors?  COMPREHENSIVE POLICY INQUIRY  The Administration has also announced that it is about to commence an inquiry into all policy issues related to privacy protection, encryption, and law enforcement.  The items to be considered include:  export controls on encryption technology and the FBI's Digital Telephony Proposal.  It appears that the this inquiry will be conducted by the National Security Council.  Unfortunately, however, the Presidential Directive describing the inquiry is classified.  Some public involvement in the process has been promised, but they terms have yet to be specified.  FROM MORE INFORMATION CONTACT:  Jerry Berman, Executive Director (jberman@eff.org) Daniel J.

This may be a dangerous thing to do.  It is my opinion that most educated or well informed people of this country have some distrust of the government. This should exist because as a bureaucracy, any government given enough time will tend to exist for it self and not for the original purpose it was  created for.  This distrust by the people should keep those in power in-line. That and a properly functioning press.  When a sensationalism oriented press portrays a group of people as \\\"nuts\\\" or crazies, a violation of those people's civil rights seem justified.   Since we, as American's, have the  gurantee of rights as enumerated in the constitution, to include the 2nd ammendment, the government must appease the public's opinion or risk  voted out of existance, or if it has become corrupt enough to tamper with domocratic process itself, being thrown out by force.   Our government as it stands, must appease the public.  Therefore the  official press releases portray the BD's as fanatics who are a threat to public safety.  We must not prejudge people based on one sided information. So far the only information that we are being given is comming from the very agency that was embarrased by the BD(Branch Davidians sp?).  It is to their advantage to make the BD's as fanatical and dangerous as possible.  If they were portrayed as law-abiding citizen's, then they(ATF) had no justification what so ever of doing what they did.    So let's keep an open mind.  Jokes like above, even though it may be funny, may mislead the public from the truth of the matter.  Just as an aside,  my understanding of U.S. vs Rock Island and U.S. vs Dalton leads me to believe that the National Firearms Act, which allows the Fed's (in this case ATF) to regulate firearms(machine guns), has been deemed to be unconstitutional since 1986.(By two federal district courts at least). And since, I believe the only reason ATF was involved in this case is because of firearms violations, it would be interesting to  find out whether or not the search warrent was based on the NFA. It would be very embarrassing indeed if a search warrent based on a possibly unconstitutional law has resulted in 4 deaths(Law enforcement).    **************************************************************************** The above opinions are mine and mine only.

Thanks,  Deepak \",\"   Why do we follow God so blindly?  Have you ever asked a physically blind person why he or she follows a seeing eye dog? The answer is quite simple--the dog can see, and the blind person cannot.   I acknowledge, as a Christian, that I am blind.  I see, but I see  illusions as well as reality.  (Watched TV lately?) I hear, but I hear lies as well as truth.  (Listen to your  radio or read a newspaper.)  Remember, all that tastes well is not healthy.  So, I rely one the one who can see, hear, and taste everything, and knows what is real, and what is not. That is God.   Of course, you may ask, if I cannot trust my own senses, how do I know whether what I see and hear about God is truth or a lie.  That is why we need faith to be saved.  We must force ourselves to believe that God knows the truth, and loves us enough to share it with us, even when it defies what we think we know.  Why would He have created us if He did not love us  enough to help us through this world?   I also do trust my experiences to some extent.  When I do things that defy the seeming logic of my experience,  because it is what my Father commands me to do, and I see the results in the long term, I find that He has led me in the proper direction, even though it did not feel right at the time.  This is where our works as Christians are important:  As exercises of the body make the body strong, excercises of faith make the faith strong.     As for you, no one can \\\"convert\\\" you.  You must choose to follow God of your own will, if you are ever to follow Him.  All we as Christians wish to do is share with you the love we have received from God.  If you reject that, we have to accept your decision, although we always keep the offer open to you.  If you really want to find out why we believe what we believe, I can only suggest you try praying for faith, reading the Bible, and asking Christians about their experiences personally.  Then you may grow to understand why we believe what we do, in defiance of the logic of this world.

Actually, I just finished writing a motif animation program... (take-lots-of-image-data-and-display-it-pretty-darn-fast). When using on-server pixmaps or shared memory, I had to insert a delay loop to keep it from going too quickly :). Testing both methods side by side, they were just about equal.    The advantage of SHM is that your X server doesn't grow to ridiculous sizes; but pixmaps can work over a network and *are* removed if your application dies (one tends to use ipcrm manually quite a bit when debugging SHM apps).    Shared memory also has the problem that some operating systems (e.g. Ultrix) seem to allow only a small number of segments (~6) to be attached to a process at once; consequently, a redraw becomes XShmAttach();XShmPutImage();XShmDetach(); on Dec systems. And Dec's 24 bit displays (like the ones I tend to use most often) don't seem to support the extension (maybe someone compiled them wrong?), and using pixmaps causes the X server to crash (failed mallocs), so one *has* to use the local unix domain socket (which really isn't that bad; one copies the info three times per redraw instead of one).    In short: allowing all three forms of display, within the program is a Good Thing (minus SHM if running over a network), and let the user pick whatever feels fastest.

I would rather have Zane Smith pitch right handed than have Moeller pitch at all.  2) I am sure Simmons was ready to say I told you so after Otto had an impressive win last week. NOw Otto's latest debacle has restored Simmon's reputation. Now he looks like he is back in his '92 form when he had the AL's highest ERA among starters. Four our sake(not Ted's sake), I hope he pitches with a 3.5 ERA for the rest of the season. Yeah, right.  3) Tomlin and Merced are a bit disappointing. They are still doing decently. BUt considering the considerable amount of talent and maturity they have shown their first seasons, they seem to have actually gotten a little bit worse. Tomlin was almost unhittable his rookie year against lefty batters. Merced had a very good OBA his rookie year. He showed a lot of concentration at the plate in his rookie year.  4) Walk: Well, he seems to be on the losing end tonight. BUt I still think that Walk desrved his contract.  5) Leyland should accept a part of the blame for the LaValliere situation. I can't understand his and management's fear of losing Tom Prince through waivers. Even if they do, what's the use. He is aright hander like Slaught. Not a very smart platoon. Also, I am blaming Leyland in this case, since he is hcurrently    convinced that LaVAlliere is through, while giving him way too much time last year in the regular season AND the playoffs(SLaught should have played in all 7 games; he has a good average against right handed pitching). Didn't Leyland and Simmons forsee this last year, and attempt to trade LaValliere last year itself? Any fool could tell them LaVAlliere wasn't very fit last year.  6) Dennis MOeller is SCARY!!! 7) Candeleria: Well, he is not going to have such a high ERA at the end of the season. Maybe it will be in 3-4 range. BUt $1 million  plus? Come on. Other than the customary home run giving stage Patterson goes through for a few weeks, Patterson has served the PIrates very well each year. So far, he seems to have pitched well for the Rangers. I think the PIrates should have spent the money on Patterson in stead.  8) The Rookie batters: Well, Young has surprised me a bit with his instant impact. Other than that, their excellent performance hasn't been too much of a surprise. I think we should thank Doughty for that.  9) Rookie Pitchers: Worse than expected, especially Cooke. 10) Slaught: How come he wasn't given a contract extension last year? NOw his value has increased immensely.  11) Lonnie Smith!! Well, Eric Davis was signed for a comparable amount. Let's see. Eric can hit better. He can run better. He can field better. Now why didnt the PIrates go after Eric Davis. An injured Davis is better than a healthy Lonnie Smith. Even if Lonnnie Smith gets some big hits this year,he won't be an asset. He has looked terrible on the bases and in the field.  12) Management: BIG BIG ZERO. Sauer has yet to make a forceful agreement in favor of revenue sharing. He seems more concerned about pleasing that idiot Danforth by preparing the team for a move to Tampa Bay. 13) Alex Cole fiasco. The PIrates infield and CF positions look good. The RF and LF would have looked good if we could have gotten Cole to replace two of the four outfielders. Eric Davis, Van Slyke and Cole would have made a very respectable outfield. Even without Eric Davis, thye PIrates would have a respectable outfield with Cole, SVan Slyke, and Merced(I think he should hit left handed against lefts in stead of switch hitting). Simmons did have options for the outfield. Ironically, the biggest accomplishment of Simmon's tenure was getting Alex Cole really cheap. Too bad.  14) Compensatory draft picks for Bonds: Forget it. The pirates can rant and rave. they will not get those picks. As of now, the issue is still being appealed. Now, if this doesnt convince anyone that Simmons and Sauer are idiots, nothing else will.  On a final note. Tim Wakefield won't be as awful as he was in his last 2 starts. BUt don't count on him pitching like last year for the rest of the season.

If we  unthinkingly adopt pantheistic ideas that are opposed to Christianity,  we can pervert our faith.  When we clearly recognize pantheism when we  encounter it we have the opportunity to embrace what is consistent with  Christianity and reject what isn't.      We need to be alert, always thinking and questioning.  We must examine  the underlying assumptions of every book we read, tv program we watch  and socio-political movement we participate in.  Ideas are important.   Philosophies and doctrines are what give form to the events of our  lives.  They are the basis from which we live our lives of love and  service.  The command to love God with all one's mind means no fuzzy- headed drifting from idea to idea.    One Christian who acknowledges this is the Pope.  It is a frequent theme  in his writings.  Indeed, thoughtful Christians from most traditions  recognize that consumerism has no place in the lives of Christians.  It  too is a perversion and dangerous to our faith.

Neto):  This all sounds suspiciously like my company might have something to do with this.  Background first: Megatek has a series of framebuffers designed as X accelerators. For the most part these are designed for Sun SBUS and Sun (and other vendor's) VME systems.  That said, Megatek products support multi-screen and/or multi-display on a sigle workstation. Most of our cards have a keyboard/mouse port which can be used to provide additional displays. For example, say you hade a Sparcstation with an Sbus expansion chassis. You could put in six frambuffers, allowing a total of six screens in the system. You could then attach from 1 to 6 keyboard/mice, allowing you to mix and match any combination of screens and displays. You could have 1 6-screen display, 3 2-screen displays, 6 1-screen displays, or 1 2-screen display and 1 4-screen display. Basically any combination.  Because of this, we at Megatek try to be very careful about the use of the words multi-screen and multi-display. They are quite different in meaning, and (at least in X) have exact definitions.  The reason I ramble like this is the mention of an upper limit if 12 screens in a display. As it so happens, there's a define in the server that determines the most screens supported (server/include/misc.h, MAXSCREENS). As released my MIT, this is 3. As released by Megatek, this is 12.  As such, the most screens supported by a single Megatek display (i.e. X server) is 12. If someone construed this to be a limitation of X I'm sorry, but clearly (as pointed out so well by Mr. Neto) this is not the case.  We just did it here because nobody has ever asked us for more. Of course, I could say \\\"Buy all you want, we'll support more.\\\" -- \",\"   If by that you mean anything on the GD approach, there was an article on it in a recent Avation Week.

I have a Mitsubishi 63 meg Hard Drive,  and am running Smartdrv (the version that comes with Windows 3.1) on  it.  I rarely use Windows.  I use a program called Disk Technician  Gold v1.14 to do diagnostics live time on my hard drive.  It works by  having a device driver detect whenever more than one read is  necessary for a file, or if there is anything else is wrong with it,  and minor problems are fully checked out upon rebooting.  My hard  drive is notorious for bad sectors.  I usually end up with 8 new bad  sectors a week.           Here's what happened:  I ran a program, and DTG broke in with  an Emergency Warning and recommended I reboot.  It gave me this  message twice before the program was fully loaded.  I exited the program  and did just this.  DTG went through its bootup process, examining  for new errors etc., and a screen popped up and said something about  sectors for a brief period of time.           I then went back to the program, executed it again, and the  exact same error was detected.  I rebooted and tried again, and the  same error happened again.  So, I removed DTG from memory, and went  to the program to see if I could detect anything wrong.  Sure enough  there was a number of read attempts.  So I rebooted and reloaded DTG,  but removed the cache.  I executed the program.  No read errors,  either audible or detected by DTG.  I quit the program, loaded the  cache, and ran the program again.  The errors were detected.           Ok, so the errors are there, and DTG detects but doesn't fix  them, when the cache is loaded.  When the cache is not loaded there are  no errors.  So, to see if the cache was interfering with any other  files, I went into xtree gold and tagged all files, and searched them  for a random string (in other words, I wanted the program to  completely read every file on my hard drive).  Before I got through  the c's DTG had detected at least six errors and recommended I reboot.           Does anybody, have any idea why Smartdrv is causing misreads on  my hard drive?  Oh, there are exactly two misreads per file, and 1 in  about every 100 files are affected.             I originally posted this message to Disk Technician Corp.'s  system, but I figured someone out in netland may know enough about  smartdrv to help me out. \",\" At issue was not a trial behind closed doors, but arrest, trial and imprisonment in complete secrecy.  This was appraently attempted in the case of Vanunu and failed.  It has happened before, and there is reason to believe it still goes on.  Read this:  From Ma'ariv, February 18 (possibly 28), 1992  PUBLICATION BAN          The State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many         years there have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were         sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of         their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever         being made public.  By Baruch Me'iri  All those involved in this matter politely refused my request, one way or another: \\\"Look, the subject is too delicate.  If I comment on it, I will be implicitly admitting that it is true; If I mention a specific case, even hint at it, I might be guilty of making public something which may legally not be published\\\".  The State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many years there have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever being made public. More precisely: A court ordered publication ban was placed on the fact of their arrest, and later on their imprisonment.  In Israel of 1993, citizens are imprisoned without us, the citizens of this country, knowing anything about it.  Not knowing anything about the fact that one person or another were tried and thrown in prison, for security offenses, in complete secrecy.  In the distant past -- for example during the days of the [Lavon - YA] affair -- we heard about \\\"the third man\\\" being in prison.  But many years have passed since then, and what existed then can today no longer be found even in South American countries, or in the former Communist countries.  But it appears that this is still possible in Israel of 1993.  The Chair of the Knesset Committee on Law, the Constitution and Justice, MK David Zucker, sent a letter on this subject early this week to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice, and the Cabinet Legal Advisor.  Ma'ariv has obtained the content of the letter:  \\\"During the past several years a number of Israeli citizens have been imprisoned for various periods for security offenses.  In some of these cases a legal publication ban was imposed not only on the specifics of the crimes for which the prisoners were convicted, but even on the mere fact of their imprisonment.  In those cases, after being legally convicted, the prisoners spend their term in prison without public awareness either of the imprisonment or of the prisoner\\\", asserts MK Zucker.  On the other hand Zucker agrees in his letter that, \\\"There is absolutely no question that it is possible, and in some cases it is imperative, that a publication ban be imposed on the specifics of security offenses and the course of trials.  But even in such cases the Court must weigh carefully and deliberately the circumstances under which a trial will not be held in public.  \\\"However, one must ask whether the imposition of a publication ban on the mere fact of a person's arrest, and on the name of a person sentenced to prison, is justified and appropriate in the State of Israel.  The principle of public trial and the right of the public to know are not consistent with the disappearance of a person from public sight and his descent into the abyss of prison.\\\"  Zucker thus decided to turn to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice and the Cabinet Legal Advisor and request that they consider the question.  \\\"The State of Israel is strong enough to withstand the cost incurred by abiding by the principle of public punishment.  The State of Israel cannot be allowed to have prisoners whose detention and its cause is kept secret\\\", wrote Zucker.  The legal counsel of the Civil Rights Union, Attorney Mordechai Shiffman said that, \\\"We, as the Civil Rights Union, do not know of any cases of security prisoners, Citizens of Israel, who are imprisoned, and whose imprisonment cannot be made public.  This is a situation which, if it actually exists, is definitely unhealthy.  Just like censorship is an unhealthy matter\\\".  \\\"The Union is aware\\\", says Shiffman, \\\"of cases where notification of a suspect's arrest to family members and lawyers is withheld.  I am speaking only of several days.  I know also of cases where a detainee was not allowed to meet with an attorney -- sometimes for the whole first month of arrest.  That is done because of the great secrecy.  \\\"The suspect himself, his family, his lawyer -- or even a journalist -- can challenge the publication ban in court.  But there are cases where the family members themselves are not interested in publicity.  The journalist knows nothing of the arrest, and so almost everyone is happy...\\\"  Attorney Yossi Arnon, an official of the Bar, claims that given the laws as they exist in Israel today, a situation where the arrest of a person for security offenses is kept secret is definitely possible.  \\\"Nothing is easier.  The court orders a publication ban, and that's that.  Someone who has committed security offenses can spend long years in prison without us knowing anything about it.\\\"  -- Do you find this situation acceptable?  Attorney Arnon: \\\"Definitely not.  We live in a democratic country, and such a state of affairs is impermissible.  I am well aware that publication can be damaging -- from the standpoint of security -- but total non-publication, silence, is unacceptable. Consider the trial of Mordechai Vanunu: at least in his case we know that he was charged with aggravated espionage and sentenced to 18 years in prison.  The trial was held behind closed doors, nobody knew the details except for those who were authorized to.  It is somehow possible to understand, though not to accept, the reasons, but, as I have noted, we at least are aware of his imprisonment.\\\"  -- Why is the matter actually that serious?  Can't we trust the discretion of the court?  Attorney Arnon: \\\"The judges have no choice but to trust the presentations made to them. The judges do not have the tools to investigate.  This gives the government enormous power, power which they can misuse.\\\"  -- And what if there really is a security issue?  Attorney Arnon: \\\"I am a man of the legal system, not a security expert.  Democracy stands in opposition to security.  I believe it is possible to publicize the matter of the arrest and the charges -- without entering into detail.  We have already seen how the laws concerning publication bans can be misused, in the case of the Rachel Heller murder.  A suspect in the murder was held for many months without the matter being made public.\\\"  Attorney Shiffman, on the other hand, believes that state security can be a legitimate reason for prohibiting publication of a suspect's arrest, or of a convicted criminal's imprisonment.  \\\"A healthy situation?  Definitely not.  But I am aware of the fact that mere publication may be harmful to state security\\\".  A different opinion is expressed by attorney Uri Shtendal, former advisor for Arab affairs to Prime Ministers Levi Eshkol and Golda Meir.  \\\"Clearly, we are speaking of isolated special cases.  Such situations contrast with the principle that a judicial proceeding must be held in public. No doubt this contradicts the principle of freedom of expression.  Definitely also to the principle of individual freedom which is also harmed by the prohibition of publication.  \\\"Nevertheless\\\", adds Shtendal, \\\"the legislator allowed for the possibility of such a ban, to accommodate special cases where the damage possible as a consequence of publication is greater than that which may follow from an abridgment of the principles I've mentioned. The authority to decide such matters of publication does not rest with the Prime Minister or the security services, but with the court, which we may rest assured will authorize a publication ban only if it has been convinced of its need beyond a shadow of a doubt.\\\"  Nevertheless, attorney Shtendal agrees: \\\"As a rule, clearly such a phenomenon is undesirable. Such an extreme step must be taken only in the most extreme circumstances.\\\"\",\" Sometimes I have a problem with doctor's prescribing medicine like this.  I of course don't know the exact situation, and anti-depressants may work, but it isn't helping the ringing at all, is it?    Mine started about three years back.  Turns out I have tinnitus bilateral (translation: ringing in both ears, basically ;).  If this is what it is, she'll probably get used to it.  It would keep me up and drive me nuts too, but nowadays, I have to plug both my ears with my fingers to check to see if they are ringing.  Usually they are, but you get so used to it, it just gets tuned out.  Yes, this is what I've read about it... not just from my own personal experience.    Millions have it, according to my physician.  You just learn to cope with it (like I mentioned earlier) by ignoring it.  It eventually becomes unconscious.  The doc also said it could be caused by diet (ie: too much caffeine) and stress, but I haven't changed my lifestyle much, and it just comes and goes (it is always there somewhat, but now I rarely notice it when it really \\\"kicks in\\\").  Also, it doesn't necessarily mean there is any hearing loss, either caused by it or causing it.  I had an ENT (ear/nose/throat) exam, and passed.  In fact, my hearing is quite good considering I don't take as good of care of my hearing as I should.  Her reaction is normal.  If it is tinnitus, chances are good she'll begin to not even notice it.    This info is taken mostly from a few \\\"experts\\\", my own experience, and some readings (sorry, it was a few years back and don't have any specifics handy).\",\"I can not believe the way this thread on candida(yeast) has progressed.

Those that were  raised on farms and saw first-hand the effect of diet on the health of their  farm animals and those students who had made a dramatic diet change prior to  entering medical school(switched to the vegan diet).  Typically, this is  about 1/3 of my class of 90 students.  Those not interested in nutrition  either tune me out or just stop coming to class.  That's okay because I  know that some of what I'm teaching is going to stick and there will be at  least a few \\\"enlightened\\\" physicians practicing in the U.S.  It's really  too bad that most U.S. medical schools don't cover nutrition because if  they did, candida would not be viewed as a non-disease by so many in the  medical profession.  In animal husbandry, an animal is reinnoculated with \\\"good\\\" bacteria after  antibiotics are stopped.  Medicine has decided that since humans do not  have a ruminant stomach, no such reinnoculation with \\\"good\\\" bacteria is  needed after coming off a braod spectrum antibiotic.  Humans have all  kinds of different organisms living in the GI system(mouth, stomach, small  and large intestine), sinuses, vagina and on the skin.  These are  nonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune  system is compromised.  They are also called nonpathogens because unlike  the pathogenic organisms that cause human disease, they do not produce  toxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body.  But any of  these organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up  residence within the body.  A poor mucus membrane barrier can let this  happen and vitamin A is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier. Steve got real upset with Elaine's doctor because he was using anti-fungals  and vitamin A for her GI problems.  If Steve really understoood what  vitamin A does in the body, he would not(or at least should not) be calling  Elaine's doctor a quack.  Here is a brief primer on yeast.  Yeast infections, as they are commonly  called, are not truely caused by yeasts.  The most common organism responsible for this type of infection is Candida albicans or Monilia which is actually a  yeast-like fungus.  An infection caused by this organism is called candidiasis. Candidiasis is a very rare occurance because, like an E. Coli infection, it  requires that the host immune system be severly depressed.    Candida is frequently found on the skin and all of the mucous membranes of  normal healthy people and it rarely becomes a problem unless some predisposing factor is present such as a high blood glucose level(diabetes) or an oral  course of antibiotics has been used.  In diabetics, their secretions contain  much higher amounts of glucose.  Candida, unlike bacteria, is very limited in  it's food(fuel) selection.  Without glucose, it can not grow, it just barely  survives.  If it gets access to a lot of glucose, it blooms and over rides  the other organisms living with it in the sinuses, GI tract or vagina.  In  diabetics, skin lesions can also foster a good bloom site for these little  buggers.  The bloom is usually just a minor irritant in most people but  some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus  membrane or skin bloom site.  Whether this is an allergic like reaction to  the candida or not isn't certain.  When the bloom is in the vagina or on  the skin, it can be easliy seen and some doctors do then try to \\\"treat\\\" it. If it's internal, only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty  nondiscript.     Candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in  the sinuses, the GI tract(mouth, stomach and intestines) and in the  vaginal tract which compete with it for food.  The human immune system  ususally does not bother itself with these(nonpathogenic organisms) unless  they broach the mucus membrane \\\"barrier\\\".  If they do, an inflammatory  response will be set up.  Most Americans are not getting enough vitamin A  from their diets.  About 30% of all American's die with less Vitamin A than  they were born with(U.S. autopsy studies).  While this low level of vitamin  A does not cause pathology(blindness) it does impair the mucus membrane  barrier system.  This would then be a predisposing factor for a strong  inflammatory response after a candida bloom.    While diabetics can suffer from a candida \\\"bloom\\\" the  most common cause of  this type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which  knock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main  competition for candida as far as food is concerned.  While drugs are  available to handle candida, many patients find that their doctor will not  use them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection.  The toxicity of  the anti-fungal drugs does warrant some caution.  But if the GI or sinus  inflammation is suspected to be candida(and recent use of a broad spectrum  antibiotic is the smoking gun), then anti-fungal use should be approrpriate  just as the anti-fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring  vaginal yeast infections, in spite of what Mr. Steve Dyer says.  But even in patients being given the anti-fungals, the irritation caused by  the excessive candida bloom in the sinus, GI tract or the vagina tends to  return after drug treatment is discontinued unless the underlying cause of  the problem is addressed(lack of a \\\"good\\\" bacterial flora in the body and/or  poor mucus membrane barrier).  Lactobacillus acidophilus is the most effective  therapy for candida overgrowth.  From it's name, it is an acid loving  organism and it sets up an acidic condition were it grows.  Candida can not  grow very well in an acidic environment.  In the vagina, L. acidophilius is  the predominate bacteria(unless you are hit with broad spectrum  antibiotics).    In the GI system, the ano-rectal region seems to be a particularly good  reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very  favorable environment around the rectum for transfer(through moisture and  humidity) of candida to the vaginal tract.  One of the most effctive ways to  minimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear.    If the bloom occurs in the anal area, the burning, swelling, pain and even  blood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids.  If the  bloom manages to move further up the GI tract, very diffuse symptomatology  occurs(abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool).  This positive stool  for occult blood is what sent Elaine to her family doctor in the first  place.  After extensive testing, he told her that there was nothing wrong  but her gut still hurt.  On to another doctor, and so on.  Richard Kaplan  has told me throiugh e-mail that he considers occult blood tests in stool  specimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of  false positives(candida blooms guys?).  If my gut hurt me on a constant  basis, I would want it fixed.  Yes it's nice to know that I don't have  colon cancer but what then is causing my distress?  When I finally find a  doctor who treats me and gets me 90% better, Steve Dyer calls him a quack.  Candida prefers a slightly alkaline environment while bacteria  tend to prefer a slightly acidic environment.  The vagina becomes alkaline  during a woman's period and this is often when candida blooms in the vagina.  Vinegar and water douches are the best way of dealing with vaginal  problems.  Many women have also gotten relief from the introduction of  Lactobacillus directly into the vaginal tract(I would want to be sure of  the purity of the product before trying this).  My wife had this vagina  problem after going on birth control pills and searched for over a year  until she found a gynocologist who solved the problem rather than just writting  scripts for anti-fungal creams.  This was a woman gynocologist who had had  the same problem(recurring vaginal yeast infections).  This M.D. did some  digging and came up with an acetic acid and L. Acidophilis douche which she  used in your office to keep it sterile.  After three treatments, sex  returned to our marraige.  I have often wondered what an M.D. with chronic  GI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his  patients is a non-existent syndrome.  The nonpathogenic bacteria L. acidophilus is an acid producing bacteria  which is the most common bacteria found in the vaginal tract of healthy women.   If taken orally, it can also become a major bacteria in the gut.  Through  aresol sprays, it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes. But before this innoculation occurs, the mucus membrane barrier system  needs to be strengthened.  This is accomplished by vitamin A, vitamin C and  some of the B-complex vitamins.  Diet surveys repeatedly show that Americans  are not getting enough B6 and folate.  These are probably the segement of  the population that will have the greatest problem with this non-existent  disorder(candida blooms after antibiotic therapy).   Some of the above material was obtained from \\\"Natural Healing\\\" by Mark  Bricklin, Published by Rodale press, as well as notes from my human  nutrition course.  I will be posting a discussion of vitamin A  sometime in  the future, along with reference citings to point out the extremely  important role that vitamin A plays in the mucus membrane defense system in  the body and why vitamin A should be effective in dealing with candida  blooms.  Another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrate  intake during the treatment phase, this is especially important if the GI  system is involved.  If candida can not get glucose, it's not going to out  grow the bacteria and you then give bacteria, which can use amino acids and  fatty acids for energy, a chance to take over and keep the candida in check  once carbohydrate is returned to the gut.  If Steve and some of the other nay-sayers want to jump all over this post,  fine.  I jumped all over Steve in Sci. Med. Nutrition because he verbably  accosted a poster who was seeking advice about her doctor's use of vitamin  A and anti-fungals for a candida bloom in her gut.  People seeking advice  from newsnet should not be treated this way.  Those of us giving of our  time and knowledge can slug it out to our heart's content.  If you saved  your venom for me Steve and left the helpless posters who are timidly  seeking help alone, I wouldn't have a problem with your behavior.

But you've got my vote.   --I'm outta here like Vladimir --Alan\",\" On the cars mentioned - 3 series from the late 80's the \\\"electronic\\\" odometer is really a mechanical drum type odometer, that is driven by pulses from a speed sensor on the rear axle.  These pulses are  converted into mechanical pulses that turn the odometer - and speedometer. No way changing or erasing an eprom is going to change the mileage reading.  It also means the odometer is just as easy (or hard) to change as any other mechanical odometer.  On the other hand it is a bit easier to disconnect the speed sensor and run the car with no speedometer or odometer reading...a simple switch will do the job.  It also will disable the speed limiter, which will enable the car to reach it's full speed.  ;-)  \",\"  There were many injustices in the middle ages.  And this is truely sad. I would hate to see a day when churches put people to death or torchured them for practicing homosexuality, or any other crime.  The church is not called to take over the governments of the world.  It may be that homosexuals treated cruelly today, but that does not mean that we should teach  Christians to practice homosexual immorality.  Do you think that we should also teach Christians to practice divination and channelling because the witches in the middle ages were persecuted.    And you accuse me of judging?  When did you look into my heart and see if I have love.  I have been writing that we should not teach Christians to practice homosexual immorality, and you pretend to have divine knowledge to look into my heart.  I can't say that I love homosexuals as I should- I can't say that I love my neighbor as I should either.  I don't know very many homosexuals as it is.    But Jesus loves homosexuals, just as He loves everyone else.  If His love were conditional, I not know Him at all.  Yes.  We should show love to  homosexuals, but it is not love to encourage brothers in the church to  stumble and continue in their sin.  That is a very damaging and dangerous  thing.   That is slander.   I could just as easily say  that NAMBLA has been able to implement legislation to make child molesting easier because of the tearing down of societies morality due to people accepting homosexuality as normal, and that this is what you are embracing.  I do believe that homosexual sex is immoral, that does not mean I endorse using violence against them.  There is a problem of hatred in the church.  But there is also the problem of what has been called \\\"unsanctified mercy.\\\" Many in the conservative churches have seen the moral breakdown in  this country and the storm on the horizon, and have gotten militant in  the flesh.  This is truely sad.  Yet others in other churches have  embraced immorality in society, and have pointed to the carnality in the conservative churches to justify their actions.     Certainly we should not use a bullwhip to drive people from Jesus. But we shouldn't water down the gospel to draw people in.  Jesus didn't go out of His way to show only what might be considered positive aspects to draw people in.  He told one man to sell all He had.  He told another not to say good bye to His family.  His words were hard at times. We should present people with the cost of the tower before we allow them to begin construction.  many people have already been innoculated to the gospel.

If you are reading a copy of this FAQ which is more than a few   months old (see the \\\"Last-modified\\\" date above) you should probably   locate the latest edition, since the information may be outdated.    If you do not know how to get those newsgroups and/or your site does   not receive them and/or this article has already expired, you can   retrieve this FAQ from an archive site.    There exist several usenet FAQ archive sites.  To find out more about   them and how to access them, please see the \\\"Introduction to the   news.answers newsgroup\\\" posting in news.answers.

Lewis (faq%craft@uunet.uu.net) maintains the informative and   well written \\\"comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions\\\" document.   Its focus is on general X information, while this FAQ concentrates   on performance.    The comp.windows.x FAQ does address the issue of speed, but only with   regards to the X server.  The gist of that topic seems to be:  \\\"Use X11R5, it is faster than R4\\\".   (Please see the X FAQ for complete details).  --------------- Window Managers ---------------    There are a lot of window managers out there, with lots of different   features and abilities.  The choice of which to use is by necessity a   balancing act between performance and useful features.  At this   point, most respondents have agreed upon \\\"twm\\\" as the best candidate   for a speedy window manager.     A couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger,   is turning off unnecessary things like \\\"zooming\\\" and \\\"opaque move\\\".

Jeff Law   (law@schirf.cs.utah.edu) advises us that on a Sun system, X should be   compiled with gcc (version 2.*) or with the unbundled Sun compiler.   You can expect to get \\\"*very* large speedups in the server\\\" by not   using the bundled SunOS compiler.  I assume that similar results   would occur if you used one of the other high-quality commercial   compilers on the market.

This sounds crazy, but I have confirmed that it works!      Warner Losh (imp@Solbourne.COM) provided me with a good explanation of   why this works, which I have summarized here:      When you start up an X server it takes a huge amount of time to     start accepting connections.  A lot of initialization is done by     the server when it starts.  This process touches a large number of     pages.  Any other process running at the same time would fight the     server for use of the CPU, and more importantly, memory.  If you     put a sleep in there, you give the Server a chance to get itself     sorted out before the clients start up.      Similarly, there is also a lot of initialization whenever an X     client program starts: toolkits registering widgets, resources     being fetched, programs initializing state and \\\"databases\\\" and so     forth.  All this activity is typically memory intensive.  Once this     initialization is done (\\\"The process has reached a steady state\\\"),     the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages.     By using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your     .Xinitrc , you avoid them fighting each other for your     workstation's limited resources    This is most definitely a \\\"Your Mileage May Vary\\\" situation, as there   are so many variables to be considered: available RAM, local swap   space, load average, number of users on your system, which clients   you are starting, etc.    Currently in my .xinitrc I have a situation like:  (sleep 1; exec xclock ) &  (sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &  (sleep 1; exec xterm ) &  (sleep 1; exec xterm ) &    I've experimented with:  (sleep 1; exec xclock ) &  (sleep 2; exec xbiff ) &  (sleep 3; exec xterm ) &  (sleep 4; exec xterm ) &    I've even tried:  (sleep 2; exec start_X_clients_script ) &   and then in start_X_clients_script I had:  (sleep 1; exec xclock ) &  (sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &  (sleep 1; exec xterm ) &  (sleep 1; exec xterm ) &      [ The idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had     completely finished processing my .xinitrc, and had settled down     into a \\\"steady state\\\" before the sleep expired and all my clients     were launched. ]    All of these yielded fairly comparable results, and so I just stuck with   my current setup, for its simplicity.  You will probably have to   experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you.  Fonts - - -   Loading fonts takes time and RAM.  If you minimize the number of fonts   your applications use, you'll get speed increases in load-up time.    One simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts (one small, one   large, one roman, whatever suits you) and configure all your clients -- or   at least all your heavily used clients -- to use only those few fonts.   Client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded   into the server.  This will also conserve server resources, since fewer   fonts will be loaded by the server.          [ Farrell McKay (fbm@ptcburp.ptcbu.oz.au),            Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) ]    eg: My main xterm font is 7x13, so I also have twm set up to use 7x13   in all it's menus and icons etc.  Twm's default font is 8x13.  Since   I don't normally use 8x13, I've eliminated one font from my server.    Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com):     Keep fonts local to the workstation, rather than loading them over nfs.     If you will make extensive use of R5 scalable fonts, use a font server.  About the Resources File - - - - - - - - - - - - -      Keep your .Xresources / .Xdefaults file small.  Saves RAM and saves     on server startup time.          Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)    One suggestion:      In your .Xdefaults (.Xresources) file, try putting only the minimum     number of resources that you want to have available to all of your     applications.  For example:  *reverseVideo: true      Then, separate your resources into individual client-specific     resource files.  For example: $HOME/lib/app-defaults.  In your     .login file set the environment variable XUSERFILESEARCHPATH:   setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH $HOME/lib/app-defaults/%N      [ The \\\"comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions\\\" FAQ contains     an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work.     --ed.]      So, when xterm launches, it loads its resources from     .../app-defaults/XTerm.  Xdvi finds them in .../app-defaults/XDvi,     and so on and so forth.  Note that not all clients follow the same     XXxxx resource-file naming pattern.  You can check in your system     app-defaults directory (often: /usr/X11R5/lib/X11/app-defaults/) to     find the proper name, and then name your personal resource files     with the same name.      This is all documented in the Xt Specification (pg 125 & 666).       [Thanks to: Kevin Samborn (samborn@mtkgc.com),            Michael Urban (urban@cobra.jpl.nasa.gov),                and Mike Long (mikel@ee.cornell.edu).       Kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers.]    This method of organizing your personal resources has the following   benefits:      - Easier to maintain / more usable.      - Fewer resources are stored in the X server in the RESOURCE_MANAGER       property.  As a side benefit your server may start fractionally       quicker, since it doesn`t have to load all your resources.      - Applications only process their own resources, never have to sort        through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them.    It also has drawbacks:      - the application that you are interested in has to load an       additional file every time it starts up.  This doesn't seem to       make that much of a performance difference, and you might       consider this a huge boon to usability.  If you are modifying an       application's resource database, you just need to re-run the       application without having to \\\"xrdb\\\" again.      - xrdb will by default run your .Xdefaults file through cpp.  When       your resources are split out into multiple resource files and       then loaded by the individual client programs, they will not.       WATCH OUT FOR THIS!!        I had C style comments in my .Xdefaults file, which cpp stripped       out.  When I switched to this method of distributed resource       files I spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why       my clients were not finding their resources.  Xt did *NOT*       provide any error message when it encountered the C style       comments in the resource files, it simply, silently, aborted       processing the resource file.        The loss of preprocessing (which can be very handy, e.g. ``#ifdef       COLOR'' ...) is enough to cause some people to dismiss this       method of resource management.      - You may also run into some clients which break the rules.  For       example, neither Emacs (18.58.3) nor Xvt (1.0) will find their       resources if they are anywhere other than in .Xdefaults.      - when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files       with the machine where your resources are stored, your client       will not find its resources.  Loading all your resources into the       server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find       their resources.            Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov)    A possible compromise suggestion that I have (and am planning on trying)   is to put resources for all my heavily used clients (eg: xterm) into my   .Xdefaults file, and to use the \\\"separate resources files\\\" method for   clients that I seldom use.  Define Your Display Properly - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -    Client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server.  In   that situation, rather than setting your DISPLAY environment variable to    \\\"<hostname>:0.0\\\", where <hostname> is the name of your workstation, you   should set your DISPLAY variable to \\\"unix:0.0\\\" or \\\":0.0\\\".  By doing this   you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same   machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests.    [thanks to Patrick J Horgan (pjh70@ras.amdahl.com)]    See the _DISPLAY NAMES_ section of the X(1) man page for further   explanation of how to properly set your display name.    \\\"I don't think it's stock MIT, but (at least) Data General and HP have   libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when   the DISPLAY isn't set specially.\\\"          Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET)    [Jody Goldberg (jody@algorithmics.com) sent me an Xlib patch to change   stock R5 to use local communication even if DISPLAY is not properly set.   I don't want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle   non-MIT patches and so have elected not to include it here.  Hopefully MIT   will apply this minor (~8 lines) patch themselves.  In the meantime, if   you want to try it yourself, email Jody.  --ed.]  ------- Clients -------    If you only have a few megabytes of Ram then you should think   carefully about the number of programs you are running.  Think also   about the _kind_ of programs you are running.  For example:  Is there   a smaller clock program than xclock?    Unfortunately, I haven't really noticed that programs advertise how large   they are, so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word.    [ Suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients   (eg: Xclock, Xterm, Xbiff) are welcome.  --ed.]    I've received some contradictory advice from people, on the subject   of X client programs.  Some advocate the use of programs that are   strictly Xlib based, since Xt, Xaw and other toolkits are rather   large.  Others warn us that other applications which you are using   may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries.  In   this case, using a non-Xt (for example) client program may actually   _increase_ the amount of RAM consumed.    The upshot of all this seems to be: Don't mix toolkits.  That is, try   and use just Athena clients, or just Xview clients (or just Motif   clients, etc).  If you use more than one, then you're dragging in   more than one toolkit library.    Know your environment, and think carefully about which client   programs would work best together in that environment.

I suspect that   xterm is one of the most used clients at many, if not most sites.   Laziness?  Isn't there a better terminal emulator available?  See below.    If you must use xterm, you can try reducing the number of saveLines   to reduce memory usage.  [ Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com),      Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk) ]  1) Xvt    suggested by: Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) :    available: export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib/xvt-1.0.tar.Z     \\\"...if you don't need all the esoteric features of xterm, then get    hold of xvt ...  it was written here just to save swap space as    xterm is rather a hog! \\\"     This was written as a partial 'clone' of xterm.  You don't have to    rename your resources, as xvt pretends to be XTerm.  In it's current    version, you cannot bind keys as you can in xterm.  I've heard that    there are versions of xvt with this feature, but I've not found any    yet.     UPDATE (March 1993):  I recently had a few email conversations with    Brian Warkentin (brian.warkentine@eng.sun.com) regarding xvt.  He    questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm.  For    instance, xvt may initialize slightly faster, but compare scrolling    speed (try this quickie benchmark: /bin/time dd if=/etc/termcap    bs=40) and see which program can scroll faster.  Also, while xterm    may be slightly larger in RAM requirements (We don't have any hard    numbers here, does anyone else?) shared libraries and shared text    segments mean that xterm's paging requirements are not that major.     As an experiment, he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm, but it    made little difference, since if you never use it, it never gets    brought into memory.     So here we stand with some conflicting reports on the validity of    xvt over xterm.  In summary?  Caveat Emptor, your mileage may vary.    If you can provide some hard data, I'd like to see it.

From Scott Barman (scott@asd.com) comes a suggestion regarding Motif   Text Field Widgets:      I noticed that during data entry into Motif text field widgets, I     was getting a slight lag in response to some keystrokes,     particularly the initial one in the field.  Examining the what was     going on with xscope I found it.  It seems that when the resource     XmNblinkRate is non-zero and the focus is on a text field widget     (or even just a text widget) the I-beam cursor will blink.     Every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets, the     widget code is making a request to the server (CopyArea).  The user     can stop this by setting the resource XmNblinkRate to 0.  It is not     noticeable on a 40MHz SPARC, but it does make a little difference     on a [slower system].    This specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots   of areas.  Consider your heavily used clients, are there any minor   embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on Server   requests?  ------------------------- Miscellaneous Suggestions -------------------------  Pretty Pictures - - - - - - - -   Don't use large bitmaps (GIF's, etc) as root window backgrounds.    - The more complicated your root window bitmap, the slower the server     is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows (or redraw, etc)    - These take up RAM, and CPU power.  I work on a Sun SPARC and I'm     conscious of performance issues, I can't comprehend it when I see     people with a 4mb Sun 3/60 running xphoon as their root window.      I'll let someone else figure out how much RAM would be occupied by     having a full screen root image on a colour workstation.    - If you're anything like me, you need all the screen real estate     that you can get for clients, and so rarely see the root window anyway.          [ Thanks to Qiang Alex Zhao (azhao@cs.arizona.edu)     for reminding me of this one. --ed.]  A Quicker Mouse - - - - - - - -   Using xset, you can adjust how fast your pointer moves on the screen   when you move your mouse.  I use \\\"xset m 3 10\\\" in my .xinitrc file,   which lets me send my pointer across the screen with just a flick of   the wrist.  See the xset man page for further ideas and information.    Hint: sometimes you may want to *slow down* your mouse tracking for   fine work.  To cover my options, I have placed a number of different   mouse setting commands into a menu in my window manager.      e.g. (for twm) :       menu \\\"mouse settings\\\" {         \\\"Mouse Settings:\\\"   f.title  \\\"  Very Fast\\\"    ! \\\"xset m 7 10 &\\\"  \\\"  Normal (Fast)\\\"   ! \\\"xset m 3 10 &\\\"  \\\"  System Default (Un-Accelerated)\\\" ! \\\"xset m default &\\\"  \\\"  Glacial\\\"    ! \\\"xset m 0 10 &\\\"       }  Programming Thoughts - - - - - - - - - - -   Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :     To speed up applications that you're developing, there are tons of     things you can do.  Some that stick out:      - For Motif programs, don't set XmFontList resources for individual       buttons, labels, lists, et. al.; use the defaultFontList or       labelFontList or whatever resource of the highest-level manager       widget.  Again, stick to as few fonts as possible.      - Better yet, don't use Motif at all.  It's an absolute pig.      - Don't create and destroy widgets on the fly.  Try to reuse them.       (This will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits, too.)      - Use a line width of 0 in GCs.  On some servers this makes a HUGE       difference.      - Compress and collapse multiple Expose events.  This can make the       difference between a fast application and a completely unusable       one.    Francois Staes (frans@kiwi.uia.ac.be) :     Just a small remark: I once heard that using a better malloc     function would greatly increase performance of Xt based     applications since they use malloc heavily. They suggested trying     out the GNUY malloc, but I didn't find the time yet. I did some     tests on small programs just doing malloc and free, and the     differences were indeed very noticeable ( somewhat 5 times faster)    [ Any confirmation on this from anyone?  --ed.]    Andre' Beck (Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de) :    - Unnecessary NoExpose Events.      Most people use XCopyArea/XCopyPlane as fastest blit routines, but     they forget to reset graphics_exposures in the GC used for the     blits. This will cause a NoExpose Event every blit, that, in most     cases, only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to     run through it's event-loop again and again.    - Thousands of XChangeGC requests.      This \\\"Gfx Context Switching\\\" is also seen in most handcoded X-Apps,     where only one or few GCs are created and then heavily changed     again and again.  Xt uses a definitely better mechanism, by caching     and sharing a lot of GCs with all needed parameters. This will     remove the load of subsequent XChangeGC requests from the     connection (by moving it toward the client startup phase).  Say What!? - - - - - -    Some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first:    David B. Lewis (by day: dbl@osf.org, by night: david%craft@uunet.uu.net) :     How about this: swap displays with someone else. Run all your programs     on the other machine and display locally; the other user runs off your     machine onto the other display. Goal: reduce context switches in the     same operation between client and server.    I'm not in a situation where I can easily try this, but I have received   the following confirmation...    Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se):     I regularly run programs on other machines and I notice a big     difference. I try to run on a machine where I will reduce net usage     and usually with nice to reduce the impact of my intrusion. This     helps a lot on my poor little SS1+ with only 16 MB, it was     essential when I only had 8 MB.    Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov) :     [The X11 Server and the client are] competing for the same CPU as     your server when you run it on the same machine.  Not really a     major problem, except that the X11 client and the server are in     absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing.    Timothy H Panton (thp@westhawk.uucp) :     Firstly it relies on the fact that most CPU's are mostly idle, X's     cpu usage is bursty.  so the chances of you and your teammate     doing something cpu-intensive at the same time is small. If they     are not then you get twice the cpu+memory available for your     action.      The second factor is that context switches are expensive, using 2     cpu's halves them, you pay a price due to the overhead of going     over the network, but this is offset in most cases by the improved     buffering of a network (typically 20k vs 4k for a pipe), allowing     even fewer context switches.  ---------------------------- Other Sources of Information ----------------------------    Volume 8 in O'Reilly's X Window System Series, ``X Window System   Administrator's Guide'' is a book all X administrator's should read.

He works hard, for sure, but is no better than average on defense, and is prone to costly penalties and defensive lapses at times, while being basically an offensive zero (0 goal and 7 assists in 79 games).  He would be hardpressed to make the team next year.  #3 DAVID WILLIAMS  Season: 2nd Acquired: '91-92, free agent from New Jersey Grade:  C/C-  IMO, Williams was the most valuable defenseman for the Sharks in '91-92, playing a combination of good offense (3 goals and 25 assists in 56 games) and good defense.  But he, playing the first part of this season in Kansas City, was good neither offensively nor defensively this year; it, then, appears that '91-92 was a fluke.  Although he improved towards the end of the season, he was prone to being out of position defensively, and did not demonstrate the playmaking skills that made him the team's leading scorer among defensemen last year.  He would also be hardpressed to make the team next year.  #4 JAYSON MORE  Season: 2nd Acquired: '91-92, from Montreal in expansion draft Grade:  B+  After being touted as the team's top defensive prospects in training camp before '91-92, More had a rather disappointing '91-92, as he was not particularly good defensively, and had just 17 points in 46 games.  He, then, proceeded to improve his game massively this season, becoming the team's most reliable defenseman, whom the team can count on night in and night out to play steady defense and providing occasional (but only occasional) offensive flash. Offensively, he was even more disappointing than last year (11 points in 73 games), but his defense improved tremendously.  He is probably best as the defensive part of a defense combination with an offensive defenseman.  #5 NEIL WILKINSON  Season: 4th Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  B-  Wilkinson was probably the team's top defensive defenseman in '91-92.  However, partially because of injuries, he was not the same this year, as he missed 25 games total due to nagging knee and back injuries, and seemed to be slowed even when playing.  He, then, had often to be saved by his defensive partners; that is, if they are there at all.  But he also had some solid games, and if he can be complete healthy, he can still be a force.  #6 SANDIS OZOLINSH  Season: 1st Acquired: '91-92, 2nd round pick in entry draft Grade:  I (A)  At the time of his injury (December 30, against the Philadelphia Flyers), Ozolinsh was well on track to be, IMO, the team's MVP.  A serious knee injury in that game, though, forced him to miss the rest of the season (47 games), but he still finished as the team's top scorer among defensemen (23 points), which, of course, tells more about the lack of offense the Sharks had from their defensemen, but it also tells of Ozolinsh's abilities.  At the time, he was playing very good defense along with excellent offense; he was still susceptible to so-called \\\"rookie mistakes,\\\" but was probably the defenseman who made the least of them on the team, rookie or veteran.  If he can come back from his injuries, he is ready to be a star.  #19 DOUG ZMOLEK  Season: 1st Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  B  Zmolek had basically a solid and durable year, being one of the only two Sharks to play in all 84 games of the season.  He was solid on defense, but after being billed as an offensive defenseman, he didn't show it (15 points). He was also prone to penalties, and his 229 penalty minutes was second on the team; however, that was also an indication that he was fearly when facing tough physical opponents, and he was at his best when playing physically.  But to become a fixture in this league, he needs to improve both offensively and defensively, and cut down on the number of power-plays he gives to opponents.\",\" Doug> NNTP-Posting-Host: se05.wg2.waii.com   Doug> ..continuing on my build problems, I got stuck here build xterm...

Watch them in the offensive zone, especially on the powerplay.  Damphousse or Lebeau will skate all over the bloody zone, maybe pass to the point, get it back, skate some more, pass it around....BUT WHERE'S THE SHOT??! Answer: the shot is totally useless because they lack a forward who stands in front of the net a la` Neely, Shanahan, Tocchet, etc etc.  Too bad  Demers won't put Dipietro or LeClair on the powerplay more often.  Dammit, even Ewen would at least cause some disruptions.  Montreal desperately needs a power forward with some talent, IMO.  Then watch them in their own zone. Patrick Roy is screened on everything. Say what you want about his performance; IMNSHO he cannot stop what he cannot see.  And Montreal's defence does a miserable job of clearing the front of the net.  Last night against Washington Roy played a *great* game.  The first goal came on the most ridiculous goalmouth scramble I've seen in a long time, and he didn't have a hope in hell of stopping the shot.  The second goal came on a deflection of a shot he only partially saw anyway.  Pathetic defence.  The third goal was EN.

Sounds like it would have a *huge* drag area, not a lot of mass, and be in a fairly low orbit.   2) Just what orbital parameters are we talking about here? What real impact are we talking about, really?  How many optical astronomers are *really* going to be impacted?   3) Which is more important; adding a few extra days of 'seeing' for (very few) optical astronomers or getting the data the sensors are supposed to return along with the data for large inflatables (and the potential there for an inflatable space station)? The choice would seem to be one or the other, since the advertising is being used to help fund this thing.   4) If your answer to 3) above was \\\"the astronomers\\\", then feel free to come up with some other way to fund the (to my mind) more important research data that would be gained by this WITHOUT SPENDING ANY MORE OF MY MONEY TO DO IT.

This is possible because it's the same theory used by most color scanners.  I am not looking for the obv ious solution which is to buy a color scanner but what I do need is those equat ions becasue I am starting to write software which will automate the conversion  process.  I would really appreciate it if someone would repost the 3 equations /3 unknowns.

It's somewhat ironic that our exposure to bigotry happens in this instance to have originated in rec.scouting, since I always understood scouting to teach tolerance and diversity.  I understand bigotry to be irrational prejudice against other people who happen to be of a different race, religion, ethnic background, sex, or other inconsequential characteristics.  All the evidence I've seen indicates that sexual orientation and lack of belief in gods are exactly such inconsequential characteristics.  Thus, pending further evidence, I conclude that those who show prejudice against such people are bigots, and organizations that exclude such people are discriminatory.\",\" Hmmmmm you know this happened to me also.

There is no Yzerman-Fedorov-Probert line, except for maybe on a powerplay.  These three players usually play on three different lines. Which would mean that Toronto's checking line would have to pull a triple shift. The Wings' lines usually look like this:                         Gallant-Yzerman-Ciccarelli                         Kozlov-Fedorov-Drake                         Kennedy-Burr-Probert                         Ysebaert-Primeau-Sheppard   Oh by the way:  Start praying! : )\",\" And in other parts of the world, European \\\"Socialists\\\" would be known as fascist capitalist pigs.

That seriously underrepresents the harm he has done in the field.  Owen will cleanly play any ball he reaches.  He will have a fine fielding percentage, like always.  The problem is that he doesn't reach anything that isn't hit straight at him!  This wouldn't be quite as obvious a problem if he were playing next to Kelly Gruber or Robin Ventura.  But the third baseman for the Yankees is Wade Boggs (who should have moved across the diamond *last* year)!

Second, I disagree with the Pen's weak spot being defense and goaltending - for a couple of reasons.  Barrasso has had a spectacular year - no slow start, consistently sharp, GAA < 3.0, and  leads the league in wins.  Tommy deserves the Vezina.  Given the lack of  respect he commands, though, I doubt he will win it.  The other reason  concerns the Pens' team defense.  They are hovering around 3rd or 4th in the fewest goals allowed.  That is a big improvement for them, and it indicates that they are playing better team defense.   We'll see.  It'll be fun.\",\"------------------------------------------------------------------------- One reason that the WHA abandoned the blue puck was the fact that it crumbled very quickly during play.

When we die we are released from the arc of time, and able to comprehend our lives in toto.  To visit each moment in time sequentially or all at once, but not able to alter the actions thoughts or feelings we had/have/will have in this  life.  From that perspective, I posit that all will have direct knowledge of God, and be able to recognize at each moment of time wether we were doing what we ought.  That the experience of having lived a life far from God will be an eternal torment.  That  having lived a life of grace, will be an eternal joy.  That the  resurrection of the body comes not from any physical reconstitution of our present forms, but knowledge of our present forms by our fully cognizant souls.

Christian people have caused \\\"objective morality\\\" to look very \\\"relative.\\\"  After all, that was the point of the original question in this thread, i.e. can we toss out Christianity because it is so obviously inconsistent with its own principles?  If you will bear with me, I will attempt to explain this apparent inconsistency from at least one Christian's viewpoint:  If God exists and is the creator of mankind as the Bible claims, then He has a pretty well-defined concept of what makes people tick physically, emotionally, etc.  GOD has an \\\"objective\\\" morality for us. That is to say, He has no trouble understanding what is good for (or detrimental to) the creature He created.    Galatians 2:10-- For we [mankind] are His workmanship, created in  Christ Jesus for good works [a morality], which God prepared  beforehand [a well-defined design], that we might walk in them.  However, contrary to what many people assume (including the Pharasees of the Bible,) God's morality cannot be completely codified in a list of rules and regulations.  To some extent, every activity of a person's life creates a new situation to which morality must be applied.  There never could be enough volumes to codify God's \\\"objective\\\" morality for us.   Throughout history, mankind has tried to reduce morality to a list of rules (objectivity, if you please.)  In the Old Testament, we have both principles and specific rules.  By the time of Jesus, most of the principles were obscured by the emphasis men had placed on the rules. Volumes of additional rules had been made to try to codify the application of the principles.  We [mankind] weren't comfortable with the \\\"subjectivity\\\" of principles.    For reference see Matthew 5 where Jesus explains the difference  between the Law and the principles of the Law.  For example, in  verses 21-22:  \\\"You have heard that the ancients were told,  'You shall not commit murder'...and 'Whoever commits murder shall  be liable to the court.'  But I say to you that everyone who is  angry with his brother shall be liable to the court...\\\"  The \\\"objective morality\\\" of God gets blurred by our inept interpretation of it.  We [Christians] have made our biggest errors when we have allowed any one person or group of people decide EXACTLY what God intended for us.  If we [Christians] would stay committed to seeking God's will instead of trying to prove we already had it all figured out, we might do a better job of allowing others to find God's \\\"objective morality\\\" for themselves.

Matthew     Wiener (weemba@libra.wistar.upenn.edu) contributed the section on     Voyager, and the section on Sakigake was obtained from ISAS material     posted by Yoshiro Yamada (yamada@yscvax.ysc.go.jp).  US PLANETARY MISSIONS       MARINER (VENUS, MARS, & MERCURY FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)      MARINER 1, the first U.S. attempt to send a spacecraft to Venus, failed     minutes after launch in 1962. The guidance instructions from the ground     stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with its antenna, so the     onboard computer took control. However, there turned out to be a bug in     the guidance software, and the rocket promptly went off course, so the     Range Safety Officer destroyed it. Although the bug is sometimes claimed     to have been an incorrect FORTRAN DO statement, it was actually a     transcription error in which the bar (indicating smoothing) was omitted     from the expression \\\"R-dot-bar sub n\\\" (nth smoothed value of derivative     of radius). This error led the software to treat normal minor variations     of velocity as if they were serious, leading to incorrect compensation.      MARINER 2 became the first successful probe to flyby Venus in December     of 1962, and it returned information which confirmed that Venus is a     very hot (800 degrees Fahrenheit, now revised to 900 degrees F.) world     with a cloud-covered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide     (sulfuric acid was later confirmed in 1978).      MARINER 3, launched on November 5, 1964, was lost when its protective     shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary     space. Unable to collect the Sun's energy for power from its solar     panels, the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in     solar orbit. It was intended for a Mars flyby with MARINER 4.      MARINER 4, the sister probe to MARINER 3, did reach Mars in 1965 and     took the first close-up images of the Martian surface (22 in all) as it     flew by the planet. The probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere     much thinner than previously thought. Many scientists concluded from     this preliminary scan that Mars was a \\\"dead\\\" world in both the     geological and biological sense.      MARINER 5 was sent to Venus in 1967. It reconfirmed the data on that     planet collected five years earlier by MARINER 2, plus the information     that Venus' atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least 90 times     that of Earth's, or the equivalent of being 3,300 feet under the surface     of an ocean.      MARINER 6 and 7 were sent to Mars in 1969 and expanded upon the work     done by MARINER 4 four years earlier. However, they failed to take away     the concept of Mars as a \\\"dead\\\" planet, first made from the basic     measurements of MARINER 4.      MARINER 8 ended up in the Atlantic Ocean in 1971 when the rocket     launcher autopilot failed.      MARINER 9, the sister probe to MARINER 8, became the first craft to     orbit Mars in 1971. It returned information on the Red Planet that no     other probe had done before, revealing huge volcanoes on the Martian     surface, as well as giant canyon systems, and evidence that water once     flowed across the planet. The probe also took the first detailed closeup     images of Mars' two small moons, Phobos and Deimos.      MARINER 10 used Venus as a gravity assist to Mercury in 1974. The probe     did return the first close-up images of the Venusian atmosphere in     ultraviolet, revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover,     plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four     Earth days. MARINER 10 eventually made three flybys of Mercury from 1974     to 1975 before running out of attitude control gas. The probe revealed     Mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than     thought. This would seem to indicate that Mercury has an iron core which     makes up 75 percent of the entire planet.       PIONEER (MOON, SUN, VENUS, JUPITER, and SATURN FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)      PIONEER 1 through 3 failed to meet their main objective - to photograph     the Moon close-up - but they did reach far enough into space to provide     new information on the area between Earth and the Moon, including new     data on the Van Allen radiation belts circling Earth. All three craft     had failures with their rocket launchers. PIONEER 1 was launched on     October 11, 1958, PIONEER 2 on November 8, and PIONEER 3 on December 6.      PIONEER 4 was a Moon probe which missed the Moon and became the first     U.S. spacecraft to orbit the Sun in 1959. PIONEER 5 was originally     designed to flyby Venus, but the mission was scaled down and it instead     studied the interplanetary environment between Venus and Earth out to     36.2 million kilometers in 1960, a record until MARINER 2. PIONEER 6     through 9 were placed into solar orbit from 1965 to 1968: PIONEER 6, 7,     and 8 are still transmitting information at this time. PIONEER E (would     have been number 10) suffered a launch failure in 1969.      PIONEER 10 became the first spacecraft to flyby Jupiter in 1973. PIONEER     11 followed it in 1974, and then went on to become the first probe to     study Saturn in 1979. Both vehicles should continue to function through     1995 and are heading off into interstellar space, the first craft ever     to do so.      PIONEER Venus 1 (1978) (also known as PIONEER Venus Orbiter, or PIONEER     12) burned up in the Venusian atmosphere on October 8, 1992. PVO made     the first radar studies of the planet's surface via probe. PIONEER Venus     2 (also known as PIONEER 13) sent four small probes into the atmosphere     in December of 1978. The main spacecraft bus burned up high in the     atmosphere, while the four probes descended by parachute towards the     surface. Though none were expected to survive to the surface, the Day     probe did make it and transmitted for 67.5 minutes on the ground before     its batteries failed.       RANGER (LUNAR LANDER AND IMPACT MISSIONS)      RANGER 1 and 2 were test probes for the RANGER lunar impact series. They     were meant for high Earth orbit testing in 1961, but rocket problems     left them in useless low orbits which quickly decayed.      RANGER 3, launched on January 26, 1962, was intended to land an     instrument capsule on the surface of the Moon, but problems during the     launch caused the probe to miss the Moon and head into solar orbit.     RANGER 3 did try to take some images of the Moon as it flew by, but the     camera was unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt.      RANGER 4, launched April 23, 1962, had the same purpose as RANGER 3, but     suffered technical problems enroute and crashed on the lunar farside,     the first U.S. probe to reach the Moon, albeit without returning data.      RANGER 5, launched October 18, 1962 and similar to RANGER 3 and 4, lost     all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the Moon     and drifted off into solar orbit.      RANGER 6 through 9 had more modified lunar missions: They were to send     back live images of the lunar surface as they headed towards an impact     with the Moon. RANGER 6 failed this objective in 1964 when its cameras     did not operate. RANGER 7 through 9 performed well, becoming the first     U.S. lunar probes to return thousands of lunar images through 1965.       LUNAR ORBITER (LUNAR SURFACE PHOTOGRAPHY)      LUNAR ORBITER 1 through 5 were designed to orbit the Moon and image     various sites being studied as landing areas for the manned APOLLO     missions of 1969-1972. The probes also contributed greatly to our     understanding of lunar surface features, particularly the lunar farside.     All five probes of the series, launched from 1966 to 1967, were     essentially successful in their missions. They were the first U.S.     probes to orbit the Moon. All LOs were eventually crashed into the lunar     surface to avoid interference with the manned APOLLO missions.       SURVEYOR (LUNAR SOFT LANDERS)      The SURVEYOR series were designed primarily to see if an APOLLO lunar     module could land on the surface of the Moon without sinking into the     soil (before this time, it was feared by some that the Moon was covered     in great layers of dust, which would not support a heavy landing     vehicle). SURVEYOR was successful in proving that the lunar surface was     strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from 1966 to 1968.      Only SURVEYOR 2 and 4 were unsuccessful missions. The rest became the     first U.S. probes to soft land on the Moon, taking thousands of images     and scooping the soil for analysis. APOLLO 12 landed 600 feet from     SURVEYOR 3 in 1969 and returned parts of the craft to Earth. SURVEYOR 7,     the last of the series, was a purely scientific mission which explored     the Tycho crater region in 1968.       VIKING (MARS ORBITERS AND LANDERS)      VIKING 1 was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on August 20, 1975 on     a TITAN 3E-CENTAUR D1 rocket. The probe went into Martian orbit on June     19, 1976, and the lander set down on the western slopes of Chryse     Planitia on July 20, 1976. It soon began its programmed search for     Martian micro-organisms (there is still debate as to whether the probes     found life there or not), and sent back incredible color panoramas of     its surroundings. One thing scientists learned was that Mars' sky was     pinkish in color, not dark blue as they originally thought (the sky is     pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the     thin atmosphere). The lander set down among a field of red sand and     boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image.      The VIKING 1 orbiter kept functioning until August 7, 1980, when it ran     out of attitude-control propellant. The lander was switched into a     weather-reporting mode, where it had been hoped it would keep     functioning through 1994; but after November 13, 1982, an errant command     had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until     further orders. Communication was never regained again, despite the     engineers' efforts through May of 1983.      An interesting side note: VIKING 1's lander has been designated the     Thomas A. Mutch Memorial Station in honor of the late leader of the     lander imaging team. The National Air and Space Museum in Washington,     D.C. is entrusted with the safekeeping of the Mutch Station Plaque until     it can be attached to the lander by a manned expedition.      VIKING 2 was launched on September 9, 1975, and arrived in Martian orbit     on August 7, 1976. The lander touched down on September 3, 1976 in     Utopia Planitia. It accomplished essentially the same tasks as its     sister lander, with the exception that its seisometer worked, recording     one marsquake. The orbiter had a series of attitude-control gas leaks in     1978, which prompted it being shut down that July. The lander was shut     down on April 12, 1980.      The orbits of both VIKING orbiters should decay around 2025.       VOYAGER (OUTER PLANET FLYBYS)      VOYAGER 1 was launched September 5, 1977, and flew past Jupiter on March     5, 1979 and by Saturn on November 13, 1980. VOYAGER 2 was launched     August 20, 1977 (before VOYAGER 1), and flew by Jupiter on August 7,     1979, by Saturn on August 26, 1981, by Uranus on January 24, 1986, and     by Neptune on August 8, 1989. VOYAGER 2 took advantage of a rare     once-every-189-years alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to     outer planet. VOYAGER 1 could, in principle, have headed towards Pluto,     but JPL opted for the sure thing of a Titan close up.      Between the two probes, our knowledge of the 4 giant planets, their     satellites, and their rings has become immense. VOYAGER 1&2 discovered     that Jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics, lightning and     aurorae. Three new satellites were discovered. Two of the major     surprises were that Jupiter has rings and that Io has active sulfurous     volcanoes, with major effects on the Jovian magnetosphere.      When the two probes reached Saturn, they discovered over 1000 ringlets     and 7 satellites, including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep     the rings stable. The weather was tame compared with Jupiter: massive     jet streams with minimal variance (a 33-year great white spot/band cycle     is known). Titan's atmosphere was smoggy. Mimas' appearance was     startling: one massive impact crater gave it the Death Star appearance.     The big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings. Braids,     kinks, and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain.      VOYAGER 2, thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts,     continued the mission to Uranus and Neptune. Uranus itself was highly     monochromatic in appearance. One oddity was that its magnetic axis was     found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational     axis, giving Uranus a peculiar magnetosphere. Icy channels were found on     Ariel, and Miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains. 10     satellites and one more ring were discovered.      In contrast to Uranus, Neptune was found to have rather active weather,     including numerous cloud features. The ring arcs turned out to be bright     patches on one ring. Two other rings, and 6 other satellites, were     discovered. Neptune's magnetic axis was also skewed. Triton had a     canteloupe appearance and geysers. (What's liquid at 38K?)      The two VOYAGERs are expected to last for about two more decades. Their     on-target journeying gives negative evidence about possible planets     beyond Pluto. Their next major scientific discovery should be the     location of the heliopause.   SOVIET PLANETARY MISSIONS      Since there have been so many Soviet probes to the Moon, Venus, and     Mars, I will highlight only the primary missions:       SOVIET LUNAR PROBES      LUNA 1 - Lunar impact attempt in 1959, missed Moon and became first       craft in solar orbit.     LUNA 2 - First craft to impact on lunar surface in 1959.     LUNA 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1959.     ZOND 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1965 since LUNA 3. Was       also a test for future Mars missions.     LUNA 9 - First probe to soft land on the Moon in 1966, returned images       from surface.     LUNA 10 - First probe to orbit the Moon in 1966.     LUNA 13 - Second successful Soviet lunar soft landing mission in 1966.     ZOND 5 - First successful circumlunar craft. ZOND 6 through 8       accomplished similar missions through 1970. The probes were       unmanned tests of a manned orbiting SOYUZ-type lunar vehicle.     LUNA 16 - First probe to land on Moon and return samples of lunar soil        to Earth in 1970. LUNA 20 accomplished similar mission in        1972.     LUNA 17 - Delivered the first unmanned lunar rover to the Moon's        surface, LUNOKHOD 1, in 1970. A similar feat was accomplished        with LUNA 21/LUNOKHOD 2 in 1973.     LUNA 24 - Last Soviet lunar mission to date. Returned soil samples in        1976.       SOVIET VENUS PROBES      VENERA 1 - First acknowledged attempt at Venus mission. Transmissions         lost enroute in 1961.     VENERA 2 - Attempt to image Venus during flyby mission in tandem with         VENERA 3. Probe ceased transmitting just before encounter in         February of 1966. No images were returned.     VENERA 3 - Attempt to place a lander capsule on Venusian surface.         Transmissions ceased just before encounter and entire probe         became the first craft to impact on another planet in 1966.     VENERA 4 - First probe to successfully return data while descending         through Venusian atmosphere. Crushed by air pressure before         reaching surface in 1967. VENERA 5 and 6 mission profiles         similar in 1969.     VENERA 7 - First probe to return data from the surface of another planet         in 1970. VENERA 8 accomplished a more detailed mission in         1972.     VENERA 9 - Sent first image of Venusian surface in 1975. Was also the         first probe to orbit Venus. VENERA 10 accomplished similar         mission.     VENERA 13 - Returned first color images of Venusian surface in 1982.   VENERA 14 accomplished similar mission.     VENERA 15 - Accomplished radar mapping with VENERA 16 of sections of   planet's surface in 1983 more detailed than PVO.     VEGA 1 - Accomplished with VEGA 2 first balloon probes of Venusian       atmosphere in 1985, including two landers. Flyby buses went on       to become first spacecraft to study Comet Halley close-up in       March of 1986.       SOVIET MARS PROBES      MARS 1 - First acknowledged Mars probe in 1962. Transmissions ceased       enroute the following year.     ZOND 2 - First possible attempt to place a lander capsule on Martian       surface. Probe signals ceased enroute in 1965.     MARS 2 - First Soviet Mars probe to land - albeit crash - on Martian       surface. Orbiter section first Soviet probe to circle the Red       Planet in 1971.     MARS 3 - First successful soft landing on Martian surface, but lander       signals ceased after 90 seconds in 1971.     MARS 4 - Attempt at orbiting Mars in 1974, braking rockets failed to       fire, probe went on into solar orbit.     MARS 5 - First fully successful Soviet Mars mission, orbiting Mars in       1974. Returned images of Martian surface comparable to U.S.       probe MARINER 9.     MARS 6 - Landing attempt in 1974. Lander crashed into the surface.     MARS 7 - Lander missed Mars completely in 1974, went into a solar orbit       with its flyby bus.     PHOBOS 1 - First attempt to land probes on surface of Mars' largest         moon, Phobos. Probe failed enroute in 1988 due to         human/computer error.     PHOBOS 2 - Attempt to land probes on Martian moon Phobos. The probe did         enter Mars orbit in early 1989, but signals ceased one week         before scheduled Phobos landing.      While there has been talk of Soviet Jupiter, Saturn, and even     interstellar probes within the next thirty years, no major steps have     yet been taken with these projects. More intensive studies of the Moon,     Mars, Venus, and various comets have been planned for the 1990s, and a     Mercury mission to orbit and land probes on the tiny world has been     planned for 2003. How the many changes in the former Soviet Union (now     the Commonwealth of Independent States) will affect the future of their     space program remains to be seen.   JAPANESE PLANETARY MISSIONS      SAKIGAKE (MS-T5) was launched from the Kagoshima Space Center by ISAS on     January 8 1985, and approached Halley's Comet within about 7 million km     on March 11, 1986. The spacecraft is carrying three instru- ments to     measure interplanetary magnetic field/plasma waves/solar wind, all of     which work normally now, so ISAS made an Earth swingby by Sakigake on     January 8, 1992 into an orbit similar to the earth's. The closest     approach was at 23h08m47s (JST=UTC+9h) on January 8, 1992. The     geocentric distance was 88,997 km. This is the first planet-swingby for     a Japanese spacecraft.      During the approach, Sakigake observed the geotail. Some geotail     passages will be scheduled in some years hence. The second Earth-swingby     will be on June 14, 1993 (at 40 Re (Earth's radius)), and the third     October 28, 1994 (at 86 Re).       HITEN, a small lunar probe, was launched into Earth orbit on January 24,     1990. The spacecraft was then known as MUSES-A, but was renamed to Hiten     once in orbit. The 430 lb probe looped out from Earth and made its first     lunary flyby on March 19, where it dropped off its 26 lb midget     satellite, HAGOROMO. Japan at this point became the third nation to     orbit a satellite around the Moon, joining the Unites States and USSR.      The smaller spacecraft, Hagoromo, remained in orbit around the Moon. An     apparently broken transistor radio caused the Japanese space scientists     to lose track of it. Hagoromo's rocket motor fired on schedule on March     19, but the spacecraft's tracking transmitter failed immediately. The     rocket firing of Hagoromo was optically confirmed using the Schmidt     camera (105-cm, F3.1) at the Kiso Observatory in Japan.      Hiten made multiple lunar flybys at approximately monthly intervals and     performed aerobraking experiments using the Earth's atmosphere. Hiten     made a close approach to the moon at 22:33 JST (UTC+9h) on February 15,     1992 at the height of 423 km from the moon's surface (35.3N, 9.7E) and     fired its propulsion system for about ten minutes to put the craft into     lunar orbit. The following is the orbital calculation results after the     approach:   Apoapsis Altitude: about 49,400 km  Periapsis Altitude: about 9,600 km  Inclination : 34.7 deg (to ecliptic plane)  Period  : 4.7 days   PLANETARY MISSION REFERENCES      I also recommend reading the following works, categorized in three     groups: General overviews, specific books on particular space missions,     and periodical sources on space probes. This list is by no means     complete; it is primarily designed to give you places to start your     research through generally available works on the subject. If anyone can     add pertinent works to the list, it would be greatly appreciated.      Though naturally I recommend all the books listed below, I think it     would be best if you started out with the general overview books, in     order to give you a clear idea of the history of space exploration in     this area. I also recommend that you pick up some good, up-to-date     general works on astronomy and the Sol system, to give you some extra     background. Most of these books and periodicals can be found in any good     public and university library. Some of the more recently published works     can also be purchased in and/or ordered through any good mass- market     bookstore.      General Overviews (in alphabetical order by author):        J.

Other works and periodicals:      NASA has published very detailed and technical books on every space     probe mission it has launched. Good university libraries will carry     these books, and they are easily found simply by knowing which mission     you wish to read about. I recommend these works after you first study     some of the books listed above.      Some periodicals I recommend for reading on space probes are NATIONAL     GEOGRAPHIC, which has written articles on the PIONEER probes to Earth's     Moon Luna and the Jovian planets Jupiter and Saturn, the RANGER,     SURVEYOR, LUNAR ORBITER, and APOLLO missions to Luna, the MARINER     missions to Mercury, Venus, and Mars, the VIKING probes to Mars, and the     VOYAGER missions to Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.      More details on American, Soviet, European, and Japanese probe missions     can be found in SKY AND TELESCOPE, ASTRONOMY, SCIENCE, NATURE, and     SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN magazines. TIME, NEWSWEEK, and various major     newspapers can supply not only general information on certain missions,     but also show you what else was going on with Earth at the time events     were unfolding, if that is of interest to you. Space missions are     affected by numerous political, economic, and climatic factors, as you     probably know.      Depending on just how far your interest in space probes will go, you     might also wish to join The Planetary Society, one of the largest space     groups in the world dedicated to planetary exploration. Their     periodical, THE PLANETARY REPORT, details the latest space probe     missions. Write to The Planetary Society, 65 North Catalina Avenue,     Pasadena, California 91106 USA.      Good luck with your studies in this area of space exploration. I     personally find planetary missions to be one of the more exciting areas     in this field, and the benefits human society has and will receive from     it are incredible, with many yet to be realized.

Here are the rates I get:  1) sequential read (MSDOS C program that uses bios calls to read 64-sector                     blocks sequentially from outside (first) track inward)                       8mhz bus    10mhz bus                      --------    ---------    MAXTOR LXT340:    860KB/sec   976KB/sec    QUANTUM LPS240:   862KB/sec   887KB/sec  2) disk buffer read (same C program, but re-reads the same block repeatedly                      so in effect is reading the RAM buffer on the drive)                       8mhz bus    10mhz bus                      --------    ---------    MAXTOR LXT340:   1046KB/sec  1212KB/sec    QUANTUM LPS240:  1015KB/sec  1276KB/sec  3) CORETEST V2.7 transfer rate (seems to agree with (2) above)                       8mhz bus    10mhz bus                      --------    ---------    MAXTOR LXT340:   1051KB/sec  1224KB/sec    QUANTUM LPS240:  1026KB/sec  1298KB/sec  I managed to get hold of the QUANTUM LPS240AT product manual and it goes into excrutiating detail describing how the bits get from the platter, through the controller, and out the IDE interface.  Nowhere do I see anything like \\\"after the bits are whipped of the platter at high speed they sit around in a buffer to thaw before they are sent to the host\\\" (even though I SWEAR that's whats happening ;->).  Here are some relevent quotes from the manual:    \\\"Data is transferred from the disk to the read buffer at a rate of    3.75 MB/s maximum, 1.87MB/s minimum.\\\"  (My calculations show 3121KB/sec    maximum and 1578KB/sec minimum...  disk spins at 4306 RPM with 87    sectors per track on the outside and 44 on the inside)    \\\"Single burst errors of up to 24 bits within one sector can be corrected    'on-the-fly', in real time as they occur, allowing a high degree of    data integrity with no impact to the drive's performance.\\\"  (I take    this to mean error correction isn't the bottleneck)    \\\"For page-mode operations, the data-transfer rate to and from the buffer    RAM is up to 10.0 MB/s. This high transfer rate allows the AT Interface    IC to communicate over the AT bus at a data-transfer rate of 5.0 MB/s,    while the DCS simultaneously controls disk-to-RAM transfers\\\"                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ So the thing can even do it's cache pre-fetch WHILE it's sending the requested sector (it has 3 64KB read buffers for pre-fetching, I guess you could call that a cache :-|).  So when I do a sequential read on the outer tracks, WHY am I getting a measly 862KB/sec when I should be getting around 3MB/sec???  Any of you hard-disk engineers out there know? \",\"  [ ACT 5:40 - 41 ]  ... ...  The basic problem with your argument is your total and complete reliance on the biblical text.  Luke's account is highly suspect (I would refer you to the hermeneia commentary on Acts).  Moreover Luke's account is written at least 90 years after the fact.  In the meantime everyone he mentions has died and attempts to find actual written sources behind the text have come up with only the we section of the later portion of acts as firmly established. Moreover, Pauls account of some of the events in Acts (as recorded in  Galatians) fail to establish the acts accounts.   What we need, therefore, is a reliable text, critically appreciated, which documents the death of Christians for belief in the Resurrection.  I would suggest you look at some greek and roman historians.  I think you will be disapointed.\",\" I'll tell you my story as an example of what *not* to do.  Early in 1984 I took some riding lessons from my college roommate on his old Honda CB360T.  He had taken the MSF beginner's course, so I actually learned *some* of what I needed to know to ride.  I proceeded to buy a beat-up Honda CL350 for $400 and a $12 helmet and rode around wearing this and a cotton windbreaker.  Then I decided to invest in a full-face helmet (first smart move).  Sometime around then I also passed my road test.  On May 4, 1984, I got caught in a rainstorm on my way home from a 4-mile trip.  Entering the town where I lived (a rather urban suburb), I had to stop suddenly for a red light that I noticed too late, skidded the rear tire out, and was ejected face upward into the oncoming lane of traffic.  Fortunately for me the oncoming traffic was also stopped for the same red light, otherwise I might have slid under a car and been killed.  Now this is anecdotal evidence, to be sure, but I later took the Experienced Rider Course from the MSF and saw that earlier training could have helped me greatly.  In your case the need is even greater since you have nobody to help you practice even the most basic stuff as I did.  So my advice is to take the MSF beginner's course first thing.  I wouldn't even buy a bike until you've taken the course, unless you happen to pick up a real good deal and can store it someplace until you're ready to use it.   While you're waiting to take the course (it might take a few weeks in DC, as I recall there were always waiting lists in Boston), could you save up some more money to start out right?  Say $300 for riding gear, plus the cost bike, plus maybe $100 (guess) to a mechanic to make sure the machine is safe (assuming you economize by buying some old beat-up machine from a private individual), plus insurance, plus registration and licensing fees, plus the course, you're looking at maybe $600 not including the bike itself and a reserve for ongoing maintenance.   I pay about $100 insurance now (upstate NY) but it was closer to $200 in Boston (more urban) for decent insurance including substantial coverage for liability, which you want unless you plan always to be poor.  I'd guess DC is more like Boston than like a rural area, ergo more expensive.   There used to be annual buyer's guides in the usual motorcycle magazines; I found those helpful in getting an idea of what new or recent models might be available.  You could probably look through past issues to size up what used bikes might be available.  (My first bike was 13 years old when I bought it so I went on my friend's advice instead.)  Also look at the bikes that you see people riding or that are parked on the street.  I basically settled on my present bike by noticing that there were a lot of high-mileage BMW's running around and they were generally set up the way I wanted.  Nothing wrong with talking to various dealers in your area or visiting showrooms.  Dealers in the Boston area, at least when I was shopping, were very nice about letting you look around their showrooms and quoting prices for bikes that weren't the latest models (hence cheaper), although I ended up buying both bikes in private sales.\",\"Hi, can anyone direct me to map type gifs?

One might find oneself, as I did in late 1986, anticipating expenses in the near term that require selling off holdings.  Given the choice between waiting a few weeks (and taking an extra tax hit) or selling in December with preferential tax treatment, only a fool would choose the former.  2) The fact that Brett can now construct _post hoc_ calculations of what would have been more beneficial to investors is in many respects beside the point.  There was plenty of _Money_-style advice given to unsophisticated investors in late 1986 to \\\"sell now and save on taxes.\\\"  In case anyone missed it, there was no shortage of similar advice late last year (in the NYTimes, e.g.), even though that advice was based not on the foregone conclusion of enacted law (as in 1986), but merely on the *assumption* that Clinton would raise tax rates (without capping CG taxes, contrary to the current proposal).  It's nice to think that investors always behave in their optimal economic interest.  Like assuming weightless ropes and frictionless pulleys, though, this sort of thinking often fails to describe accurately what happens in the real world.  \",\"I was looking at the amps diagram for Sony 1090/2090 receivers, and I was amazed to find a difference between the US and Canadian model on the capacitor(s) that hangs off the output to the speakers:                           ------\\\\/\\\\/\\\\----- to speaker (identical both models from amp ---------------| (idnetical both models) >                         <  10                          >                         |                        -----                                               |     |                                 0.022        ---   ---        Canadian model only!

However, I think that some people (such as myself) would benefit from answers to the simple(?) question:  Which would YOU choose, and why?  Like lots of people, I'd really like to increase my data transfer rate from the hard drive.  Right now I have a 15ms 210Mb IDE drive (Seagate 1239A), and what I would say is a standard (not special, no cache I believe) IDE controller card on my ISA 486-50.  I'm currently thinking about adding another HD, in the 300Mb to 500Mb range. And I'm thinking hard (you should hear those gears a-grinding in my head) about buying a SCSI drive (SCSI for the future benefit).  I believe I'm getting something like 890Kb/sec transfer right now (according to NU).  How would this number compare if I bought the state-of-the-art SCSI card for my ISA PC, and the state-of-the-art SCSI hard drive (the wailing-est system I could hope for)?  Obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other, but what would YOU want to use on your ISA system? And how much would it cost?  Along those lines, what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HD's if I were to buy the top-of-the-line IDE caching controller for my 200Mb, 15ms HD? And how much would it cost?  I actually have a PAS-16, and could (what a waste I guess it would be...) hook up a SCSI HD through it's SCSI port which yields an optimum of 690Kb/sec. Actually, I have a borrowed 12ms Fujitsu HD hooked up through it now (and own the Trantor HD drivers for the PAS-16 SCSI port).  Is this SCSI port a SCSI-2 port?  How could I tell?  Is the Fujitsu 2623A a SCSI-2?  Are all SCSI HD's SCSI-2?  Thanks for any comments.\",\"Benedikt Rosenau writes, with great authority:   \\\"Contradictory\\\" is a property of language.

It's no accident that the first two names are 1988 only.  As with first and second base, 1988 was the year of the glove.  Average DA was 20 points higher in both leagues than any other year.  Looks good.  Too bad he's moving to short.  Highest five-year regular, though he's only had one year as good as Kevin Mitchell :->.  The other elite fielders in the league.  This is an interesting line.  His 1988 figure was slightly below average. His 1990 was pathetic, and his 1991 was the next best year by anybody.  Part of that may be his mobility.  1988 was with the Yankees.  1990 was with the Padres, who appear to have a rotten infield.  1991 was with the Twins, and judging by Leius and Gaetti, the Metrodome may be a good place to play third.  Add another to the elite fielders list.  Too fielders whose career average may overstate their value.  I don't know what happened to Caminiti -- judging by the three previous years, his low 1992 may be a fluke.  Sabo is merely average, however.  His incredible 1988 (best year ever) brings his average up a lot.  Strange last two years.  According to reputation, one of the best fielders ever at third base. But at the end, he was below average.  (Average in 1988 was .643).  Boggs has been pretty good.  I don't know what happened in 1990, but every other year he has been above average, usually by quite a bit.  Last year -- a fluke or a portent?  Why is it that the two leagues usually have defensive averages very close to one another, but very different from year to year?  Any ideas?  Brook  is declining.  Three first-time regulars, above average in 1992.  I'm not sure why Jefferies gets all the grief about his fielding.  He's never had a good year, but while at second he improved to become an average fielder, and is an average fielder at third.  Zeile, on the other hand, is a below average fielder.  Each year he's about 10 points below average.  And it's probably not just the park, since Terry Pendleton had excellent DAs in the three years before this.  Moving back to second was a good idea.  So why is Hayes supposed to be good defensively?  He's had a grand total of one year above the league DA, and was pretty bad last year.  Howard Johnson and Carney Lansford -- separated at birth.  To his credit, HoJo did have one above average year (1990).  Lansford couldn't even break the .600 mark without the help of the year of the glove.  Good hitter, but his fielding needs work.  Not a good fielder.  Both are better off at shortstop.  Two consecutive horrible years for Leo.  Camden Yards doesn't seem to have helped his fielding any.    Texas slugger debuts with not only the lowest career DA, but the lowest DA at third ever.  Congratulations, Dean. --  Dale J.

So I decided to check it out, on my own.  But, then, that was in BN times (Before Net).  So, here are some  references.  See Robin Lane Fox's _The unauthorized version_, (p.284) where  Lane Fox writes, \\\"... the one passage which appears to [comment on Jesus'  career] is agreed to be a Christian addition.\\\"  In my Re:Albert Sabin response (C5u7sJ.391@sunfish.usd.edu) to Jim Lippard (21 April 93), I noted that consensus is typically indicated subtly as in Elaine  Pagel's _The gnostic gospels_ (p.85), to wit:  \\\"A comment *attributed* to Josephus reports ... [emphasis mine]\\\".  Scholars sometimes do not even mention the two Josephus entries, another subtlety reflecting consensus.  So far as I can deduce, today's consensus is built on at least three things:  1) the long passage is way out of context, 2) Origen did not know about the long passage, and 3) the short and long passages are contradictory.  I don't know the references wherein the arguments which led to consensus are orginally developed (does anyone?).  Biblical scholars as I defined them include theologians and historians.  The former, like the latter, incorporate historical, social, technological and ideological contexts as well as theology.  So the distinction is blurred.  I  didn't elaborate on that.  Sorry.  (In turn, historians are compelled to incorporate theology).  Can't say about the number of copies.  These were, however, BG times (Before  Gutenburg).  A hundred first editions seems exceedingly high; counting on one  hand seems more reasonable.  Perhaps those mss. without the long insert (if any, because anything is possible) have been destroyed.  Such a practice is  certainly not foreign to religions.  Anyway, all we have are mss. which have  the two entries.  Lippart (in the message noted above) talks about an Arabic  ms.

He used a strange technique I'd never seen before.  He took a big pot with lid, and placed a tray in it made from aluminum foil. The tray was about the size and shape of a typical coffee-table ash tray, made by crumpling a sheet of foil around the edges.  In the tray, he placed a couple spoonfuls of brown sugar, a similar quantity of brown rice (he said any rice will do), the contents of two teabags of Earl Grey tea, and a few cloves.  On top of this was placed an ordinary aluminum basket-type steamer, with two chicken breasts in it.  The lid was put on, and the whole assembly went on the stovetop at high heat for 10 or 12 minutes.  Later, he removed what looked like smoked chicken breasts.  What surprises and concerns me are:  1)  No wood chips.  Where does the smoke flavor come from?  2)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember hearing that carmel color     (obtained by caramelizing sugar -- a common coloring and flavoring     agent) had been found to be carcinogenic.  I believe they injected     it under the skin of rats, or something.  If the results were conclusive,     caramel color would not be legal in the U.S., yet it is still being     used.  Was the initial research result found to be incorrect, or what?  3)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember Earl Grey tea being implicated     as carcinogenic, because it contains oil of bergamot (an extract     from the skin of a type of citrus fruit).  Does anyone know whatever     happened with that story?  If it were carcinogenic, Earl Grey tea     could not have it as an additive, yet it apparently continues to do     so.  WRT natural wood smoke (I've smoking a duck right now, as it happens), I've noticed that a heavily-smoked food item will have an unpleasant tangy taste when eaten directly out of the smoker if the smoke has only recently stopped flowing.  I find the best taste to be had by using dry wood chips, getting lots of smoke right up at the beginning of the cooking process, then slowly barbequing for hours and hours without adding additional wood chips.  My theory is that the unpleasant tangy molecules are low-molecular weight stuff, like terpenes, and that the smoky flavor molecules are some sort of larger molecule more similar to tar.  The long barbeque time after the initial intensive smoke drives off the low-molecular weight stuff, just leaving the flavor behind.  Does anyone know if my theory is correct?  I also remember hearing that the combustion products of fat dripping on the charcoal and burning are carcinogenic.  For that reason, and because it covers the product with soot and some unpleasant tanginess, I only grill non-drippy meats like prawns directly over hot coals.  I do stuff like this duck by indirect heat.  I have a long rectangular Weber, and I put the coals at one end and the meat at the other end.  The fat drops directly on the floor below the meat, and next time I use the barbeque I make the fire in that end to burn off the fat and help ignite the coals.  And yet another reason I've heard not to smoke or barbeque meat is that smoked cured meat, like pork sausage and bacon, contains nitrosamines, which are carcinogenic.  I'm pretty sure this claim actually has some standing, don't know about the others.\",\"  Make sure to take the Sutcliff, Fisk, ect. factor into account. \",\" Depending on how you plan to use your SUV, I might recommend also browsing Trailer Boats and one or more of those Pickup, Shotgun, and 4WD magazines.

I don't happen to have my SAE manual handy, but oil viscosity in general _decreases_ with temperature.  The SAE numbers are based on a `typical' curve that oils used to all have, running from (say) the viscosity of a room-temperature 90-weight at 0C, down to (say) that of a room-temperature  5-weight at 20C, for a typical 40-weight oil.  Oils that are designed for operation in `normal' temperatures just have a weight specification.  Oils that are designed for operation in exceedingly cold temperatures have a `W' tacked on the end, so in winter in a cold place, you'd stick 10W in your car in the winter and 40 in it in the summer, to approximate the appropriate viscosity throughout the year.  Modern multi-viscosity oils change viscosity much less with temperature. As a result, their viscosity graphs cross over several curves.  A multi-vis specification pegs the curve at two temperatures, a `normal' operating temperature and a `cold' one (though I can't remember the numbers...).  In any event, the weights do indicate a significant difference.  Remember that your engine is temperature-regulated (by the thermostat and radiator or air fins) most of the time -- unless you overheat it or something.  Any weight of oil is better than no oil, or than very old, carbonized oil.  Thin oil won't (in general) lubricate as well at temperature, thicker oil will (like a 20W50) will lubricate better at temperature,  but not as well during startup, when most engine wear occurs.    If you're planning on making long drives, the 20W50 is probably fine (esp. in the summer) in your 10W40 car.  But if you're making short drives, stick to the 10W40.  \",\"         How do we come up with this setup?  Is this subjective, if enough people agreed we could switch the order?

That's because truth may be absolute, but it may not be obvious.  Like so many things, the truth is always subject to misinterpretation.  I strongly suspect that we are reaching an impasse here, which is why I deign from commenting much further.   Now hold it.  I never said that Christians cannot be arrogant.  Indeed, as many other Christians on SRC have stressed before, this is a trap that Christians must always be wary about.  However, this does not mean that if you believe in the absolutes established by the Bible, you are necessarily being arrogant.  A Christian can believe that the Word of God is absolute, but he or she should not expect this to be immediately evident to everyone.    Not quite.  You say that according to my stance, we cannot *reliably* determine what is true.  That is not what I said.  I say that as fallible human beings, we cannot discern the truth with 100% certainty.  The  distinction is subtle yet important.  When a scientist performs an experiment, he can claim that his results are reliable, without claiming that absolutely no mistake whatsoever could have been made.  In other words, he can admit that he could be mistaken, without sacrificing his convictions.  Nobody can establish what absolute truth is with 100% certainty. Throughout the centuries, philosophers have argued about what we can know with complete certainty and what we cannot.  Descartes made a step in the right direction when he uttered, \\\"Cogito, ergo sum,\\\" yet we have not advanced much beyond that.  Do you believe that other people aside from you exist?  Do you believe that the computer terminal you are using exists?  If so, can you be absolutely certain about that?  Are you sure it is not some grand illusion?  Of course, you have no such assurance.  This does not mean, however, that for all practical purposes, you can be certain that they exist.  So it is with Christianity.  The most mature Christians I know have deep convictions about absolute morality, yet they acknowledge that there is a non-zero probability  that they are wrong.  This does not, however, mean that they should (or do)  abandon these absolutes.   As I said, we can never be absolutely certain that we are correct.  This does not mean that we cannot be certain enough, in light of the evidence, to  render all doubts unreasonable. \",\" Hismanal (astemizole) is most definitely linked to weight gain.

The crucial thing is not to sit around just having fantasies; they aren't of any use unless they make you do some experiments.  I've known a lot of scientists whose fantasies lead them on to creative work; usually they won't admit out loud what the fantasy was, prior to the consumption of a few beers.  (Simple example: Warren Jelinek noticed an extremely heavy band on a DNA electrophoresis gel of human ALU fragments.  He got very excited, hoping that he'd seen some essential part of the control mechanism for eukaryotic genes.  This fantasy led him to sequence samples of the band and carry out binding assays.  The result was a well-conserved, 400 or so bp, sequence that occurs about 500,000 times in the human genome.  Unfortunately for Warren's fantasy, it turns out to be a transposon that is present in so many copies because it replicates itself and copies itself back into the genome.  On the other hand, the characteristics of transposons were much elucidated; the necessity of a cellular reverse transcriptase was recognized; and the standard method of recognizing human DNA was created. Other species have different sets of transposons.  Fortunately for me, Warren and I used to eat dinner at T.G.I. Fridays all the time.)   I'm not sure that it's random.  But there is no known rational mechanism for generating a rich set of interesting hypotheses.  If you are really working in an unknown area, it is unlikely that you will have much sense of what might or might not be true; under those circumstances, the best thing to do is just follow whatever instincts you have.  If they are wrong, you will find out soon enough; but at least, you will find out _something_. If you try to do experiments at random, with no prior conceptions at all in mind, you will probably get nowhere.   Unfortunately, the critical function does sometimes become hostage to non-rational forces.  Then we get varieties of pathological science: Lysenko, Mirsky's opposition to DNA-as-gene, cold fusion, and so forth.   I don't agree that this follows.  In fact, this is _exactly_ the point at which I disagree with Feyerabend.  It is a most important part of the culture of science that one keeps one's jealousies out of the refereeing process.  Failures there are aplenty, but, on the whole, things work out.  Another point: there are a couple of senses of the phrase ``experimental design''.  I'd say that the less rational part is in experimental _choice_, not design.  Alexander Fleming (Proc. Royal Soc., 1922) chose to look for bacteriophage in his own mucus for strange reasons (Phage had previously been found in locust diarrhea; Fleming probably thought runny bottom, runny nose, what the hell, it's worth a try.) but his method of looking for phage was well-designed to detect anything phage-like; in fact, he found lysozyme.   It is not clear to me what you mean by rational vs. irrational.  Perhaps you can give a few examples of surprising experiments that were tried out for perfectly rational reasons, or interesting new theories that were first advanced from logical grounds.  The main examples I can think of are from modern high-energy physics which is not typical of science as a whole.\",\": > : >ATLANTIC DIVISION : >  : > ST JOHN'S MAPLE LEAFS VS MONCTON HAWKS : > MONCTON HAWKS : >See CD Islanders.

If not, why didn't they? \",\"I know it's a long shot, but maybe someone went through this and will have some comments to share.  The story is this: I bought a car out of state, and I'm trying to get the safety inspection in Pennsylvania. The problem is that the car has  aftermarket tint on all windows except the windshield. The tint is rather weak, and you can clearly see the inside of the car through the tint.  The inspection garage said that they won't pass it unless I get a waiver from the state police. So I went to the state police - the officer told me that aftermarket tint is illegal, and I can get a waiver only for a pre-84 car or for a medical reason. I asked him to show me the section of the vehicle code that says it's illegal.  He showed it to me and the paraghaph said that you can't have tint, if you can't see the inside of the car because of the tint. When I told him that you can in fact see the inside very well, he shut the book and said \\\"It's just illegal, and in fact we can have someone give you a ticket for it right now.\\\" Well, won't argue with that...  Since the vehicle code says it's OK as long as you can see through the tint, I'd like to keep it (I'll re-read the vehicle code in the library).  I'd also like to get some sort of paper from the police that says it's OK, so I can get the inspection, and so that I won't get in trouble for the tint later on. I also wouldn't mind registering a complaint against that officer - he really pissed me off.  So does anyone have any experience getting that sort of a paper from the police, especially in Pennsylvania? Does anyone have any experience registering a complaint against an officer? I called the station  later on today, but they basically said there is no place where I could register a complaint against an officer... And if I do decide to keep the tint and get a ticket anyway, how much of a chance do I stand to succesfully appeal the ticket in court?  Any comments about it will be welcome!\",\"Hi.

As for people being able to tell if he was a liar, well, we've had grifters and charlatans since the beginning of civilization.  If David Copperfield had been the Messiah, I bet he could have found plenty of believers.   Jesus was hardly the first to claim to be a faith healer, and he wasn't the first to be \\\"witnessed.\\\"  What sets him apart?   Rubbish.  Nations have followed crazies, liars, psychopaths, and  megalomaniacs throughout history.

There are flaws in your logic everywhere.  And as I'm sure others will tell you, read the FAQ!    Of course, you have to believe the Bible first.  Just because something is written in the Bible does not mean it is true, and the age of that tome plus the lack of external supporting evidence makes it less credible.  So if you do quote from the Bible in the future, try to back up that quote with  supporting evidence.  Otherwise, you will get flamed mercilessly.    Just like weight lifting or guitar playing, eh?  I don't know how you  define the world \\\"total,\\\" but I would imagine a \\\"total sacrafice [sp] of everything for God's sake\\\" would involve more than a time commitment.

We ask that you write a letter protesting the release of the following murderer.   This letter should be written to :   Raven Kazen - Victims Services Board of Pardons and Paroles P.O. Box 13401 - Capital Station Austin, Texas 78711   The letter should be written if at all possible on RED PAPER as that was agreed on at one of our first meetings . It represents the coalition and all of its parts as well as the heart ache of those left behind and the blood spilled by these criminals. The letter should have only one name on it so it can be filed in the folder of that criminal waiting for his next try at parole.   List of Criminals:   Today we have only one parole to protest , On October 4, 1990, Mark Steven Hughes rendered numerous blows to the head of James Allen Pompa . Ten month old James went into a coma and died two days later.   On July 8, 1992, Mark Steven Hughes pled guilty to Injury to a Child and received a ten-year sentence. According to Texas law, Mark became eligible for parole on January 4, 1992 -- six months before he was even sentenced!

All of the vendors I have called say that the internal video will not work on a true VGA monitor but will work on a IBM Compatible multisync like the sony's or the NEC monitors.  I thought the VGA capability of LCIII was very attractive because it allowed you to use inexpensive VGA monitors.  Am I confused or are these vendors just not up to speed?  Has anyone used an LCIII with a non multisync VGA monitor and if so where did you get your adapter (please be specific w/ vendor and cat #)?  I would prefer to get a apple monitor for these LCIII's (it's unseemly to see the finder inside an IBM bezel) but the more money we save on monitors the more LCIII's we can afford and the more PS/2's we can get rid of!\",\"From: res@colnet.cmhnet.org (Rob Stampfli)   >separate locations to gain credibility.

I'll be working on programming x-clients this summer, and since I don't have much experience with programming X, I thought this issue might be helpful as it has a section on debugging, and a section on the 40 most common errors in programming X.

Then I met a born-again christian, a very sweet person, not proseletyzing(sp?), not  imposing. I tried to get into being as christian as I could, as I felt I  'should'.  But the more I tried, the more depressed I got. I felt guilty for some of my own personal, honest feelings. I tried so hard to reconcile this conflict. until I was 23.  Then I taught myself to think rationally. I read a lot of books, pro and con  religion in general and, specifically, catholicism. I came to a crisis point, then it finally clicked and now I am a staunch atheist.   This is a very loose explanation, but it's the gist of it.

Perhaps you should examine in yourself why as such a good friend, you  are unwilling to accept this imortant part of your friends life?  Why  do you call into question his faith?  Your friend has changed, he has  found something that fills a need in his life.  You need to decide if  you are still his friend, whether you can accommodate his new life.   It sounds as if you are criticizing him for a fundamental belief in  the Bible, yet you are quick to reveal that your fundamental belief  that it is superstition.  Perhaps if he knew you at least took him  seriously, that you at least took an interest in the light he has found,  that you at least tried to understand what has become a special part of  his life, you could together decide to become fundamentalists, respect  each others differences and remain friends, or part ways.  Maybe even if  you stuck it out with him, you could help him to un-convert.  Of course,  if you go in with that attitude he will surely see through your intentions  and begin to resent you.  I happen to be a person very tolerant of fundamentalists, because I know that the idea of a simple black and white approach to life is appealing. I don't happen to share the beliefs of fundamentalists, but I am not offended by their prosyletizing.  I had a few good conversations with some Witnesses who came to my door.  I didn't switch my beliefs, but for those at home who maybe need a friendly face to invite them somewhere, the Witnesses provide a wonderful service.  You may have been conditioned to believe that religion is unimportant and witnessing is obnoxious, but why?  Are you afraid you might be converted and become one of them, that you will be swept up in fundamentalism, that you will become a weirdo. Friendship's a two-way street.

The messiah comes to build the kingdom of heaven on the earth.  He also comes to first reveal the root cause of original sin (fallen nature) and then provide a means to cut the connection to that original sin.  He also wants to create world peace based on Godism.  The messiah's teachings will build on the foundation of the Bible but provide profound new insights into the nature of God, the fall of man, the purpose of creation, and God's providence of restoration.  It will also provide a foundation for the unity of all the World's religions.  Many Christians expect Jesus to come on literal clouds, so they may miss him when he returns. Just as the Jewish people missed Jesus 2000 years ago.  They are still waiting for his first coming.  The Jewish people of that age expected Elijah to come first.  Jesus said that John the Baptist was Elijah. But John the Baptist denied that he was Elijah.  (How did this reflect on Jesus?)  Later in prison John even questioned who Jesus was: \\\"is he the one who is to come or do we look for another\\\". (see book of Matthew)   David Koresh didn't even come close.  The problem is that people like this make it difficult for people to believe and trust in the real Messiah when he does show up.   Very good point and perhaps the most important point of all for Christians: How to recognize the Second Coming?  The Messiah should not claim to be God.  What sets a Messiah apart is that he is born without original sin.  He is not born perfect but achieves perfection after a period of growth.  Adam and Eve were born sinless but they fell, and this tragedy meant that it would take God thousands of years to create the kingdom of heaven on the earth as God originally intended.  God's restoration providence is still not complete.  The messiah is the true Son of God, one with God, God's representative on the earth, but not God himself.  There is only one God.  ...    Who else in this world is claiming to be the Messiah.

If a player does well at AA and then does not improve at AAA, isn't that a sign that maybe he doesn't belong in the bigs?  Now, Keith Mitchell.  As I recall (no stat books handy - surprise!) he jumped from AA to Atlanta in 1991.  He did so well that he was returned to the minors, where he didn't do very well at all.  Now his career is in jeopardy.  So how does he fit in with your  point.  Good MLE's in AA.  Moved him right to the big club.  Now he's one step away from being traded or moved out of baseball.

Of course, I said \\\"No problem\\\" and went to work. Unfortunately, the DRDOS refuses to recognize the hard drive during  installation, even though I am still able to boot off of the hard drive using the old DOS.  After openning it up I discovered it was using an 8-bit  Seagate SCSI controller on a ST-157N SCSI 40Mbtye drive.  I then booted  with DRDOS 6.0 off of the floppy a second time and ran fdisk to see if  I could access the drive.  Lo and behold the primary 46.5 Mbyte partition  was intact (created by DOS 3.1 no less, I didn't think you could go over a 32Mbyte partition in the older DOSes. I could be wrong...).  I then tried  to remove the primary partition, which it wouldn't allow me to do.  I am  unaware of anything special that has to be done with a SCSI drive (I  kinda expected it to work just like an IDE/MFM/RLL drive for DOS  installations).  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated (except for  \\\"Throw it in the garbage and buy a new PC\\\")...

Could you please tell me what was the ethnic composition of  Israel right after it was formed.     No one in his right mind would sell his freedom and dignity. Palestinians are no exception. Perhaps you heard about anti-trust in the business world.  Since we are debating the legality of a commercial transaction, we must use the laws governing the guidelines and ethics of such transactions. Basic ANTI-TRUST law says that, while you can purchase IBM stocks for the purpose of investing, you can not acquire a large number of those shares with the intent or controlling IBM. You can do so only if you make your intentions CLEAR apriori . Clearly, the Jews who purchased properties from palastenians had some designs, they were not buying a dwelling or a real estate. They were establishing a bridgehead for the European Jews.  The palastenians sold their properties to the Jews in the old tradition of arab hospitality. Being a multi-ethnic / multi-religious society, accepting the jews as neighbours was no different, just another religion. Plus they paid fair market value, etc... They did not know they were victims of an international conspiracy. (I'm not a conspiracy theorist myself, but this one is hard to dismiss).     Again Adam, the devil is in the details. I don't want to get on a tangent here but its the same reasonning that says its OK to return 100 deportes and leave the rest.

Personaly, I've never heard anything about the arab community in Isreal. Except that they're there.  So yes, they're there. But as a community with history and roots, its dead.

Paul closes Romans 14 with, \\\"On the other hand, the person with doubts about something who eats it anyway is guilty, because he isn't acting on his faith, and any failure to act on faith is a sin.\\\" Gaus, ISBN:0-933999-99-2 Have you read the Ten Commandments which are a portion of the Law? Have you read Jesus' word in Matt5:14-19? Is there any doubt in your mind about what is right and what is sin (Greek hamartia = missing the mark)?   Whereas, the Ten Commandments and Jesus' words in Matt5:14-19 are fairly clear, are they not?   Matt5:14-19 doesn't answer your question?   Breaking bread - roughly synonymous with eating.   How do you unite this concept of yours with the Ten Commandments and Jesus's word in Matt5:14-19?   Or, they assumed that the Ten Commandments and Jesus' word in Matt5:14-19 actually stood for something? Perhaps they were \\\"strong in the faith?\\\"  ---------------------------  [No, I don't believe that Paul can overrule God.  However Paul was writing for a largely Gentile audience.  The Law was regarded by Jews at the time (and now) as binding on Jews, but not on Gentiles.  There are rules that were binding on all human beings (the so-called Noachic laws), but they are quite minimal.  The issue that the Church had to face after Jesus' death was what to do about Gentiles who wanted to follow Christ.  The decision not to impose the Law on them didn't say that the Law was abolished.  It simply acknowledged that fact that it didn't apply to Gentiles.  Thus there is no contradiction with Mat 5. As far as I can tell, both Paul and other Jewish Christians did continue to participate in Jewish worship on the Sabbath.  Thus they continued to obey the Law.  The issue was (and is) with Gentile Christians, who are not covered by the Law (or at least not by the ceremonial aspects of it).  Jesus dealt mostly with Jews.  I think we can reasonably assume that Mat 5 was directed to a Jewish audience.  He did interact with Gentiles a few times (e.g. the centurion whose slave was healed and a couple of others).  The terms used to describe the centurion (see Luke 7) suggest that he was a \\\"God-fearer\\\", i.e. a Gentile who followed God, but had not adopted the whole Jewish Law.  He was commended by Jewish elders as a worthy person, and Jesus accepted him as such. This seems to me to indicate that Jesus accepted the prevailing view that Gentiles need not accept the Law.  However there's more involved if you want to compare Jesus and Paul on the Law.  In order to get a full picture of the role of the Law, we have to come to grips with Paul's apparent rejection of the Law, and how that relates to Jesus' commendation of the Law.  At least as I read Paul, he says that the Law serves a purpose that has been in a certain sense superceded.  Again, this issue isn't one of the abolition of the Law.  In the middle of his discussion, Paul notes that he might be understood this way, and assures us that that's not what he intends to say.  Rather, he sees the Law as primarily being present to convict people of their sinfulness.  But ultimately it's an impossible standard, and one that has been superceded by Christ. Paul's comments are not the world's clearest here, and not everyone agrees with my reading.  But the interesting thing to notice is that even this radical position does not entail an abolition of the Law. It still remains as an uncompromising standard, from which not an iota or dot may be removed.  For its purpose of convicting of sin, it's important that it not be relaxed.  However for Christians, it's not the end -- ultimately we live in faith, not Law.  While the theoretical categories they use are rather different, in the end I think Jesus and Paul come to a rather similar conclusion.  The quoted passage from Mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest of the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus shows us how he interprets the Law.  The \\\"not an iota or dot\\\" would suggest a rather literal reading, but in fact that's not Jesus' approach.  Jesus' interpretations emphasize the intent of the Law, and stay away from the ceremonial details.  Indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude towards the Sabbath and kosher laws.  Some scholars claim that Mat 5:17-20 needs to be taken in the context of 1st Cent. Jewish discussions.  Jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a tenth of even the most minor herbs, but neglecting the things that really matter: justice, mercy and faith, and caring about how cups and plates are cleaned, but not about the fact that inside the people who use them are full of extortion and rapacity.  (Mat 23:23-25) This, and the discussion later in Mat 5, suggest that Jesus has a very specific view of the Law in mind, and that when he talks about maintaining the Law in its full strength, he is thinking of these aspects of it. Paul's conclusion is similar.  While he talks about the Law being superceded, all of the specific examples he gives involve the \\\"ceremonial law\\\", such as circumcision and the Sabbath.  He is quite concerned about maintaining moral standards.  The net result of this is that when Paul talks about the Law being superceded, and Jesus talks about the Law being maintained, I believe they are talking about different aspects of the Law.  Paul is embroiled in arguments about circumcision.  As is natural in letters responding to specific situations, he's looking at the aspect of the Law that is currently causing trouble: the Law as specifically Jewish ceremonies.  He certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards of conduct.  On the other hand, when Jesus commends the Law, he seems to be talking the Law in its broadest implications for morals and human relationships, and deemphasizing those aspects that were later to give Paul so much trouble.  It's unfortunate that people use the same terms in different ways, but we should be familiar with that from current conflicts.  Look at the way terms like \\\"family values\\\" take on special meaning from the current context.  Imagine some poor historian of the future trying to figure out why \\\"family values\\\" should be used as a code word for opposition to homosexuality in one specific period in the U.S.  I think Law had taken on a similar role in the arguments Paul was involved in.  Paul was clearly not rejecting all of the Jewish values that go along with the term \\\"Law\\\", any more than people who concerned about the \\\"family values\\\" movement are really opposed to family values.\",\"From: payne@crl.dec.com (Andrew Payne) Message-ID: <1993Apr20.004418.11548@crl.dec.com> Organization: DEC Cambridge Research Lab Date: Tue, 20 Apr 1993 00:44:18 GMT   Does anyone know if a source for the TCM3105 modem chips (as used in the Baycom and my PMP modems)?

Please email me directly with opinions (both positive and negative).  Ann Freeman Siemens Industrial Automation, Inc. Johnson City, TN\",\"You are making the same mistake I did: you are confusing the DRIVE interface to the DATA THROUGHPUT interface.  Again from my Mac & IBM info sheet {available by FTP on sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6) in the info-mac/report as mac-ibm-compare173.txt}: Expansion Both Mac & IBM SCSI: only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM.  Allows the use of any device: hard drive, printer, scanner, Nubus card   expansion {Mac Plus only}, some monitors, and CD-ROM.  Apple developed some   specifications for SCSI controlers while IBM has no exact controller   specifications {which results in added incompatibilities on IBM machines}.    Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal   terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port   {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and at the   end.  Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}.  SCSI-1:  7 devices per SCSI controller.  8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}  and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfer base.  16-bit SCSI-1 requires a  SCSI-2 controler chip and can provide only fast SCSI-2 not wide SCSI-2  which are both 16-bit interfaces {see SCSI-2}. SCSI-2: 10 devices per SCSI controller in SCSI-2 mode.  SCSI-2 is fully  SCSI-1 complient and tends to be implimented as a very fast SCSI-1 since it   needs a different controller interface in both hardware {which tends to be   very expendsive} and software.  Transfer speeds are 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst   {8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst  {32-bit/wide and fast}.  SCSI-2 in SCSI-1 mode is limited to 7 devices and  reduced 8-bit or 16-bit {fast only} throughput due to the difference between  SCSI-1 and wide SCSI-2 ports.  IBM HD Interfaces {limited to hard drives by design or lack of development}: [...] IDE:  Integrated Device Electronics   currently the most common standard, and is mainly used for medium sized   drives. Can have more than one hard drive. Asynchronous Transfer: ~5MB/s max.  So at its LOWEST setting SCSI-2 interface in Asynchronous SCSI-1 mode AVERAGES  the through put MAXIMUM of IDE in asynchronous mode.  In full SCSI-2 mode it blows poor IDE out the window, down the street, and into the garbage can. The problem becomes can the drive mechanisim keep up with those through put rates and THAT is where the bottleneck and cost of SCSI-2 comes from.  NOT the interface itself but more and more from drive mechanisims to use the SCSI-2 through put.  The cost of SCSI interface is a self fulliling prophisy: few people buy SCSI because it is so expencive for the PC, which in turn convices makes that mass producing SCSI {which would reduce its cost} is unwarented, and so SCSI is expencive. {That is the effect of the Rule of Scale: the more items sold the less EACH item has to bare the brunt the cost of manufacture and so the less each item has to cost}\",\"  May I suggest the book: \\\"Ethics\\\" by Dr. Norm Geisler, of Dallas Theological Seminary.

On the other hand, some people  seem to start tuning out `the same old words' and pay attention better  when things get changed around.  I think innovative priests and liturgy  committees are trying to get our attention and make things more  meaningful for us.  It drives me crazy too.   Different people have differing preferences and needs in liturgy.  My  local parish is innovative.  I prefer to go to Mass at the next parish  over.  Sometimes we don't have the option of attending a Mass in the  style which best suits us.  John put a smiley on it but to \\\"just offer  it up\\\" probably is the solution.  A related issue, that it sounds like John does not have to deal with, is  that spouses may have different liturgical tastes.  My husband does like  innovative litury.  It is a challenge to meet both of our spiritual  needs without just going our separate ways.  When you include the factor  of also trying to satisfy our children's needs, things get pretty  complicated.

The detector detectors work by picking up IF re-radiated from your radar  detector. In Britain, where one has/used to pay for a TV licence, there  are/were TV detector vans prowling the streets, looking for people who hadn't  paid their licence fee. They had a couple of long solenoid antennae on the roof, and I believe could triangulate an operating TV from the IF.   I wonder how much of the IF is radiated back from the detector antenna, and  how much from the rest of the module. It might be worth putting the detector  in a proper RF shielded enclosure. \",\"  Preliminary data regarding similar research into kangaroo overpopulation in Australia do not in any way support the cost-effectiveness of this approach.  It _may_ be cost-effective for deer--if you quietly overlook the fact that the net cost to the state of deer hunting is _negative_ (i.e. a profit) because the (majority of) hunters pay for licences. The cost comparisons are probably being done assuming that people have to be employed to cull the animals, which is not in fact the case. You figure people are going to pay for licences to implant contraceptive pellets or spread baits?  There has been a fair bit of discussion about this here recently, because the kangaroo population in the grounds of the Governor- General's residence has now reached plague proportions.  Despite the whines of the rampant animal-libbers, the most effective method of controlling the population is still considered to be controlled shooting.   Some people take satisfaction (IMHO, legitimate satisfaction) in eating food that they have harvested themselves.  The pleasure derived from hunting is the same as that you get from eating fruit and vegetables grown in your own garden (and, in general, game meat is probably much  freer of unpleasant chemicals than what you buy from the butcher or the supermarket).   By \\\"cannot now be justified\\\" I guess you mean that you personally don't see any justification.  Fine--but what makes your opinion so important?   Certainly the last point is correct.  If politicians don't see any votes for themselves in opposing stupid legislation or in developing and supporting measures which might be effective in reducing the  incidence of violent crime they

NHL teams can't afford to import role players from Europe, they pick the stars but will continue to build their teams around local players.

But unfortunely the Yards (a definitely excellent ballpark) only holds like 45,000 with 275 SRO spots. Ticket sales for the entire year is moving fast. Bleacher seats are almost gone for every game this year. It's a extremely likelyhood that the O's could sell out every game this year (especially if we lead the division for most of the year like '89).   On another front, the sale of the Orioles to anyone is likely to be forced upon Eli Jacobs who is major debt apparently. Maybe we can get an owner willing to spend on a proven rightfielder free agent in the winter.  Fernando has made the O's as the fifth starter. The O's pitching staff looks pretty good. Sutcliffe, Mussina, McDonald, Rhodes, and Fernando.

B2:      Male sex survey: Gay activity low      A new natonal study on male sexual behavior, the most thorough     examination of American men's sexual practices published since     the Kinsey report more than four decades ago, shows about 2     percent of the men surveyed had engaged in homosexual sex and     1 percent considered themselves exclusively homosexual.      The figures on homosexuality in the study released Wednesday     by the Alan Guttmacher Institute are significantly lower than     the 10 percent figure that has been part of the conventional     wisdom since it was published in the Kinsey report.  The article also contains numbers on the number of sexual partners. The median number of sexual partners for all men 20-39 was 7.3. Compared to the table I have already posted from Masters, Johnson, and Kolodny showing male homosexual partners, it is apparent that homosexual men are dramatically more promiscuous than the general male population.  It's a shame that we don't have a breakdown for straight men vs. gay/bi men -- that would show even more dramatically how much more promiscuous gay/bi men are.\",\" I was trying to avoid a discussion of the whether Clintons views should be endorsed or not.

Thank you.\",\"  It certainly is multi-user. What I have seen from the March Beta is that it doesn't yet come with the stuff which exploits multi-user features. I remember somebody from MS stating that it doesn't allow two users share one GUI. My interpretation of this was that one user per console but all the networking and RPC based stuff you want.   I believe ftp and rlogin deamons for NT systems will come from third party. Somebody already has a Beta version of an unsecure ftpd on the net. There is no reason why one cannot write a posix based shell like csh on Unix for remote logins.   In general I liked NT when I checked it out. It slow compared to Win3.1 (just like any other real OS). The beta version, although being slow, botts up much faster than my SUN workstation. Windows subsystems also start up a lot faster than X windows. I believe Bill Gates was right when he stated that NT was not for everybody. After playing around with it for a while I was convinced. If I owned a busines using a \\\"business computer\\\" from IBM or some other established vendor, I would consider moving to NT platform because it would provide a much cheaper solution (If you are running SQL servers etc.). It provides the robustness such an application requires.   On the other hand if you like your DOS games, more or less forget about NT. You can always boot to DOS  but in general that defeats the purpose of using NT. Most of NT's features are visible in a networked environment and in such an environment you can't reboot your machine at will. For personal use, I would rather wait for the Win32 based Windows release (whatever you name it) than jump to NT bandwagon. I expect most applications will keep on using Win16 until Win32 becomes widely available.  \",\" Could be the (folk?) song \\\"Clementine\\\".

BTW: the DOE handles reactor fuel, and merely leases it to reactors.  The NRC certifies these reactors.  The military have their own sources.  A private citizen has none of these official sources.    That's freshman-level chemistry.  Big deal.  Can you make it work?  That's PhD-level physics.  Big difference.    So you admit that there's no law that could stop you?  Physics aside, could you make one if you had the funds and time?  The answer is yes.  So, do we lock you up now because of this?  Surely you can see where the comparison with anti-gun laws comes into play here?    Precisely why it's not as readily utilized as you seem to have been lead to believe.  BTW: 98% U235 is far better for home-made bombs than trying to use plutonium.

They were acting in direct contradiction to scripture.  Jesus' Second Coming is something that everyone will know of.  Jesus also predicted that there will be false Messiahs who will use His name.  His prophecy has been fulfilled.   I agree with you there.    Me too.  I have already given my life to God.  If God tells me to lay down my life, it will be to save another life.    Do you judge all Christians by the acts of those who would call themselves Christian and yet are not?  The BD's contradicted scripture in their actions.  They were NOT Christian.  Simple as that.  Perhaps you have read too much into what the media has portrayed.  Ask any true-believing Christian and you will find that they will deny any association with the BD's.  Even the 7th Day Adventists have denied any further ties with this cult, which was what they were.  Do you judge all Muslims by the acts committed by Saddam Hussein, a  supposedly devout Muslim?  I don't.  Saddam is just a dictator using the religious beliefs of his people to further his own ends.

I have installed the Cyrillic fonts I found on CICA and now a strange thing happens: Sometimes windows uses Cyrillic when its supposed to use Times Roman. Examples: The PC-Tools Backup (version 7.1) has one line of Cyrillic text in its opening banner, the next to last line. Importing a Word for Windows text written in Times into WP5.2 also results in Cyrillic. Does anyone have an idea where to look for the problem?

That is, ignoring concerns about government intrusions into individual privacy, is the value of easy wiretaps to investigators greater than the cost to the communications industry, and their customers, to support this wiretap technology?    A rough estimate suggests that wiretaps are worth about five million dollars per year to U.S. law enforcement agencies.  (In 1990, 872 U.S. wiretaps led to 2057 arrests, while total police expenditures of $28 billion led to 11.25 million arrests [ref US Statistical Abstracts].) I'm working on estimating this wiretap benefit more accurately, but I'd like to ask hardware experts out there to help me with estimating the costs of the new proposed wiretap technology.  Please send me quotable/citeable estimates for:  - How many chips which would need to be made per year to keep all   phones with wiretap chips? - How much would it cost to make each chip? - How much did it cost to develop this technology in the first place? - How much more would supporting hardware, people, etc. cost, per chip? - What percentage cheaper would encryption chips and support have been   if private enterprise could compete to meet customer encryption needs? - What percentage of phone traffic would be taken up by the proposed   \\\"law enforcement blocks\\\"? - What is the total cost of handling all phone traffic per year?  Put another way, the question I'm asking is, what if each police agency that wanted a particular wiretap had to pay for it, being charged their share of the full social cost of forcing communication to be wiretap compatible?  Would they choose to buy such wiretaps, or would they find it more cost-effective to instead investigate crimes in other ways?\",\" I think in Illinois venereal disease (the old ones, not AIDS) was included.

Thus I've never really believed in God and heaven, although I don't actually believe that they don't exist either - I'm sort of undecided, probably like a lot of people I guess.         Lately I've been thinking about it all a lot more, and I wondered how religious people can be so convinced that there is a God. I feel as though I want to believe, but I'm not used to believing things without proof - just as I can't believe that there definitely isn't a God, so I can't definitely believe that there is. I wondered if most of you were brought up by religious families and never believed any different. Can anyone help me to understand how your belief and faith in God can be so strong.          Another question that frequently crosses my mind is which religion is correct?? How do you choose a religion, and how do you know that the Christian God exists and the Gods of other religions don't?? How do you feel about people who follow other religions?? How about atheists?? And people like me - agnostics I suppose. Do you respect their religion, and accept their beliefs as just as valid as your own?? Isn't there contradiction between the religions?? How can your religion be more valid than any others?? Do you have less respect for someone if they're not religious, or if they follow a different religion than you would if they were Christian??          Also, how much of the scriptures are correct?? Are all events in the bible really supposed to have happened, or are they just supposed to be stories with morals showing a true Christian how to behave??          I generally follow most of the Christian ideas, which I suppose are fairly universal throughout all religions - not killing, stealing, etc, and 'Loving my neighbour' for want of a better expression. The only part I find hard is the actual belief in God.          Finally, what is God's attitude to people like me, who don't quite believe in Him, but are generally fairly 'good' people. Surely not believing doesn't make me a worse person?? If not, I find myself wondering why I so strongly want to really believe, and to find a religion.

I would refer you to John Dominic Crossans Book _The Cross That Spoke_ (Pub. Harper and Row, 1988).  The earliest texts which we have make no reference to an empty tomb.  Nor is an empty tomb necessary for a claim of resurrection. Modern Evangelicals/Fundamentalists have completely missed what the point of resurrection is -- Here the work of George Nickelsburg's work  _Resurrection, Immortality, and Eternal Life in Intertestamental Judaism_ (Publ Cambridge, Havard Univ. Press, 1972) is most helpful.  Look At Rom 1:1-3.  Paul here has no need of an empty tomb.  Additionally in 1 Cor 15, Here again there is no mention of an empty tomb. He was raised (note the passive), he appeared, no ascension either.  Resurrection could be accomplished without ever disturbing the bones in the grave.  The whole idea of an empty tomb isn't broached in any of our texts until well after the fall of Jerusalem.  By that time, the idea of coming up with a body would have been ludicrious.  Moreover Mack has argued (convicingly, I think) that the empty tomb story first appears in Mark (we have no texts before this which mention the tomb).         You are quite right here.  Even the Idea of a subjective mystical event as the foundation of the resurrection narratives is currently becoming more untenable. See B. Mack _A Myth of Innocence_.\",\" How is it ever going to be an Off- the Shelf Technology if someone doesn't do it?  Maybe we should do this as part of the SSF design goals. ;-)  Gee fred.

The arrogance being attacked is that we \\\"think we are the only ones who know what the absolutes are\\\".  In short, many evangelicals claim that they are infallible on the matter of religious texts.  In particular, the problem is one of epistemology.  As a shorthand, you can think of epistemology as \\\"how do you know?\\\"  That question, it turns out, is a very troubling one.  The problem with `absolute certainty' is that, at the bottom, at least some of the thinking goes on inside your own head.  Unless you can be certain that everything which happens in your head is infallible, the reasoning you did to discover a source of truth is in question.  And that means you do NOT have absolute justification for your source of authority -- which means you do NOT have absolute certainty.   Let's take the specific example of Biblical Inerrancy, and a fictional Inerrantist named Zeke.  (The following arguments applies to the idea of Papal Infallibility, too.)  Zeke has, we presume, spent some time studying the Bible, and history, and several other topics.  He has concluded, based on all these studies (and possibly some religious experiences) that the Bible is a source of Absolute Truth.  He may be correct; but even if he is, he cannot be certain that he is correct. His conclusion depends on how well he studied history -- he may have made mistakes, and the references he used may have contained mistakes.  His conclusion depends on how well he studied the Bible -- he may have made mistakes.  His conclusion depends on his own reasoning -- and he may have made mistakes.  (Noticing a common thread yet?  8-)  Everything about his study of the world that he did -- everything that happened in his own head -- is limited by his own thinking.  No matter what he does to try and cover his mistakes, he can never be certain of his own infallibility.  As long as ANY PART of the belief is based on his own reasoning, that belief cannot be considered \\\"absolutely certain\\\".  Zeke believes that he has found a source of absolute truth -- but that belief is only as good as the quality of the search he made for it.  Unless he can say that his own reasoning is flawless, his conclusions are in doubt.  Any belief that you hold about absolute sources of truth depends in part on your own thinking -- there is no way out of the loop.  Only an infallible thinker can have absolute certainty in all his beliefs.   This is easy to demonstrate.  Let's go back to our shorthand method of doing epistemology: \\\"how do you know?\\\"  Imagine a hypothetical discussion:   A: The Bible is a source of absolute truth.   B: How do you know?   A: I studied history and the Bible and religious writings and church     teachings and came to this conclusion.   B: How do you know you studied history correctly?   A: Well, I double-checked everything.   B: How do you know you double-checked correctly?   A: Well, I compared my answers with some smart people and we agreed.   B: Just because some smart guy believes something that doesn't mean it is     true.  How do you know THEY studied it correctly?   A: ...  And, as you see, B will eventually get A to the point where he has to say \\\"I can't prove that there are no mistakes\\\" -- and as long as you may have made a mistake, then you cannot be ABSOLUTELY certain.  There is no way out of the loop.   This is where the \\\"arrogance of Christians\\\" arises: many people believe that their own personal research can give them absolute certainty about the doctrines of Christianity -- they are implicitly claiming that they are infallible, and that there is no possibility of mistake.  Claiming that you CANNOT have made a mistake, and that your thinking has led you to a flawless conclusion, is pretty arrogant.   *  People who want to see this argument explained in great detail should try to find _The Infallibility of the Church_, by George Salmon.  He is attacking the idea that the Pope can be knowably infallible (and he does so very well), but the general argument applies equally well to the idea that the Bible is knowably Inerrant. \",\"This past week I've been playing with some of the R-D (Reaction- Diffusion, not to be confused with RDS or R&D) techniques from SIGGRAPH '91.

Their loose morals, and other vices were  unknown to the Arabs prior to Balfour Declaration, on top of   all communist activities were the cause of most of the Arab  criticism.\\\"[1]  As Uzun exposed, the Armenians were fascist. Before Pearl Harbor,  the Dashnak daily 'Hairenik' (not to be confused with the Tzeghagrons 'Hairenik Weekly') expressed pro-Nazi sentiments:  \\\"And came Adolf Hitler, after herculean struggles. He spoke  to the racial heart strings of the German, opened the   fountain of his national genius, strock down the spirit  of defeatism...At no period since the World War had Berlin  conducted so realistic, well organized, and planned policy  as now, since Hitler's assumption to power...And whatever  others may think concerning Hitlerism and Fascism as a   system of Government, it is proved that they have revitalized  and regenerated the two states, Germany and Italy.\\\"[2]  [1] Captain George Haig, 'The Case of Palestine,' in Hairenik     Weekly, Friday, September 25, 1936.

The Bible does not have a  message -- it has messages.  And some of those are messages of repentance and giving, to turn the other cheek, and do unto the least of these.  But some of the messages are the complete opposite.  Like the isrealites order to  wipe out other tribes including women and children down to cattle, and  punished severely when they were less than complete about the job.  Like jews who are said to have cried out in Matthew, \\\"His blood be upon our heads and our childrens heads\\\" A verse quoted in every pogrom from the crusades to the holocaust.  Have these been misunderstood?  I think not.  They have only been understood too clearly.  It is essential that christians grasp firmly the good the bible teaches, the meek carpenter from Nazareth is a potent  symbol for how we should be, his teachings we must take to heart, but we cannot ignore the other material in the bible which is not to our liking and say those who live by that have misread it.  To say that is only to chose a point of interpretation and declare it normative.  Such can be done with the same legitmacy by anyone.  Instead we must let the text critique the text. Understanding that there is both good and bad in our sacred corpus, we test all things and hold fast to that which is good.   At the risk of sounding heretical (well ok, more heretical) I don't think that doubt is something which requires forgiveness, it is something which requires introspection and reflection.  If that is a sin, then there can be no salvation, for doubt is an inescapble part of being human.  Consider Job.  His friends had no doubt. Whereas Job had no doubt in himself but doubted the wisdom and justice of God.  When God finally did appear he  rebuked the friends and had job make sacrifices for them.  To be a Christian it to always have doubt, or not to have honesty.\",\"      Nothing but errors and omissions here! \",\"Be very careful when you plug in a external monitor and a external speaker.

Early MOSFETS had a gate-source voltage rating  of approximately +/- 20 VDCmax, and they would usually turn completely \\\"ON\\\"  at +10VDC.

I was opposed to intervention in Somalia for the same reason I am opposed to intervention in Bosnia - there is no security interest of the United States there which justifies risking the lives of American servicemen, and there are too many crises in the world for us to take on all of them.  In the case of Bosnia, the risks are obviously much greater, and there are other countries in a much better position and with far better reasons to take action than the US.   You continue to misunderstand.  I did not say the reason why people want to intervene is because of racist (<- you seem to be overly fond of using this word, btw.  I said the phenomenon was race-related, which is not the same as racist.  Perhaps this distinction is too subtle for you to grasp) motives - I said the attention and outrage at the entire Yugoslavian situation was a result of it being 1) closer to home, 2) happening to people we can identify with, and 3) relentlessly harped on by the media.  I never said anything about which side would be preferred, which has a lot more to do with the presentation of the conflict than any psychological factors.  I think there is no doubt that despite the fact we intervened in Somalia, the level of attention devoted to there was considerably less than what is devoted to Bosnia, if the newspapers and tv news I see are any guide. \",\"[about the infield fly rule]  Unless he's Deion Sanders, in which case he just heads back to the dugout and waits for his next base-running-blunder opportunity.\",\"The rubber drain plugs under my carpet in my mazda glc leaked like the ones are doing under your spare in the Probe.

The standard VGA and EGA outputs are  very different than the NTSC format used by televisions.  While there is equipment that will do the conversion, it is hard to get your hands on and costs quite a bit.   If you have access to an Amiga computer, that has an NTSC output, you can transfer certain types of graphic files by modem and tape them from the NTSC output.  Unfortunately, this would be frame-by-frame and would lead to unbelievably scratchy animation unless you had a good Amiga animation program.\",\" Ahhh, the classic Truth By Blatant Assertion technique.  Too bad it's so demonstrably false.  Take a look at Great Britain sometime for a  nice history on drug criminalization.  The evidence there shows that during periods of time when drugs (such as heroin) were illegal, crime went up and people did die from bad drugs.  During times when drugs were legalized, those trends were reversed.   Now this is a great example of an ironclad proof.  Gosh, I'm convinced. ( :-} for the humor impaired).  First, assert something for which you have no evidence, then dodge requests for proof by claiming to know what this group was intended for.  As to research, if you'd done any at all, you'd realize that there is plenty of reason to believe that legalizing drugs will have many benefits to society.  There are some plausible arguments against it, too, but they aren't enough to convince me that criminalization of drugs is the answer.  I'm willing to be convinced I'm wrong, but I seriously doubt the likes of you can do it. -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ...Dale Cook    \\\"Any town having more churches than bars has a serious                    social problem.\\\" ---Edward Abbey The opinions are mine only (i.e., they are NOT my employer's)\",\"  I watched him over his entire career.

But it does not prevent the fertilzation of the  : ovule. Is it true ? If yes, is there a risk of extra-uterine : pregnancy, that is the development of the ovule inside the Fallopian : tube ?  Actually that is not how the pill works, but it *is* how the IUD works. The oral contraceptive pill actually *prevents* ovulation from occuring by providing negatve feedback to the pituitary gland, and thus preventing the LH surge that normally occurs at the time of ovulation.  With the IUD what happens is that fertilization may occur, but the device prevents implantation within the wall of the uterus (*not* the vagina). \",\"THE WHITE HOUSE                      Office of the Press Secretary  _____________________________________________________________________ For Immediate Release                                   April 5, 1993                               PRESS BRIEFING                        BY GEORGE STEPHANOPOLOUS                             The Briefing Room    10:10 A.M. EDT              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As you know, the President is soon  to be on his way, on Amtrack to Camden Yards.  He'll be throwing out  the first pitch.              Q   It's MARC, the Maryland Area Transit, it's not  Amtrack.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, it's not Amtrack?  Well, he's  going from Union Station, you're right.  Excuse me.              Q   George, what exactly are you prepared to do to  break the logjam with  ??? Senate?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, there are  discussions between Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole this morning,  and I think that the President is going to continue to make the point  that he believes that our investment package, our jobs package needs  to be passed as quickly as possible.  We need this investment for  summer jobs, for immunization, for highway construction, for the  important programs that will put people back to work right away this  summer.  And the President continues to believe his program should be  passed.              Q   Will he compromise, that's the question?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, the discussions  are going on this morning in the Senate betwen Senator Mitchell and  Senator Dole, let's see what they come up with.  But the President  believes his jobs program should go forward.              Q   George, would the President be willing to accept $8  billion for one year, which apparently appears to be the compromise  being offered by --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I don't know what is being  offered by either side.  The Senate discussions are going on right  now, let's see what happens today.              Q   Would he go that far -- no matter what the  Republicans have offered so far, would he go that far, $8 billion per  year?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that his  program should be passed at this time.  Clearly, we're going to be  willing to listen to what the Senators might or might not be able to  come up with, but I'm not going to get into figures right now.  Let's  see what happens.              Q   It's reasonable to assume, isn't it, from what has  happened so far that a compromise is going to be necessary in order  to get a vote?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the Republicans seem more  intrested in stopping progress on the President's jobs bill, than in  doing something to create --  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the  Republicans seem more interested in stopping progress on the  President's jobs bill than in doing something to create real action,  real jobs this summer for the American people.  I think there's no  question about that.  There's been some frustration of legislative  activity over the last few days.              Q   So, you'll need to compromise to get your package  through?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We'll see what happens with the  conversations between Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole this morning.              Q      prepared to compromise --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President's prepared to listen  to what Senator Mitchell has to say this morning after his meeting  with Senator Dole.               Q   Does he feel that he has been defeated in his --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not in the least.  In fact, he's  been very successful so far in the beginning of his term.              Q   How?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He passed his budget in record  time, in six weeks, and it's a budget which reduces the deficit by  $500 billion over five years.  And it's a budget which provides for  important investments in our future.  Right now we've also had strong  passage of his jobs program through the House.  Simply because a  minority of Republicans in the Senate choose to perpetuate gridlock  and hold up action on the President's jobs program is not a sign that  he is not succeeding overall.              Q   He can't beat this, can he?              Q   The fact is they can do that?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the Republicans can stop  action.  There's no question about that.              Q   What are you going to do about it?              Q   George, what do you know about these alleged notes  taken by Boris Yeltsin during one of the meetings in which it appears  that the President told Boris Yeltsin not to trust the Japanese; that  when they say yes they mean no?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's a complete  misreading of what happened at the meeting.  The context of the  conversation was that President Clinton was actually reassuring  President Yeltsin at the time about his conversations with Prime  Minister Miyazawa over the Kuril Islands and the Prime Minister's  belief that Japan would play a constructive role in the G-7 process.   I mean this was a casual comment about Japanese courtesy and  etiquette but overall it was in the context of a conversation where  he was reassuring President Yeltsin that he believed the Japanese  were serious about their commitment to the G-7 process.              Q    Are you saying that the President said that when  the Japanese say yes they mean no?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's not -- I don't know the  exact words and there was a much longer discussion about he did say  something along the lines that he believes that on this issue Prime  Minister Miyazawa intends to really go forward with the G-7 process.              Q   Have there been any attempts to explain this to the  Japanese because apparently the Japanese press has picked this up and  there appears to be --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I've seen the reports in the  Japanese press and it actually does put the situation in context.  It  does talk about the Japanese -- understanding the Japanese points of  view.  I don't think it's going to be a problem.  I believe that  there may have been some diplomatic context just to clear things up  but I'm not positive.              Q   George, was the specific comment that was made  specific to the Kuril Island situation or was it a general  observation on Japanese etiquette?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The discussion was about --              Q   The specific comment is what I'm asking about that  has alleged to have been translated from the Russian notes, \\\"when the  Japanese say yes they mean no.\\\"              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, it was a combination.  I mean  I don't think that's the whole sentence.  I think that the specific  comment was a broad, general observation followed up by a specific  finish to the sentence where he said in this case he believes that  Prime Minister Miyazawa means to keep the commitment.              Q   Was he saying it facetiously first?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it was just a casual  observation.              Q   And then you say diplomatic contacts were made to  clear it up.  Has the President sent a message?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, I don't think the President  spoke; I believe that Secretary Christopher has made some calls but  I'm not sure exactly how many.              Q   Well, this obviously is a bigger deal than you're  making it out to be if Christopher has had to make some calls.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, no.  It was just that we got  the reports in Vancouver and the Secretary wanted to make sure that  it was understood and make sure there was absolutely no        MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- reports in Vancouver, and the  Secretary wanted to make sure that it was understood, and make sure  there is absolutely no misunderstanding, and I don't believe there is  on.              Q   What is our position about the Japanese?  That they  may have to say one thing, but actualy mean another?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  The position on the Japanese  is as the President stated to President Yeltsin throughout the two  days.  He said that he had had a good conversation with Prime  Minister Miazawa prior to the Summit.  He reiterated the U.S.  position, the long-standing support for the Japanese position on the  Kuril Islands, but also reiterated Prime Minister Miazawa's  commitment to move forward on the G-7 process and to play a  constructive role.  And I think President Yeltsin was very glad to  hear that.              Q   After listening to Secretary Christopher on Iraq  for the last few days, I'm a little confused.  What is the U.S.  policy?  Do you want to see Saddam Hussein overturned?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's the same policy that Secretary  Christopher has reiterated, and all of the U.S officials have  reiterated.  We expect full and complete and unequivocal compliance  with all U.N. resolutions.  Right now we do not have that compliance.              Q      throwing it out further that if Iraq complies,  Saddam can't stay in office?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.  I think that that's -- our  judgment is that it is not possible for Saddam Hussein to comply with  the resolutions and stay in power.  But the important point is that  we expect compliance by Iraq with all U.N. resolutions, and we will  continue to demand it.              Q   And are you concerned the Iran will become the  dominant power in the area --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Secretary Christopher has also  spoken to Iran over the last several days, and he says we also expect  full Iranian compliance with all international norms, and stopping  support of terrorism.              Q   That's a very glib statement that he won't stay in  power if he complies with U.N. resolutions.  On what logic do you  base that?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right now Saddam Hussein is not  complying with the U.N. resolutions at all.  He is not respecting the  rights of his people, as is required by the U.N. resolution.  He is  not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding inspections.   He is not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding  armaments.              Q   Well, when do you think that if he did comply he  would be out of power?        MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, right now his power rests on  the repression of his people.  If he stopped doing that it would make  it more difficult for him to stay in power.              Q   George, back on the stimulus package, why is it  that you and the President accuse the Republicans of playing pure  politics and perpetuating gridlock?  Why is it that -- what evidence  do you have that they just don't have a genuine idealogical  difference with you that's in good faith?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the fact that several times  in the past the Republicans, many of the ones who are now leading the  fight for the filibuster, have supported the very funding they now  seek to stop, most especially, the highway funding.                Q   George, in regards to that, some of the moderate  Republicans said that the White House erred by not being more open to  them during the -- while the plan was put together, that they had  one, sort of, proforma meeting between the White House and the Senate  Republicans, and that was it.  Does the Administration look back and  thinks perhaps it could have done a better job of working with some - -              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I'm not sure that it's true  that there was only one meeting.  I mean, the President met with the  Republican leadership on at least two occasions before the  introduction of his package.  He met with the entire Senate  Republican Caucus also for lunch, and went up there.  We are  continually in contact with as many Republicans as we can find who  have an interest in the President's package.  We are interested in  what they have to say, as well.  But we believe that this program is  important, and we're going to continue to fight for it.              Q      your all or nothing, do it with the Democrats  alone strategy, did you maybe miscalculate the ability to get it  through?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean, I think that there is  no question that under the Senate rules a determined minority can  frustrate activity.  I mean, there is just no question about that.   You only need 40 plus one to keep going.  40 plus one to keep going  and to stop any action, and that's what the Republicans are doing.              Q      going to rethink the way you attempt to get  other things passed as you go through this process for the rest of  the summer?              Q      work with Republicans and try to woo some  Republicans into your camp?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we're going to continue to  look for the support of Republicans whenever we can get it on the  President's intiatives?              Q   But on this one -- how are you going to do it  differently than you did it on this one because on this one you  really did stiff the Republicans from the beginning and made it clear  that it was a Democratic majority that would get this through and  could get it through and you really didn't need Republican votes?   Are you going to take a different tack when you have to go for  particular votes?  When you have to go through --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't see into the future and  understand every possible turn in the legislative road.  Clearly the  President's going to continue to reach out when he can.              Q   You don't have any regrets then about the way you  have handled it up to now and you don't plan any changes in your  approach in dealing with the Republicans in Congress based on this  experience?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Obviously the President would like  his package passed as quickly as possible and he's going to continue  to press for that.  We will continue to reach out to Republicans,  there's not question about that.  And we'll continue to reason with  them and try and find appropriate avenues for cooperation.  In this  case the Republicans have chosen to unify around a filibuster, around  a plan to frustrate action not a plan to move forward.              Q   They're being denied any other legislative means of  putting their proposals forward.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think they're being --              Q      any ideas.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think their amendments are being  defeated; I don't know that they're being denied.              Q      to present them.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's not exactly true.  I mean  they get the votes --              Q      that theirs can be passed though by the  parliamentary rules under which they're playing.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Unless they get a majority in  support all the way around, no, that's not exactly true.              Q   George, one more on Iraq.  Is the administration  backing any of the Iraqi opposition?  Grooming any new leadership?              Q      backing any of the Iraqi -- leadership?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, I -- again, we're pressing for  Iraqi compliance.  I don't know if we can get into the business of  grooming leadership.  I believe there have been some contacts, at  some levels, with Iraqi opposition groups.  I don't know  about  anything recently.              Q      Jesse Jackson, who, of course, is not the  President's best friend, has, however, been told that there is to be  some kind of town meeting, or some kind of involvement by the  President, pre-empted the ball game -- Los Angeles.  Will he consider  something like that, or any other kind of intervention there?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, the President  appointed Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, about 10 days ago, to be a  special envoy to California, and coordiante cabinet activities around  the California economic situation, including the situation in Los  Angeles.                I believe there will also be visits out to Los Angeles  by the Education -- or have been visits by the Education Secretary,  Mr. Riley.  I believe that Transportation Secretary Pena and HUD  Secretary Cisneros are also going out.  And there may be other visits  by Cabinet officials over the next several days and weeks.  I  wouldn't rule out the possibility of a visit by President Clinton to  California.  Obviously, he is following the situation closely, and is  concerned about making sure that we make the right long term policy  decisions that will help create the kind of economic opportunities  which help prevent disturbances.  But we're going to continue to  watch it.              Q   George, as a follow-up, Reverend Jackson is also  supposed to be outside the ball park today, in Baltimore, with a  group of supporters protesting the lack of minorities in baseball  management.  Does the President have a position on that?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has received  correspondence from Reverend Jackson.  I know that Reverend Jackson  has also spoken with the White House Chief of Staff, Mack McLarty.   He clearly raises serious questions.  There has been some progress in  baseball over the last several years, but still not enough.  But the  President intends to continue to go to the ball game.              Q   Is he going to say anything about it today, or see  Reverend Jackson while he's out there?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if he is going to see  them, but as I said, the President believes that Reverend Jackson has  raised some serious questions, and it's something that, as I said,  even though there has been progress, it's clearly not enough.              Q   Did Reverend Jackson ask him not to go to the ball  game?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure about that.  I believe  the characterization the Reverend Jackson is talking about is an  informational pickett.  I don't know that he asked him not to go to  the ball game, but he sent a long, detailed, formal letter outlining  his concerns with the situation in major league baseball and the  President read it.              Q   George, the Orioles are playing the Rangers, the  managing partner of the Rangers is George W. Bush.  Is he going to be  there, and is he going to meet with the President?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.              Q   What is the Mubarak schedule?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I know that President Mubarak is  coming tomorrow morning for a working meeting, they will have a  lunch, and I believe that he is having dinner tonight with Vice  President Gore.              Q   And joint statements tomorrow --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe so, yes.  At the end,  yes.              Q   Is there evidence, George, that the Egyptians did  warn the U.S. about a potential terrorist bombing -- terrorist  activities?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As reported in The New York Times,  I mean, I think that President Mubarak did say that there has been  general conversations with the Egyptians, as there have been for a  long period of time.  We do have general intelligence sharing, I  mean.  But President Mubarak was very careful to point out that there  was no specific information on this visit that was passed forward.   The President will continue to investigate the situation, but he also  reiterates his belief that we cannot tolerate terrorism of any kind.              Q   George, he did make specific -- or the Egyptians,  apparently, did issue specific warnings about this individual who,  forgive me --this individual who, forgive me the name escapes me at  the moment, and said the Egyptians were more or less rebuffed in  their attempts to get some kind of action.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know if I would  agree with your characterization of the Mubarak interview.  He did  say that they gave general warnings about the possibility of a  network in the United States and upon which we took appropriate  action.  But there was no specific information on this specific  operation at all.              Q   So, the White House doesn't feel that any of the  law enforcement agencies whether it be the CIA or FBI who would have  received this kind of information was lax or derelict in its duty in  not pursuing some kind of --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, not at all.              Q   What's next with Serbia?  It got only a passing  mention in the news conference yesterday --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  You didn't get to ask your  question.              Q   Yes, exactly.  Was there any agreement on concerted  action between the two countries?  And even if there wasn't, what  does the U.S. do next?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the U.S. is clearly going  to move forward in the U.N. today continuing discussions with our  allies on a sanctions resolution and we'll continue to look for ways  to press the Serbians to come to the negotiating table and sign an  agreement.              Q   George, why do you think sanctions is still an  option?  I mean the Serbians make it clear that at least the  leadership is surviving just fine and they feel like they can wait  you out and even the administration officials we had in the other day  said there's no evidence that they're going to have an effect any  time soon.  The Bosnian Serbs have said no to the peace plan.  When  does no mean no and you have to do something different?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean we are doing something  different.  We're moving forward on further sanctions through the  U.N. and those discussions will continue.  We're going to continue to  try and tighten the noose on Serbia, and I think that every  opportunity we have to do that will have an effect over time.              Q   Are we looking again at lifting the arms embargo?  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has said that this is something  that is under consideration.              Q   George, do you have any more on Hugh Rodham's  condition, how he's doing?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As far as I know nothing's changed.              Q   George, -- week after Mr. Mubarak?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's a little unclear.  I think  we'll be able to get you more either tonight or tomorrow morning  after the Mubarak visit.              Q   Is he going somewhere for Easter?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not that I know of.              Q   What more can you tell us about the additional aid  to Russia that the President plans to ask Congress about?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's going to be consulting with  the Congress and with our G-7 partners over the next couple of weeks.   I know that he spoke last evening with Congressman Gephardt and their  delegation before the -- the congressional delegation meets with the  Russians this week and those consultations will continue over the  next several weeks.              Q   Do you expect that package to be of the magnitude  of the one announced Sunday?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not going to discuss the  magnitude.              Q   How about the list of Cold War restrictions, where  do you stand on that --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As the President said yesterday,  he's going to be looking for that list from the Congress this week  and reviewing it.  He believes -- he's going to try and get it this  week and he's going to review the list, and we're going to take a  hard look at it.              Q   But they're making it up?  I mean it's no White  House involvement, Congress is compiling this list?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he's going to talk to the  congressional leaders about compiling the list but I'm certain we'll  be able to get our own researchers working as well.              Q   George, isn't lifting the arms embargo more of a  probability than a possibility?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's something that's under  discussion.              Q   Secretary Christopher has said that it's a matter  of time and -- for months before that happens.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, all I can say is that it's  something that the President is reviewing.  Right now we're working  with our allies in the U.N on a sanctions resolution, and we'll  continue to review other matters.              Q   George, can you tell us anything about the schedule  this week?  Any travel?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They just asked about that.  I  don't have anything more beyond tomorrow's visit with Mubarak right  now.              Q   Are there consultations, George, with any Jewish  American organizations concerning Jackson-Vanick?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As you know the National Conference  of Soviet Jewry has a list of, I believe,        MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- as you know, the National  Conference of Soviet Jewry has a list of, I believe, 200 Refuseniks.   We'll certainly take a look at that and continue appropriate  discussions.              Thanks. \",\"Yes,  Take Interstate I-70 to the route 48 exit.  Go south on 48 about 2-1/2 miles.  Trun right on Shiloh Springs Road.  The hamvention is at the Harrah arena, which is about 1 mile west and on the north side of the Road.  Parking at the arena is limited.

I'm surprised they couldn't find a sprint car race (mini cars through pigpens, indeed!) on short notice.  George\",\"   I think that you are changing the meaning of \\\"values\\\" here. Perhaps it is time to backtrack and take a look at the word.  value n. 1. A fair equivalent or return for something, such as goods or service. 2. Monetary or material worth. 3. Worth as measured in  usefulness or importance; merit. 4. A principle, standard, or quality considered inherently worthwhile or desirable. 5. Precise meaning, as of a word. 6. An assigned or calculated numerical quantity. 7. Mus.  The relative duratation of a tone or rest. 8. The relative darkness or lightness of a color. 9. The distinctive quality of a speech or speech sound.   In context of a moral system, definition four seems to fit best. In terms of scientific usage, definitions six or eight might apply. Note that these definitions do not mean the same thing.  In my mind, to say that science has its basis in values is a bit of a reach. Science has its basis in observable fact. Even the usages of the word \\\"value\\\" above do not denote observable fact, but rather a standard of measurement. I would conclude that science does not have its basis in values, and so your statement above fails. In fact, if one concludes that a scientific set of measurements (values) are based on systems derived from observation, then it must follow that in a scientific context, there is no such thing as there is no such thing as \\\"objective values.\\\"  Back to the present. This has nothing to do with a moral system anyhow. Just because the word \\\"values\\\" is used in both contexts does not mean that there is a relationship between the two contexts.  If one is to argue for objective values (in a moral sense) then one must first start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective. Considering the meaning of the word \\\"objective\\\" I doubt that this will ever happen.  So, back to the original question:  And objective morality is.....?  If you can provide an objective foundation for \\\"morality\\\" then that will be a good beginning. \",\" I think you meant Quadra 800 ..... (but a Centris 800 probably would be a real nice machine... :)  )  But yeah, it needs 80ns not 60ns.  Joel \",\" Ok, so there are in fact two distinct components transmitted by the chip; the real message encrypted with the \\\"conventional\\\" key, and the serial number and encrypted \\\"conventional\\\" key encrypted with the (IMHO kind of bogus, as the whole concept of \\\"one key that millions of people use which can't be changed\\\" doesn't seem reasonable) \\\"family key\\\".  Suppose I analyze the output of this chip and I'm able to determine which bits are the encrypted packet which contains the serial number and session key.  Suppose I also design a simple algorithm based on this information which takes the data containing the encrypted session key and twiddles a bit (or several) before it's sent down the line.  Mind you, I'm sure the NSA thought of this along with a dozen other attacks I can't imagine, and the system is probably somehow designed so that manipulation of this information will cause a compliant receiving chip to somehow fail to decrypt successfully.  But how? What if the two parties agree in advance on some kind of consistent bit-twiddling scheme, so the decryption chip sees the restored \\\"proper\\\" bitstream but an eavesdropper gets a E[K; UK] packet that's wrong?  I suppose this could be easily defeated if the chip \\\"sends\\\" that information out many times in slightly different ways, making it effectively impossible to be certain you know all the information being sent.\",\"I hope that this comes off as a somewhat unbiased assesment of WFAN and WIP(I go to school in Philadelphia, and I listen to both stations on a consistant basis.)  Now that the fan has Mike Lupica on from 10 to noon, they have a person who can get the  big name guests for interviews, and not just of local importance He did have Dave Cheketts and Fred Wilpon on his show, but he  had Bob Costas and Magic Johnson on too.     Now here are my opinions of the two stations competing talent: Morning show:   In my opinion, I think Imus is much better than Bruno, Cataldi,  and Morganti, even though I would feel different if Morganti had a better crew of people to work with.  To me, WIP tries to copy Imus but make it all sports as a theme.  In terms of sports, Imus lacks the blanketing of the airwaves, but he interjects humor and politics into his show. 10 AM to 12 Noon:   I think Chuck Cooperstein and Lupica are equal in their abilities to host a radio show, but I think Chuck has the advantage over Lupica in terms of dealing with the caller who is asking about who the local team is going to draft in the sixth round.  Lupica and the other hosts on FAN get better interview guests, but I heard the PD of WIP say that they were not interested in interviews with celebrities unless it was a major story.   I would consider this even because they are two different styles of host.  12 Noon to 2 PM:   At this point, I would have to give a big advantage to  Jody McDonald over Len Berman because Lenny has only been on for a couple of weeks.  I just think JM has the ability to transcend the \\\"homer\\\" mentality of the Philadelphia fan base.  This is most evident when the IGGLES(Philadelphia  spelling) play the Cowboys because JM is a huge Dallas fan. Where else can you have people call up and predict a 93-0 score without the egging of the hosts(re:WIP morning 'guys') I do agree that JM was great on the FAN weekend overnight and I miss hearing him over the current crop of rotating hosts.  I feel that JM is the best sportstalk host on  either station by a good margin.  If you are in NY and you can't get WIP, JM does fill in on the weekends sometimes.  2PM to 4PM:   This is the time when JM goes up against Francesa and  Russo(fatso and froot loops) and I become the most divided in my loyalties.  Mike and the dog are very entertaining, but they often go an hour or so without calls or even 10 to 20 minutes without talking about sports.  MATD do get great guests and that is the basis for their show, so it is like the 10 to 12 debate.  Another plus is the appearances by Mike and Chris on Imus in the Morning, which are often hilarious.    4 PM to 7 PM:   MATD go up against Fredericks and Missanelli.  I like Mike Missanelli but I just can't stomach Steve Fredericks.   I know that SF came from Philly originally, but when he was at the FAN, he was a NY homer as much as he is a Philly homer now.  I don't listen to WIP much after 4 PM unless there is a game on that night, but you will see later for the  reason.  That is why I give the advantage to FAN.  7 PM to Midnight:   S&M are on WIP until 8 and then it is the man who makes Eli that calls MATD all the time seem like a novice on charges of racism, G Cobb.  This man is so grating on my nerves that if I listen to him for a few minutes I go nuts.(I know that is biased, but listen to his show) On FAN, there is usually a game on, Knicks, Rangers, Mets Jets, or St. John's basketball.  If the game is on the west coast, then it is usually Howie Rose.  Of course I think dead air would be better than G Cobb on WIP, but WIP does air Sixers and Flyers games during the season. (If this is the sports station, why did they lose the IGGLES to WYSP(home of Howard Stern in Phil.)) During the summer, it is all talk on WIP.   Overall, I would have to give the advantage to WFAN, with the exception of 10 to 12, and 2 to 4 where it is even, and 12 to 2 where WIP has the advantage.                   Rich\",\"...

Most atheists are perfectly willing to acknowledge the existence and ministry of Jesus--but are quite capable of rationalizing the miracles and the resurrection into  misunderstandings, hoaxes, or simple fabrications.  They can always make an analogy with the _Iliad_, a book that tells the story of the historical Trojan War, but also talks about gods and goddesses and their conversations.   I don't think it's possible to convince atheists of the validity of  Christianity through argument.  We have to help foster faith and an understanding of God.  I could be wrong--are there any former atheists here who were led to Christianity by argument?\",\"Well, I'm back from Tokyo, so here are the standings after the April 13 update.   - Andrew  USENET Hockey Draft Standings Week 27  Posn Team    Pts Proj Cash Last Posn  1.

Of cause, the R4-version  did not know about the xpTableWidgetClass (we used tableWidgetClass    instead - caught from the net in times of R3) and XpTableChildPosition    (formerly XtTblPosition).  Since compiling with R5, the program causes a zero width or height error  (on sparc-stations). The trouble-shooter is the (re)computation of the  model_init_table - table widget: though its childs (label and asciiText   widgets) exist, XtQueryGeometry returns a prefered width and height of    zero.   Thus the following asignment cannot perform anything else but set the    width and height of the newly created widget to zero. No wonder XtPopup   or XtManage- Child create zero width or height errors (dependent on    whether width and height of the shell widget are set in the resource    file or not).    Question: Does anyone know, why XtQueryGeometry returns so low prefered    values when working on table widgets or perhaps what    to do about?   I'll be happy, if someone is able to help me.

Most of the other models are in the same class, but aren't the first cars you would think of. I threw in the Escort/Tracer because it has a good amount of Japanese technology and has similar reliability stats.  I didn't include domestic small cars such as the Cavalier, Sunbird, Shadow, Sundance, Tempo, and Topaz, since I think Saturn is going after cars that have at least some degree of Japanese roots.  The SC1/SC2 was meant to compete against the following cars:  Toyota Paseo Honda Civic Si/Civic Coupes/del Sol Si Nissan NX1600/NX2000 Mazda MX-3 Isuzu Impulse Geo Storm Ford Escort GT   If you look at the prices of these cars, they're more expensive than they're 4-door counterparts.  The is good reason for this.  It is a more upscale and trend-driven market.  Even though many of these models are based on sedan platforms, their interior, etc. is good enough to warrant slightly higher prices.  Here are some of the platform derivations I can think of:  Tercel -> Paseo Sentra -> NX1600/NX2000 Civic -> del Sol 323 -> MX-3 (not sure on this one) Stylus -> Impulse/Storm  To illustrate, a Tercel starts at around $8000, while the Paseo starts at around $11,000.  Even a 4-door Tercel will cost less than a 2-door Paseo.  Now, you might be saying that the Tercel doesn't offer the power that some 4-doors offer.  What I mean is that there is no 4-dr Tercel with a comparable powerplant as its sport coupe derivative.  Let's take another example: the Isuzu Stylus XS and Impulse XS/Storm GSi.  Both have the same powerplants (a 1.6L 140hp engine), but the smaller 2-dr coupes are generally more expensive. Again, this is because the two-door sport coupe market is a more fashion-oriented and trend-setting segment.  People are willing to pay more money for this type of car.     In short, even though the SC1/SC2 may be smaller, hence \\\"less\\\" car, it's market orientation dictates a slightly higher price than its mechanically equivalent sedan (SL1/SL2) version.

The training course will discuss the applications of satellite data concerning natural resources, renewable energy and the environment.  The training course, organised for the benefit of francophone African experts, will be hosted by ESRIN, the European Space Agency's establishment in Frascati, which is responsible for coordination with the users of data from ESA's remote sensing satellite. Twenty-four experts in the field of remote sensing, selected from 19 francophone countries from northern, western and central Africa, and three regional African centres, will attend the two-week session. The course will focus on remote sensing techniques and data applications, particularly ERS-1 data.  The ERS-1 satellite, developed by ESA and launched in 1991 with the European Ariane launcher, carries an advanced radar instrument and is the first in a series of radar remote sensing missions that will ensure availability of data beyond the year 2000. The aim of the training course is to increase the potential of experts using the practical applications of radar remote sensing systems to natural resources, renewable energy and the environment, with particular emphasis on applications to geology and mineral prospecting, oceanography and near- coastal areas, agriculture, forestry and meteorology.  The education and practical training programme was developed jointly by the United Nations and ESA. The facilities and the technical support, as well as lecturers and information documents for the training course, will be provided by the Agency. Lecturers at the training course will include high-level experts from other European and African organisations active in remote sensing applications. Funds for the training course are being provided by the United Nations    Trust Fund for New and Renewable Sources of Energy; the primary contributor to that Fund is the Government of Italy.\",\" There was a recession, and none of the potential entrants could raise any money.

But it would still not mean that homeopathy qualifies as a science.  This is where you and I disagree with Turpin.  In order to have science, one must have a theoretical structure that makes sense, not a mere collection of empirically validated random hypotheses.  Experiment and empirical studies are an important part of science, but they are merely the culmination of scientific research.  The most important part of true scientific methodology is SCIENTIFIC THINKING.   Without this, one does not have any hypotheses worth testing.  (No, hypotheses do not just leap out at you after you look at enough data. Nor do they simply come to you in a flash one day while you're shaving or looking out the window.  At least not unless you've done a lot of really good thinking beforehand.)    The difference between a Nobel Prize level scientist and a mediocre scientist does not lie in the quality of their empirical methodology.   It depends on the quality of their THINKING.    It really bothers me that so many graduate students seem to believe that they are doing science merely because they are conducting empirical studies.  And it bothers me even more that there are many fields, such as certain parts of psychology, where there seems to be no thinking at all,  but mere studies testing ad hoc hypotheses.    And I'm especially offended by Russell Turpin's repeated assertion that science amounts to nothing more than avoiding mistakes.  Simply avoiding mistakes doesn't get you anywhere.    -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems  less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \",\"Finally got my computer fixed and I'd like to sum up.  About hard drive companies: the original 160 meg drive that was bad (bad sector or something) was an IBM.  The new one is a Quantum.  Is the LCIII supposed to be shipped with IBMs?  Is there a quality difference?  Apparently! :)  Second, about hard drive position.  I've put the LCIII on its side and the new 160 HD has had no problems at all.  I've even switched back and forth between horizontal and vertical and there are no problems.

I was walking down the streets on our campus, and a beggar came up and asked me for any spare change I might have.  I had a dollar or so that I gave her, and - not wanting to give away all my money to strangers (I generally give a dollar as that will buy a little food at McDonalds or something) - I offered her some \\\"spiritual gifts,\\\" as I called them, rather than gifts of money. I talked of how great I felt that God had made such a pretty day, and how nice it was to give to people - she then said she was getting married soon. She talked about how she and her husband had very little (they may not have even had a house, for all I know), but that they felt a very special love in the Lord, an unselfish kind of caring.  It warmed my heart to know that 2 people can have so little monetarily, and realize that spiritually they are indeed very rich.

[1]  Born 1964 Secretary-Typist Azsantekmontazh Trust Sumgait Construction and Installation Administration Secretary of the SMU Komsomol Organization  Resident at Building 17/33B, Apartment 15 Microdistrict No. 3 Sumgait [Azerbaijan]   On the 27th my sister Marina and I went to the movies the seven o'clock show, at the theater that is across from the City Party Committee, about 50 yards  away. The SK theater. They were showing an Argentinian film, \\\"The Abyss.\\\"  Before the film we noticed about 60 to 70 people standing near the podium at  the City Party Committee, but they were silent, there's no conversation  whatsoever, and we couldn't figure out what was going on. That is, we knew it  was about Karabagh, but what it was exactly, what they were talking about, if  someone gave a speech or not, we didn't know. We bought our tickets. There  were 30 or 40 people in the theater. This was a very small number for that  large movie theater. The film started. About 30 minutes later they stopped the film. A crowd burst in. About 60 people. They came up onto the stage. Well  mostly they were young people, from 16 to 23 years old. They demanded that an  Armenian woman come up onto the stage. They used foul language and said that  they were going to show what Azerbaijanis were capable of, what they could do  to Armenian girls. I thought that's what they meant because they had demanded  a girl specifically. Marina and I were sitting together. I told her to move  over, there were some Russian girls sitting nearby. So that if someone  recognized me or if something happened, they would take me, and not Marina.  It got quiet, 2 or 3 girls jumped up to run out, but the door was closed--it's only opened at the end of the   show--and they returned to their seats.  Everyone in the theater was looking at one another, Russians, Azerbaijanis,  people of various nationalities. But no one reacted at all, no one in the  auditorium made a sound. They were silent, looking at one another, and  gradually started to leave. Some guy, a really fat one, says, \\\"OK, we've  scared them enough, let's leave.\\\" They leave slowly, pompously. It seemed to  me that those people were not themselves. Either they had smoked a bunch of  \\\"anasha\\\", or had taken something else, because they all looked beastly, like  they were ready to tear anyone apart. Then it was all over, as though nothing  had happened at all. The film started up again, it was one of those cheerful  films which should have only brought pleasure, made you happy to be alive. We  could barely sit to the end. So it had started at seven it was over by nine,  and it was dark . . .  Marina and I were walking home, Lenin Street, that's the center of town. Lenin Street was packed, just packed with young people. They were shouting,  something about Karabagh and something about Armenians. We weren't especially  listening, because the way we were feeling we didn't know if we were going to  make it home or not, and just what had happened anyway? Public transportation  wasn't running. Incidentally, when we came out of the theater we saw police,  policemen standing there. The director of the movie theater was looking at the doors, because when they were leaving they had broken the glass, the doors  there are basically all glass. Everything was broken. He stood there grief- stricken, but looking as though nothing really big had happened, like some  naughty boys had just broken them quite by accident, with a slingshot. Well,  since he looked more or less calm I decided that, nothing all that super  serious had happened. We went out very slowly; we wanted to catch a bus, we  live literally one stop away. We didn't want to go on foot, not because it was dark, but because something might happen. We flagged down a cab, but the  driver didn't want to take us. We told him we live near the bus station, and  he said he'd take us to the bus station and not a yard farther. I said, well,  OK . . .  So we got into the cab and managed to get there. Something incredible was  happening at the bus station. There was a traffic jam. Public transportation  was at a standstill and everyone was shouting \\\"Ka-ra-bagh,\\\" they're not going  to give up Karabagh. I go home and tell my family what's going on, and there's immediate panic in the house. Mamma says, what should we do? Like the end had  come, they were going to come, kill us, that's it . . . Somehow we managed to  cheer ourselves up: Nothing that bad could happen. Where are we living anyway, just what kind of social order do we have? Somehow we manage to calm Mamma  down. And we went to bed. But no one could sleep. Everyone made as though  nothing had happened.  That was on Saturday. In short, the day went by. We didn't go anywhere and  didn't call our relatives. No one did anything. Because . . . life goes on. That day I realized something was approaching, but what exactly, I couldn't guess.  On the 28th everything was like it was supposed to be, we lived like we always had. There were five of us at home: Mamma, Papa and us, three sisters: Lyuda,  Marina, and I. My sister Lyuda was in Yerevan at the time. We sat at home and  no one went out. Later we learned that a demonstration had started that  morning. It all started . . . They were smashing up stores. We were sitting at home and didn't know anything about it. Then a girlfriend of mine, Lyuda  Zimogliad, came by at around three o'clock I think. We worked together, we did our apprenticeships together, she's a Russian girl. She said that something awful was happening in town. I asked, \\\"Don't they want Armenians? Well what  are they after, if they're already in that state?\\\" She says, no, nothing like  that, it's just a demonstration, but it's awful to watch it. Somehow, it feels like a war has broken out. Public transportation has been stopped . . . The  cabs, the buses, well it's just a nightmare.  Then Papa decides to go to the drugstore, my mother was having allergy  problems at the time . . . He left the house and our neighbor, Aunt Vera, asked him, \\\"Where are you going? Stop! There are such terrible things going on in the courtyard; aren't you afraid to go out?\\\" Papa didn't know what she was talking about. She simply pushed him back into the entryway. He came home  and told Mamma. Mamma said, \\\"Well, if Aunt Vera was talking like that it means that something is really going on.\\\" But we didn't go see her, she's a Russian, she lives across from us. I had to see my friend out. Around five o'clock I  tell Lyuda, \\\"Ok, look, it's time for you to go, it's late already, I'll see  you out.\\\" Mamma says, \\\"You don't need to go, it's too late already, you can  see what the situation in town is.\\\" So we decided to stay home. Dinner was  ready. Mamma says, \\\"Let her eat with us, then she can go.\\\" We sat down at the  table. But no one was hungry, no one was in the mood, we just put everything  out on the table to calm ourselves down, and make it appear that we're eating. We turned on the television, and the show \\\"In Fairy-Tale Land\\\" was coming on.  We cleared the table.  We hear some noise out in the courtyard. I go out on the balcony, but I can't  see what's going on, because the noise is coming from the direction of the bus station, and there is a 9-story building in the way. There is mob of people  . . . I can't figure out what's happening. They're shouting something, looking somewhere, I can't make out what is going on. I go down to a neighbor, she's  an Azerbaijani; we've been friends of her family for about 25 years. I go down to look from their place. I see people shouting, looking at the 5-and 9-story  buildings near the bus station. Just then soldiers set upon them, about 20  people, with clubs. The mob runs off in different directions. I even see  several people from our building. They are looking and laughing . . . I decide that means it's not all that bad if they are laughing: it means they're not  killing anyone. But now the crowd suddenly dashes toward the soldiers. One of  the soldiers cannot manage to get away, they start stomping on him with their  feet, everyone's kicking him . . . I become ill and go home, and explain in  general terms that horrible things are going on out there . . .  can't speak . . . Well, they've probably killed that soldier, the way that crowd is . . . If each of them kicked him just once . . . They took his club away from him and started to beat him with it. But it was far away and I couldn't see if he got up and left or not.  I become terrified and go home and say, \\\"Lyuda, don't go anywhere, stay at our place, because if you go out they could kill you or . . . \\\" Then the crowd  runs over closer toward our building and stands at the 12-story building and  starts shouting something. We go out onto the balcony. All of our neighbors  are also out on theirs, too. Everyone is standing, staring. The mob is  shouting and about 5 minutes later comes running toward our building. As it  turns out, at the 12-story building the Azerbaijani neighbors went down and  kept them from coming in. There's only one entryway there, they could stop  them.  They all run up to our building. Mamma immediately starts closing the windows, afraid that they might throw stones. They have stones and they break the  windows, all of them. There are very many people. We have a large courtyard,  and it's packed with people. They spill up to the first floor so they don't  crush each other. They crawl up on trees, posts, and garages. It's just a huge cloud of people. They break and burn the motorcycle of the Armenian Sergey  Sargisian, from our building. We close the windows and immediately hear  tramping in our entryway. They come up to our fifth floor with a tremendous  din and roar. It's incomprehensible. Mamma told me later that they were  shouting Father's name, \\\"Grisha, open the door, we've come to kill you!,\\\" or something like that. I don't remember that, I was spaced out, kind of. Mamma  says, \\\"Into the bedroom, quickly!\\\" In the bedroom we have two tall beds, part  of our dowry; Mamma says, \\\"Hide there, they probably won't come in there,  they'll ask something, say something, and leave.\\\" She says, \\\"We'll tell them  that we live alone here.\\\" I can't imagine that my parents will stand out in  the hall alone talking with some sort of beasts . . . I go to them and say  that I'll stand together with them, I'll talk with them if they come, maybe I  can find a common language with them, all the more so if they know me: I speak  Azerbaijani more or less, and I can find out what they want. I told Marina and Lyuda to hide under the bed, and my sister Lyuda, I can't remember if I told  her anything or not.  Then . . . they open the door: it's like they blew on it and it broke and fell right into the hall. The crows bursts in and starts to shout: Get out of here, leave, vacate the apartment and go back to your Armenia; things like that. I tell them, \\\"What has happened, speak calmly. One of you, tell me, calmly, what has happened.\\\" In Azerbaijani, they say, \\\"Get out of the apartment, leave.\\\" I  say, \\\"OK. Go downstairs. We'll gather everything we need and leave the  apartment.\\\" I realize that it is senseless to discuss any sort of rights with them, these are animals. They must be stopped. The ones standing in the doorway, the young guys, say, \\\"There are old people and one girl with them. Too bad!\\\" They take two or three steps back. It seems as though I have pacified them with our exchange. Then someone in the courtyard shouts,  commanding them: \\\"Don't you understand what you are saying? Kill them?\\\"  And that was it! That was all it took. They grab Papa, carry him into one room, and Mamma and me into another. They put Mamma on the bed and start  undressing her, beating her legs. They start tearing my clothes, right there,  in front of Mamma. I don't remember where they went, what they did, or how  much time passed. I had the feeling that they beat me on the head, on my body, and tore my clothes, all at the same time, I don't even know what I said. The  atrocities started. I was savagely raped in that room. They argued among  themselves who would go first.  Later, I remember, I came to. I don't know if I'm dead or alive. Someone comes in, someone tall, I think, clean-shaven, in an Eskimo dogskin coat, balding.  He looks around at what's happening. At that instant everything stops. It  seems to me that he is either their commander or . . . that somehow everything depends on him. He looks and says, \\\"Well, we're done here.\\\" They are beating Mamma on the head. They break up the chairs and beat her with the chair legs  . . . She loses consciousness, and they decide that she's dead. Papa . . . was out cold. They want to throw Lyuda off the balcony, but they can't get the  window open. Apparently the window frames are stuck after the rain and the  windows can't be opened. They leave her next to the window. She was thinking  about being thrown out the window and passed out. She's not a real strong  person anyway . . . He looks at me and sees that I'm saying something, that I'm still twitching. Well, I start saying the opposite of what I should be,  which is humbling myself and pleading. I start shouting, cursing . . . they  don't get any entreaty out of me. I  already know that I'm dead, why would I  humble myself before anyone? And he says that if that's what I think, since my tongue is so long . . . maybe he thinks that I still look quite appealing  . . . In short, he commands that I be taken outside.  I no longer saw or remembered what was happening to Marina and Lyuda, I don't  know if they are alive or not. They take me outside. They are dragging me by  my arms, by my legs. They are hitting me against the wall, the railings,  something metal . . . While they are carrying me someone is biting me, someone else is pinching me . . .I don't even know. I think, my God, when will death  come? If only it were sooner . . . Then . . . they carry me out, throw me near the entryway . . . and start kicking me. I lose consciousness . . . What  happened after that, how many people there were, I don't remember.   I come to after a while, I don't remember how long. A neighbor is bringing me  clothing. I'm entirely covered with blood, she puts a dress on me. I remember  that I said the same words over and over again: \\\"Mamma, what happened, Mamma,  what have they done to us, where are we, whose house are we at?\\\" I can't make  sense out of anything. There is a guy standing over me, I sort of know him, he served in Afghanistan, his name is Igor, he brought me indoors. When they all  went to the third entryway and killed a person there, Igor gathered his  courage, took me into his arms, and brought me to the neighbors', even though  he's small-minded, he put himself at risk. Igor Agayev is Azerbaijani; he  served in Afghanistan. There are three brothers. The older brother also served there, I think; now he's stationed here, on the border, in Armenia. Igor  brought me to the neighbors', and then helped me come to my senses, saying,  \\\"Karina, I know you, calm down, I'm not one of them.\\\" How do I know who's who  and what's what? I come to, and they clean me up. I was covered in blood. Then Papa . . . I saw Papa, I saw Mamma. And Marina, too . . . Igor was there when  they dragged Marina and Lyuda out from under the bed . . . Marina . . . Lyuda  said that she was Russian, they said, we'll let you go, we aren't touching the Russians, go. And while they are dragging Marina out she decides she's going  to tell them she's Azerbaijani. Igor immediately grabs Marina's and Lyuda's  hands, because he knows Marina, and knows that she is Armenian and is our  sister, and takes her to the second floor to a neighbor's and starts pounding  on the door so she will open up. She opens the door and Igor pushes them in  there. So they survived.  My sister Lyuda lost consciousness after the bandits started stealing things. While they were going downstairs, taking things downstairs, then coming back  up again, Lyuda seized the opportunity and crawled under the bed and stayed  there. Then, when she was herself again, she found a torn night shirt and put  it on, and some sort of robe and went to a neighbor's on the fourth floor, the one whose apartment I had watched the crowd from, the friend of ours, and  knocked on the door. The neighbor opened and said, \\\"I'm not going to let you  in the apartment because I'm afraid of them. But I'll give you some stockings  and we'll leave the building.\\\" Lyuda says, \\\"I'll stay at your place because of what's going on, they keep going up and down the stairs.\\\" It was just for a  moment, just a moment in life, but the neighbor wouldn't consent. Lyuda came  back to our place and lay under the bed . . .  I came to. Mother was there. I can't remember my supervisor's telephone  number, but something had to be done. Somehow I remembered and called, and he  came to get us. He didn't have any idea what was going on. He thought we were  simply afraid, he didn't know that they were killing us and that we had passed between life and death. He came and got us and took us to the police precinct. There they looked us over. I was having trouble walking, my lungs hurt badly,  it was hard to breathe . . .  My supervisor's name is Urshan Feyruzovich Mamedov. He's the head of our  administration. They took us there. When we were leaving, I saw a great number of buses full of soldiers at the entrance to town. The buses were ordinary  passenger buses. There were very many soldiers. We left around eleven, right  after eleven. If these people could stop what was happening they could save a  great many lives . . . Because the crowd was moving on, toward the school, and what was going on there . . . I think everyone know not only in Sumgait, not  only in Yerevan. Because there they murdered them all one after the next,  without stopping. After us.  I think 14 people died in Microdistrict No. 3, and 10 to 12 of them were from Buildings 4, 5, and 6. In our building one person died, and one old woman died from Building 16, that's the building in front of ours. There young  Azerbaijani men stopped the mob and wouldn't let it into their building.  Incidentally, when we were at the neighbors', Marina called our relatives to warn them, so they would all know what was happening. I called a aunt in  Microdistrict No. 5. They have three neighbors who are Armenians. I said, \\\"Run quickly, I can't explain what's going on; hide, do what you can, just stay alive. Hide at Azerbaijanis', ones who won't give you away.\\\" At that moment  three people came in, policemen. I think they were Azerbaijanis. I was in such awful condition, my face was completely distorted my lips were puffed up,  there was blood, my eye was swollen, no one thought I would ever see anything  out of that eye again . . . my forehead was badly cut, and one-half of my face was pushed out forward. No one would have thought that I would survive, get my normal appearance back, and be able to grasp anything at all. I started to  scream at those people, why did you come, who sent you here, no one wants you  here, haven't you killed people people yet, what are you doing here? One of  the soldiers said, \\\"Don't scream at us. We're Muslims, but we're not from the  Sumgait police. They called in from Daghestan.\\\" So at that point the  Daghestan police were there.  When we got to the police precinct there were an awful lot of police there, there were soldiers, police with dogs, ambulances, firemen . . . I don't know, maybe they were waiting for people to bring them the goners and the seriously  injured to treat them there in the police precinct. I don't know what they  were there for. There were also doctors from Baku there. They examined Lyuda  and me and said, \\\"These women need to go to the Maternity Home, but we don't  know what to do with the rest.\\\"  So they took us, and I lost contact with my parents, my boss, everyone. My  boss said, \\\"Don't worry, I'll find you, no matter where you are, no matter what happens.\\\" We went to the hospital. There we were examined by a department head from the Sumgait Maternity Home, Pashayeva, I think her name was. She  examined us. The ambulance was from Baku; I figured out that the Sumgait  ambulances hadn't done anything, they didn't respond to any calls. People  called and neither the police nor the ambulances showed any sign of life.  That doctor looked me over and I could tell from her behavior that something very good had happened, for she became quite glad. I even thought to myself,  \\\"God, can it be that nothing all that bad is wrong?\\\" She looks me over and  says, \\\"Now why are you suffering so? You don't know what your people have been doing, your people did even worse things.\\\" And I think, great, I have to deal  with her . . . And I felt so bad, I thought, why don't I just die so as not to have to hear more stuff like this from people like her? Here I am in this  condition and being told about something that our people did. I just didn't  have the energy to say, \\\"How could our people possibly be smart enough to  think of something that yours haven't already done?\\\" I stayed there. Then they brought in another woman, Ira B., she was married, and she was raped in her  own apartment, too. There were three of us, Ira, Lyuda, and 1. The next  morning they took Lyuda and Ira away. They didn't do anything to help us. This was in the old Maternity Home, in the combined block. They didn't do anything  more than examine me, that was it. I didn't want any shots or tranquilizer,  nothing. What shots could have calmed me down? I didn't even want to look at  them.  I lay in the ward. Either it just worked out that way or they did it on pur- pose, but I was alone. I was alone even though the wards were packed. That same evening a woman came by and asked me what was wrong with me, that my face was disfigured. She asked what had happened to me, and I said, \\\"Better to ask  your brother what happened, there's no point in asking me, your brother can  better explain what happened.\\\" She fell into a faint. All the doctors threw  themselves at her, and the doctor categorically forbade anyone to come into my ward.  Then people from work came to see me, my boss, his daughter; they brought me  clothing, because I was literally naked. The only thing I had on was a dress,  but the woman who gave it to me was very short, and the dress was way up  above my knees, and the woman orderly said, \\\"I can't believe you put on such a short dress, who are you showing off your legs to here?\\\" I went back to my  ward thinking, just one more thing from something. People from work came and  brought me something in a sack, apples, I think, three or four pounds, but I  couldn't take them. I had become so weak that it was just embarrassing. I said that I couldn't take the apples, and really didn't have any appetite. No one  had to bring me anything. Some woman took the sack . . . And, oh yes! . . .  Then I heard that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history should  be hidden or torn up completely so that no one would know that I was an  Armenian, maybe they wouldn't figure it out from looking at me. So they must  have been thinking that there would be some kind of attack, that something  else would happen. That it would be worse. Or, perhaps, someone was outside on the street, I don't know. In any case, I didn't sleep a wink that night.  The next morning they picked me up, a whole police detail, put me in a bus,  and off we went. I didn't even know where they were taking me. They took me to the club where the troops were, the very one I was in that ill-fated evening. I got off the bus. Near the City Party Committee there were a great many  troops, tanks, armored personnel carriers; the whole scene was terrible. I saw  a few people I knew there, and that calmed me a little. I had already thought  that I was the only one left. So there were five or six of us left in Sumgait  after that night. I still didn't know what happened to my parents, they didn't  come to see me in the hospital, and my boss told me that everything was fine.  I didn't know whether to believe him or not. Maybe he was just trying to calm  me down, maybe something happened on the way. Then I went to the club and saw  a lot of people I knew. They all knew one another, they were all kissing each  other and asking, \\\"What happened, what went on?\\\" Two days later they came to  see me from work. They were there all the time. Each day they came, showed  interest, and were constantly bringing me money. They did everything they  could. Of course I'm most thankful to my boss, the only one of my colleagues  who didn't lose his presence of mind and who didn't change his opinions,  neither before, nor after, nor in the heat of the moment, no matter what  happened. He constantly took an interest. A sincere interest, from the heart  . . . Then, about two days later, the secretary of the Party Committee came,  not from our Party organization, but from the First Trust, which ours is part  of, Comrade Kerimov, a very important figure in our town. He made arrangements with the emergency medical personnel to take me away, because if I sat down by myself I couldn't get up or lie down again. There was something wrong with my lungs, it was hard to breathe. They examined me there several times, there I  lay were several doctors, they all thought that . . . that it must just be  from all the blows, I don't know. They didn't diagnose anything in particular. When I was in the Maternity Home I even asked . . . I made it a point of  insisting that they take me to the trauma section because I felt so awful.  There was no way something inside wasn't broken, my ribs . . . Well they took  me there and took x-rays and said that everything was fine. There were  emergency medical workers on duty in the club. The mother of one of Marina's  friends was there. She was the head doctor at the Sumgait Children's Clinic.  They had every kind of antifever agent in the world, which was exactly what I needed at that moment, I thought. I said that I was having great difficulty breathing, I couldn't seem to get enough air, something was wrong with me. They put tight bandages around my chest and waist. Later I overheard some people saying that I had been cut all over. I think they just saw me being all bandaged up and decided that my breasts and face had been cut . . . But I wasn't cut.  They took us to the Khimik boarding house. We lived there a long time. Soon  appeared representatives . . . They were agitating. At first people would not  talk to them, and drove them off. One of the Armenian women shouted, \\\"We  demand that Seidov come!\\\" The response was, \\\"It's Seidov who sent us.\\\" Seidov  is the Chairman of the Azerbaijani Council of Ministers. The woman said,  \\\"We'll only see Seidov's daughter, have her come here, we'll do the same  things to her that they did to our daughters, and then we'll deal with you  agitators.\\\" And so on. More of them said, \\\"Have Seidov himself come.\\\" This  went on day in, day out. The agitators kept coming and coming, this drove us  out of our wits. Then people gradually started departing for Yerevan because  they realized it was senseless to stay. Everything got on our nerves: The  smell, the small children. There were children at the SK club, children who  had literally just come out of the Maternity Home. What were they doing in a  club that didn't even have running water all the time? At first we had to pay  to eat there. They even overcharged us, as it turned out. On the second day  someone told us that they would bring us food for free. The children were ill. Everything stank there. Well imagine about 3,000 people in a small movie  theater with seating for no more than 500. You couldn't sit or lie down, it  was impossible to even move. The stench was awful. Even the smallest infants  took ill overnight there. I heard that they were arriving seriously ill in  Yerevan, the infants. They have to be washed, they have to be bathed, not to  mention that we, the adults, were ill and needed care. People were fainting  right and left. I just don't know, everyone was crying, everyone . . . Only  the young people, the men, somehow managed to keep it together. But the women  were in a constant state of panic. It seemed to everyone that they would come  any minute and kill and stab. It seemed clear that we had been gathered  together purposely, like during the war, so that they could burn the movie  theater and there wouldn't be a single Armenian left. Then people went up to  the attic. I didn't see them, I only heard them, because I was lying down and  couldn't get up. I lay right on the stage, we had some room there. Apparently  they caught two people with either oil or gas. I think they wanted to burn the theater. Maybe someone saw them, I didn't. I was in no condition to open my  eyes.  Everyone was suspicious of everyone else. They would ask, \\\"Aren't you an  Azerbaijani? I think I saw you somewhere, I think you're an Azerbaijani.\\\" They led out all the men and started letting them back in by checking their passports, relatives might be covering for each other. Half of the people did not have any documents. There were people who had run out of their homes in  nothing but a pair of pants and slippers, or wearing just a shirt, not like they should have, with their IDs.  So on the 28th, on Sunday, I think, the police did nothing to help us. On Monday everything resumed where it had left off on Block 41A. They didn't  spare a soul there: not children, not pregnant women, nobody. They killed, they burned, they hacked with axes, just everything possible. They murdered  the Melkumian family whom I knew, my mother worked with them. Their daughter- in-law went to school with my older sister. They were brutally murdered. Only  the two daughters-in-law survived. By a miracle one was able to save herself,  she ran away, the neighbors wouldn't take her in, so she ran about the  building until she found refuge. She was pregnant and had two small children.  This all continued on Monday in Block 41A, on the 29th, when the troops were  already in the city.  They murdered people, they overturned automobiles, and they burned entire  families. They say they didn't even know for sure if the people were Armenians or not. I heard that the Lezgins suffered, too. I'm not sure myself, I didn't  see any Lezgins who had been injured. They burned cars so it's very difficult  now to say exactly who died and who didn't. It was very difficult to identify  the corpses, or rather, what remained of the corpses after they were doused in gasoline and burned . . . it's all very hard to imagine, of course I heard  that many people disappeared without a trace, from the BTZ plant two people,  including a woman who worked the night shift, Aunt Razmella, who also lived in Microdistrict 3.  They were stopping buses between Baku and Sumgait. In the evening people who  had been visiting Baku were returning to Sumgait, and people from Baku were  going home from Sumgait, and there were students, too. They were simply  savagely murdered. They were stopping the buses, the drivers immediately did  what they were told because there was just no other way to deal with that  hoard of brutally minded people. They stopped the buses, dragged the Armenians out and killed them on the spot. I didn't see it myself, but I heard that they put them all in a pile so as to burn them. Later it was hard to discern from  the corpses, well you can't call them corpses, you had to figure out from the  ashes who it was. l heard that two fellows saved two women, one a student, Ira G., if I'm not mistaken. She was in the hospital a long time after that, and  she still can't figure out who saved her. She was also brutally raped and  beaten and thrown onto a pile of corpses. The fellow pulled her out of that  whole pile of corpses, put his coat on her, took her into his arms, and  carried her to the city. I still can't imagine how he managed to do that.  I heard that from Engels Grigorian. He knows her, apparently. Well a lot of  people went to that hospital anyway. She was in the hospital and singing a  song in Armenian, and they wrote the words down, and, I think he still has  that piece of paper, because he says that a lot of people now have that song,  the one she sang in the hospital where she lay in such bad shape. They  couldn't find the guy who saved her. He left her in someone's apartment and called the ambulance, she was in such awful shape that, probably, like me, she couldn't remember anyone's face.  I think that I knew one of the people who broke into our house, maybe I had  talked with him once. But I received so many blows everything was just knocked out of my head. I can't remember to this day who he was. Then, it seems, I saw the Secretary of the Directorate's Party organization, where Marina works. She goes to school and works, she goes to night school at AZI, and works by day at the Khimzashchita Construction and Installation Administration. I'm the  Secretary of the Komsomol organization at our administration and often met  with the secretaries of Party and Komsomol organizations. We had joint  meetings. I know them all, I've even talked with them, and he, I know, is from Armenia. An Azerbaijani, but from Armenia. It became obvious that many of  those people were Azerbaijanis born in Armenia.  They took me to various police stations, to the police precinct, and to the Procuracy, because the USSR Procuracy got involved in the case, and I iden- tified the photographs of people who I could more or less recognize. They showed me the people who were in our apartment, they're working on our case, but I can't even recognize them, although it was proved that they were the ones, they're processing it somehow. They tell me that they know that someone held me by the arm and someone else held me by the leg when they were  dragging me. There was someone else in our apartment who did not even touch  me, he just stole a blanket and an earring or something like that. All these  people, all of them, as much as I've heard about them and seen them, they were all from Kafan.  The Secretary of the Party organization is named Najaf, Najaf Rzayev. He was  there when everything started. It must have been him because I didn't  recognize anyone else in the crowd whom I knew besides him. All the more since I told him, \\\"Listen, you do something, because you know me.\\\" He turned away  and went toward the bedroom, where Marina was. Well you couldn't see Marina  anyway. There was such a noisy confusion of people that you couldn't make out  anyone. All of it flew right out of my head, and then gradually I became  myself again, at the City Party Committee . . . There were military people  there. I told them what went on, and they wrote it all down. I told them his  name. On March 8 the Secretary of our First Trust Party organization, the one  we're part of, came to see us, his name is Najaf Rzayev. I tell Mamma, \\\"If he's here despite the fact that I gave his name, it means that either his  alibi has been confirmed or, probably, that they think I'm crazy, not  responsible for my words.\\\" He said, \\\"What did they do to you, how awful,  myself, I hid an Armenian family.\\\" Then after some time goes by he comes back  again and says something entirely different: \\\"I wasn't at home, my family and  I went to Baku.\\\" I said, \\\"Marina, what is he saying? He said something totally different before.\\\" After that I didn't go to see our Procurator, our case is  being handled by a procurator from Voronezh, Fedorov by name. Fedorov told me  that Rzayev's case had just gotten to him, and there were so names involved.  What are they doing with Rzayev? Did he prove his alibi or not? They just think that since I was hit in the  head I can't say anything for sure, whether it was him or not. It will be an  insult if he was in our apartment and doesn't have to pay for it, but at the  same time  I'm afraid to say I'm a hundred percent sure that it was he. Because no mat- ter who I name, they tell me, no, you're wrong, he didn't do that, that one wasn't there. All the faces have gotten mixed up in my mind. Who did what exactly I can't say.                                                       When they took me outside there was a whole crowd there, but I didn't see it,  because I had my eyes closed all the time. It seemed to me that I always got it because of my eyes, people were always hassling me, for some reason it  always seemed to me that my eyes are responsible. When they were beating my  face I thought they were trying to put my eyes out. So I had my eyes closed,  they took me outside and started to beat me. A young guy, 22, held my arms, he works at the BTZ plant. And right nearby, across the road from us, Block 41,  is where all this was going on. Right across the road from us. The BTZ  dormitory is over there, that's where he lives. Now he's in custody, they even have proved, as far as I know, that it was he who killed Shurik Gambarian, the clarinet player from the third entryway of our building. One person in our  building was killed, it was that man.  A guy comes by who shared a room with the guy who was holding me. He saw that he was holding me by the arms and that he was beating me, but he didn't come  over, he just looked and then went into the dormitory. A while after it was  all over, people started making announcements in town saying that  investigators had been summoned. That guy went and told them everything. Now  they've caught him, everything's been proved. Now, evidently, they've been beating him, I don't know what they're doing with them over there, but he  himself said that he was working the night shift at the plant. Some young guy  came to the plant and said, \\\"Everyone who wants to kill Armenians come to the  bus station on Saturday at ten.\\\" That was it. He said, the ones who wanted to, went. This was at the BTZ plant, during the night shift, probably, late Friday night. It was at night, they were at the sauna together. And he said, what do  you mean, do you understand what you are saying? The others were silent,  probably, in their hearts they were thinking, I'm going to go. But they didn't say anything to one another. He said that he thought it important to to go,  because he had heard a lot about what had happened in Kafan, that they had  killed their Azerbaijani sisters, their mothers, burned villages, and all of  that. That guy was also born in Kafan. That is certain. And Marina says that  the Secretary of the Party organization is from Armenia, too.                                                             from  I've participated in the investigation a couple of times. I'm satisfied with them thus far. They summoned us and asked about what happened, and every word  I said was recorded. I met some guy there . . . By the way, he was an  Armenian. I said that he was in our apartment, but what he did, I don't know.  His last name was Grigorian, Eduard Grigorian. He s from Sumgait, from  Microdistrict 1. He was sentenced I think, to five years, not his first time.  His mother is Russian. I met with him at the KGB in Baku, at the Azerbaijani  KGB. They took us there and showed me photographs. There were so many  photographs, I think they even photographed those people who were caught at  curfew, and I've got them all confused. I say, the face was about like this,  the guy in the white coat with the red clasps. But he could take that coat off and burn it somewhere, and it would be like looking for a needle in a  haystack. Well. This guy, Grigorian, I said, he was in our apartment, but he  is so light-complected that he looks like a Lezgin. I don't know what he did,  I can't remember. Maybe he beat me or raped me. But he was in our apartment.  At the KGB he started asking me, pleading with me, there's no need for this,  all this stuff, look me in the eyes, you're like a sister to me. I took a look at him and thought, \\\"My God, Heaven forbid that I should have a brother like  you.\\\" But they were satisfied with my responses, because I said everything  without great certainty. I was there with Mamma. Then Lyuda came in, but when  she came in she got sick immediately. She wanted to kill him, she crawled over the table at him. She recognized him. When she came to, Lyuda was lying on the balcony, the mob threw her there and all of them ran into the bedroom. We had  all kinds of boxes with dishes in them, the dowries for all three sisters.  They stole everything in the apartment, leaving only small things. At that  moment Lyuda came to and started remembering everything. Well, seeing the  faces, hearing the voices . . . Two people were saying they could burn the  apartment. Another says, why burn the apartment when I've got three kids and  no place to live. So this guy was in temporary housing, he didn't have  anywhere to live, he was from Sumgait. They were sure that they would get the  apartment. Besides, the neighbors were Azerbaijani. Why should they burn the  apartment, they might burn Azerbaijanis. That's what they said. How did they  know there were Azerbaijanis there, if they just picked a place, thinking that Armenians lived there? We have a list of the residents for our part of the  building, our name is in there, but how could they know that Azerbaijanis  lived on the other side of the wall from us? So they didn't set fire to our  apartment.  I don't know, I was in such bad shape that if all of it had come to a halt  when I was outside, if someone had asked me what was happening, I would have said that a civil war was going on. Well, maybe not civil . . . but probably civil, because when they were beating me I opened my eyes and saw that all the neighbors were standing on their balconies and watching, like at a free horror film. So a civil war was going on, and only the Armenians were being fought. If it were a world war or something like that, they would have been fighting everyone. But they only fought us. Then I met some women from  our building, some Azerbaijanis. They are crying, they tell me, \\\"Karina, we  saw all of it, how could it happen?\\\" They're asking me! Well I just don't know what to call it if a normal girl can stand there and watch what happened to  me. I think that if it were the other way around either I wouldn't have been  able to take it, or I would have tried to avert it, like that one Azerbaijani  woman did in front of our building. A woman lives there, an awful, dissipated  woman, if you can call her a woman, the dissipated life she leads. Two  Armenian families live there, in her part of the building. She came out on the balcony and saw what was happening to me and started to scream and curse. She  came down to the entryway and said, \\\"You'll come in this entryway over my dead body.\\\" So not one of them took it in his head to go in that entryway. Some  folks were saying that those people were so out of control that they didn't  even know what they were doing. I don't think that's true. They knew very well what they were doing if they didn't even lift a hand against that woman. They  couldn't have cared less about her, but the fact that she was an Azerbaijani  stopped them.  They were just beasts, they had smoked so much. When they came to our place  they were all chewing something. I noticed: Everyone who came into the  apartment was chewing something. I think, my God, maybe I just think that?  Maybe I'm losing my mind? But no, they're all chewing something. Maybe it is  some kind of drug, it must be, because . . . At first glance they all seemed  to be such normal people, young, clean-shaven, looking exactly as if they had  come to some sort of celebration. But they were shouting something. They didn't talk, they shouted, as though there were deaf people there. They  screamed and screamed: \\\"Yeah, killing, killing, we're killing the Armenians!\\\"  Only they didn't shout \\\"kill,\\\" they shouted \\\"gurun ermianlary.\\\" Gurun  literally means \\\"kill,\\\" or \\\"destroy.\\\"  That's how it was! I'll continue. We hid in a captain's apartment, he's an Azerbaijani, his wife is a Tatar. We were sitting in their apartment, their  kids were out in the yard. Their kids knew a whole lot. This was in our part  of the building, on the third floor. When Mamma came to and couldn't find Lyuda she took Papa's hand, this was while the looters were stealing things, but they didn't pay attention because they were stealing things. Apparently they had already ceased killing and switched to stealing. Mamma found the courage to . . .  A boy said to my mother \\\"Where's the gold?\\\" Mamma said he must have been 12  to 14 years old. He even looked Russian, he was so fair-skinned. But the  Azerbaijanis from Armenia are fair-skinned. I noticed they were all on the  fair side. He shouted, they were all smashing things, and he asks Mamma where  the gold is. We kept our gold in the wardrobe with our important papers. In a  little black bag, we kept everything in there. Mamma doesn't really like to  wear gold. She probably never even wore those things from the time they were  bought for her. They took everything that was lying on the cheval glass. Mamma thinks that the gold saved us. Because they threw themselves at the gold, and  Mamma grabbed Papa, who was trying to breathe. They had closed his mouth,  bound his hands, and put a pillow and a chair on his face . . . They had  shoved something into his mouth so he would suffocate. Mamma grabbed him and  tore all that stuff off . . . He had something in his mouth, he was having  trouble breathing, his nose was filled with blood. Mamma grabbed him and  started running from the fifth down to the first floor because no one wanted  to open their doors to them. Mamma said that by accident, completely by  accident that person opened his door, he was sleeping, and said, half-awake,  \\\"What's happened?\\\" He sees that they are bloody. Mamma said, \\\"At least go and  find out what's happening to my daughters, even if they've burned them or  murdered them, at least bring the corpses.\\\" He went looking for us. At that  moment Lyuda was under the bed. She says that after they left it seemed that  someone was calling her name. When he quietly called her she couldn't get out  from under the bed. She wanted to get out and was calling softly. She thought  she was shouting, but in fact she was either silent or was only talking to  herself, it just seemed to her that she was shouting. When she got out from  under the bed everyone was gone. And again . . . She thought that she had lost her mind. I'll never leave here, never! To hell with it! It just seems that  way to me, I'll come to eventually. But then, when everything had settled  down, stopped, that mall brought Lyuda down, and Igor carried me in from outside. Or first I was brought in, then Lyuda, I don't remember what order it happened in.  And Mamma said, \\\"Listen, they're all running around down there, shouting  something or other, and running toward the other building.\\\" It had more or  less calmed down where we were. Who's dead, who's alive, we don't know. I  tried to call my girlfriend. I had basically come to. Mamma says, \\\"Listen; let's go upstairs, at least get a mattress or something. We don't know how  long we'll be here. Maybe they didn't burn everything.\\\" I don't get it, all women have that feeling, they want to get something from their homes, maybe  not everything was taken? I tell Mamma, \\\"Mamma, what do you need any of that  for? To hell with it! We're alive, forget the rest of it, all of it!\\\" She says, \\\"No, let's go get at least something. Maybe we'll leave here, spend the  night at someone else's.\\\" Mamma went upstairs, and their little boy, their son Alik, was standing on the lookout. lIe was standing there to see if they were  coming. They only managed to run up there and grab something one time. He  shouts, \\\"Come back, they're coming!\\\" They didn't have enough time to get a  lot, mattresses from one apartment, a blanket from another . . . Mamma got my  knitting . . . Someone managed to grab our old things, the ones we never wore, out of the hall . . . Someone took Father's old coveralls. The neighbor, his  wife, Mamma and Papa . . . Marina went with them. I was in no condition to  leave. Neither was Lyuda. We just sat. They ran out and we closed the door and just then we hear that the mob is on its way toward our place upstairs,  they're dragging something again. They were going toward the other building,  maybe over by the school, or . . . There was an unfinished building over there, people said they were going toward the basement or the unfinished  building, they could gradually carry everything over there. Then things more  or less calmed down. I tried to call my boss.  Later there was more noise. We were on the third floor, in a one-bedroom apartment, and a woman lives in the one-bedroom place on the second floor, Asya Dallakian. She's an old woman, retired. She wasn't at home, at that time she was usually in the country, she has a married daughter there, and her grandson is in the army. She is only very rarely in town; she gets her retirement money and the apartment is essentially vacant. They started pounding on her door and broke it down. She had two or three beds in there,  something like that, she's a 60-to 70-year-old woman who really does not even  live there. Probably she had some pots, a couple of metal bed frames and  mattresses, and a television. When her grandson came she bought a television.  They started wrecking everything. I started getting sick again. I think, \\\"My  God, what is going on around here? When will this end?\\\" We turned off the  lights and sat. As it turns out the people who weren't afraid, the ones who  knew what was going on, knew not to turn off the lights. We didn't know, but  they didn't come to where we were all the same. They all knew very well that  he was a captain. He went out and closed the door, and we sat in his  apartment. His last name was Kasumov. He's an exserviceman, retired, works up  at the fire station at some plant or other. He went out and stood at his door. They tell him, \\\"Comrade Captain, don't worry, we won't harm you, you're one of us.\\\" He went upstairs, and they say, \\\"Aren't you taking anything from this  apartment?\\\" He says, \\\"I don't need anything.\\\" And the women who were standing  in the yard . . . we have a basement, full of water . . . the women who were  standing in the yard saw. Those guys, they left everything they stole on the  first floor and ran upstairs again. The women threw everything they had time  to into the basement, to save our property. Some things were left: dirty  pillows, two or three other things and a rug. A guy came downstairs, really  mad, and he says, \\\"Where's the rug? I just put it right here!\\\" They tell him,  \\\"Some guy came and took it and went off toward the school.\\\" He ran off in that direction.  Oh! I forgot the most important point. When Igor picked me up in his arms,  there were women standing there who saw everything that was going on. They  just didn't tell me about it for a long time. The wife of that military man,  she didn't want to kill my spirit, I was already dead enough. Later she told  me, that after they murdered Uncle Shurik in the third entryway one of them,  the ringleader, apparently a young man, said, \\\"Where's the girl who was here?\\\" And he became furious. The woman tells him, \\\"She came to . . . \\\" She didn't know what to say: Think something up? Someone carried her off? Then they would comb the whole house and find me and our whole family. So the woman says, \\\"She came to and went to the basement.\\\" Now, our basement is full of water. So the  whole mob dashes off to the basement to look for me or my corpse. They took  flashlights; they were up to their waists in water, water which had been  standing there for years, and soot, and fuel oil. They climbed down in there  to get me. Then one of them said, \\\"There's so much water down there, she  probably walked and walked and then passed out and died. She met her death in  the basement. That's it, we can leave, no problem!\\\" I didn't know that, and  when I was told, I felt worse. Two times worse. A lot worse! So they didn't  just want to pound me flat, something more awful was awaiting me . . .  After that we of course didn't want to live in Sumgait any longer. We really  didn't want to go back to our apartment. When we moved, I went up there and  started to quiver and shake all over, because I started remembering it all.  Although the neighbors all sobbed, it was all . . . so cheap . . . The people  who sat in their apartments and didn't help us at a time like that. I think  that they could have helped! I don't think that they were obligated to, but  they could have helped us! Because that one woman was able to stop that whole  brutal crowd by herself. That means they could have, too. It would have been enough foe one man or women to say, What do you think you're doing?\\\" That's  all! That would have done it. There were 60 apartments in our building. Not  one person said it! When I was lying on the ground and all those people were  standing on their balconies I didn't hear anyone's voice, no one said what are you doing, leave her alone . . . Mamma even told one of the neighbor women  that if it had been an Azerbaijani woman in my place they would have dropped a bomb if it would have killed even one Armenian. They would have stood up for  one of their own. True, they say that our neighbor from the fourth entryway,  an old/ sick woman tried to stop the pogrom. The Azerbaijanis have a custom:  if a woman takes her scarf and throws it on the ground, the men are supposed  to stop immediately. The old woman from the fourth entryway did that, but they stomped her scarf into the ground, pushed her off to the side, and said, \\\"If you want to go on living, you'll disappear into your apartment.\\\" So she left. That trick didn't work on them.  Even the neighbors who helped us move told me, OK, fine, calm down, forget  that it happened. I said I'd only forget it if I told them right then that it had happened to their daughter--and if that didn't have any effect on them,  then I would forget everything, too.

It is very unlikely, however, that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car.  Ham rigs for cars put out around 100 watts.  It is possible that a 100 watt radio would cause interference to consumer electronic 100 feet  away.  Most TVs, stereos, and VCRs have very poor RF shielding. If you experience the problem frequently, it may be  caused by a ham, CBer, or other radio operator in a base station nearby.    The interference may have been caused by a radio  transmitter used for other purposes, such as police, fire, etc.  If you heard voices over your stereo, I think you are correct in assuming that the source is an RF transmitter.  If you have frequent trouble, you may want to try the RF ferrite chokes available at Radio Shack.  The interference is probably being picked up by your speaker wires, and those chokes can be installed on the wires very easily (without cutting them). Good instructions are included with the chokes. If that does not solve the problem, you may want to search your neighborhood for a radio operator.  Look for antennas on the roof or car.  Talk to him/her about your problem.

Thank You, \",\"    John, The problem here is that you have taken one peice of my response, without bothering to connect it with the other parts.  I have repeatedly noted that one needs to take the problematic historcity of acts and then examine the work of John Dominic Crossan and Burton Mack.  Once you have taken the time to examine recent developments in biblical scholarship, I think you will  grasp more clearly what I am saying.     Certainly this is an issue as I think the situation in Waco shows most  clearly.  If all that is required is that people are willing to die for a belief for it to be true, then surely David Koresh is the son of God.  No, the spurrious arguement that the resurrection had to be true for people to be willing to die must be put to rest.  The other problem is that it is so  monologocentric.  Even if the resurrection was a big deal (which it doesn't seem to have been for either Q, Thomas, or even John to a certain degree) there are a lot of other things which the Early Christians could have been doing together that would have been worth dying for.  It is my belief that even the idea of a mixed race community, which brought down regional/national boundaries in the name of koinonia could have been enough for people to be willing to die.  Radical communties do that (e.g. Jonestown, Waco, Warsaw, etc) But my original point was that roman persecution (which is the only persecution we have documented proof of) was not about whether a carpenter came back from the dead.  Such a claim was not unique nor particularly abhorent to the roman or greek mind.  My point is that avoidance of military and civic duty (i.e. emperor worship) would have been much more problematic -- which has nothing to do with the resurrection at all.  When nero used christians as human  torches to light up his dinner party it wasn't because the believe in a  risen savior, it was because they were supposedly involved in incest and cannablism.  The argument that christians were martyred for the resurrection just cannot stand up to critical examination.\",\"   Must there be a \\\"why\\\" to this?  I ask because of what you also      assume about God-- namely, that He just exists, with no \\\"why\\\"      to His existence.  So the question is reversed, \\\"Why can't      we assume the universe just exists as you assume God to      \\\"just exist\\\"?  Why must there be a \\\"why\\\" to the universe?\\\"   It may be that one day man not only can create life but can also      create man.  Now, I don't see this happening in my lifetime,      nor do I assert it is probable.  But the possibility is there,      given scientists are working hard at \\\"decoding\\\" out \\\"genetic      code\\\" to perhaps help cure disease of a genetic variation.      Again, though, must there be \\\"why\\\" or a \\\"divine prupose\\\" to      man's existence?   As far as we can tell, man falls into the \\\"mammal\\\" catagory.  Now,      if there were something more to the man (say, a soul), then      we have yet to find evidence of such.  But as it is now, man      is a mammal (babies are born live, mother gives milk, we're      warm-blooded, etc.) as other mammals are and is similar in      genetic construction to some of them (in particular, primates).

As I've noted before, I'm not necessarily disputing the benefits of  eliminating anti-competitive legislation with regard to auto dealers, barbers, etc.  One need not, however, swallow the entire libertarian agenda to accomplish this end.  Just because one grants the benefits of allowing anyone who wishes to cut hair to sell his/her services without regulation does not mean that the same unregulated barbers should be  free to bleed people as a medical service without government intervention.   (As some/many libertarians would argue.)    On a case by case basis, the cost/benefit ratio of government regulation is obviously worthwhile.  The libertarian agenda, however, does not call for this assessment.  It assumes that the costs of regulation (of any kind) always outweigh its benefits.  This approach avoids all sorts of  difficult analysis, but it strikes many of the rest of us as dogmatic,  to say the least.  I have no objection to an analysis of medical care, education,  national defense or local police that suggests a \\\"free market\\\" can provide a more effective, efficient means of accomplishing social objectives than is provided through \\\"statist\\\" approaches.

BUT government  should supply those necessary goods and services only when it is impossible  for a private enterprise (or individual) to make money from providing them. I agree with some of the other posts that this train probably can not make  money and will rely heavily on State tax dollars.    The question, I think, then becomes:  Do we, the general public, need the train?  I certainly do not, nor will I ever, need this train in Lubbock, Texas.

Does He grade on a curve, does He cheat? That is interesting. Not to mention thought provoking. My own concept is that He is a Father and we are His children. In that He loves us, with a love that we can never understand until we are with Him. The Bible says that He looks on the heart as the final measure. From that perspective, in a grading context, the heart is the final test. Specifically, most Christians would agree that there is only one Heaven and one Hell. From that perspective, it is Heaven or Hell. You either go to one or the other. The \\\"grading\\\" on a pass/fail basis is done by God the Father with intervention by Jesus the Son. Not by others. For only God sees the heart. The Bible says of the heart, \\\"...who can know it.\\\" I would say there has always been, and always be, an unchanging method. That is what makes a relationship with Christ so secure. In an uncertain and ever changing landscape He is always the same. Yesterday, today and tomorrow. Concerning whether or not our childhoods are considerd as part of the test, my own conviction is no. Were that the case I certainly wouldn't be going to Heaven. The Bible speaks very plainly about the love and care Jesus had for and about children. The reality is that we are all children. Some of us just have bigger bodies and grey hair. But the Father, our Father is always there. Like most Fathers He wants only the best for His own. There maybe decipline, but there is more love. It's sometimes looks like Christianity is a test, to see who makes it and who doesn't. Those who do pass=Heaven, and those who don't go to the other place. But it is really much more than that... There are few experts. Most of us are just travelers looking for the light and the way Home. Praying that we can bring others with us. \",\" Hey!

Quite the reverse...\",\" Stop! Hold it! You have a few problems here. Official history says that  the first accusations of homosexuality in the SA came from OUTSIDE of the Nazi  party, long BEFORE the Nazis ever came to power. So this objection is a red herring, even if established history is wrong on this point. Moreover, none of  the histories I've read ever made mention of Hitler or anyone else ever using  homosexuality as a pretext for purging Roehm. A point I saw reiterated was that Hitler and the party covered up these accusations. If you are going to accuse official history of being a fabrication, you should at least get your facts right. The pretext for purging Roehm was that he was planning to use the SA in a coup against Hitler. Nowhere is there mention of using allegations of homosexuality as a pretext for the purge, nor as a justification afterwards (it is possible that the histories I've read have not mentioned this, but I doubt it - would it be in Hitler's best interest to admit to the world that his former right hand man was a homosexual?).   Anyway, as I said before, it is always possible that I have missed references  to the Nazis making use of charges of homosexuality against the SA after the  night of the long knives - but this does not prove that they were false. Even  the Nazis could tell the truth when it was to their advantage. In any case,  this does not deal with accusations of homosexuality in the SA during the  1920's.   Ah, yes. I forgot this was being posted to alt.conspiracy. I can smell the paranoia from here. Since the Nazis never officially charged Roehm with  homosexuality (at least, not according to what I've read), I'd like to know  what tainted \\\"evidence\\\" you are talking about. Since the accusations were made  by persons outside of the Nazi party, long before it came to power, and those  accusations were common knowledge to journalists and others in Germany in the  1920's and 30's, just how would it be possible for the Nazis to go back in  time and plant \\\"tainted\\\" evidence? How exactly does one doctor newspapers  which were circulated around the world, without the discrepancies being  obvious? What actual incidences of Nazi doctoring evidence on this matter do you know about? And what about the testimony of people who were involved in  these matters, some of whom were not Nazis? And what is the point of making a  false accusation of homosexuality if you do not publicize it? Since the point  here seems to be to discredit established history, then the burden of proof  falls on the revisionist. The revisionists had better do their homework  before making accusations. Otherwise they simply look like conspiracy nuts.   This is just about the *only* thing we agree on.   I suspect that the notion that there might have been bad people - Roehm and  his SA buddies - who were homosexuals must disturb some people. The feeling seems to be that if a nasty individual is accused of homosexuality, that this must be an attempt to bash homosexuals. This fear - often justified - is what lies behind this distrust of official history, or so it seems to me. But this is not a good justification for trashing accepted accounts of this subject. If  you really think that historians are so incompetent, why don't you write them  and ask where they got their sources on this subject, if you can't tell from  their footnotes? I'm a graduate student in history. Writing to professors and tracking down sources is old hat. But my time is limited and this is not my specialty - and neither you nor anyone else have said anything that would cast one shred of doubt on existing evidence. I'm not going to waste my time trying to debunk someone's paranoia. Do the research yourself.   Given that you already consider all evidence \\\"tainted\\\", what on earth would constitute concrete particulars? And since when have concrete particulars been considered \\\"shrewd guesses\\\"?  I suggest that those who do not trust popular historians (Irving et al) - historians writing for a popular audience do not, as a rule, provide copious  footnotes - should try instead reading academic historians, who usually  provide footnotes to all their sources in immmense detail. This is the place  to start looking. Assuming that one really wants to know the truth.  I'll bet the folks on alt.pagan are tired of this subject already. My apologies - we seem to have gone off on a bit of a tangent.

In terms of laws regarding individual rights, restrictions on police searches, etc... (all closely related to crime) Canadian laws parallel England's and differ greatly from those of the United States.     Actually, they do not have \\\"roughly the same... urban economy\\\",  and extremely different ethnic composition.   However, if you account for economic and ethnic differences, the difference disappears completely: Seattle's minorities are predominatly poor, while Vancouver's are middle or upper class. The rates for whites in both cities were found to be identicle, while the rate for poor, Seattle minorities was almost three times as great as for the well-to-do minorities of Vancouver. The pattern seems to be one of poverty and race relations, not one of gun control.   That is a gross distortion: \\\"Self-defense\\\" does not mean killing the attacker. There were 21 cases of civilians killing their  attacker in self-defence. But such cases represent less that 0.5% of the crimes prevented by armed self-defence; for every case you cite, there were over 200 other cases of self-defence where the crime was prevented but the attacker was not killed. (0.5%, by the way, is the most conservative possible figure, based on the National Crime Survey's estimate of 80,000 crimes prevented by armed self-defence each year. Most other  studies on the subject put the figure at 500,000 to 600,000. Those figures would imply less than 0.08% of sucessful self-defences involve killing the attacker.)   So, more correctly, there over 4000 (possibly as many as 25,000)  cases of civilians acting in self-defence, only 21 of which resulted in the death of the attacker. This is a significant factor, in comparison to the 592 homicides. If memory serves, homicides make up approximately 1% of the violent crimes the study considered, so the fair comparison would be 40 - 250 homicides prevented and 592 homicides. Clearly, the study can not be close to accurate, since it ignored these cases of self-defence.\",\"   Both of these symptoms are related - tachycardia. Getting a flushed face is due to the heart pumping the blood faster than a regular pulse.  I suspect this is related to an increase in sodium levels in the blood, since note *sodium chloride* monosodium glutamate. Both are sodium compounds. Our bodies require sodium, but like everything else, one can get too much of a good thing.   Again, this could be related to increased blood flow from increased heart rate, from the sodium in the MSG. Distended crainial arteries, essentially. One of many causes of headaches. There is no discrepency her, necessarily.    Well stomache ache and vomiting tend to be related. Again, not necessarily a discrepency. More likely a related reaction. Vomiting occurs as a response to get rid of a noxious compound an organism has eaten. If a person can't digest the stuff (entirely possible - the list of stuff people are allergic to is quite long), and lacks an enzyme to break it down, gastrointestinal distress (stomach or belly ache) would be expected.     These are respiratory reactions, and are now considered to be similar to vomitting. They are a way for the body to dispose of noxious compounds. They are adaptiove responses. Of course, it is possible some other food or environmental compound could be responsible for the symptoms. But it's important to remember that a lot opf these effets can be additive, synergystic, subtractive, etc, etc. It would be necessary to know exactly what was in a dish, and what else the person was exposed to. Respiratory does sound suspicious BUT  resopiration and heart rate are connected.  Things in the body are far from simple...very inetractive place, the vertebrate body.    People respond in a myriad of ways to the same compound. It depends upon what it is about the compound that \\\"pisses off\\\" their body. Pollen, for example, of some plants aggrivates breathing in many people, because, when inhaled, it sets of the immune system, and an histamine attack is launched. The immune system goes overboard, causing the allergic person a lot of misery. And someone with an allergy to some pollens will have trouble with some herb teas that contain pollens (Chamomile, linden, etc). Drinking the substance can perturb that person's system as much as inhaling it.    See above. And don't think that heart rate changes, and circulatory problems are not serious. They can be deadly.  and brain damage.   The area of the brain effected is the neuroendocrine system controlling the release of gonadotropin, the supra-hormone controlling the cyclical release of testosterone and estradiol, as well as somatostatin, and other steroids. Testing for effective dose would be, uh, a wee bit unethical.   poisoning.   Absolutely. But it could also be some synergystic mess from eating , say, undetected shrimp or mushrooms (to which many are allergic), plus too much alcohol, and inhaling too much diesel fumes biking home, plus, let's say, having contracted flu from one's sig. other 3 days before from drinking out of the same glass.

We were   having intermittent problems with our mail at the time. Please excuse me   if you have seen this before...  Should Christians fight?  Last week Alastair posted some questions about fighting, and whether there   are such things as \\\"justifiable wars\\\". I have started looking into these   things and have jotted down my findings as I go. I haven't answered all   his questions yet, and I know what I have here is on a slightly different   tack, but possibly I'll be able to get into it more deeply later, and post   some more info soon.  Our duty to our neighbour:  Do good to all men (Gal 6:10) Love our neighbour as ourselves (Matt 22:39)  Act the part of the good Samaritan (Luke 10) toward any who may be in   trouble. We will therefore render every possible assistance to an injured   man, and therefore should not be part of any organisation which causes   people harm (even medical corps of the army etc).  Christians are by faith \\\"citizens of the commonwealth of Israel\\\"   (Ephesians 2:11-12), and also recognise that \\\"God rules in the kingdoms of   men\\\", and therefore we should not be taking part in any of the struggles   of those nations which we are not part of due to our faith.  We are to be \\\"strangers and pilgrims\\\" amongst the nations, so we are just   passing through, and not part of any nation or any national aspirations   (this can also be applied to politics etc, but that's another story). We   are not supposed to \\\"strive\\\" or \\\"resist evil\\\" (even \\\"suffer yourselves to   be defrauded\\\") it is therefore incosistent for us to strive to assist in   preserving a state which Christ will destroy when he returns to set up   God's kingdom.  Our duty to the state.  \\\"Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar's and unto God   the things which be God's\\\" (Luke 20:25). \\\"Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power   but of God; the powers that be are ordained of God. Whosoever resisteth   the power, resisteth the ordinance of God\\\" (Rom 13:1-2). \\\"Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake; whether   it be to king as supreme... for so is the will of God that with well doing   ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men\\\" (1 Pet 2:13-15)  These scriptures make it clear that submission to the powers that be is a   divine command, but it is equally clear from Acts 5:19-29 that when any   ordinance of man runs counter to God's law, we must refuse submission to   it. The reason for this is that we are God's \\\"bond servants\\\" and His   service is our life's task. An example of the type of thing is in Col   3:22-23 where bondservants were to \\\"work heartily as unto the Lord\\\" - so   also we should work as if our boss was God - i.e. \\\"Pressed down, shaken   together, and running over\\\"... oops - a bit of a side track there...  In the contests between the nations, we are on God's side - a side that is   not fighting in the battle, but is \\\"testifying\\\" to the truth.  When we believe in God and embrace His promises, we become \\\"fellow   citizens with the Saints and of the Household of God\\\", and are no longer   interested in associations of the world. Think of this in relation to   unions etc as well. Paul tells us to \\\"lay aside every weight\\\" that we may   run \\\"the race that is set before us\\\", and if we are wise, we will discard   any association which would retard our progress - \\\"Thou therefore endure   hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. No man that warreth entangleth   himself with the affairs of this life, that he may please him who hath   chosen him to be a soldier\\\" (2 Tim 2:3-4).  One of these entanglements he warns about is \\\"be ye not unequally yoked   together with unbelievers\\\". One of the obvious applications of this is   marriage with unbelievers, but it also covers things like business   partnerships and any other position where we may form a close association   with any person or persons not believing the truth about God (in this case   the army). The principle comes from Deut 22:10 - remember that as well as   them being different animals of different strengths, one was clean and one   unclean under the law. These ideas are strongly stressed in 2 Cor 6:13-18   - I suggest you read this. The yoking also has another aspect - that of   servitude, and Jesus says \\\"take my yoke upon you\\\", so we are then yoked   with Christ and cannot be yoked with unbelievers. We have already seen   that we are bondservants of Christ, and Paul says \\\"become not ye the   bondservants of men (1 Cor 7:23 RV).  An example from the Old Testament: the question is asked in 2 Chr 19:2   \\\"Shouldest thou help the ungodly...?\\\". The situation here is a good   example of what happens when you are yoked together with unbelievers.   Jehoshaphat was lucky to escape with his life. Here are the facts: 1. He had made an affinity with Ahab, who had \\\"sold himself to work   wickedness before the Lord\\\" (1 Kings 21:25). 2. When asked by Ahab to form a military alliance, he had agreed and said   \\\"I am as thou art, my people as thy people\\\" (1 Kings 22:4) - an unequal   yoking. 3. He sttod firm in refusing the advice of the false prophets and insisted   on hearing the prophet of the Lord (trying to do the right thing), he   found that he was yoked and therefore couldn't break away from the evil   association he had made.  God says to us \\\"Come out from among them and be ye separate, and touch not   the unclean thing, and I will receive you and ye shall be my sons and   daughters\\\" (2 Cor 6:17).  This is more or less what I have found out so far - I'm still looking into   it, as I don't think I've answered all the questions raised by Alastair   yet. Heres a summary and a few things to think about:  The Christian in under command. Obedience to this command is an essential   factor in his relationship with Christ (John 15:10,14).  Total dedication to this course of action is required (Romans 12:1-2).  Disobedience compromises the close relationship between Christ and his   followers (1 Pet 2:7-8).  We are to be separated to God (Rom 6:4). This involves a master-servant   relationship (Rom 6:12,16).  No man can serve two masters (Matt 6:24,13,14).  All that is in the 'Kosmos' is lust and pride - quite opposed to Gos (1   John 2:16). Christs kingdom is not of this world (i.e. not worldly in   nature) - if it was, his servants would fight to deliver him. If Christ is   our master and he was not delivered by his servants because his kingdom   was not of this world, then his servants cannot possibly fight for another   master.  Strangers and pilgrims have no rights, and we cannot swear allegiance to   anyone but God.  The servant of the Lord must not war but be gentle to all (2 Tim 2:24) -   this does not just apply to war, but also to avoiding strife throughout   our lives. There is a war to be waged, not with man's weapons (2 Cor   10:3-4), but with God's armour (Eph6:13-20).  I'll probably post some more when I've had time to look into things a bit   further. \",\"being a mere female, I have often found I can't really take the big offensive line with asshole car drivers, so I found a more subtle and nastly ooops I mean nasty way to get back at them.

The athiest's position is that there is no PROOF of the existence of God.  As much as some people accept their Church, their priests or straight from their own scriptures as the \\\"proof\\\", this does not  satisfy atheists.  Atheists DO believe in recognisable authorities.  If they were as dogmatic as you claim they are, they would be trying to prove 1 + 1 =2 every time they got up.  What they dispute is that Churches, priests, scriptures etc. represent true authorities and know the TRUTH.   Are you asking us to believe blindly?  You are trying to deny that part of us that makes us ask the question \\\"Does God exist?\\\" i.e. self-awareness and reason.  If we do not use our ability to reason we become as ignorant as the other animals on this earth.  Does God want us to be like that?  You are right that science and reason cannot PROVE anything.  However, if we do not use them we can only then believe on FAITH alone.  And since we can only use faith, why is one picture of \\\"God\\\" (e.g. Hinduism) any less valid than another (e.g. Christianity)?  \",\"I have a 486DX 25mhz with local bus.

The news show that showed the lengthy excerpts also  had interviews with the filmmaker who made the documentary who basically  confirmed what was shown in the excerpts from the time he spent at the  compound in 1992.

Bill Mayne\",\"  Dennis, I have worked on or written proposals worth tens of millions of $$. Customers included government (including NASA), for profit and non-profit companies. All expected a wrap (usually called a fee). Much of the work involved allocating and costing the work of subcontractors. The subcontractors where universities, for-profits, non-profits, and even some of the NASA Centers for the Commercialization of Space. ALL charged fees as part of the work. Down the street is one of the NASA commercialization centers; they charge a fee.  Now, I'm sure your a competent engineer Dennis, but you clearly lack experience in several areas. Your posts show that you don't understand the importance of integration in large projects. You also show a lack of understanding of costing efforts as shown by your belief that it is reasonable to charge incremental costs for everything. This isn't a flame, jsut a statement.  Your employer DOES charge a fee. You may not see it but you do.    Well there you are Dennis. As I said, they simply include the fee in their overhead. Many seoparate the fee since the fee structure can change depending on the customer.   Integration, Dennis, isn't overhead.   Dennis, Reston has been the only NASA agency working to reduce costs. When WP 02 was hemoraging out a billion $$, the centers you love so much where doing their best to cover it up and ignore the problem. Reston was the only place you would find people actually interested in solving the problems and building a station.   When you have a bit more experience Dennis, you will realize that integration isn't overhead. It is the single most important part of a successful large scale effort.   The story you refer to said that some NASA people blamed it on Congress. Suprise suprise. The fact remains that it is the centers you support so much who covered up the overheads and wouldn't address the problems until the press published the story.  Are you saying the Reston managers where wrong to get NASA to address the overruns? You approve of what the centers did to cover up the overruns?   You should know Dennis that NASA doesn't include transport costs for resuply. That comes from the Shuttle budget. What they where saying is that operational costs could be cut in half plus transport.   I do hope you can find the time to tell us just why it was wrong of Reston to ask that the problems with WP 02 be addressed.

As a standard disclaimer I would like to point out the following facts: 1) Some of these files may run your adapter out of spec.  Doing so can    stress the ICs on the card and may result in incorrect operation or in    shorter life (how short depends on how much out of spec [boom!] :-). 2) Some of these files may run your adapter in a region that is out of    spec for your monitor, resulting in damage to your monitor. 3) You should be knowledgable about your monitor and adapter's ability    to use the mode you select.

I am amazed at the different non-biblical argument those who oppose the Sabbath present.   One question comes to mind, especially since my last one was not answered from Scripture.  Maybe clh may wish to provide the first response.  There is a lot of talk about the Sabbath of the TC being ceremonial.  Answer this:  Since the TC commandments is one law with ten parts on what biblical basis have you decided that only the Sabbath portion is ceremonial? OR You say that the seventh-day is the Sabbath but not applicable to Gentile Christians.  Does that mean the Sabbath commandment has been annulled?  References please.  If God did not intend His requirements on the Jews to be applicable to Gentile Christians why did He make it plain that the Gentiles were now grafted into the commonwealth of Israel?

The NHL, to be precise.  And in the NHL, there exist these things called \\\"ties\\\".  A tie occurs when a game ends with the score for each team equal.  Each team gets one point for a tie.  There also exits these things called \\\"wins\\\".  A win is when one team has a higher score than the opponent.  (Oh yeah, only two teams play each other at a time, so I can say \\\"the opponent\\\".)  A team gets two points for a win.  So, let's say that a team has a record of 38 wins, 36 losses, and 10 ties.  Another team has a record of 40 wins, 38 losses and 6 ties.  The first team has (38*2)+10 = 86 points.  The second team has (40*2)+6 = 86 points.  WOW!  They *both* have the same number of points, but the number of wins is different!  How did they do that??!?!?!?!  That's amazing.  So, Rex, when people talk about wins being the first tiebreaker, well, then that's what it means.  In our example, the second team would win the tiebreaker and therefore have the \\\"better\\\" record, even though both teams had the same number of points.  If you didn't understand this post, Rex, maybe you should go back and read it again, very slowly. :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-)  --     Keith Keller    LET'S GO RANGERS!!!!!

But  recently I heard something about a new card from  Miro. It was the Miro Crystal 24s with 3 MB and True Color support up to 1024x768. It costs just a little more than the ATI.

Thanks,   I have been using the PLI (SONY) 3.5\\\" MO drive and now a Sharp color scanner using standard SCSI cables and STANDARD $20 terminator on my Q700.  No problems.  If you were using a IIfx, that might be another story.  Make sure there is only one terminator in the cabling and it must be at the end.  Some boxes have internal terminators; some can be switched out and others are socketted.  These count.  If the box with internal terminations cannot be put on the end to terminate the cabling, they have to be disabled, ie, switched out or pulled out of their sockets.  If you have 2 boxes with internal terminations, the terminations in one box has to be disabled...., etc.  I am sure that this has been covered by the \\\"experts\\\".  My experience with SCSI boxes that connect to the Mac indicates that they must have some software package for the Mac to 'talk' to them.  My PLI MO drive and Sharp scanner has one for each.

The road surface isn't much different to a typical TX freeway. They are better in terms of lighting, safety, signs, roadmarkings etc. I'd have no problem driving 130 on most US freeways, as it is, I save it for the backroads, which really are more likely to be dangerous.   It would have to be quite severe. I don't recall any US freeway, without road damage warnings, that i would regard as unsafe at 130 in any decent, well damped car. Note that my definition of decent, well damped, would exclude most typical American sedans.   I don't know where you live, but I would be much more worried about cops, other traffic etc. than the road surface at 130. It just isn't that fast or that dangerous.

For example, Why couldn't Magellan just be told to go into a \\\"safe\\\" mode and stay bobbing about Venus in a low-power-use mode and if maybe in a few years if funding gets restored after the economy gets better (hopefully), it could be turned on again.    For that matter, why exactly were the Apollo lunar experiments \\\"turned off\\\" rather than just \\\"safed\\\".  Was it political (i.e. as along as they could be used, someone would keep bugging congress for funds)?  Turning them off keeps them pesky scientists out of the bureaucrat's hair....    I've heard the argument that an active but \\\"uncontrolled\\\" spacecraft causes \\\"radio noise.\\\"  I find that hard to believe that this could be a problem in a properly designed \\\"safe\\\" mode. This safe mode could be a program routine which causes the spacecraft to go to least fuel using orientation, and once a (week, month, year, whatever) attempts a signal lock on Earth. At that time, if funding has been restored, the mission can continue.  If no signal is recieved, the spacecraft goes back to the safe mode for another time period. As we would know when the spacecraft is going to try to contact Earth, we could be prepared if necessary.    As another a spacecraft could do at the attempted contact is beam stored data towards Earth.  If someone can receive it, great, if not, so it's lost and no big deal. By making the time and signal location generally known, perhaps someone in the world might be able and willing to intercept the data even if they're not willing to contact the spacecraft.  I see this as being particularly useful for spacecraft which could have an otherwise long life and are in or are going to places which are otherwise unaccessible (Jupiter/Saturn Orbit, exiting the solar system, etc).     Perhaps those designing future spacecraft (Cassini, Pluto Flyby, etc) should consider designing in a \\\"pause\\\" mode in case their spacecraft gets the ax sometime in the future after completion of the primary mission. Perhaps Mars Observer and Galilleo could have some kind of routine written in for the post mission \\\"drift\\\" phase.

That is, we  observe in nature that every cause has an effect, and every effect was produced  by a cause.  The existence of the natural realm, as an effect itself, cannot be  its own cause; it must therefore have a supernatural cause.  God, on the other hand, is a supernatural being, and is therefore not subject  to such natural laws as the law of cause and effect.  As a supernatural being,  God's eternal existence does not imply a previous cause the way the existence  of a physical, natural cosmos does.  Thus, those who believe in the  supernatural have a valid basis for accepting the existence of uncaused  phenomena such as the eternal God, whereas those who deny the existence of the  supernatural are faced with the dilemma of a physical universe whose very  nature shows that it is not sufficient to explain its own existence.  This is, of course, an oversimplification of a complex topic, but I just wanted  to clarify some important differences between the supernatural (God) and the  natural (the universe), since you seem to mistake them as being  interchangeable.\",\"   I think George is referring to switch.zip in the ~ftp/pub/pc/win3/drivers/video directory.

Ward Survey Research Center University of Utah\",\" Bill, I have taken the time to explain that biblical scholars consider the Josephus reference to be an early Christian insert.  By biblical scholar I mean an expert who, in the course of his or her research, is willing to let the chips fall where they may.  This excludes literalists, who may otherwise be defined as biblical apologists.  They find what they want to find.  They are not trustworthy by scholarly standards (and others).  Why an insert?  Read it - I have, a number of times.  The passage is glaringly out of context, and Josephus, a superb writer, had no such problem elsewhere  in his work.  The passage has *nothing* to do with the subject matter in which  it lies.  It suddenly appears and then just as quickly disappears.  Until you can demonstrate how and why the scholarly community is wrong about the Josephus insert, your \\\"proof\\\" is meaningless and it should not be repeated here.  What's more, even if Josephus happened to be legitimate, it would \\\"prove\\\" nothing.  Scholars speak of the \\\"weight of evidence.\\\"  Far more independent evidence would be required to validate your claim.  Until forthcoming, your belief is based on faith.  That's OK, but you exceed your rights when you pass faith off as fact.  As for the gospels, there are parallels, but there are also glaring inconsistencies and contradictions.  Shouldn't a perfect canon be perfect?  Shouldn't there be absolutely no room for debate?  I suggest you read _Gospel  Fictions_ by Randel Helms, and _The Unauthorized Version_ by Robin Fox (for  Herb Huston, no known kinship or familial relationship, but we do indeed share  an evolutionary ancestry).  The fact that there are inconsistencies, gaps and contradictions does not deny your position.  On the other hand, neither do the gospels \\\"prove\\\" your faith.  Independent evidence is necessary, and I know of none (which we have already discussed, and so far you have not provided any).  Until then, its faith.  Moreover, you have committed a fundamental error in logic.  You have attempted to \\\"prove\\\" your claim with that which you want to prove.  Its no different than saying \\\"I am right because I say so.\\\"    Your logic is full of circles.  It reminds me a bit of the 1910 Presbyterian  General Assembly.  The assembly defined five fundamentals (this is where \\\"fundamentalist\\\" came from) of orthodox Protestant Christianity, to wit: 1) Jesus performed miracles, 2) Jesus was born of a virgin, 3) Jesus was bodily resurrected, 4) Jesus' crucifixion atoned for human sin, and - here is the clincher - 5) the bible is the inerrant word of God.  Presbyterians construe \\\"inerrant\\\" broadly as spritually inerrant.  Fundamentalists take the first four as literally true, and then validate them with a literally inerrant bible, which contains the first four, and which is the only thing known to  contain the first four.    Smoke and mirrors and wands and hand waving if ever there was!  Its faith, Bill.  You don't have any more or better truths than anyone else.  Whatever works for you.  Just don't foist it on others.   Regards,\",\"Howdy,  I'm a little new to this newsgroup, but I would like to tap some of the knowledge and expertise available here.  The Subject:  After-market cruise controls  The Background: I recently broke my ankle in a road-bicycling accident (4 places, five  screws, yuk! :-( ).  In two weeks I will be returning to Texas (my home) from my school (BYU) in Provo, Utah.  As you can imagine, trying to drive nearly 1300 miles with a broken right ankle isn't just the epitome of a good time.  My car does not have a cruise control, so I would have to do all the pedalling (ha ha) with my messed-up ankle.  My question: What is the general opinion of after-market cruise control units?  I realize that a cheap CC (cruise control) from, say, Pep Boys, isn't going to be as good as a factory or professionally installed unit (if there is such a thing).  And I uderstand that I probably can't expect much in the way of accuracy, looks and that sort of thing;  But anything's gotta be better than trying to drive with a hosed ankle.  I have a 1984 Jeep Cherokee, 4 speed, standard, 4*4, 2.5L engine with kettering(sp?) ignition (y'know, distributor cap, rotor, that set-up--not electronic.  Maybe you could've guessed it being an '84, but I'm just trying to give information as completly as I can).  I found a CC unit for 80 bucks.  It seems to use the vehicles vacuum system  instead of an electric servor/motor.  Is this good or bad?  If I did buy this CC, which vacuum hose should I tap?  It has two speed sensors:  One magnetic, and one that gets a signal from the  negative side of the distributor, kinda like a tach pick-up, or so I understand.  I can use either one.  Which is best?  The manual says (I read it in the store today) that the magnetic/axle set-up is more accurate, but harder to install.  Is there really a big difference?  It has a sensor for the brake pedal, just like other CCs, but does NOT have a sensor for the clutch pedal.  So if I wasn't paying real close attention I might push the clutch in while the cruise is trying to get the speed up.  Which would wind the engine up kinda high until I got my wits about me and turned  the thing off.  I'm pretty coordinated, so this doesn't bother me, if it were for my girlfriends car, *then* it would bother me, but I'm ok with it.  The installation also calls for an attachment to a steady-on brake signal and a switched-on brake signal.  I think I can get a switched brake signal from the correct side of the brake light blade fuse.  Am I right?  But I'm not sure where to get the steady-on brake signal, or, for that matter, what exactly it is?  Any ideas as to what the manufaturer wants and where to get it?  I think I can figure the other things out.  Like how to hook-up the negative side tach-type sensing gizmo and the cabin control unit, and the ground and all that miscellaneous business.  But I need a little help with:   1.  Is it worth the money and safety risk (if any) for such a      device?  2.  Is there any particularly good after-market CC?  3.  Are \\\"professionally\\\" installed CCs signifacantly better and      worth the cabbage?  4.  If the unit I saw (sorry, no manufacturer or model number, just      that it is at Pep Boy and its $80) is sufficient for my simple       needs, how do I get the thing installed properly (specifically,      the questions above)?  My father and I built a \\\"Veep\\\" (Volkswagen powered Jeep CJ-2A) when I was in high school, so I consider myself fairly good with tools, electronics, and cars.  So the installation doesn't scare me.  I just want to be certain that I get the thing installed correctly as my Cherokee is just a wee bit more complicated than my Veep. :-)  I appreciate your time in reading my post, and I would appreciate any expertise or opinion anybody has on the subject.  If you would like to share some of your wisdom, please email as I don't get over this group very often (but I check my mail all the time).  Again, thanks for any help anyone may have.\",\"  Not that new.  20 years ago, we had drug addicts harboring active TB that was resistant to everything (in Chicago).  The difference now is that such strains have become virulent.  In the old days, such TB was weak.  It didn't spread to other people very easily and just infected the one person in whom it developed (because of non-compliance with medications).  Non-compliance and development of resistant strains has been a problem for a very long time.  That is why we have like 9 drugs against TB.  There is always a need to develop new ones due to such strains.  Now, however, with a virulent resistant strain, we are in more trouble, and measures to assure compliance may be necessary even if they entail force.  --  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gordon Banks  N3JXP      | \\\"Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and geb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon.\\\" \",\"          But that's just the problem.

They all accept a file as a command line  parameter, but the only way (at least that I know of) to do this easily when running them from windows is to set up the PIF file so that it prompts me for additional parameters (at which point I type  in the file name).    Problems are:   1) Sometimes I can't remember where the file is exactly located and it would be nice to browse my directories for it without having to use the file manager.       and 2) I'm lazy and hate to type long pathnames for files burried  several directory levels deep.   If anyone can point me to such a program or let me know of some other way to handle this, I'd appreciate it.

So? \",\" It should have been made fairly clear that the *most* Crimson would ever get was a 150 (75 old style) MHz CPU upgrade.  Certainly this was mentioned on comp.sys.sgi on more than one occasion as being likely.  If our sales folks were saying otherwise, they were either confused, or less than honest/ethical, or somebody further up the chain inside SGI was misleading them.   There were 4 versions (20, 25, 30, 35), although admittedly the 30 came out at the same time as the 35, over a period of 2 1/2 years.  The chassis simply couldn't be pushed any further.  I'd say 4 years was a pretty good lifespan, myself, for a system design in this day and age.  Getting the 35 to work caused a lot of gray hairs in both the hardware and product design groups; we would have been out of our minds to push it further, and I *know* that was made clear, almost from the day the 35 started shipping.  We had one last kicker in the form of the Elan graphics, which made 3 graphics versions over its lifespan, which I also think is pretty good.   Please, by all means send a complaint letter through SGI support or sales on your concerns.  There should be no reason for sales folks to misrepresent future upgrades to customers (sure, sometimes there will be confusion for a while, over whether an upgrade will be available, but that shouldn't last too long, and doesn't seem to be what you are referring to).  Yes, the sales folks *do* get bonus's at the end of some (all?) quarters, but that is pretty common industry wide, and sometimes that can result in good deals for customers (sometimes it probably pushes folks into systems that aren't what they need, I'm sure, but nobody is *forcing* you to buy at end of quarter, after all...)   They don't get all that long a lead time either; although certainly they get presentations on possible new products, and their opinions may well influence the end product, but that also is life in the industry.  We can't design systems that meet just their needs, or we won't sell too many systems, after all (which is not to say that we don't have some niche products, like Reality Engine).   But surely you don't expect a system you buy now for a five year period to be constantly upgradable over that entire five year period?  That's a rather unreasonable expectation, in my experience (with workstations/microcomputers).  Supported, and parts available, yes, but certainly not upgradable to the latest and greatest!   I missed your first posting, but as I say, by all means share your frustation with somebody at a level inside SGI where it might have an effect (not immediate, I'm sure, but complaints aren't going to be ignored, and *may* affect future plans, if we  hear similar things from more than one person/site).  All of the above is, as usual, my personal opinion, not SGI's.\",\"(note: this is not about the L.A. or NY Times)  A few times a year, a funny thing happens: the bike engine runs perfectly.  Completely smooth.  Not that it runs poorly normally, but on these days, it is exceptional.  My theory is that the air density and moisture content of the air are such that I get complete combustion.  Needless to say, it puts me in a great mood.  The mood lasted for about 20 miles.  Heading north on the 405 freeway, about a mile or two south of the 10, my throttle stopped responding.... and I was between lanes.  Nothing to do but make  my way over 4 lanes to the shoulder... initially by gliding, then by pushing.  At least traffic was heavy enough so that cars did not mind stopping for me.  Turned out to be a screw unscrewed inside my Mikuni HS40  carb.  I keep hearing that one should keep all of the screws tight on a bike, but I never thought that I had to do that on the screws inside of a carb.  At least it was roadside fixable and I was on my way in hardly any time. ____________________________________________________________________________    Death is life's way of telling you you've been fired  -- R.

Apple can't deliver that right now because the 040 saps too much power, radiates far too much heat, and is too large for a notebook. How does one get around that without designing a new chipset? Use existing PowerBook technology to your best advantage. The Duo Dock gives Apple a unique ability to give users that 040 power in a \\\"Semi-Portable\\\" fashion. By plunking the 040 into the Dock, you've got \\\"quadra\\\" power at your desk. On the road, that 33mhz 68030 should be able to handle most of your needs. Okay, not the BEST solution, but its an answer to a no-win situation. :-) So, does this mean one will be able to use the PowerBook's processor in parallel to the dock's processor?

It started happening about four years ago after I moved to my current town, although I don't know if that has anything to do with anything.

[AFS]     Just a quick comment:: [AFS] [AFS]     Armenians killed Turks------Turks killed Armenians. [AFS] [AFS]     Simple as that. Can anybody deny these facts?  Jews killed Germans in WWII -- Germans killed Jews in WWII, BUT there was  quite a difference in these two statements, regardless of what Nazi  revisionists say!  [SY] My grand parents were living partly in todays Armenia and partly in [SY] todays Georgia. There were villages, Kurd/Turk (different Turkic groups) [SY] Georgian (muslim/christian) Armenian and Farsi... Very near to eachother. [SY] The people living there were aware of their differences. They were  [SY] different people. For example, my grandfather would not have been happy  [SY] if his doughter had willed to marry an Armenian guy. But that did not  [SY] mean that they were willing to kill eachother. No! They were neighbors.  OK.  [SY] Armenians killed Turks. Which Armenians? Their neoghbors? As far as my [SY] grandparents are concerned, the Armenians attacked first but these  [SY] Armenians were not their neighbors. They came from other places. Maybe  [SY] first they had a training at some place. They were taught to kill people, [SY] to hate Turks/Kurds? It seems so...  There is certainly a difference between the planned extermination of the Armenians of eastern Turkey beginning in 1915, with that of the Armeno- Georgian conflicts of late 1918! The argument is not whether Armenians ever  killed in their collective existence, but rather the wholesale destruction of Anatolian Armenians under orders of the Turkish government. An Armenian- Georgian dispute over the disposition of Akhalkalak, Lori, and Pambak after the Turkish Third Army evacuated the region, cannot be equated with the extermination of Anatolian Armenians. Many Armenians and Georgians died in this area in the scramble to re-occupy these lands and the lack of preparation for the winter months. This is not the same as the Turkish  genocide of the Armenians nearly four years earlier, hundreds of kilometers away!  [SY] Anyway, but after they killed/raped/... Turks and other muslim people [SY] around, people assumed that 'Armenians killed us, raped our women', [SY] not a particular group of people trained in some camps, maybe backed [SY] by some powerful states... After that step, you cannot explain these  [SY] people not to hate all Armenians.   I don't follow, perhaps the next paragraph will shed some light.  [SY] So what am I trying to point out? First, at least for that region, [SY] you cannot blame Turks/Kurds etc since it was a self defense situation. [SY] Most of the Armenians, I think, are not to blame either. But since some [SY] people started that fire, it is not easy to undo it. There are facts. [SY] People cannot trust eachother easily. It is very difficult to establish [SY] a good relation based on mutual respect and trust between nations with [SY] different ethnic/cultural/religious backgrounds but it is unfortunately [SY] very easy to start a fire!  Again, the fighting between Armenians and Georgians in 1918/19 had little to do with the destruction of the Armenians in Turkey. It is interesting that the Georgian leaders of the Transcaucasian Federation (Armenia, Azerbaijan,  and Georgia) made special deals with Turkish generals not to pass through  Tiflis on their way to Baku, in return for Georgians not helping the Armenians  militarily. Of course, as Turkish troops marched across what was left of Caucasian Armenia, many Armenians went north and such population movement  caused problems with the locals. This is in no comparison with events 4 years  earlier in eastern Anatolia. My father's mother's family escaped Cemiskezek ->  Erzinka -> Erzerum -> Nakhitchevan -> Tiflis -> Constantinople ->  Massachusetts.   [SY] My grandparents were *not* bloodthirsty people. We did not experience [SY] what they had to endure... They had to leave their lands, there were [SY] ladies, old ladies, all of her children killed while she forced to [SY] witness! Young women put dirt at their face to make themselves [SY] unattractive! I don't want to go into any graphic detail.  My grandmother's brother was forced to dress up as a Kurdish women, and paste potato skins on his face to look ugly. The Turks would kill any Armenian young man on sight in Dersim. Because their family was rather influential, local Kurds helped them escape before it was too late. This is why I am alive  today.  [SY] You may think that my sources are biased. They were biased in some sense. [SY] They experienced their own pain, of course. That is the way it is.  But [SY] as I said they were living in peace with their neighbors before. Why  [SY] should they become enemies?  \",\"op that worked was the \\\"Macintosh |> >Software\\\" loop (whatever that means). |>  |> I doubt this is a Quadra-specific problem.

In fact, it is often chosen (besides its other merits) because it shoots like a revolver does basically.  It can limit the training time (read budget $$$) due to the fact there are no 'external' safties other than the trigger, hence less training time required.    Smith & Wesson (among other types) are chosen due to the fact taht they do have the external safties (hammer drop,as well as mag drop) which if properly used have saved many lives when 'Mr. Bad' snatched the gun from the officer and tried to shoot said officer the gun was on safe and would not fire.  This point had been made in many articles in various  gun magazines.  If fact, one author (can't remember who) staged a little test where he had a revolver and a S&W on safe laying on a table and asked people with little firearms experience to on his signal, grab the gun and shoot a target.  He timed the people using each gun.  The revolver times were pretty close, but some of the times with the S&W were in minutes, or the person just gave up because they could not figure out the saftey.   You don't often see Colt 45 autos issued due to the light trigger which can be accidentally fired in a stress situation, opening the issuing city,county, etc.. to lawsuits, bad press, etc..   Of course any problem can be overcome with enough training, but such training is not always available to budget crunched departments.  I know if I were a Cop I would want something like a S&W just for the off chance of the gun getting taken away.  The safety doesn't guarantee that 'Mr. Bad' won't figure it out and shoot me, but it could buy enough time to draw a second gun and shoot 'Mr. Bad' before it's too late.   Don't think I am too biassed here just because I have had 3 Glocks in my possession at one time, because I have had a .45 as well.  In fact, it was my first handgun.  Remember, the ultimate 'safety' is YOU the operator, and no safety is going to stop an negligent discharge (note I don't say accidental) if you break the rules of gun handling.   As per the part of being light weight and looking cool, I agree 100%.  I wouldn't rule it out as a first purchase.  \",\"   Just wondering, do you mean the \\\"Lectorium Rosicrucianum\\\"?

He stressed how likely it was the the Branch Davidians would commit mass suicide.  He was concerned with the safety of the children.   What did the FBI do to defuse the situation,  Did they try to reassure Koresh?  DId the FBI offer medical assistance to the BD?  Did the FBI offer them a supply of water when the BD pump stoped working?  Did the permit Koresh to communicate with anyone outside the compound?   What the FBI did was harass the Branch Davidians as much as possible. They kept powerful lights shining on the compound, shut off their electrical power, put their pump out of action, assaulted their ears with loud noise, cut off their communication with the outside and kept limiting their permitter.  The stated goal was to put pressure on David Koresh.   Was the FBI attempting to get Koresh to surrender or were they hoping to get Koresh so mad that he and some of his followers would attack the the tanks.   It appears that the tactics employed by the FBI did drive Koresh over the edge.  The blame for the deaths should be shared by both the federal experts whose tactics drove Koresh over the edge and the fools at the ATF who planed the raid.   Stupidity and incompetence of the BATF and the FBI leadership have resulted in the needless death of 90 innocent people.   If every thing had gone as planned 90 people would be alive today.

It's in the hands of cops, and while I am sure most of the time they are good, their security will not be as good as the escrow houses.   What this effectively means is that if they perform a wiretap on you, at the end of the wiretap, they should be obligated to inform you that a tap was performed, and replace (for free) the clipper chip in your cellular phone so that it is once again a code known only to the escrow houses.  Do the police normally reveal every tap they do even if no charges are laid?   In many ways, it would be a positive step if they had to. Judges set time limits on warrants, I assume.  At the end of the time limit they should have to renew or replace your chip.

Nonetheless, he noted that everything will be decided upon at the meeting of the Arab foreign ministers in Damascus. The newspaper also reports that threatening phone calls were recently made to houses of several of the senior members of the Palestinian delegation to the peace talks. The threats, in Arabic, demanded that the delegates not go to Washington to, \\\"sell out the Palestinian people.\\\" One caller threatened, \\\"Should you go, you will not find your family alive upon your return.\\\" The newspaper states that such phone calls were received, as far as is known, at the houses of Faisal al-Husseini, Hanan Ashrawi and others. \",\" I must admit that this point has been running through my mind for most of the discussion: one the dice are out there, it won't be long before someone decaps it and, after a bit of work, has full details of the Clipper algorythm.

The idea of resurrection is one which can be found in a host of different forms in the religions of antiquity.  The problem was not the resurrection which was a mediorce issue for a tiny fragment of the Jewish population  (the Saducees) but was a non issues for everyone else.  The real problem was that Christians were pacifist and preached there was only one god.  When the state operates by a system of divinitation of the emperor -  monotheism  becomes a capital offense.  The Jews were able to get exemption from this, and were also not evangelistic.  Christians were far more vocal, and gentile, and hence dangerous and were therefore targets of persecution.  Also since Christians were a relatively powerless group, they made good scapegoats as is seen by Nero's blaming them for the burning of Rome.  Let's not cloud the issues with the resurrection.  randy\",\"   What are the volumes that it speaks besides the fact that he leaves your  choices up to you?

Further striking bigoted and racist attitude of  certain Greeks still exists in our day. Most Greeks insist even  today, that the 537 year-old capital of the Ottoman Empire should  be called not by its rightful name of Istanbul, but by its half  a millennium-old moniker 'Cons*(whatever).'  Everyone knows that New York City was once called 'New Amsterdam' but Dutch people do not persist on calling it that today. The name  of Stalingrad too is long gone, replaced by Volgagrad. China's Peking traded its name for Beiging long ago. Ciudad Trujillo of the Dominican Republic is now Santa Domingo. Zimbabve's old colonial capital Salisburry became Harrare. These changes have all been accepted officially by everyone in the world.  But, Greeks are still determined on calling the Turkish Istanbul  by the name of 'Cons*.'  How can one explain this total intransigence? What makes Greeks so different from other mortals? 18-year-old questionable democracy? Why don't they seem to reconcile with the fact, for instance, that Istanbul changed hands 537 years ago in 1453 AD, and that this predates the discovery of the New  World, by 39 years. The declaration of U.S. independence in 1776 will come 284 years later.  Shouldn't then, half a millennium be considered enough time for  'Cons*' to be called a Turkish city? Where is the logic in the  Greek reasoning, if there is any? How long can one sit on the  laurels of an ancient civilization? Ancient Greece does not exist,  any more than any other 16 civilizations that existed on the soil  of Anatolia.  These undereducated 'wieneramus' live with an illusion. It  is the same mentality which allows them to rationalize that Cyprus is a Greek Island. No history book shows that it ever was. It belonged to the Ottoman Turks 'lock, stock and barrel' for a period of well over 300 years.  In fact, prior to the Turks' acquisition of it, following bloody naval battles with the Venetians in 1570 AD, the island of Cyprus belonged, invariably, to several nations:  The Assyrians, the Sumerians, the Phoenicians, the Egyptians, the Ottoman Turks, of course in that order, owned it as  their territory. But, it has never been the possession of the government of Greece - not even for one day - in the history of the world. Moreover, Cyprus is located 1500 miles from the Greek mainland, but only  40 miles from Turkiye's southern coastline.  Saddam Hussein claims that Kuwait was once Iraqi territory and the Greek Cypriot government and  the terrorist Greek governments think that Cyprus also was once part of the Greek hegemony.  Those 'Arromdians' involved in this grandiose hallucination should wake up from their sweet daydreams and confront  reality. Again, wishful thinking is unproductive, only  facts count.  As for Selanik,    <<Those Jews who survived these assaults in Southeastern Europe fled   particularly to Salonica, whose Jewish population increased substantially   as a result, from 28,000 in 1876 to 90,000 in 1908, more than half the   total population, though even there increased persecution by local Greeks   led many Jews to flee elsewhere in the Ottoman Empire, particularly to   the great port of Izmir.    Despite all the pressure from Ottomans and foreign Jews alike, the ritual   murders and other assaults by Christians on Jews went on and on. Greek   efforts to decimate the Jewish population of Salonica culminated in 1912   and 1913, following Greek conquest of Salonica during the first Balkan War,   when many of its Jews, were either killed or terrorized into leaving...>>    <<Though Greece was obligated by the post World War I treaties to allow   Jews and other minorities to use their own languages in education and to   practice their religions without hindrance, a law was issued in 1923   which forbad all inhabitants from working on Sunday, stimulating a new   Jewish exodus as it was intended to do. Between 1932 and 1934 there was a   series of anti-Semitic riots in Salonica, with the Cambel quarter, where   most of the remaining Jews lived, being burned to the ground. This   was followed by regulations requiring the use of Greek and prohibiting   Hebrew and Judea-Spanish in the Jewish schools. A start was made also   on expropriating the land of the principal Jewish cemetery in Salonica   for use by the new University in order to derive the Jews out [47]. By   killing and driving out large numbers of Jews, the Greeks left a   substantial Greek majority in the city for the first time, and starting   Salonica Jewry on the way to its final decimation by the Nazis during the   occupation of Greece starting in 1941.    Salonica and Izmir of course were not the only places of refuge for   Jewish refugees entering the Empire during its last century of existence.   Istanbul, Edirne, and other parts of Rumelia and Anatolia received   thousands more. Nor were Jews the only refugees received and helped by   the government of the Sultan. Thousands of Muslims accompanied them in   flight from similar persecutions wherever Balkan christian states gained   independence or expanded. The Russian conquest of the Crimea and the   Caucasus starting in the late eighteenth century, and particularly during   and after the Crimean War, combined with the same independence movements   in Southeastern Europe that had caused so much suffering and flight among   its Jews caused thousands of helpless, ill, and poverty-stricken Muslim   refugees to accompany them into the ever shrinking boundaries of the   Ottoman Empire, with the Istanbul government struggling mightly but vainly   to house and feed them as best it could. From 1850 to 1864 as many as   800,000 Crimean Tatars, Circassians, and other Muslims from north and   east of the Black Sea had entered Anatolia alone, as many as 200,000 more   came during the next twenty years, while 474,389 refugees entered in 1876-   1877 as a result of the Ottoman wars with Russia and the Balkan states,   with an equal number gaining refuge in the European portions of the   Empire.>>  [47] Robert Mantran, 'La structure sociale de la communaute juive de   Salonqiue a la fin du dix-neuvieme siecle', RH no.534 (1980), 391-92;   Nehama VII, 762; Joseph Nehama (Salonica) to AIU (Paris) no.2868/2,   12 May 1903 (AIU Archives I-C-43); and no.2775, 10 January 1900 (AIU   Archives I-C-41), describing daily battles between Jewish and Greek   children in the streets of Salonica.

We Catholics do believe that God's revealed truth that is not explicitly recorded in the Bible can be and is passed on through the Tradition of the Church. It should be noted that the Tradition of the Church, otherwise known as Sacred Tradition, is not the same as ordinary human traditions. However, we do not believe that additional truth will be revealed to the Church.  Public revelation, which is the basis of Catholic doctrine, ended with the death of St. John, the last Apostle.  Nothing new can be added.  Theologians study this revelation and can draw out implications that were not recognized previously, so that the Council of Nicea could define statements about the theology of the Trinity and the Incarnation that were not explicitly stated in the Bible and had been disputed before the council, but there was no new revelation at Nicea or at any subsequent council.  Cardinal Newman's _An Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine_, written while he was still an Anglican, is an excellent discussion of of this point.

Thats hard to top.\",\" I attribute my success to several factors:  Very low fat.  Except when someone else has cooked a meal for me, I only eat fruit, vegetables, and whole grain or bran cereals.  I estimate I only get about 5 to 10 percent of my calories from fat.  Very little sugar or salt.  Very high fiber.  Most Americans get about 10 grams.  25 to 35 are recommended.  I get between 50 and 150.  Sometimes 200.  (I've heard of people taking fiber pills.  It seems unlikely that pills can contain enough fiber to make a difference.  It would be about as likely as someone getting fat by popping fat pills.  Tablets are just too small, unless you snarf down hundreds of them daily.)  My \\\"clean your plate\\\" conditioning works *for* me.  Eating the last 10% takes half my eating time, and gives satiety a chance to catch up, so I don't still feel hungry and go start eating something else.  I don't eat when I'm not hungry (unless I'm sure I'll get hungry shortly, and eating won't be practical then).  I bike to work, 22 miles a day, year round.  Fast.  I also bike to stores, movies, and everywhere else, as I've never owned a car. I estimate this burns about 1000 calories a day.  It also helps build and maintain muscle mass, prevent insulin resistance (diabetes runs in my family), and increase my metabolism.  (Even so, my metabolism is so low that when I'm at rest I'm most comfortable with a temperature in the 90s (F), and usually wear a sweater if it drops to 80.)  Cycling also motivates me to avoid every excess ounce.  (Cyclists routinely pay a premium for cycling products that weigh slightly less than others.  But it's easier and cheaper to trim weight from the rider than from the vehicle.)  There's no question in my mind that my metabolism is radically different from that of most people who have never been fat.  Fortunately, it isn't different in a way that precludes excellent health.  Obviously, I can't swear that every obese person who does what I've done will have the success I did.  But I've never yet heard of one who did try it and didn't succeed.   I'm sure everyone's weight cycles, whether or not they've ever been fat. I usually eat extremely little salt.  When I do eat something salty, my weight can increase overnight by as much as ten pounds.  It comes off again over a week or two. --  Keith Lynch, kfl@access.digex.com\",\"[Deletions]  Geez, Dal must have slipped something into Ted's drink sometime.  Comparing Prince to Pagnozzi offensively is laughable.  Prince has never hit well in the minors and he's now 27 years old, I think.  Pagnozzi was not a bad hitter in the minors.  (I'll bring in the numbers tomorrow assuming I don't have another brain cramp and forget.)  He had a very good year at Louisville  before coming up to the majors.  As I recall, the hype on Pagnozzi coming up in the organization was good hit, decent fielding.  When he got to the  majors and didn't hit as well as expected (not as much playing time?), he  became Exhibit 312 in Nichols' Law of Catcher Defense and got the reputation  as an outstanding defensive catcher.  It's not clear he ever learned to hit.  His four years with more than 100 AB--  Born 31 July 1962 Year     AB      BA     SLG     OBA   1988    195    .282    .320    .328 1990    220    .277    .373    .321 1991    459    .264    .351    .317 1992    485    .249    .359    .290   No power, less-than-league-average walks, peak year when he turned 28,  now declining.  If Ted is going to invoke Pagnozzi as a model for Prince, given that Prince has underperformed Pagnozzi in the minors, it's not a rosy picture.  BTW, I'm still unhappy with moving Zeile, who had the same reputation  coming up in the Cardinal organization as Pagnozzi, except that he was a much, much better hitter, to 3rd where he could be an average hitter and a below average fielder instead of a well-above average hitter as an average (or below average) fielding catcher.  Harold\",\"     For discussion purposes, I will ignore dynamic effects like pulses in the exhaust pipe, and try to paint a useful mental picture.  1.  Unless an engine is supercharged, the pressure available to force air into the intake tract is _atmospheric_.  At the time the intake valve is opened, the pressure differential available to move air is only the difference between the combustion chamber pressure (left over after the exhaust stroke) and atmospheric.  As the piston decends on the intake stroke, combustion chamber pressure is decreased, allowing atmospheric pressure to move more air into the intake tract.  At no time does the pressure ever become \\\"negative\\\", or even approach a good vacuum.  2.  At the time of the exhaust valve closing, the pressure in the combustion chamber is essentially the pressure of the exhaust system up to the first major flow restriction (the muffler).  Note that the volume of gas that must flow through the exhaust is much larger than the volume that must flow through the intake, because of the temperature difference and the products of combustion.  3.  In the last 6-8 years, the Japanese manufacturers have started paying attention to exhaust and intake tuning, in pursuit of almighty horsepower.  At this point in time, on high-performance bikes, substitution of an aftermarket free-flow air filter will have almost zero affect on performance, because the stock intake system flows very well anyway.  Substitution of an aftermarket exhaust system will make very little difference, unless (in general) the new exhaust system is _much_ louder than the stocker.  4.  On older bikes,  exhaust back-pressure was the dominating factor. If free-flowing air filters were substituted, very little difference was noted, unless a free-flowing exhaust system was installed as well.  5.  In general, an engine can be visualized as an air pump.  At any given RPM, anything that will cause the engine to pump more air, be it on the intake or exhaust side, will cause it to produce more horsepower. Pumping more air will require recalibration (rejetting) of the carburetor.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\",\"I've gotten very few posts on this group in the last couple days.

Game is so different here in Europe compared to NHL. North-ame- ricans are better in small rinks and europeans in large rinks. An average european player from Sweden, Finland, Russian or Tsech/Slovakia is a better  skater and  puckhandler than his NHL colleague. Especially defenders in NHL are mainly slow and clumsy. Sel{nne has also said that in the Finnish Sm-league game is more based on skill than in NHL. In Finland he couldn't get so many  breakaways because defenders here are an average much better skaters than in NHL. Also Alpo Suhonen said that in NHL Sel{nne's speed accentuates because of clumsy defensemen.  I have to admit that the best players come from Canada, but those regulars aren't as skilful as regulars in the best european leagues.

Foul (Any illegal contact with the other player or his stick with your    body or stick). If you get 5 you are out for the game.  2. Unsportsmanlike contact. (An intentional foul). This inlcludes all the    current flavours of roughing, fighting and boarding. If you get two you    are thrown out of the game, and fined.  3. Technical foul. Bad mouthing the ref, by player or coach. Penalty shot    is awarded. Two and you are thrown out of the game.  Besides the penalty shot for one technical, if the team gets 5 penalties in a period, the opposing team gets a penalty shot for every additional one, until the end of the period. The victim gets two shots if he/she was in the act of shooting when the foul ocured.  This works well for several reasons. First, penalty shots are the most exciting thing in hockey, right? So, it follows that the more the better. Next, when the player is setting up for a penalty shot, the network can take a commercial. Finally, with only three penalties, the network announcers (Don Meredith, Dick Vitale, John Madden, Pat Summerall, and Marv Levy, among others) will be able to tell the viewers what happened before the PA announcer says it.  Oh, one other rule. When a goal is scored (10-20 times a period), the play cannot resume until the PA announcer announces it. This way, the network can sneak in a few more commercials. Then, once the PA announcer has told them who scored, the TV announcer can tell you the viewer, and even have a  chance of pronouncing his name right.  Seriously, though, I actually went to see a NBA basketball game last week, for the first time in my life. I was amazed how boring it was. The play is so slow they actually had fans come out for things like free-throw shooting contests DURING THE PERIOD!. Of course the 'Laker Girls' get to do their  routines at least 6-8 times during the game, and not just between periods either. There is a whistle every 30 seconds on average, maybe less. The game is 48 minutes, with 2 minutes between quarters 1-2 and 3-4 and a 10 minute halftime, and it still takes over 2 hours.  The reason for this has to be TV. There is plenty of room to throw in commercials, and have the announcer jabber while nothing else is happening. On TV, basketball is fairly entertaining, IMHO. But, it is better to watch it on TV than to be there. If this is the road the NHL is following, then it truly is a sad day.  Enough for now.\",\": I would like to get your opinions on this: when exactly does an engaged : couple become \\\"married\\\" in God's eyes?  Some say that if the two have : publically announced their plans to marry, have made their vows to God, and : are unswervingly committed to one another (I realize this is a subjective : qualifier) they are married/joined in God's sight.  The way I read Scripture, a couple becomes married when they are *physically* married, i.e. when they first have sexual intercourse.  e.g. the end of Genesis 2 (quoted from memory) ``for this reason, a man shall leave his parents and be joined to his wife, and they will become one flesh'' (Jesus also quotes this scripture referring to marriage).  If you read through Genesis in particular, you will often come across the phraseology: ``[man] lay with [woman], and she became his wife''. This implies that she became his wife when they lay together, i.e. at the point of intercourse.  Compare this with Jewish tradition: Joseph, when he heard that Mary was pregnant, had it in mind to divorce her quietly -- but Mary and Joseph were *betrothed*, not married. i.e., they were in a binding relationship (which required a divorce to get out of), but *marriage* would not occur until Mary and Joseph went to bed together.  Compare with Christ and the Church (Ephesians 5, Revelation 19): the church is described as the ``bride'' of Christ, but the *marriage* of the Lamb takes  place when Jesus returns. i.e., we are in a binding love-relationship with Jesus, but we are still looking forward to the time when the marriage will take place. I see this as the spiritual equivalent of sexual intercourse, because it represents the most intimate fellowship possible between man and God.  In summary, engagement should be honoured as a binding relationship, but it is not marriage. A civil ceremony is not marriage either. Marriage occurs at the point when the betrothed couple go to bed together. (I don't mean to demean the civil or church ceremony -- ours was great! I don't mean to be too pedantic.) Historically, I think I am correct in stating that the civil ceremony (i.e. a marriage recognised by the state), has only been around in the West since Napoleon, who introduced it to keep tabs on the people (although I'm ready to be corrected on that point!)  This view obviously raises some questions:  What about those who have had sex with one or more partners, without considering marriage. Are those people also ``married''?  If it is true that marriage occurs at the point of intercourse, is it necessary to be married in the eyes of the state? (I would say Yes, because this honours the laws of our nations in the West. Although it is not illegal to sleep together though unmarried in most Western countries, I believe that it is God- honouring to proclaim our marriage to the state and to our friends before actually consummating our marriage. Its to do with our being salt and light, and also to do with how people will perceive us; i.e. it is culturally insensitive to declare yourself married without going through a civil ceremony.)  --   ----- Michael Davis (cs89mcd@brunel.ac.uk)\",\"UPI Washington DC, Update Desk   4/15/93    For the past several months the Clinton administration has been   stymied by mixed signals coming from the economy.

The unemployment figures seem stalled at the 7% mark.  last month,   in an effort to understand this problem, President Clinton appointed   a blue ribbon panel to try to resolve the apparent conflicting   economic signals.  This panel was chaired by Vice President Gore.    Today the panel released their results, providing a shocking conclusion.   \\\"It's the guns\\\" Vice President Gore said.  Apparently NRA members, and other   \\\"gun-nuts\\\" are purchasing firearms at in record numbers, pulling the   economy out of the recession.  \\\"Their buying them five times faster than   ever before, and stockpiling left and right\\\", the Vice President said.      However, since many domestic firearm and ammunition manufacturers have   been experiencing hard times during the past few years, including several   declarations of bankruptcy by many leading American gun makers, they have   not rushed to increase hiring to meet the new demand.    \\\"We want to see if this run will continue before hiring more people\\\", said   the President of Colt industries.  \\\"As long as Clinton is in office, we   suspect it will\\\", he added.    In response to this new information, President Clinton announced a new   Gun Control measure to be introduced into Congress this session.  It's    called the \\\"Ban-One-A-Month\\\" Gun Control Bill.  Under the terms of this law,   every make and model of all firearms will be written on individual index    cards.  The cards will all be put in a big hat and the President will draw   one card every month.  Sixty days later that gun will be banned from any   further manufacture/importation or sale in this country, except to the   politically connected and to members of the National Police Force.    The President said, \\\"This law will benefit America two ways.  When the   Gun-Of-The-Month is announced every thirty days, the gun-nuts will run   out and buy thousands of them, boosting the economy even more.  In addition,   over the long run, we will get all of these icky-evil guns off of the   street.\\\"  He also announce the appointment of Sarah Brady to oversee   this program, citing her \\\"Honesty, and unbiased view on the subject   of gun control\\\".    Senators Metzenbaum, DeConcini, Feinstein, and Boxer have proposed an   amendment to the Bill which would add additional index cards containing   caliber designations for all know ammunitions.  \\\"Their stockpiling,   stockpiling, stockpiling\\\" screamed Metzenbaum during a press conference   at the national Headquarters of Handgun Control Inc.    Senators Simon, Metzenbaum, and Moyenhan also introduced an amendment   that would make all guns illegal to possess once the last card has been   drawn from the hat.  Senator Simon was quoted as saying, \\\"First we'll   fuck em, then we'll kick em out of bed in the morning\\\", during a press   conference he held in the second floor Mens Restroom of the Senate   building.  He of course was referring to the fact that he would allow   the people to purchase the guns to help the economy, but would require   the BATF to seize all of the guns in America sometime in the year 2008,   after all of the cards have been drawn.    The head of the BATF responded by saying, \\\"We will have to see if this   thing in Waco is over by then.  We may be too busy to seize all those   guns\\\".    US House Representatives Pat Schroeder and David Skaggs of Colorado   declared this proposed law as being \\\"reasonable gun control which won't   affect anybodys Constitutional right to own sporting guns\\\".    - end article -    For the humor impaired :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)                                   Bill Vojak                                 vojak@icebucket.stortek.com     NRA, ILA,                                 Colorado Firearms Coalition ------------------------------------------------------------ The CBS Nightly Propaganda With Dan Rather.

We can just call them house Jews, fools, or anti-Semites from Jewish families.

Once you've found a bike you're interested in, call some insurance companies for rates. Some bikes are much cheaper to insure than you might think (my EX-500 only costs me $127/year in St. Louis; I'm 27)  For a first bike, I recommend 500cc's or less. And a bike short enough to get both feet on the ground when you stop.   The one piece of advice EVERYONE will give you is to take a Motorcycle Safety Foundation Rider's Course. See a dealer for details. In some states, completion of such a course can give you a break on insurance. It will also teach you to ride properly from the beginning, so you won't learn any bad habits.  Good luck. Riding a motorcycle is the most fun you can have, naked or otherwise.\",\"Hi, I just have a small question about my bike.  Being a fairly experienced BMW and MZ-Mechanic, I just don't know what to  think about my Honda.  She was using too much oil for the last 5000 km (on my trip to Daytona bike  week this spring), and all of a sudden, she trailed smoke like hell and  was running only on one cylinder.  I towed the bike home and took it apart, but everything looks in perfect  working order. No cracks in the heads or pistons, the cylinder walls look  very clean, and the wear of pistons and cylinders is not measurable. All  still within factory specs. The only thing I could find, however, was a  slightly bigger ring gap on the right cylinder (the one with the problem),  but it is still way below the wear-limit given in the Clymer-manual for  this bike.  Any syggestions??? What else could cause my problem??? Do I have to hone  the cylinder walls (make them a little rougher in a criss-cross-pattern) in  order to get better breaking in of my new rings??? Won't that increase the  wear of my pistons?? Please send comments to   sruhl@mechanical.watstar.uwaterloo.ca Thanks in advance. Stef. \",\"                                                         ^^^ Wow!

The empirical evidence of the last two decades is that more people will show up to see the Bruins play the Sabre umpteen times than see the Bruins play the Captials in the first round.  Maybe hockey has increased in popularity sufficiently that this will no longer be the case.  The experiment is worthwhile with the uneven distribution of the expansion teams, but I prefer the divisional  playoff.\",\"  A nice formulation for the introduction of the first encryption devices with built-in trapdoors - just like the Feds wanted...   Bla-bla.   Indeed, and the current proposal does nothing to prevent the latter.   This doesn't say much. There are many incredibly weak encryption algorithms in commercial use today...   Except from the government.   Nope. The criminals won't be stupid enough to use the new chip, they'll use something secure. This technology provides only means to intercept the phone conversations of people who are stupid enough to use it.   That is, the government has the keys. It doesn't matter much if they are in one or in two of its hands...   Correct. It does, however, provide those Americans with the false sense of privacy.   If the screening is not public, it cannot be trusted. Some people do not trust DES even today, after all the examinations - only because some parts of its design were kept secret.   So they'll use a different technology to hide their illegal activities. So will those law-abiding citizens, who do not trust their government not to misuse its abilities to decrypt their conversations.   Except from the government.   Huh? Later it says that the new technology will be export restricted.   In short, the new technology can:  1) Protect the law abiding citizen's privacy from the casual snooper.  It cannot:  1) Protect him from the government, if it decides to misuse its ability to decrypt the conversations.  2) Protect him from the criminals who succeed to break the new encryption scheme or to steal the keys, or to bribe the people who handle them, etc.  3) Prevent the criminals from using secure encryption for communication.    Correct. However, it does not provide them that much privacy as it claims.    Two candidates: the NSA and the Mafia.    That is, \\\"trust us\\\".   \\\"Security through obscurity\\\".   If it's not entirely open to public examination, it cannot be trusted. Besides, who can prove that the devices used for examination and the ones built into your phones will be the same?    The NSA and the FBI?    Why did they \\\"forget\\\" the Academia?    Doesn't this smell to monopolism?    Like the Mafia?   This is the main question, why was it buried at the end?   \\\"We'll see\\\".   \\\"Trust us\\\".   In short, \\\"If we decide to outlaw strong crypto, we'll tell you\\\".   Since the US government seems to consider strong crypto as munitions and since the US constitutions guarantees the right to every American to bear arms, why is not every American entitled, as a matter of right, to an unbreakable commercial encryption product?   Bullshit. The proposed technology provides a false sense of security, encryption devices with built-in capabilities for breaking the encryption, does not prevent the criminals to use strong crypto, and is a step to outlaw strong crypto.    Who was the optimist who believed that the new administration will leave the export controls on strong crypto devices?  OK, I'm not American, it's not my business, but I just couldn't resist to comment... The whole plot looks so totalitaristic... It's up to you, Americans, to fight for your rights.

And, much as it discomforts us, in humans a trouble-free birth process was sacrificed to increased brain and cranial size.  Wild animals have a much easier time with birth than humans do. Domestic horses and cows typically have a worse time.  To give you an idea: my family tree is complicated because a few of my pioneer great-great- grandfathers had several wives, and we never could figure out which wife had each child.  One might ask why this happened.  My great-great- grandfathers were, by the time they reached their forties, quite prosperous farmers.  Nonetheless, they lost several wives each to the rigors of childbirth; the graveyards in Spencer, Indiana, and Boswell, North Dakota, contain quite a few gravestones like \\\"Ida, wf. of Jacob Liptrap, and baby, May 6, 1853.\\\"   More like one in ten.  And the consequences can be devastating; I have direct experience of more than a dozen victims of a fouled-up breech birth.   It isn't always fatal.  But it is often fatal, when it happens out of reach of adequate help.  More often, it permanently damages one's health.  Clearly women's bodies _evolved_ to give birth (I am no believer in divine design); however, evolution did not favor trouble-free births for humans.     My, aren't we wroth!  I haven't read a more outrageous straw man attack in months!  I can practically see your mouth foam.  We're statistically sophisticated enough to balance the risks.  Although I can't produce exact statistics 5 years after the last time we looked them up, rest assured that we balanced C-section risks against other risks. I wouldn't encourage my wife to have a Caesarean unless it was clearly indicated; on the other hand, I am opposed (on obvious grounds) to waiting until an emergency to give in.  And bear this in mind: my wife took the lead in all of these decisions. We talked things over, and I did a lot of the leg work, but the main decisions were really hers.   I don't know of very many home birth advocates, even, that think that a first-time mother should have her baby at home.   But people should bother to find out the relative risks.  My wife was unwilling to take any significant risks in order to have nice surroundings. In view of the intensity of the birth experience, I doubt surroundings have much importance anyway.  Somehow the values you're advocating seem all lopsided to me: taking risks, even if fairly small, of serious permanent harm in order to preserve something that is, after all, an esthetic consideration.\",\"-| I just installed a Motorola XC68882RC50 FPU in an Amiga A2630 board (25 MHz -| 68030 + 68882 with capability to clock the FPU separately).

Speaking as an atheist (heterosexual, for what it's worth), this is one of the least attractive parts of some varieties of Christianity.  Although I'm sure it's possible to argue theologically that we shouldn't make analogies between discrimination on the basis of sex and race and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, morally the case looks unanswerable (for those outside religion): the three forms _are_ analogous; we shouldn't discriminate on the basis of sex, race or sexual orientation.  I found the moderator's FAQs on the subject instructive, and recommend everyone to read them.  There seem to be three different levels of acceptance:  1) Regard homosexual orientation as a sin (or evil, whatever) 2) Regard homosexual behaviour as a sin, but accept orientation (though presumably orientation is unfortunate) and dislike people who indulge 3) As 2, but \\\"love the sinner\\\" 4) Accept homosexuality altogether.  My experience is that 3 is the most common attitude (I imagine 1 and 2 are limited to a few fundamentalist sects).  I suppose I can go along with 3, except that I have this feeling that a 14--15 year old living in a community with this attitude, on discovering that they were more attracted to members of the same sex, would not feel the love of the community, but would rather feel the pressure not to exhibit their feelings.  I'm not saying that the community (in particular the parents) would not love the child, but I suspect the child would not feel loved.\",\"[deletia- sig]  [deletia- formalities]  I probably should let this pass, it's not worth the time, and it's not really intended for me. But I couldn't resist. A personal weakness of mine. Jerkius Kneeus. Tragically incurable.   Not so; I can prove that the existance of God is disputable by showing that people dispute it; This is easy: I dispute that God exists. Simple.  I missed your \\\"Traditional Proofs\\\" treatise, but the proofs I remember from the Summa Theologic (the 5 ways I think it was) were rather poor stuff. The Ontological argument is about a billion times better, imho.  I would think you'd want non-traditional proofs, considering the general failure of the traditional proofs: at least the ones I know of. (I am thinking of the Ontological Argument, the Cosmological Argument and the Teleological argument. Those are the ones traditional enough to have funny names, anyway.)   This is the real question. So to discuss it, I'll assume God exists. Otherwise, there is no heavenly authority to babble about.   Please show this is the case. I am familiar with the First Cause argument, and I'll accept (for the sake of argument) that there is a First Cause, even though I find some of its premices questionable. The rest you'll have to show. This includes that the First Cause is God.   Got it. I deny that God is all good. So there.   This isn't self-consistent: if humans must renew the relationship, then God (incarnate or not) can't do it. Well, unless you think God is human. Granted, God made himself 'human', but this is nonetheless cheating: The intent of the statement is clearly that man has to fix the problem he caused. God fixing it- even by indirect means- contradicts this.   Why?  Also, why assume said claim is true anyway?  If *I* claim to be Truth, are you bound by reason to follow me?   :)  Undoubtably. Do you mean to imply we should all obey the commands of the Marines without question? You seem to imply this about God, and that the Marines are similar in this respect.. If this is not what you are trying to say, they please explain what it is you are saying, as I have missed it.   Why? Why not question it? Even if it *is* truth, we cannot know this certainly, so why is it so irrational to question? Perhaps we will thus discover that we were wrong.  You assert that God is Truth and we can't question Truth. But I assert that God is not Truth and anyway we can question Truth. How is it my assertion is less good than yours?   Oh?  I hereby deny 1+1=2.  I hope you'll agree 1+1=2 is the truth.  Granted, I look pretty damn silly saying something like that, but I needed something we'd both agree was clearly true.  Now, you'll notice no stormtroopers have marched in to drag me off to the gulag. No heaven lighting bolts either. No mysterious net outages. I seem to be permited to say such things, absurd or not.   They are certainly not true. At least, the ones Newton derived are not true, and are indeed wildly inaccurate at high speeds or small distances. We do not have a set of Laws of Physics that always works in all cases. If we did, Physics would be over already.  Science is all about Questioning this sort of truth. If we didn't, we'd still follow Aristotle. I'd generalize this a little more: If you want to learn anything new, you MUST question the things you Know (tm). Because you can always be wrong.   Even presupposing that Truth may not be Denied, and may not be Questioned, and that God is Truth, it only follows that God may not be Denied or Questioned. NOT that he must be obeyed!  We could unquestioningly DISobey him. How annoying of us. But you have not connected denial with disobedience.  ---    - Dan \\\"No Nickname\\\" Johnson And God said \\\"Jeeze, this is dull\\\"... and it *WAS* dull.

I wrote that human brains \\\"are infested with sin\\\", and can be trusted only in limited circumstances.    Which just moves the problem back one level: how do you tell if your conscience is properly formed?  The only way to tell is to presuppose that you are capable of judging the formed-ness of your own conscience.  In other words, you can only be sure that your conscience is `properly formed' if you assume that your evaluation can be trusted.  Assuming your conclusions saves you a lot of time, I'll grant, but it's not a valid way of reasoning.  Unless you are infallible, your judgements about your own thinking cannot be certain.  Therefore, it is not possible to be certain your conscience is `properly formed'.  (Whatever that is supposed to mean.)   Mr Boundary then gives another paradigm example of the problem:   The Church is `by necessity' the infallible interpreter of divine revelation? How do you know?  Presumably, you believe this because of some argument or another -- how do you know that the argument contains no mistakes?  You write:   But there is a huge difference between `confidence in our ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true' and `infallible'.  I am confident about a lot of things, but absolute certainty is a very long way from `confident'.  This discussion is about the arrogance of claiming to be absolutely certain (really, go check the subject line).  Saying you are absolutely certain is significantly different than saying you are confident.  When you say that you are confident, that invites people to ask why.  Except in very limited circumstances, when you say that you are absolutely certain, it invites people to dismiss you as someone who does not have any idea of his own fallibility.   I have yet to meet anyone who believed in a knowably-infallible source of truth who would admit the possibility of errors in his reasoning.  All of them -- every last one -- has claimed that he was himself infallible. The result has been to convince me that they had no idea what was going on.   Darren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu  [This particular discussion may not be entirely relevant to the original criticism.  I get the feeling that the original poster regarded as arrogant the very idea that there are right and wrong answers in religion, and that the difference can have eternal consequences.  When I say that I think there is a hell and that he is at least in significant danger of ending up there, I will admit that -- as you say -- the reasoning processes I used to reach this are fallible.  Thus at least in principle I could be wrong.  But these basic facts are clearly enough taught in the Bible that I think it's unlikely that I'm misinterpreting it.  (In order to get this level of confidence, I've tried to frame my statement sufficiently carefully as to sidestep a number of the more controversial issues.  I haven't, for example said that all non-Christians will definitely end up in hell, and I haven't attempted to describe hell in any detail.)  I have a feeling that my view is going to be regarded as arrogant and intolerant even though I acknowledge that I'm fallible and so there's some chance I'm wrong.  Don't get me wrong -- I think there are a lot of genuinely arrogant Christians, and often criticism of us is justified.  But in at least some cases I think the criticisms constitute blaming the messenger. If the universe is set up so that there are eternal consequences for certain decisions, it's not my fault -- I'm just telling it the way I think it is.  You may think God is immoral for setting things up that way.  It's one of the critiques of Christianity that I find it most difficult to respond to.  But it's not arrogance for me to tell what I think is the truth.\",\"Well i'm not sure about the story nad it did seem biased.

Having lived in Europe I realize that incidences such as the one described in the letter have occured. The U.S. media as a whole seem to try to ignore them. The U.S. is subsidizing Israels existance and the Europeans are not (at least not to the same degree). So I think that might be a reason they report more clearly on the atrocities.

Questions: ========= The software is Netware 286 Level II and I can see burnt on to the screen SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a. However, to configure netware for level II (mirrored or duplexed disks) requires a second disk, yes?   So how is the Novell Server 286A normally configured?  1. Can I install SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a as Level I, or is this what is causing my serialisation error? 2. Is the Novell Server 286A normally equipped with two hard drives, one of which has failed? 3. Would this mean I can not install the network software because it will not be serialised for this hardware with a failed drive? 4. What else can cause a serialisation error? 5. What happens if the keycard fails? 6. Am I doing something wrong? Can someone knowledgeable offer some comments and guides.  Thanks for your time.  Apology: ======= I appreciate that I have posted this request somewhat widely. As I'm dealing with somewhat archaic hardware and software I'm hoping that by casting my net further, I'm more likely to capture someone who has met this system before. I believe I can justify the groups to which I am posting. Please feel free to correct me if you feel this is an inappropriate place to post this.  \",\"  Not acceptable. Syria and Lebanon have a right to determine if they wish to return to the situation prior to the French invasion where they were both part of the same \\\"mandate territory\\\" - read colony.  Israel has no right to determine what happens in Lebanon. Invading another country because you consider them a threat is precisely the way that almost all wars of aggression have started.    Again territorial expansion by force.    The UN defines them as occupied. They are recognised as such by every nation on earth (excluding one small caribean island).    So the Adam thinks that peace is possible with continued occupation and  a continued military presence? That is a completely unsustainable situation because the USA is bankrupt and simply cannot afford to finance the Israeli ecconomy any more. There is no money for such an occupation.    They were moved in as part of a deliberate policy to prevent the return of the occupied territories. Machiavelli described the reasoning in the Prince. The clear intention was to create a constituency which the Likud beleived could not be deprived of the land stolen from the indigenous population.  The pretexts under which the settlers aquired land was through the  redefinition of much land used in common as \\\"public land\\\". The assertion that the village common on which the village depends for food belongs to an invader simply because no individual has title is clearly an excuse. When the land is used to build a condominium for aliens brought in to occupy the land for a foreign power there is a clear breach of the Geneva convention which stipulates that land use in occupied territories must not be changed.   No amount of self justifying on the part of Likud and hard linner appologists will change the fact that the majority of world governments, and all of those that actually have any power have condemned this practice.    Theyu also are a liability. We are talking about civilian encampments that would last no more than hours against tanks,   Don't fool yourself. It was the gulf war that brought the Israelis to the negotiating table. Once their US backers had a secure base in the gulf they insrtructed Shamir to negotiate or else.  If the creation of settlements had gone on any longer the USA would have cut the money supply.   Not at all. They can chose to live in an arab state or return to Israel.   The existence of a comunity does not give the right for another country to annexe territory, not in Bosnia, not in the West Bank.   Unless the new boundaries drawn up are those of 48 there will be no peace. Araffat has precious little authority to agree to anything else.   The real issue is not the land treaty but the trade treaty. Since the Palestinians will remain heavily dependent on Israel indefinitely it is this that will be the guarantor of peace. another factor will be the return of lands confiscated by the Israeli state within Israel and the dismantling of the shadow structures which allow discrimination against non-Jews within what is nominaly a secular state.   The irony is that in return for a guarantee that the palestinian state has a non descrimination law in order to protect the remaining settlers the Israeli state is going to be forced inot the same position. This will mean outlawing of discrimination such as that which prevents arabs from buying or using much of the land.   \",\"can anyone give me more information regarding endometriosis?   i heard it's a very common disease among women and if anyone can provide names of a specialist/surgeon in  the north carolina research triangle  park area (raleigh/durham/chapel  hill) who is familiar with the condition, i would really appreciate it.  thanks.   --Naomi\",\" My speculation does not include or depend upon a trapdoor in RSAREF.

The air flow of small 3.5 inch fans can be reduced by about 50% by using a 1 to 4 uF capacitor.  Use a good grade nonpolarized unit with working voltage rating around 250 volts.  Note that some impriical study is usually required to experimentally determine the best size capacitor for a given application.  For DC powered applications, try the Radio Shack 12 volt box fan. It can run and start reliably from as low as about 4.5 VDC.  It is exceptionally quiet, but at admittedly low flow.

It was in the early '60's.  He had had more than a few books published by that time, but he was down on his luck financially.  Rumor was that he was hunting urban pigeons with birdshot for food.  He viewed himself as a resourceful man, and (IMO) decided to check out gracefully if he couldn't support himself.  The worst part is that John Campbell, the long-time editor of Astounding/Analog SF magazine had cut a check for Piper's most recent story, and said check was in the mail.  If Campbell had known Piper's straits, I'm sure he would have phoned to say hang on. Campbell was like that.  I wish it had happened differently.

Let us imagine that the executive branch actually could extract keys from the escrow houses without anyone knowing, or telling. Now what? Dick has 80 bits of data. What the hell's he gonna do with it?   1) Trot around to the telco and say 'we'd like an unauthorised decrypting tap'. Uh huh.  2) Break in to watergate and install his own tap (so his people still do have to break in, neat, huh?) record some noise, then get the Executive Branch Phone Decryption Box (huh? they've got one? Goodness, wait 'til the washington post gets hold of this) and decrypt the noise.  3) More likely, stare at the key, and say 'Oh, hell it's not worth all this bloody hassle'   Truth is, even granted *lots* of covert power on the part of the Executive Branch, this system is *more* difficult to tap with than POTS gear. The fact that it is easier to tap than some hypothetical system neither you nor I am going to place on our phones is neither here nor there.   The only rational concerns I am seeing raised are:   a) is the key really just chopped in half, and not some XOR arrangement? That is, has some egregious technical error been built in to the plan?  b) is this is the first step toward strict regulation of strong encryption?     This is b), of course. I suspect not. If the government actually wanted to make such regs, they'd just do it. A few hundred people on Usenet yelling about it wouldn't even slow the machine down.   Besides, who is this mysterious 'they' who's going to take away all our rights the instant we let our guard down? Congress? That gang of buffoons can't even balance their checkbooks. The FBI?

As I said in my previous posting, those quotes exactly exist in the source   given by Serdar Argic ..      You couldn't reject it...      Here we go again..  In the book I have, both the front page and the Author's preface give   the same year: 1923 and 15 January, 1923, respectively!  (Anyone can check it at her/his library,if not, I can send you the copies of  pages, please ask by sct)      I really don't care what year it was first published(1923 or 1924) What I care about is what the book writes about murders, tortures,et..in the given quotes by Serdar Argic, and your denial of these quotes..and your groundless accussations, etc.    [...]      I claim I have a book in my hand published in 1923(first publication)  and it exactly has the same quoted info as the book published  in 1934(Serdar Argic's Reference) has..You couldn't reject it..but, now you  are avoiding the real issues by twisting around..    Let's see how you lie!..(from 'non-existing' quotes to re-publication)    First you said there was no such a quote in the given reference..You  called Serdar Argic a liar!..  I said to you, NO, MR.Davidian, there exactly existed such a quote...  (I even gave the call number, page numbers..you could't reject it.)    And now, you are lying again and talking about \\\"modified,re-published book\\\" (without any proof :how, when, where, by whom, etc..)..  (by the way, how is it possible to re-publish the book in 1923 if it was   first published in 1924(your claim).I am sure that you have some 'pretty    well suited theories', as usual)    And I am ready to send the copies of the necessary pages to anybody who  wants to compare the fact and Mr.Davidian's lies...I also give the call number  and page numbers again for the library use, which are:                    949.6 R 198       and the page numbers to verify the quotes:218 and 215                           Now, are you claiming that there can't be such a reference by saying \\\"it is  not possible...\\\" ..If not, what is your point?    Differences in the number of pages?  Mine was published in 1923..Serdar Argic's was in 1934..  No need to use the same book size and the same letter   charachter in both publications,etc, etc.. does it give you an idea!!    The issue was not the number of pages the book has..or the year  first published..   And you tried to hide the whole point..  the point is that both books have the exactly the same quotes about  how moslems are killed, tortured,etc by Armenians..and those quotes given   by Serdar Argic exist!!

Hiermee ontstond de tweede universiteitssterrenwacht ter wereld. Aert Jansz, de eerste waarnemer, en zijn opvolgers voerden de Utrechtse sterrenkunde in de daaropvolgende jaren, decennia en eeuwen naar de voorhoede van het astronomisch onderzoek. Dit jaar is het 350 jaar geleden dat deze historische benoeming plaatsvond.  De huidige generatie Utrechtse sterrenkundigen en studenten sterrenkunde, verenigd in het Sterrekundig Instituut Utrecht, vieren de benoeming van hun 'oervader' middels een breed scala aan feestelijke activiteiten. Zo is er voor scholieren een planetenproject, programmeert de Studium Generale een aantal voordrachten met een sterrenkundig thema en wordt op de Dies Natalis aan een astronoom een eredoctoraat uitgereikt. Er staat echter meer op stapel.  Studenten natuur- en sterrenkunde kunnen op 26 april aan een sterrenkundesymposium deelnemen. De onderwerpen van het symposium zijn opgebouwd rond een van de zwaartepunten van het huidige Utrechtse onderzoek: het onderzoek aan de zogeheten 'compacte objecten', de eindstadia in de evolutie van sterren. Bij de samenstelling van het programma is getracht de deelnemer een zo aktueel en breed mogelijk beeld te geven van de stand van zaken in het onderzoek aan deze eindstadia. In de eerste, inleidende lezing zal dagvoorzitter prof. Lamers een beknopt overzicht geven van de evolutie van zware sterren, waarna de zeven overige sprekers in lezingen van telkens een half uur nader op de specifieke evolutionaire eindprodukten zullen ingaan. Na afloop van elke lezing is er gelegenheid tot het stellen van vragen. Het dagprogramma staat afgedrukt op een apart vel. Het niveau van de lezingen is afgestemd op tweedejaars studenten natuur- en sterrenkunde. OOK ANDERE BELANGSTELLENDEN ZIJN VAN HARTE WELKOM!  Tijdens de lezing van prof. Kuijpers zullen, als alles goed gaat, de veertien radioteleskopen van de Radiosterrenwacht Westerbork worden ingezet om via een directe verbinding tussen het heelal, Westerbork en Utrecht het zwakke radiosignaal van een snel roterende kosmische vuurtoren, een zogeheten pulsar, in de symposiumzaal door te geven en te audiovisualiseren. Prof. Kuijpers zal de binnenkomende signalen (elkaar snel opvolgende scherp gepiekte pulsen radiostraling) bespreken en trachten te verklaren. Het slagen van dit unieke experiment staat en valt met de technische haalbaarheid ervan. De op te vangen signalen zijn namelijk zo zwak, dat pas na een waarnemingsperiode van 10 miljoen jaar genoeg energie is opgevangen om een lamp van 30 Watt een seconde te laten branden! Tijdens het symposium zal er niet zo lang gewacht hoeven te worden: de hedendaagse technologie stelt ons in staat live het heelal te beluisteren.  Deelname aan het symposium kost f 4,- (exclusief lunch) en f 16,- (inclusief lunch). Inschrijving geschiedt door het verschuldigde bedrag over te maken op ABN-AMRO rekening 44.46.97.713 t.n.v. stichting 350 JUS. Het gironummer van de ABN-AMRO bank Utrecht is 2900. Bij de inschrijving dient te worden aangegeven of men lid is van de NNV. Na inschrijving wordt de symposiummap toegestuurd.

It's beyond my grasp why some object that Mary, who was far greater than either Enoch or Elijah, should not benefit from the same privelege they recieved.  She was after all, Mother of God, full of grace, and immaculate.   And in St. Germain of Constantinople and St. John of Damascus, and in St. Andrew of Crete, among others.  And it should be noted that the Monophysite Chruches of Egypt and Syria also hold to this belief as part of divine revelation, even though they broke away from the unity of the Chruch in 451 AD by rejecting the Council of Chalcedon.  It might be argued by some Protestants that the Catholics and Orthodox made this belief up, but the Monophysites, put a big hole in that notion, as they also hold the belief, and they split from the Chruch before the belief was first annunciated in writing (as far as is known, much has been lost from the time of the Fathers).\",\"There has been quite a bit of discussion about house wiring and grounding practices here.  A few points need to be clarified:  The Equipment GROUNDING conductor, Green, green with a yellow stripe, bare, or the metal sheath or pipe of SOME wiring methods, is used as a safety ground, to carry fault currents back to the circuit breaker panel, and to limit the voltage on the metal case of utilization equipment or other metal objects.  It should never (except for a few exceptions to be discussed later) carry the normal operating current of a connected load.  Some equipment has filters in the power supply which may cause some slight current flow through the grounding conductor.    Much communications or audio equipment is sensitive to noise or slight voltages on the grounding conductor, and may require special wiring of the grounding conductors to provide reliable operation  (\\\"orange\\\" outlets are often used for this, with insulated grounding conductors wired back to the panel box, and in many cases back to the service.  Anyone installing such a system should read both the section on grounding in the National Electric Code and publications on installing quiet isolated ground systems.  The code requires the insulated grounding conductors (green wires) to run with the current carrying conductors back to the panel box, and, if required, back all the way to the service entrance , where it is bonded to the service ground (water pipe or rod)  Many of these systems are installed illegally or unsafely, where they do not provide a safe ground or a quiet ground or either.   The GROUNDED conductor of a circuit, often called the NEUTRAL, which is referred to in the code as the \\\"identified\\\" conductor and is supposed to be white or natural grey.  This conductor is supposed to be connected to ground in most electrical systems at a single point, generally at the service entrance panel.  This connection is through the Main Bonding Jumper.  (In many household service panels, the main bonding jumper is actually a bonding screw which attaches the neutral busbar to the case of the panel)    The Grounded conductor (neutral) is generally a current carrying conductor.  In the case of a 120 volt circuit it is one of the two conductors completing the circuit from the panel to the load device.    Since the grounded conductor (neutral) is only connected to the grounding conductor (bare or green) at the service entrance, if the load is any distance from the service and draws any significant current, there will be a small but measurable voltage between the grounded and grounding conductors at the load, under normal operating conditions.  If you should (incorrectly) connect the grounded (neutral) conductor to the grounding conductor at the load, some of the neutral current will flow instead through the grounding conductor.  Since there will now be current flowing through the grounding conductor, it will also no longer be quite at ground potential at the load end.  If the load equipment has a metal case, which is connected to the grounding conductor through the \\\"U\\\" ground plug, the metal case is now also no longer quite at ground potential.  The difference (under normal, non short-circuit conditions) may be only a few tenths of a volt, but it could also be a volt or two.  This normally does not present a shock hazard.    HOWEVER, if you let the metal case of the grounded equipment come into contact with an independently grounded object such as a water or gas pipe, a radiator, a metal air conditioning duct or such, part of the neutral current will try to flow through this aalternate ground path.  If the contact is not solid, you will get a significant arc (a low voltage, but possibly moderate current arc) Under the wrong conditions, this arcing could start a fire.  It is possible in some cases that the sneak ground current   could also flow through a wire of inadequate size, causing it to overheat.  With the incorrect non single-point grounding of the neutral, if there is a short circuit from hot to neutral, the high short circuit current which may flow will cause a much higher voltage on the grounding conductor, which increases the possibility for shock or fire.    Also if you incorrectly multiply connect the neutral and ground, the voltage on the ground system is seen as noise bu computer or audio equipment, often causing malfunction.  I have spent some hours tracking down such shorts in technical facilities where they were inducing severe hum into equipment.  The Neutral is usually bonded to the ground at the distribution transformer as well as at the service entrance of each dwelling.  This is done primarily for lightning protection, so that induced lightning currents have a short path back to ground, and also to assure that the currents drawn by shorts to grounded objects like pipes draw enough current to trip circuit breakers or blow fuses quickly.  The bad side of this is that not all the neutral current from the dwelling goes through the neutral wire back to the transformer.  Some of it flows through the grounding electrode (water pipe, etc.) this may cause corrosion in the pipes and possibly in things like underground fuel oil tanks, and it may also cause measurable AC magnetic fields due to the large loop between the \\\"hot\\\" conductors in the service and the neutral current in the water pipe and ground.  There are those who feel these fields may be unhealthy.  (don't flame ME on this, I'm just telling you where the field comes from, not it's health effect, as far as I'm concerned, the jury is still out on this.)  Note that the bonding jumper is only installed at the main panel, NOT at any sub distribution panels.  This is one reason why it is illegal to run service entrance cable with the sheath used as a neutral to a sub panel, you must have a seperate insulated conductor for the neutral.  The sheath can be used in this application only as the groundING conductor.  If the neutral is bonded to the grounding conductor in the sub panel, say by forgetting to remove the bonding screw, all the grounding conductors of the loads on that panel will be above ground, with the possible problems listed above.  The code makes exceptions for ranges and dryers, as well as feeds from one building to another.  In the cases of the range and dryer, the neutral may be used as the equipment ground under certain conditions, instead of a seperate wire.  Every time the code is revised, these exceptions come up for review.  These exceptions were, in fact the first required safety grounds, in the days before U ground outlets and such.  The appliance manufacturers don't want to have to redesign their ranges and driers, and the contractors don't want to have to run four wire cable (with four fairly heavy, expensive wires) in place of three wire to the appliances.  No question it would be safer with seperate neutrals to the stove, but the neutral current is low for most burner settings (since most current is in the 220 volt \\\"hots\\\" except at some low settings, the wires are large gauge, and there are few reported cases of injury or damage.  So far, the exceptions have survived. In the case of feeds between buildings, it's primarily for lightning protection.  People doing wiring should be aware what is and what isn't a legal grounding conductor.  Obviously, the bare wire in \\\"romex\\\" 'with ground' is.  Anywhere there is a green wire installed, such as in a portable cord, that is a good grounding conductor.  The sheath of BX clamped in BX connectors in metal boxes is a legal grounding conductor (in the US). (BX has an aluminum band run under the steel sheath to lower the resistance of the sheath.  You can just cut this aluminum band off at the ends, you don't have to bond it to anything, it does its job by touching every turn of the BX sheath.) Conduit or EMT (thinwall tubing) is generally a legal grounding conductor, but may require a bonding locknut where it enters a box or panel, particularly for larger pipes.    \\\"Greenfield\\\" (looks like big BX, but you pull your own wires in the empty sheath after you run it) is NOT a legal grounding conductor, as it doesn't have the aluminum band to bond it, and the spiral steel has too much resistance and inductance.  You have to run a seperate green grounding conductor inside the greenfield.  \\\"Wiremold\\\" is also not a legal grounding conductor, as the paint on the boxes often prevents good contact, and the \\\"feed\\\" to the wiremold extension is often from a box in the wall that may not be well connected to the first wiremold box.  I have personally discovered cases where the entire run of wiremold and the cases of everything plugged into all the outlets on the run were \\\"hot\\\" with 120 volts (Why do I get a shock every time I touch my computer and the radiator here in the office?) because there was no ground wire in the wiremold and one of the outlets had shorted to the edge of the wiremold box.  You must run a ground wire back in the wiremold from the outlets at least to the first box in the original wiring (conduit, BX, etc.) where you can \\\"bond\\\" the wire to the box with a screw, bnding clip, or whatever.  On another issue, while you should ground the green wire/lug on GCFI outlets when ever there is a place to ground them, it is legal in the NEC to use them without a ground if no ground is available.  It is better to have the protection of the Ground fault interrupter than no protection if you don't install it.  The interrupter doesn't depend on the ground to trip.  It is desirable to connect the ground if available, because if the ground is connected, the interrupter will trip as soon as a faulty device is plugged in, whereas without the ground, it will not trip until someone or something provides a ground path.  For those questioning the legal use of ungrounded GCFI's, read in the NEC, 210-7 (d) exception. (This is the 1990 code, my '93 code is in the city, but I know the rule hasn't changed.  It might be renumbered though.)   We have only touched the surface concerning grounding ;-} , there is much more to this subject, but most of you have fallen asleep by now.

Gregg is not, as I understand his posts, giving any support to the bounty on Rushdie's life.  If that's correct, end of one point...  Gregg is using the concept of legal in a way most Westerners don't accept. His comments about Islamic Law I think make a great deal of sense to him, and are even making a _little_ sense to me now - if a person is a member of a group (religion or whatever) they bind themselves to follow the ways of the group within the bounds of what the group requires as a minimum. The big bone of contention here that I'm picking up is that in the West we have secular governments that maintain, more or less, a level of control and of requirements outside the requirements of optional groups.  I think the majority of us reading this thread are in tune (note - I didn't say \\\"in agreement\\\") with the idea that you are finally responsible to the secular government,  and within that to the group or groups a person may have chosen.  With that in mind, it not possible under secular law (\\\"legally\\\" as most people would define the term) to hold a person to a particular group once they decide to separate from it.  Only if the secular authorities agree that there is a requirement of some sort (contractual, etc) is there any secular _enforcement_ allowed by a group to a group member or past group member.  A religion can, and often does, believe in and require additional duties of a group member.  And it can enforce the fulfillment of those duties in many ways - ostracism is common for example.  But the limit comes when the enforcement would impose unwanted and/or unaccepted onus on a person _in conflict with secular law_.  This is the difference.  In a theocracy, the requirements of the secular authorities are, by definition, congruent with the religious authorities. Outside a theocracy, this is not _necessarily_ true.  Religious requirements _may_ coincide or may not.  Similiarly, religious consequences _may_ or may not coincide with secular consequences (if any).  Regards,  Dew\",\" Confident, or merely crazed?

And you can't do IDEA at that speed; key setup takes much too long.  I wouldn't be surprised if that were the case for Skipjack, too, though there's no way of knowing just yet.  DES used only xor because that's what was feasible with mid-70's technology.  Modern chips can do a lot more.\",\" Canada's GST is collected as a sales tax and is considered a VAT. Funnily, the previous hidden wholesale tax that it replaces was never referred to as a tax (or, people never paid mind to it, thus the uproar when it was brought up front as the GST ---  one party has actually campaigned on hiding the tax again).  The stated intent of the Tories was to use the GST to write down our deficit.  Unfortunately, their legislation didn't include any mechanism for disbursing the collected funds in such a manner and the money is now sitting in escrow.  I don't know what is involved in releasing the funds, but one dilemna is that the Tories are not fiscal conservatives themselves though while taxing and spending, they've made moves to apply the breaks to a runaway locomotive by the end of this time --- the end of their second term (~9 years). While they do have chances of getting a third term, catching up in the polls to their more moderate/slightly leftish pro-business rivals, the Liberals (as in Euro/UK), the Tories' heir-apparent  for the leaders' mantle has been termed a clone of Hillary  Clinton ...  gld\",\"********* 1990 Integra LS for Sale *********  5 speed, sunroof, rear spoiler, new tires 59.7K miles  $ 7950 or best offer.  call 908-949-0878      908-938-4101  email att!hotsoup!peng\",\" Is there such a thing as the new '94 Eagle Talon?

The problem I'm currently stuck on is that theres no algorithm which triangulates any arbitrary polygonal shape. Delaunay seems to be limited to convex hulls. Constrained delaunay may be okay, but I have no code example of how to do it.  Another way to do the bartman may be  - TGA2POV - A selfmade variation of this, using heightfields.    Create a b/w picture (BIG) of the text you need, f.i. using a PostScript   previewer. Then, use this as a heightfield. If it is white on black,   the heightfield is exactly the images white parts (it's still open   on the backside). To close it, mirror it and compound it with the original.  Example:  object {    union {       height_field { gif \\\"abp2.gif\\\" }       height_field { gif \\\"abp2.gif\\\" scale <1 -1 1>}    }    texture {       Glass    }    translate <-0.5 0 -0.5>      //center    rotate <-90 0 0>             // rotate upwards    scale  <10 5 100>            // scale bigger and thicker    translate <0 2 0>            // final placement }   abp2.gif is a GIF of arbitrary size containing \\\"ABP\\\" black on white in Times-Roman 256 points. \",\" [Prof. Denning's description of SkipJack mostly omitted]   CHIP STRUCTURE  The Clipper Chip contains a classified 64-bit block encryption  algorithm called \\\"Skipjack.\\\"  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys (compared  with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling (compared with 16  for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  Throughput is  16 Mbits a second. [...]   F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips  N, a 30-bit serial number  U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted    with the chip  The key K and message stream M (i.e., digitized voice) are then  fed into the Clipper Chip to produce two values:        E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and      E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement block.    Three questions: 1) It looks like each 64 bits of input gives you 4*64 bits of output:   E[M;K] = 64 bits   E[K;U] = E[ 80 bits ] = 128 bits   E[ E[K;U], N ; F ] = E[ 128 + 30 bits ] = 192 bits    Do you really need to transmit all 256 bits each time,    or do you only transmit the 192 bits of wiretap block at the beginning?       All 256 would be really obnoxious for bandwidth-limited applications    like cellular phones (or even regular phones over   2) how do the 4 DES modes interact with the two-part output?    Do the various feedback modes only apply to the message block,    or also to the wiretap block?  Or, if the wiretap block is only    transmitted at the beginning, does it get incorporated into    everything through feedback modes, but not during ECB mode?  3) Does the Clipper Chip check the wiretap block itself?    Does the block have to be present at all?    Since the receiving chip doesn't know the transmitter's U,    it presumably can't check the validity of E[K;U], so it's     limited to checking the *form* of the wiretap block,    and maybe checking the serial number for reasonableness    (unless there's some sort of back-door structure that lets    it recognize a valid E[K;U].)        In that case, can you replace the wiretap block with a DIFFERENT    wiretap block, presumably an old valid one to avoid attracting attention?    (The chip won't do it, so you postprocess the output.)    Regular people can do one with their own serial number and a dummy key;    paranoid people can use someone else's serial number.     On the other hand, if I could think of that solution so easily,    presumably the NSA could too - have they done something to block it,    like use message encryption that's really E[M; K,U,N] ?    Thanks!\",\" What's the difference between the F550i and the new F550iW?  I'm about to buy a Gateway system and was going to take the F550i upgrade.

Would most of the North-americans now playing in the NHL be willing to play for a team in Europe?  I do not think that the majority of hockey players are necessarily interested in expanding their cultural experience to that level. (I know I would but I am not a pro hockey player)  When one recalls some players remarks in the last few years it makes me wonder how a European expansion could be achieved.  Remember these:  - Lindros did not want to play in Quebec (for more than $ reasons) - Nicholls ... in Edmonton. - R. Courtnall wanted to be traded to LA only. - C. Lemieux said he would refuse to go to Edmonton earlier this year.  I know there are many non-cultural reasons behind these but there is more:  - Some american players who played for the Expos complained about the french   fact and that the city was not quite like the other US cities.  One   players' wife trying to make her point went on to complain that she could   not even find her favorite brand of nacho chips in Montreal.  Anybody knows what happened when all these US football players moved to London, Spain, etc .. for the one year of that new football league (2 years ago?)  I wonder what the players association thinks about going to Europe.  Myself I would like to see some European teams, but what would be  the best way to do it? \",\"My suggestion would be to contact Microsoft about the Video4Windows SDK.

(if you are familiar with Insight, you know the kit I mean).  I believe the drive is either a Texel (265ms) or an NEC (280ms), but it is not clear to me which one is actually a part of the bundle (at least two of their sales people couldn't give me a straight answer as to which one; ah, yes, one of the drawbacks of OEM!).  Other questions:  - Excuse my ignorance, but is \\\"Texel\\\" a reputable maker in the CD-ROM   market?  Or do you think NEC is the better drive?  - Bottom line:  Is this kit worth the money?  (Currently, $449 for the   TA-1000, and $699 for the TA-2000)  Alternatively, I was thinking that the TA-2000 might be overkill for my uses (however, I *do* want full multimedia capabilities, Photo CD stuff, educational programs for my kids, etc.), and considered the lower-end TA-1000 kit and using the difference (around $250.00) to get something else useful, like a tape back-up drive unit.

X        * To provide a safe forum for poor C code.  :-) X X    The IOCCC is the grandfather of USENET programming contests.  Since X    1984, this contest demonstrated that a program that simply works X    correctly is not sufficient.  The IOCCC has also done much to add X    the arcane word 'obfuscated' back into the English language. X    (see \\\"The New Hacker's Dictionary\\\" by Eric Raymond) X X    You are strongly encouraged to read the new contest rules before X    sending any entries.  The rules, and sometimes the contest Email X    address itself, change over time.  A valid entry one year may X    be rejected in a later year due to changes in the rules.  The typical X    start date for contests is in early March.  Contest rules are normally not X    finalized and posted until the beginning of the contest.  The typical X    closing date for contests are in early May. X X    The rules and the guidelines may (and often do) change from year to X    year.

Thanks for your help. :  \",\" Aspartame is the methyl ester of a dipeptide, so a product of its hydrolysis is going to be methanol, which can then be oxidized to formaldehyde.  The amounts of methanol formed from the ingestion of aspartame-containing foods are completely in the metabolic noise, since you're forming equally minute amounts of methanol from other components of food all the time.  In studies involving administration of high doses of the additive, blood methanol levels were undetectable. Methanol is a poison only in quantities seen in human poisonings, say 5ml and above.  This is a consequence of its oxidation to formaldehyde and formic acid, two quite reactive compounds which at high enough levels can damage tissues like the retina and kidney, because at such high doses the body's detoxification system is overwhelmed.  Interestingly, one treatment for early methanol poisoning is to get the person drunk on ethyl alcohol--vodka or an equivalent.  That's because ethanol is metabolized preferentially over methanol by the enzymes in the liver. If the methanol stays as methanol and isn't metabolized to formaldehyde, it is actually relatively non-toxic. \",\"Hi Xperts!    I have a Sparc-1 with very limited disk space on /usr partition.    previously, i was able to run all x-windows applications  and then     i upgraded my system to sun o.s. 4.1.3 and realized that , the hard disk did not have enough space to load openwindows. My immediate alternative was to load only the neccessary files to boot the system. This resulted in not loading openwindows. As a result of which none of the X-libraries got loaded.     I am trying to load just the libraries and include files and bin/X11 files  required for running X-windows and compiling my programs written for Xlib and Xaw. In a desperate effort to regain x-windows, i retrieved /usr/lib/libX*.* files from the tape . /usr/bin/X11/*  and /usr/include/X11/* . Is this enough for running X-windows    BUt i did not get /usr/lib/X11/fonts/  sub directories . these are mainly 100dpi, 75dpi  and misc.   when i run xinit, the error message says /usr/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi etc are not in the default path. But the problem is i cannot load any of those directories as there is no disk space.  Are there any temporary suggestions before I get a 1.5 GB disk and load openwindows , to just have my x-windows running.

I think that it is important to protect your trunk, engine bay, all doors.  I'd get flashing lights, LED's mounted on the drivers and passenger door and a relay to disable engine operation. Toss in  a glass break sensor, and shock sensor. Door lock and unlock, two remotes and panic feature are also nice to have.  Most important is where you have the installation done!  Some places may cost a little more, but a poorly installed alarm (no matter how much it cost) will be a major burden.

We cannot currently ship PEM, or even  simple DES, in our products without case-by-case approval from the Department  of State.  ITAR presents a material trade barrier to US firms trying to  compete in international information systems markets.  Sure, you can use whatever freebie software you want to talk over BBS's in  the USA.  I, on the other hand, want strong crypto (PKCS, for example) to be  the *default* for electronic mail, worldwide.  I want priests to be able to  hear confession over email.  I want lawyers to be able to talk to clients in  confidence over email, or doctors talk with patients.  I want to be able to  order products from my favorite Japanese mail-order catalog over the net.  I  want to be able to sign contracts, transact business, and so on  electronically.  This is so far infeasible as a result of the current restrictions on  crytographic systems, especially beyond the borders of the USA.  Clipper is irrelevant, and if it distracts the authorities into feeling safe,  all the better.  Its only danger is if it emboldens them into trying to put  more restrictions into place, on the theory that it is \\\"good enough for  anyone who has nothing to hide.\\\"  That argument is, of course, utter BS, just  as much as \\\"no one needs an assault rifle\\\". \",\"  Most of the points you made about Lopez v. Berryhill/Olson have been made by others, and realizing that Lopez must be the second coming of Frank Thomas, I have relented and praised the unmistakeable wisdom of his supporters.   See?  This is essentially what everyone was doing  -  comparing Lopez to one of the best players in the game.  I'm really looking forward to seeing this can't-miss superstar now.  As for Thomas, I remember being an advocate of his being brought up in 1990 even though he was only 21 or 22 (can't remember).  But who did the Sox have at first? Calderon?  Martinez?  Kittle?  The spot was there.  The talent was there.  Sure, I say go for it.  I am not convinced that Lopez is anywhere near as talented as Thomas was after his AA season in 1989, and I am not convinced that Olson/ Berryhill are nearly as bad as Kittle/Martinez were.  BTW, I don't think Thomas was hurt by those three months.       Well, if we can't compare our guy to one of the best in the game, let's compare our decision to one of the most \\\"Boneshead\\\", right?  Cal Eldred was 24 when he came up, with a full season at AAA and a longer minor league career.  Frankly, I don't know why he didn't make the club in 1992.

(And I suspect that there are some atheists who would find the substance abuse preferable to Christianity.)  I think that an essential problem with communication between Christ- ians and atheists is that as Christians we necessarily see ourselves as incomplete, and needing God (the 'God-shaped hole'), while atheists necessarily see themselves as self-sufficient.  If the atheists are right, Christians are guilty of being morally weak, and too cowardly to stand up for themselves; if the Christians are right, the atheists are guilty of considerable arrogance.

So were their non-Christian contemporaries (the more familiar you are with late Republican Rome or the Pricipate, the weirder those people will seem -- forget the creative filtering done by Renaissance and Eighteenth Century hero worship.)  So are modern non-Christians.  And Christians.  You are pretty weird, yourself, with your rather acid dismissal of Luther and of Protestantism -- and in apparently buying into a simplistic propaganda model about Catholicism *not* being faddish.   Sure, it's so large that global fads take longer cycles than they do in smaller denominations (and local ones are not usually visible unless you do a lot of traveling to exotic lands :-)).  May I recom- mend, as a salutary antidote to this nonsense Philippe Aries' book _The Hour of our Death_, a longitudinal study of death customs in  Western [specifically Catholic] Christendom?  And it won't help to escape into the obscurity of the first Christian century.  Paul was pretty weird, too; as were Peter and the others in the (apparently quite weird) circle around Jesus.  What I think you might find helpful is a bit more charity -- try to understand these weirdos and nutcases with the same respect and love you would expect others to show YOUR notions.  We *are* commanded to love one another, after all.  And Brown's book is, in fact, a heroic attempt to SEE the groupings he talks about as motivated in love and the gospel and their social contexts.  (If anything, Brown is *too* heroic here -- he manages to overstrain himself at times :-))  I don't suggest that we *follow* any of these old cult paths -- and it raises hard questions from the skeptic inside me that so much of early Christianity *was* like the weird (Christian and non-Christian) cults we see today.  To that extent, I think you raise a serious problem (and perhaps your phrasing is implicitly self-deprecatory and ironic.)  But the first principle for *answering* these questions is respect and love for those we do not understand.  And it helps to *work* at under- standing (as long as we do not get overwhelmed by revulsion and begin to withdraw our respect for them as people.)  I would advise, in other words, MORE historical reading (Brown's other books are also good, most especially his bio. of Augustine; also try Robin Lane Fox's _Christians and Pagans_, maybe the Paul Veyne ed. _History of Private Life_, some of Foucault's books on sexuality in the ancient world ...)

I'm new here, and only vaguely religious, but I want to know what some of you people think.  Specifically, are there an infinite number of Heavens, and a person goes to the one that he/she deserves?  Or is it simply Heaven or nothing (Hell?) Also, are we \\\"graded\\\" by those around us, or has there always been some unchanging method?  Is the person's childhood taken into account?  I'm sure these must sound like over-simplifications to most of you, but I figure that you're the experts.        -Quinn  [Eschatology is an area on which Christians do not agree.  I suspect that's because our primary source of information is prophets and visionaries, and their writings tend to be highly symbolic.  However both Jesus' teachings in the Gospels and books such as the Revelation to John talk primarily about the difference between eternal life and eternal death.  On a number of occasions Jesus does say things that imply some sort of differentiation, e.g. Lk 10:14 and a number of similar passages where Jesus says things like \\\"even XXX will be better off than you in the judgement.\\\"  Also, I Cor 3 talks about someone who gets into heaven, but by the skin of his teeth, as it were.  But these passages are not normally interpreted as suggesting separate heavens, so much as differing levels of prestige or punishment in heaven or hell (and not all Christians would even go as far as that).  The only Christian group I know of that believes in multiple heavens is the Mormons, and they are very far from mainstream Christianity (far enough that many of our readers would not call them Christian).  Their ideas in this area involve specific Mormon revelations, in addition to the Bible and \\\"Holy Tradition\\\" of a more generic Christian sort.  Note that many Christians will cringe at the very thought of associating grading with God.  The whole point of Christ was to free us from the results of a test that we couldn't possibly pass.  If you like test analogies, God grades on a very strict and unbending scale, but he also cheats -- he replaces our test papers with an exam that was prepared by the teacher, before actually doing the grading. Because some people end up in heaven and others in hell, it's easy to see why you'd be inclined to think of it as grading.  While there are differences among branches of Christianity on details, I think we all agree that in one way or another, God cheats.  I am personally very sceptical about anyone who claims to know exactly how far God's cheating extends.  Will he accept people who don't explicitly acknowledge Christ, but somehow still follow him in their hearts?  Many Christians believe that this is possible, at least in principle, but certainly not all do.  Jesus provided us with a clear description of how to be saved, but it's not clear to me that he provided an exact description of how he's going to place the dividing line.  Certainly he made it clear that we can't expect to know whether other individuals are saved or not.\",\"Pardon me for interrupting, but why doesn't anyone ever bring up other possibilities besides more government, less government, or no government and stop there? It seems to me that the problems with society go MUCH deeper than government. Democracies seem to reflective of the majority of society, both the good and the bad. If you take away the government, you still have the structural flaws in society, except this time, with no restraints. Yes? No?  Why doesn't anybody ever discuss communal society, like a kibbutz? I never studied it on depth, but from what I've heard, the kibbutz in Isreal was very successful. It is also very close to what Aristotle and Socrates believed was the best.  Sorry to detract from the discussion.   But what good is change if there is no tracable improvement in the human condition? Who would ever support the change if you tell them it won't  improve their lives? I know that there are, and will be, libertarians  who will jump in now and say that it WILL improve our lives.

Helsingfors IFK have been around since 1897 but fans only started taking hockey seriously in the 1960s so I think you're exagerating here.   That's a rather bold claim, in the light of how successful the Canadian & American Olympic teams have been . . . and they've had to play according to our set of rules and on international ice. The 1992 Olympic teams contained about as much talent as your average expansion team. Canada had Eric Lindros, Sean Burke, Joe Juneau and Chris Kontos. Another four or five have been deep subs in the NHL. As for the Yanks, Keith Tkachuk, Scott Lachance, Bret Hedican, Shawn  McEachern, Steve Heintze, Ted Donato, Joe Sacco and Bill Guerin have been  3rd/4th line players in the NHL, while Robb Stauber has done well for the  Kings in goal. Nothing more. In fact, I'm sure that an All-Star team assembled from the best Finnish League teams would do no better in the NHL than Hartford  or Tampa Bay currently are doing. --- But what happens if _all_ top-class Finnish & Swedish players gradually end up with Helsinki & Stockholm as the North American-based ones gradually retire and no Canadian/American team is allowed to draft new players from Scandinavia?  Here is what THE HOCKEY NEWS scouts think of our NHL-based players:  (28-30=superstar) (23-27=star) (18-22=NHL regular+) (13-17=NHL regular) ( 8-12=role player)  FINLAND:    D-Jyrki Lumme.......20 D-Teppo Numminen....20 D-Peter Ahola.......13  C-Jari Kurri........25 C-Christian Ruuttu..16  R-Teemu Selanne.....27  L-Esa Tikkanen......20 (Obviously, Selanne's ratings would be higher today than they were in January)  SWEDEN: D-Ulf Samuelsson....21 D-Fredrik Olausson..20 D-Niklas Lidstrom...18 D-Calle Johansson...18 D-Kjell Samuelsson..17 D-Tommy Sjodin......13 D-Tommy Albelin......7  C-Mats Sundin.......26 C-Thomas Steen......18  R-Thomas Sandstrom..22 R-Ulf Dahlen........18 R-Michael Nylander..13  L-Per-Erik Eklund...18 L-Johan Garpenlov...16 L-Mikael Andersson..15 L-Jan Erixon........14  This would be interesting. Clearly, Finland's top five players (Winnipeg's Selanne & Numminen, Vancouver's Lumme, Los Angeles' Jari Kurri and New York's Tikkanen) are right up there with any five-man unit Pittsburgh & co. have. But I have my doubts about the home-based Finnish players - the national team did well in the Canada Cup and World Championships largely due to the efforts of Markus Ketterer (the goalie), 3-4 or the players listed above and luck. There's presumably a lot of decent players in Finland that wouldn't be superstars at the highest level but still valuable role players, however. My guess would be that the Finnish Canada Cup team would be a .500 team in the NHL. --- Sweden is easier to judge because they have more players in North America. Their points total (16 players) is 274 - seven more than Ottawa's 22 top players combined! If we estimate there are six more NHL regulars back home in  Sweden, an all-Swedish team would assemble about 350-360 skill points. Deducting some points from Pittsburgh, NY Rangers and other teams that rely on Swedish players, the Swedish team would finish in sixth place - about as high as Boston, Vancouver, Calgary and Montreal on paper! So, the \\\"dynasty\\\" talk isn't completely unfounded here. An all-Finnish/all-Swedish team might have an advantage because the players would be playing at home half of the time, won't have to adapt to a foreign country and a foreign language, and presumably play the wide-open European variant of hockey rather than have to learn the North American checking game. However, if free agency becomes a factor the top  Scandinavian players still might end up playing for large-market teams after a  couple of years the same way Edmonton's \\\"dynasty\\\" crumbled in the late '80s.  Some fringe players likely will be drafted by other NHL teams as having an  exclusive talent pool might be a bit unfair after all. I'd settle for a  compromise, prohibit all European teams from signing a North American during  the first two rounds but allow them to keep their top two players. After this,  the amateur draft should be open to anyone.  \",\"  The Japanese are still on the learning curve as far as nuclear power goes.

Basically, there are two ways to steer a horse, plow-rein and neck-rein.  Plow-reining steers him by keeping the reins separate, and you pull in the direction you wish to go.  Neck-reining steers a horse by holding the reins together in one hand, and pulling against the horse's neck in the direction you wish to go.  When training a plow-steering horse to neck-rein, one technique is to cross the reins under his necks.  Thus, when neck-reining to the left, the right rein pulls against the right side of the neck, but the left side of the bit (which the horse is used to from his plow-reining days).  Are you sorry you asked yet? \",\" Here's something I posted about this a few years ago.  It's not fully up to date with all the new variations (some of which are just different manufacturer's synonyms):  ------ In practical terms, ignoring the technological details, this is my view of the families (NB I am not a giant corporation, which influences my views on things like availability and backward compatibility):  74 The original.  Speed good, power consumption fair.  Effectively  obsolete now; use 74LS or later, except for a *very* few oddball  functions like 7407 which are hard to find in newer families.  74H Modification of 74 for higher speed, at the cost of higher  power consumption.  Very obsolete; use 74F.  74L Modification of 74 for lower power, at the cost of lower speed.  Very obsolete; use CMOS.  74S Later modification of 74 for even higher speed, at some cost in  power consumption.  Effectively obsolete; use 74F.  74LS Combination of 74L and 74S, for speed comparable to 74 with lower  power consumption.  Best all-round TTL now, widest variety of  devices.  74F Fast as blazes, power not too bad.  The clear choice for high  speed in TTL.  Availability and prices generally good.  74AS Failed competitor to 74F, although a few 74AS parts do things  that are hard to find in 74F and thus are still useful.  74ALS Possible replacement for 74LS.  Generally souped up.  Still fairly  new, availability and prices possibly a problem.  74C Fairly old family, CMOS devices with TTL pinouts.  Competed with  4000 series, not too successfully.  Obsolete; use 4000 or newer  CMOS 74 families.  4000 (Thrown in as the major non-74 non-ECL logic family.)  The old CMOS  family, still viable because of *very* wide range of devices, low  power consumption, and wide range of supply voltages.  Not fast.  Very forgiving and easy to work with (beware static electricity,  but that comment applies to many other modern logic families too).  There are neat devices in this family that exist in no other.  The  clear choice when speed is not important.  74HC A new attempt at 74-pinout CMOS.  Fast compared to old CMOS, power  consumption often lower than TTL.  Possibly a good choice for  general-purpose logic, assuming availability and affordability.  CMOS logic levels, *not* TTL ones.  Beware very limited range of  supply voltages compared to older CMOS, also major rise of power  consumption at faster speeds.  74HCT 74HC with TTL logic levels.  Much the same comments as 74HC.  Read  the fine print on things like power consumption -- TTL compatibility  in CMOS involves some compromises.  10K (Thrown in for speed freaks.)  The low end of ECL.  Various sources  claim that it is *easier* to work with than super-fast TTL for  serious high-speed work.  Less forgiving, though:  read and follow  the rules or it won't work.  Availability to hobbyists limited,  can be expensive.  100K (For real speed freaks.)  Hot ECL.  Harder to handle than 10K, and  inconvenient packages.  Much more useful datasheets, however.  As for compatibility between families:  the 74 families (except 74C and 74HC) are all more or less logic-level compatible, but how many 74X devices you can drive from one 74Y output varies enormously with X and Y.  You just have to read the specs and do the arithmetic.  74C and 74HC are compatible with the others with a bit of hassle.  4000 compatibility can be a bit of hassle or a lot of hassle depending on what supply voltage 4000 is using. 10K or 100K to anything else is considerable hassle.  Me?  I use 4000 and 74LS with a sprinkling of 74F.  74HC[T] and 10K are interesting but I haven't used either significantly yet.\",\"Do you know if there is an airport nearby?

I found 3 shareware Workspace Managers, from Australia's MS-WINDOWS archive (monu6.cc.monash.edu.au), which mirrors some sites in the U.S.  The three I found were:  1. WORKSPACES 1.10 (wspace.zip)                                 This was the smallest and simplest    of the workspace managers that I found.  It is very easy to use.    It displays a small window, containing 6 buttons, plus an extra    button for configuration purposes.  One annoying feature was the    title window that is first presented when it is run - you must press    a key (not a mouse button!) for the thing to go away.  Also, it would    have been nice if there was an \\\"ALWAYS ON TOP\\\" setting for the little    window containing the workspace buttons.  Maybe some user-specified    strings on the buttons instead of the numbers one to six might be    a nice feature.  The simplicity and ease of use of this workspace    manager makes it an attractive package.  2. WORKSHIFT 1.6 (wrksft16.zip)                                While this workspace manager offered a    few features that WORKSPACES 1.10 lacked, it was quite time consuming    to set things up.  With WORKSPACES 1.10, all but the first workspace    is initially empty.  With WORKSHIFT 1.6, you need to take \\\"snapshots\\\"    of how you want each of your workspaces to look like - i.e. what     applications they contain.  Also, the main window is quite large,    but this does allow you to have a small view of what is in each workspace.    With WORKSPACES 1.10, there was no facility for viewing what was in    a workspace without switching to it.  WORKSHIFT 1.6 provides this    viewing functionality which is quite useful.  3. BIGDESK 2.30 and BACKMENU (backdesk.zip)                             This is an interesting package, which contains    a few other goodies as well as a workspace manager.  Other goodies    include \\\"Backmenu\\\", which provides a pop-up root menu when you    press a certain mouse button - just like in X-Windows.  The menu    is totally configurable, offering unlimited depth of cascading menus,    which is provides quite handy access to applications.  You could    say it is a menu-based alternative to the program manager.  Also    bundled in \\\"backdesk.zip\\\" is a program called \\\"WRUN\\\", which allows    you to run windows applications from a DOS shell under WINDOWS    instead of using the File Manager to run applications.      The actual workspace manager is called BIGDESK 2.30.  BIGDESK works quite    differently to the other two workspace managers in that it    doesn't provide a certain number of disjoint and separate workspaces.    In fact, it basically enlarges your desktop by a configurable amount,    and you choose which region of the desktop you want your screen to    focus in on.  This means you can have windows overlapping between different    viewing regions, unlike the first two workspace managers in which    each workspace was isolated from the other one.  The BIGDESK control window    allows to to move windows around your enlarged desktop.  Basically    the control window provides a small scale view of your viewing area    while your actual computer screen provides a large scale or blow-up    of a particular section.\",\"I am in the process of installing X11R5 on my Sun Sparcstation 2 and have run into a problem.

The Navy is considering reducing the number of attack subs to 40 (Navy Times) and that would entail getting rid of or mothballing some of the current Los Angeles class.  Politically, General Dynamics is in Connecticut and we will get Seawolf subs whether we need them or not.  In addition, more bases need to be closed. Probably Long Beach Naval Station and others. The Navy is talking about three main bases on each coast being  required to home port a total fleet of 320 ships.  The question is whether Les Aspin and Clinton will be able to face down a pork happy Congress. \",\" The difference in the litigation environment is reflected in the fees.  Lack of defensive medicine and near-absence of malpractice is really why we spend less using the most expensive approach of pure insurance in Canada (along with France and Germany) without HMO's --- the NYT has admitted that malpractice insurance fees are an order of magnitude lower in Canada but doctors take-home pay is almost equal to American doctors; also, minimal bureaucracy 'cos the system is so-o-o simple (early March).  Part of the deal for using the all-insurance approach like the French and Germans do (hey, why don't they criticize France and Germany?  Is it because too many people take French and German in college to make the accusations stick? (-;) was to preserve the doctors independance. Since the provincial wings of the CMA are the ones that go to bat when the fee schedule hikes are presented, the politically-bent doctors were just cackling when they realized the CMA would grow in strength rather than diminish, especially when unopposed unlike in socialized medicine approaches like Britain's National Health Service.   For non-life threatening things, market arguments adequately cover why certain procedures are in scarcer demand.  I have MD friends who can't make a living as specialists back in Manitoba not due to the insurance rates but because they won't get enough customers -- the CMA medical monopoly's grip on doctors licencing (as in the US) aside -- so they must move to larger places.  However, this does not refute debunking of waiting lines for urgent AND routine care, as has been done in the U.S. by Consumers Reports, health policy studies cited by Prof. Dennis E. Shea on USENET, CNN, NYT, etc.  Doug Fierro has posted a NYT article from 3 weeks ago about Canada's health insurance approach, on Talk.politics.medicine.  There is one small error in the article: not all of our hospitals are private.   Of course, the one thing to note is that in the Canada/France/Germany case, private insurance *offloaded* the basic coverage to the public sector.  They realized they were keeping low-risk/high-profit extra insurance for things like private/semi-private rooms (vs. ward accomodation), dental, glasses, etc. for corporate or personal benefits, they'll have nothing to do with you if you want to be covered for basic care.  At that point, they wouldn't even consider a \\\"voucher\\\" approach to broker the universal coverage and sell policies to make up the difference in the federal guidelines and market stuff.   It is \\\"free\\\" in that there are no deductibles nor copayments (two things which I advocate to make the Canadian insurance look more like real health insurance -- which actually it is).  I know that when working in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec, I was aware that I was paying for health insurance - e.g., in Toronto, OHIP fees were listed on my pay stub; Manitoba did not collect at paycheque time, but only annually at income tax time (built into the tax rate).  Only fiscal naifs will proclaim that it's free, along with the Canadian Left for that is part of their brainwashing agenda.  The French do have copayments, though.  France Magazine's Summer  1992 edition has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance coverage, including a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For  1-30 days, you're covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100% afterward.  With extra private insurance, you can get into a private hospital and be covered for any differences beyond the public hospital rate.  The public insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same cash amount for a private hospital and the difference is paid out-of-pocket or according to your supplementary private insurance. Over 2/3rds of French have some form of extra private insurance.  So, the other 30% of health costs in Europe are out of private funds, not gleaned from other taxes.  The GDP figures are combined public and private expenditures for total outlay using the same methods that yield the 13-14% figure for the U.S.   Health insurance does exist in Canada and in Western Europe, its just that it doesn't cover basic care.  You can opt out in Canada and Germany, but you'll have to go uninsured as a result because there are too few other people that do so --- i.e., no market.  When private insurance realized how much money they'd make without the risks involved in basic insurance (e.g., neurosurgery) versus deluxe amenities (e.g., having to call Granada TV to replace a rental set on the fritz in someone's private hospital room), they started to pat themselves on the back for their social responsibility.  In Quebec last spring, a consortium of private insurers publicly warned against any thoughts of privatizing routine, low cost parts of that province's public health insurance plan.  gld\",\": HI, I was wondering if anyone would be able to help me on twwo related : subjects.

Helsingius?   * * *  _____ <8.1> What are some known anonymous remailing and posting sites?    Currently the most stable of anonymous remailing and posting sites   is anon.penet.fi operated by julf@penet.fi for several months, who   has system adminstrator privileges and owns the equipment.    Including anonymized mail, Usenet posting, and return addresses    (no encryption).  Send mail to help@penet.fi for information.     Hal Finney has contributed an instruction manual for the cypherpunk   remailers on the ftp site soda.berkeley.edu (128.32.149.19):   pub/cypherpunks/hal's.instructions. See also scripts.tar.Z (UNIX   scripts to aid remailer use) and anonmail.arj (MSDOS batch files to   aid remailer use).    ebrandt@jarthur.claremont.edu   -----------------------------     Anonymized mail.  Request information from above address.        elee7h5@rosebud.ee.uh.edu   -------------------------     Experimental anonymous remailer run Karl Barrus     <elee9sf@Menudo.UH.EDU>, with encryption to the server.  Request     information from that address.        hal@alumni.caltech.edu   ----------------------     Experimental remailer with encryption to server and return     addresses.  Request information from above address.    hh@soda.berkeley.edu   hh@cicada.berkeley.edu   hh@pmantis.berkeley.edu   ----------------------     Experimental remailer.  Include header `Request-Remailing-To'.    nowhere@bsu-cs.bsu.edu    ----------------------     Experimental remailer allowing one level of chaining.  Run by     Chael Hall.  Request information from above address.    phantom@mead.u.washington.edu    -----------------------------     Experimental remailer with encryption to server.  `finger' site     address for information.    Notes   =====      - Cypherpunk remailers tend to be unstable because they are often     running without site administrator knowledge. Liability issues     are wholly unresolved.      - So far, all encryption is based on public-key cryptography and PGP     software (see the question on cryptography).     - Encryption aspects (message text, destination address, replies)     vary between sites.    - Multiple chaining, alias unlinking, and address encryption are     mostly untested, problematic, or unsupported at this time.  _____ <8.2> What are the responsibilities associated with anonymity?       Users   -----    - Use anonymity only if you have to. Frivolous uses weaken the     seriousness and usefulness of the capability for others.   - Do not use anonymity to provoke, harass, or threaten others.   - Do not hide behind anonymity to evade established conventions on     Usenet,  such as posting binary pictures to regular newsgroups.   - If posting large files, be attentive to bandwidth considerations.     Remember, simply sending the posting to the service increases     network traffic.   - Avoid posting anonymously to the regular hierarchy of Usenet; this     is the mostly likely place to alienate readers. The `alt'     hierarchy is preferred.   - Give as much information as possible in the posting (i.e.     references, etc.) Remember that content is the only means for     readers to judge the truth of the message, and that any     inaccuracies will tend to discredit the entire message and even     future ones under the same handle.   - Be careful not to include information that will reveal your     identity or enable someone to deduce it.  Test the system by     sending anonymized mail to yourself.   - Be aware of the policies of the anonymous site and respect them.      Be prepared to forfeit your anonymity if you abuse the privilege.   - Be considerate and respectful of other's objections to anonymity.   - ``Hit-and-run'' anonymity should be used with utmost reservation.     Use services that provide anonymous return addresses instead.   - Be courteous to the system operator, who may have invested large     amounts of time, be personally risking his account, or dedicating     his hardware, all for your convenience.    Operators   ---------    - Document thoroughly acceptable and unacceptable uses in an     introductory file that is sent to new users.  Have a coherent and     consistent policy and stick to it. State clearly what logging and     monitoring is occurring. Describe your background, interest, and     security measures. Will the general approach be totalitarian or     lassaiz-faire?   - Formulate a plan for problematic ethical situations and anticipate     potentially intense moral quandaries and dilemmas. What if a user     is blackmailing someone through your service? What if a user     posts suicidal messages through your service? Remember, your     users trust you to protect them.   - In the site introductory note, give clear examples  of situations     where you will take action and what these actions will be (e.g.     warn the user, limit anonymity to email or posting only, revoke     the account, 'out' the user, contact local administrator, etc.)   - Describe exactly the limitations of the software and hardware.     Address the bandwidth limitations of your site. Report candidly     and thoroughly all bugs that have  occurred.  Work closely with     users to isolate and fix bugs. Address all bugs noted below under     ``(in)stability of anonymity''.   - Document the stability of the site---how long has it been running?     What compromises have occured? Why are you running it? What is     your commitment to it?   - Include a disclaimer in outgoing mail and messages.  Include an     address for complaints, ideally appended to every outgoing item.      Consult a lawyer about your liability.   - Be committed to the long-term stability of the site. Be prepared     to deal with complaints and `hate mail' addressed to you.  If you     do not own the hardware the system runs on or are not the system     adminstrator, consult those who do and are.   - Be considerate of providing anonymity to various groups.  If     possible, query group readers.   - Keep a uniformity and simplicity of style in outgoing message     format that can be screened effectively by kill files.  Ensure     the key text `Anon' is  somewhere in every header.   - Take precautions to ensure the security of the server from     physical and  network-based attacks and infiltrations.    Readers   -------      - Do not complain, attack, or discredit a poster for the sole reason     that he is posting anonymously, make blanket condemnations that     equate anonymity with cowardice and criminality, or assail     anonymous traffic in general for mostly neutral reasons (e.g. its     volume is heavy or increasing).   - React to the anonymous information unemotionally.  Abusive posters     will be encouraged further if they get irrationally irate     responses.  Sometimes the most effective response is silence.   - Notify operators if very severe abuses occur, such as piracy,     harassment, extortion, etc.   - Do not complain about postings being inappropriate because they     offend you personally.   - Use kill files to screen anonymous postings if you object to the     idea of anonymity itself.   - Avoid the temptation to proclaim that all anonymous postings     should be barred from particular groups because no `possible' or     `conceivable' need exists.    References   ----------      See e.g. ftp.eff.org:/pub/academic/anonymity:    > This article is an excerpt from an issue of FIDONEWS on individual   > privacy and the use of handles.  It accepts the need of a system   > operator to know the name of a user; but suggests that the use of   > a handle is analogous to a request to withhold the name in a   > letter to the editor. The article concludes with a set of   > guidelines for preserving the right to be anonymous.  _____ <8.3> How do I `kill' anonymous postings?    James Thomas Green <jgreen@zeus.calpoly.edu>:    > Try putting this in your kill file:   >      >   /Anon/h:j   >   /Anonymous/h:j   >    > This will search the headers of the messages and kill any that   > contain `Anon' or `Anonymous' in them.  Not perfect and won't   > kill followups.       Note that anonymous server operators have the capability to mask   anonymous postings under which the above method will not work; so   far this practice is not widespread, but it may become more common   as a countermeasure to widespread anonymous filtering.    _____ <8.4> What is the history behind anonymous posting servers?    Originally anonymous posting services were introduced for   individual, particularly volatile newsgroups, where anonymity is   almost the preferred method of communication, such as talk.abortion   and alt.sex.bondage.  One of the first was one by Dave Mack   started in ~1988 for alt.sex.bondage. Another early one was   wizvax.methuen.ma.us run by Stephanie Gilgut (Gilgut Enterprises)   but was disbanded due to  lack of funds.  The system provided   anonymous return addresses. n7kbt.rain.com (John Opalko) took up   the functions of this server, including reinstating the anonymous   alias file. The group ``alt.personals has been chewing through   servers like there's no tomorrow.''      Spurred by the disappearance of `wizvax' and interested in   researching the idea, Karl Kleinpaste   <Karl_Kleinpaste@godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu> developed his own system   from scratch in six hours. By this time the idea of extending the   server to new, more `mainstream'  groups was starting to emerge,   and he explored the possibility partly at the specific request  by   multiple users for anonymity in other groups. ``The intended   advantage of my system was specifically to allow multiple group   support, with a single anon identifier across all.  This was   arguably the single biggest deficiency of previous anon systems.''    K. Kleinpaste posted a message on rec.nude asking users whether an   anonymous service would be welcome there, and judged a consensus   against it.     K. Kleinpaste introduced what he calls a ``fire extinguisher'' to   `squelch' or `plonk' abusive users in response to complaints, and   used this in three cases. Nevertheless, after a few months of   intense traffic he was eventually overwhelmed by the abuses of his   server. ``Even as restricted as it was, my system was subjected to   abuses to the point where it was ordered dismantled by the   facilities staff here. Such abuses started right after it was   created.''    In ~Nov 1992, Johan Helsingius (julf@penet.FI) set up the most   controversial anonymous site to date. anon.penet.fi is based on   scripts and C code written by K. Kleinpaste and supports anonymized   mail, posting, and return addresses. He initially wanted to confine   the service to Scandinavian users but expanded it to worldwide   accessability in response to 'lots' of international requests.      J. Helsingius policy of allowing anonymous posting to every Usenet   newsgroup has been met with strong and serious ideological   opposition (e.g. by news adminstrators in news.admin.policy).   Because of the relative newness and recent emergence of the medium,   abuses by anonymous posters  tend to have higher visibility than   ``routine'' abuses. His total commitment to preservation of   anonymity is also controversial.    For example, in a highly controversial and publicized case in ~Feb   1993,  an anonymous user posted a supposed transcript of desperate   crew dialogue during the Challenger shuttle disaster via   anon.penet.fi to sci.astro. Despite that the transcript had been   posted in the same place up to a year earlier (then   non-anonymously) and actually originated not with the poster but a   New York news tabloid, subsequent responses consisted largely of   vociferous outrage at the poster's use of anonymity, reverberating   through many newsgroups.       The original poster, using the same anonymous handle, later conceded   that the story ``seemed likely to have been fabricated,''   suggesting the plausible possibility that the original intent was   not to provoke outrage but gauge reactions on the authenticity of   the story (albeit crudely), free of personal risk from perceived   association with the item.  The ensuing commotion generated queries   for the original article by late-entering readers. The anonymous   user later posted deliberately offensive comments at his   detractors.    Despite piercingly irate and outraged complaints, and even the vocal   opposition and verbal abuse of K. Kleinpaste and eminent news   operators, J. Helsingius has largely avoided use of the ``fire   extingisher'' and the ``group bouncer'' mechanisms that limit the   scope of the service. As of ~March 1993 the anon.penet.fi site is   best described as `inundated': it has registered over 13,000 users   in its initial three months of operation, forwards ~3000 messages a   day, and approximately 5% of all Usenet postings are anonymized   through the site. The immense popularity is probably largely due   to the capability for `global' anonymity which has allowed users to   find creative uses in diverse areas not previously envisioned.    Johan Helsingius has been subject to extraordinary pressure to   dismantle his server in ~Feb 1993. At one point K. Kleinpaste   threatened publicly to organize a sort of vigilante group of irate   news operators to  send out revocation commands on all messages   originating from the site.  J. Helsingius has also alluded to   threats of flooding the  server.  The server has crashed several   times, at least once due to a saturation `mailbombing' through it   by an anonymous user.  Mr. Helsingius reports spending up to 5   hours per day  answering email requests alone associated with the   service's administration. In response to the serious threats he   disabled global group access temporarily for one week and   encouraged his users to defend the service publicly.      Based on fast-moving dialogue and creative suggestions by   ``cypherpunks,'' J. Helsingius has identified many security   weaknesses and valuable new features for the service, and is   currently in the process of code development and testing. He is   planning on upgrading the IBM compatible 386 machine to a 486 soon   to handle the voluminous load and is  considering integrating a new   system with very sophisticated functionality, including multiple   email aliases, alias allocation control, public-key encryption,   etc.    A very sophisticated anonymous posting system was set up in Dec.   1992 by D. Clunie <dclunie@pax.tpa.com.au> that used cryptography   in both directions (to/from) the server for the highest degree of   confidentiality seen so far.  However, it was running on a public   access account, and he had to shut it down after only several   weeks, upon receiving requests and conditions apparently ultimately   originating from NSF representatives. D. Clunie has released the   software to the public domain.    Recently the idea of a newsgroup devoted to `whistleblowing' on   government abuses has received wide and focused attention, and   group formation is currently underway.  In the basic scenario the   group would allow people to post pseudonymously using remailers,   and even establish reputations based on their authentifiable   digital signatures. The traffic may eventually reach reporters in   the mainstream news media.  deltorto@aol.com has volunteered to   attack multiple aspects of this project, including distributing   easy-to-read documentation on posting, anonymization, and   encryption.

Mitchell                           March 23, 1993   INTRODUCTION:   In order to increase public interest in space-based and lunar operations, a real miniature lunar-like environment is being constructed on which to test tele-operated models. These models are remotely-controlled by individuals located world-wide using their personal computers, for EduTainment purposes. Not only does this provide a test-bed for simple tele-operation and tele-presence activities but it also provides for the sharing of information on methods of operating in space, including, but not limited to, layout of a lunar colony, tele-operating machines for work and play, disseminating educational information, providing contests and awards for creativity and achievement and provides a new way for students worldwide to participate in Twenty-First century remote learning methods.   Because of the nature of the LTM1 project, people of all ages, interests and skills can contribute scenery and murals, models and structures, interfacing and electronics, software and graphics. In operation LTM1 is an evolving playground and laboratory that can be used by children, students and professionals worldwide. Using a personal computer at home or a terminal at a participating institution a user is able to tele-operate real models at the LTM1 base for experimental or recreational purposes. Because a real facility exists, ample opportunity is provided for media coverage of the construction of the lunar model, its operation and new features to be added as suggested by the users themselves.   This has broad inherent interest for a wide range of groups:  - tele-operations and virtual reality research  - radio control, model railroad and ham radio operation  - astronomy and space planetariums and science centers  - art and theater  - bbs and online network users  - software and game developers  - manufacturers and retailers of model rockets, cars and trains  - children  - the child in all of us   LTM1 OVERALL DESIGN:   A room 14 feet by 8 feet contains the base lunar layout. The walls are used for murals of distant moon mountains, star fields and a view of the earth. The \\\"floor\\\" is the simulated lunar surface. A global call for contributions is hereby made for material for the lunar surface, and for the design and creation of scale models of lunar colony elements, scenery, and machine-lets.    The LTM1 initial design has 3 tele-operated machinelets:  1. An SSTO scale model which will be able to lift off, hover and land;  2. A bulldozerlet which will be able to move about in a quarry area; and  3. A moon-train which will traverse most of the simulated lunar surface.    Each machinelet has a small TV camera utilizing a CCD TV chip mounted on  it. A personal computer digitizes the image (including reducing picture  content and doing data-compression to allow for minimal images to be sent  to the operator for control purposes) and also return control signals.   The first machinelet to be set up will be the moon-train since model trains with TV cameras built in are almost off-the-shelf items and control electronics for starting and stopping a train are minimal. The user will receive an image once every 1 to 4 seconds depending on the speed of their data link to LTM1.   Next, an SSTO scale model with a CCD TV chip will be suspended from a servo-motor operated wire frame mounted on the ceiling allowing for the SSTO to be controlled by the operator to take off, hover over the entire lunar landscape and land.   Finally, some tank models will be modified to be CCD TV chip equipped bulldozerlets. The entire initial LTM1 will allow remote operators worldwide to receive minimal images while actually operating models for landing and takeoff, traveling and doing work. The entire system is based on commercially available items and parts that can be easily obtained except for the interface electronics which is well within the capability of many advanced ham radio operator and computer hardware/software developers.   By taking a graphically oriented communications program (Dmodem) and adding a tele-operations screen and controls, the necessary user interface can be provided in under 80 man hours.   PLAN OF ACTION:   The Diaspar Virtual Reality Network has agreed to sponsor this project by providing a host computer network and Internet access to that network. Diaspar is providing the 14 foot by 8 foot facility for actual construction of the lunar model. Diaspar has, in stock, the electronic tanks that can be modified and one CCD TV chip. Diaspar also agrees to provide \\\"rail stock\\\" for the lunar train model. Diaspar will make available the Dmodem graphical communications package and modify it for control of the machines-lets. An initial \\\"ground breaking\\\" with miniature shovels will be performed for a live photo-session and news conference on April 30, 1993. The initial models will be put in place. A time-lapse record will be started for historical purposes. It is not expected that this event will be completely serious or solemn. The lunar colony will be declared open for additional building, operations and experiments. A photographer will be present and the photographs taken will be converted to .gif images for distribution world-wide to major online networks and bbs's. A press release will be issued calling for contributions of ideas, time, talent, materials and scale models for the simulated lunar colony.   A contest for new designs and techniques for working on the moon will then be announced. Universities will be invited to participate, the goal being to find instructors who wish to have class participation in various aspects of the lunar colony model. Field trips to LTM1 can be arranged and at that time the results of the class work will be added to the model. Contributors will then be able to tele-operate any contributed machine-lets once they return to their campus.   A monthly LTM1 newsletter will be issued both electronically online and via conventional means to the media. Any major new tele-operated equipment addition will be marked with an invitation to the television news media. Having a large, real model space colony will be a very attractive photo opportunity for the television community. Especially since the \\\"action\\\" will be controlled by people all over the world. Science fiction writers will be invited to issue \\\"challenges\\\" to engineering and human factors students at universities to build and operate the tele-operated equipment to perform lunar tasks. Using counter-weight and pulley systems, 1/6 gravity may be simulated to some extent to try various traction challenges.   The long term goal is creating world-wide interest, education, experimentation and remote operation of a lunar colony. LTM1 has the potential of being a long term global EduTainment method for space activities and may be the generic example of how to teach and explore in many other subject areas not limited to space EduTainment. All of this facilitates the kind of spirit which can lead to a generation of people who are ready for the leap to the stars!   CONCLUSION:   EduTainment is the blending of education and entertainment. Anyone who has ever enjoyed seeing miniatures will probably see the potential impact of a globally available layout for recreation, education and experimentation purposes. By creating a tele-operated model lunar colony we not only create world-wide publicity, but also a method of trying new ideas that require real (not virtual) skills and open a new method for putting people's minds in space.

The federal government has an interest in the intent of the perpetrators in the pursuit of preventing violations of civil rights. It's the way they broke the back of the Klan, by putting a lot of people away for a very long time for harrassing blacks specifically. It is a principle that has been well recognized as constitutionally valid since over 100 years ago. It has been used whenever a select group was getting bashed or harrassed more than any other person would just for being part of a minority. It is the only way we made the defeat of the south stick after the Civil War. People who harrassed free blacks, when normally they wouldn't find themselves harrassing just anyone walking around were expeditiously tried and jailed for 5 to 8 years until nobody wanted to try it anymore. Now with the 14th amendment guarantee of equal protection under the law, the law can use multiple crime and severe penalty involving intent as much as is needed to protect even one human that is a hated minority to somebody. They can call out the national guard just for them, as they did the school girls in Alabama during desegregation in the 1950's, and the president can nationalize the state militia and turn the guns of the militia that were being used to bar blacks right around to point at the thousands in the crowd with an order to shoot that they would have to obey or face possible death by firing squad under the Uniform Code of Military Justice for failing to obey a direct order while under arms! And by god, they did! Those southern boys turned right around an fixed bayonets! And the governor was left standing and was arrested by the federal marshalls that had brought the order to nationalize the guard. And that's why we need such an ability in federal jurisdiction. -RSW \",\"  The CR purchase would be the Ford Probe GT.  john  \",\"Hi,  I just compiled the X11R5 distribution for a Sun3/SunOS4.1.1.

So, I am posting it here so others can read it, check it out, and comment on it, and provide ideas for handling these sorts of things.  I have no verification to the accuracy or lack of accuracy of this article, but if accurate, I find it extremely disturbing, especially in light of various abuses of the SSN number regarding privacy, (I understand it is now to be required in CA to renew a drivers license, or to register a car) and other proposals regarding 'smart' national Identity Cards, wiretap proposals, and such.

Perhaps suggestions and ideas for preventing this and other such proposals from acquiring the force of law would be useful.  The cost simply outweighs any possible benefits, IMO.

That said, with no further comment, the article follows:  ------------ Begin included article ---------  Note:  This file will also be available via anonymous file transfer from csrc.ncsl.nist.gov in directory /pub/nistnews and via the NIST Computer Security BBS at 301-948-5717.      ---------------------------------------------------                           THE WHITE HOUSE                    Office of the Press Secretary  _________________________________________________________________  For Immediate Release                           April 16, 1993                   STATEMENT BY THE PRESS SECRETARY   The President today announced a new initiative that will bring the Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary program to improve the security and privacy of telephone communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement.  The initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.  For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.  Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.  A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" has been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new, relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today.  This new technology will help companies protect proprietary information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals.   A \\\"key-escrow\\\" system will be established to ensure that the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique                                   2   \\\"keys,\\\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately in two \\\"key-escrow\\\" data bases that will be established by the Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap.  The \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans.  To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings.  The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield criminals and terrorists.  We need the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" and other approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system), the President has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:       --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to           employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;       --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone           calls and data, under proper court or other legal           order, when necessary to protect our citizens;       --   the effective and timely use of the most modern           technology to build the National Information           Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and           the competitiveness of American industry in the global           marketplace; and        --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export           high technology products.  The President has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.                                    3  The Administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a National Information Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks (\\\"information superhighways\\\") will transmit video, images, HDTV programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone system transmits voice.  Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law.  Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet.  The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available.

A:   No.  \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with      no new authorities to access the content of the private      conversations of Americans.  Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on      a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation      encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to      decipher the message?  A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a      court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They      would then present documentation of this authorization to      the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and      obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug      smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are      stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key      escrow system.  Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?  A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent      entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the      Administration have yet to determine which agencies will      oversee the key-escrow data banks.  Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure      how strong the security is?    A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption      systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will      remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow      system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of      cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all      potential users that there are no unrecognized      vulnerabilities.  Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?  A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the      Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in      this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the      President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet      officials.  Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?  A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on      encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify      as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have      briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the      decisions related to this initiative.  Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?  A:   The government designed and developed the key access      encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the      microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product      manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip      manufacturer that produces them.  Q:   Who provides the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\"?  A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,      California, and will sell the chip to encryption device      manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed      to other vendors in the future.  Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices?   A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating      the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" into their devices.       Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological      solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be      willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more      powerful encryption devices?  A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be      considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow      mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product      that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive      than others readily available today, but it is just one      piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to      encryption technology, which the Administration is      developing.       The Administration is not saying, \\\"since encryption      threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,      we will prohibit it outright\\\" (as some countries have      effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \\\"every      American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an      unbreakable commercial encryption product.\\\"  There is a      false \\\"tension\\\" created in the assessment that this issue is      an \\\"either-or\\\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,      and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,      balanced approach such as is proposed with the \\\"Clipper      Chip\\\" and similar encryption techniques.  Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton      Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from      that of the Bush Administration?    A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption      technology in telecommunications and computing and are      committed to working with industry and public-interest      groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'      privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law      enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime      and terrorism.  Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use      the government hardware?  A:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control      requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is      required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The      same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the      attractions of this technology is the protection it can give      to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this      in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a      case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these      devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan      to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability      of these products.  ----------- End included article -----------  \",\"Hi all,  I've been locked in a small closet chained to a lab bench for the last week or two without access to really important information.

Nothing personal against Higuera mind you, just wondering how Bud can keep coffing up money for him when he lets current big producers go over a relative pittance.

Are they going to build a new stadium?  When?\",\"  I sure hope so. Because, the unspeakable crimes of the Armenians must  be righted. Armenian invaders burned and sacked the fatherland of  Urartus, massacred and exterminated its population and presented to  the world all those left from the Urartus, as the Armenian civilization.  All reliable Western historians describe how Armenians ruthlessly exterminated 2.5 million Muslim women, children and elderly people of  Eastern Anatolia and how they collaborated with the enemies of the  Ottoman Empire between 1914-1920.  It is unfortunately a truth that Armenians are known as collaborators of the Nazis during World War II and that, even today, criminal/Nazi members of the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism Triangle preach and instigate racism, hatred, violence and terrorism among peoples.   And x-Soviet Armenia continues its anti-Turkish policy in the following  ways:  1. x-Soviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide in order to shift international public opinion away from its political responsibility.  2. x-Soviet Armenia, employing ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism  Triangle and criminal/Nazi Armenians, attempts to call into question the  veracity of the Turkish Genocide.  3. x-Soviet Armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism through the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to  silence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests.  4. Using all its human, financial, and governmental resources, x-Soviet Armenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence through terrorism, bribery and other subversive methods, non-Turkish supporters of the Turkish cause, be they political, governmental and humanitarian.  Using all the aforementioned methods, the x-Soviet Armenian government  is attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community from making the Turkish Case a contemporary issue.  Yet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian government and its terrorist and revisionist organizations, in the last decades, thanks to the struggle  of those whose closest ones were systematically exterminated by the Armenians, the international wall of silence on this issue has begun to collapse, and  consequently a number of governments and organizations have become  supportive of the recognition of the Turkish Genocide.

In the Brock2 model, Bill James calculated predicted RBIs as RBI=.235*(Total Bases) + Home Runs.  This  completely ignores the context, which was all that Brock2  could do, since context was unknown to it.  So I thought I'd take that idea as a starting point and look how good a fit to the data you get by comparing (RBI-Home Runs) to SLG*RISP.  I've started with team data, using data from the Elias's that I've picked up over the years when a) I could afford them and b) I could stomach the thought of increasing Elias's profits. That gave me the years 1984-1986, 1988, and 1990.  (I don't  have team RBIs for '87 or I could add that year.)  If you run a simple least squares fit to the data you get   (RBI-Home Runs) = 0.81*SLG*RISP.  The correlation between the LHS and the RHS is 0.86, which is significant at a ridiculously high level.  So, I feel like the fit is good at the team level.  I've no started to move on to  the player level and have looked at 4 players (Will Clark, Ozzie Smith, Joe Carter, and Don Mattingly).  I hope to  add quite a few more during my copious free time this year.  It doesn't do too badly, except the equation underpredicts the low HR hitter (Smith), which may be a fault of the model or it could just be Ozzie.  The results:                             RBI-HR          Years        Actual   Predicted Carter  (84-88,90)     400       402.6 Clark   (87,88,90,92)  269       269.6 Matt'ly (84-88,90)     471       460.8 Smith   (84-88,90)     317       280.6  I think we can make a case (and I hope to make it stronger) that RBIs can be predicted simply from knowing how a player slugs overall and how many men are in scoring position when he comes up.  More later, Harold\",\"  Again, you missed Jesus's point.  If you read the surrounding passages you would understand what Jesus means by \\\"life in the world.\\\"  But as is, you bumbled around, asserted your standard axiom that the Bible is bunk, and came up with the wrong idea.  Also, you do not know exactly what Jesus means by eternal life.    Brian K., do you expect to jump in the middle of the quantum mechanics book and understand Hermite polynomials having not read the surrounding material?  Why do you such with the Bible?  For an idea what Jesus means by the world, look up references to it in your concordance.  For a good description, the whole Book of Ecclesiastes is game.  For  eternal life, check out John 17:3, John 3:15-16.  You will find that eternal life is quite different than what you think.  Eternal life starts NOW--an infinitely high quality of life living in fellowship with God.    If my diety exists, you would not just cease to exist.  Jesus talks of hell in Luke 16:19-31.

Good luck,  - Pete ____________________________________________________________________________\",\"According to what I have read on Biblical idioms, speaking \\\"in X's name\\\" is a standard Aramaic/Hebrew legal idiom for what we today would call Power of Attorney.  A person from Jesus' culture authorized to conduct business \\\"in John's name\\\" had full authority over John's financial affairs, but was held under a solemn fiduciary obligation to work only for John's benefit and consonant with John's wishes.  It was not required for the steward to preface each business transaction with \\\"in John's name\\\"; it was sufficient to have valid power of attorney and be operating in good faith. (Note the overlap here between legal and religious definitions of \\\"faith\\\".)  With this cultural background, praying \\\"in Jesus' name\\\" does not mandate a particular verbal formula; rather it requires that the petitioner be operating faithfully and consciously within an analogous \\\"fiduciary\\\" relationship with Jesus and for the purposes of His Kingdom.  The message of \\\"praying in Jesus' name\\\" is thus closely aligned with the parable of the talents and other passages about God's delegation of Kingdom business to his stewards, both resources and responsibilities.  This idea of praying \\\"in Jesus' name\\\" is not only present but prominent in the Lord's Prayer, although the verbal forumula is absent.  The act of praying the words \\\"In Jesus' Name\\\" may be beneficial if they cause us to clarify the relationship of our requests to the advancement of God's Kingdom.  For that reason, I'm not quite ready to say that the praying the formula is without meaning.  Prayers to God for other purposes (desperation, anger, thanksgiving, etc.) don't seem to be in this category at all, whether uttered by Christian or non-Christian, whether B.C. or A.D. (that's B.C.E. or C.E. for you P.C. :-).  I don't see anything in Christ's words to contradict the idea that God deals with all prayers according to His omniscience and grace.

Jim,  There are a couple of things about your post and others in this thread that are a little confusing. An atheist is one for whom all things can be understood as processes of nature - exclusively. There is no need for any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything. There is no purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by physics, chemistry, biology, etc.; everything is random, nothing is determnined. This would also have to include human intelligence of course and all its products. There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it acquire intelligence, it's just a happy accident. For an atheist, no event can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less value than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about- an event can have value.  The products of our intelligence are acquired from our environment, from teaching, training, observation and experience and are only significant to the individual mind wherein they reside. These mental processes and the images they produce for us are just electrical activity and nothing more; content is of no consequence. The human mind is as much a response to natural forces as water running down a hill. How then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing the values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? On what grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? It seems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, you have to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but what in nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke to establish your values. Since every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what difference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or otherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The only way an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the objection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn't like it - that's it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer that it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries no weight in any \\\"absolute\\\" sense. That you don't like what God told people to do says nothing about God or God's commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled with a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That your objections -seem- well founded is due to the way you've been conditioned; there is no \\\"truth\\\" content. The whole of your intellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality. I didn't make these rules, it's inherent in naturalistic atheism and to be consistent, you have to accept the non-significance of any human thought, even your own. All of this being so, you have excluded yourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil, etc. and cannot participate. Your opinion about the Bible can have no weight whatsoever.\",\"Hi All,  Would anyone out there in 'net-land' happen to have an authentic, sure-fire way of making this great sauce that is used to adorn Gyro's and Souvlaki?

Our editors need to be able to see how many spaces are in text but the character  displayed is a large hollow box.  They overlap each other and characters on each side, which is useless.  I believe the character used by W4W is the period-centred (0183). This character shows up with the windows Charmap display as the hollow box which tends to confirm this.  I have edited the corel font with Fontmonger and changing the font graphics for the 0183 character makes no difference to the font output in Charmap or W4W.

For one, you seem unable to master your lack of desire to understand even the slightest concept of the Bible.  Seems that ignorance has you mastered.  How about sexual sins?  Gotta any of those secret desires in your head that you harbor but can get control of?   Do you dehumanize women when they walk past you?  Do you degrade them to a sex object in your head?  Are you the master of that kind of thinking?  Do you insult people unknowingly, then regret it later.  Yet do it again the next time opportunity presents itself?  Are you truly the master of yourself?  I have admitted that I am not the master of my thought life at all times. That I sometimes say things I do want to say, and then repeat my mistake unwantingly.  I have admitted to myself that I cannot control every aspect of my being.  There are times I know I shouldn't say something, but then say it anyway.  There are times I simply forget a lesson. I, in fact, am not my own master.  I need help.  Jesus promised me this help.  And I took him up on his offer.  I have willfully let Jesus be my master because Jesus knows what is better for me than I myself do.  And why not?  Does not the creator know his creation better than the creation?  Does Toyota know what's better for the Corolla than the Corolla?   Then I guess ignorance is bliss for you.  Because Brian, you enjoy not having a clue about the Bible.       Can you witness motherly love with your senses?  How does caring and concern for you register with your senses?

You have life forever.  You can choose to either live it in hell in eternal torment where there is no communication whatsoever, or can choose to  live it in paradise with God.  That is what my God says.  And that was the issue.  Your made-up theism is what it is--made up.  It's wishful thinking.    Is this the religion of Kendigianism?  Most people are not Christian.  Most people, including Christians,  are not fond of feeling that they are imperfect.  Is \\\"the world an undesireable place\\\" a doctrine of Kendigianism?  It has nothing to do with my God.  Does Kendigism have magical mystical prayers as a part of its worship? Mine doesn't.  Does Kendigianism believe that the world will be holy again?   Mine doesn't.  Does Kendigianism also dictate that one must obey what the priest tells them like good little sheep?  Mine doesn't.  Is this a bunch of lies you tell yourself so that you can justify being  ignorant of the Bible?  Brian, following Christ has nothing to do with the doctrines of Kendigianism. You would find any of your doctrines in the Bible.   I don't follow Kendigianism. I follow Christ.   Also, to try to again show you your ignorance of Christ and the Bible in regards to \\\"priests\\\",  have you not read about the sole Melchizedek priest in Hebrews 7 and 8?  Have you not read what the purpose is of the Old Testament Levitical priesthood and why there should NOT be priests today?  Yes, guess what?  The Catholics messed up.

So you have no reason to lead a good life. Leading a good life is meaningless.   Why do you do such a meaningless thing?   Has the resurrection sunk in?  Jesus is alive.  Jesus is NOT dead.

Incidentally, my MP has responded to my questions on that issue, and it appears that the UK and other `approved' countries will get the secure A5 encryption, and `dodgy' countries will get A5X.  Existing mobile equipment will drop to clear mode when used with A5X systems, but newer equipment will use A5/A5X/clear depending on the capabilities of the base station.  The cops/feds do *not* need to be able to get hold of your private key to listen in to cellular conversations.  Encryption is not end-to-end, but  cellphone to base-station - it *has* to be this way so that cellular users and fixed installations can talk to each other.  For cellular to cellular calls, the transmission is decrypted at the base-station, passed to another base-station and re-encrypted.  The cops/feds can listen to the unscrambled call *provided* they get a warrant to tap into the cellular provider's equipment.  The only reason for wanting a crackable system is so they can listen without having to obtain a warrant.  But, maybe the Clipper system is secure, and they really do need a warrant to get the key out of escrow before they can listen in using a scanner (see above - they don't *have* to go down this route anyway).  I have my doubts, but even if true once they have the key they will *never* again need a warrant to tap into that particular phone whenever they want.  `Well, Judge, it appears he wasn't a drug-dealer after all, so naturally we'll stop listening in'...

I'm willing to speculate that the DX2-50 with local-bus will be 2-4 times  as fast as the DX-50 and probably as expensive (or cheap ;-)!\",\"For those Leaf fans who are concerned, the following players are slated for return on Thursday's Winnipeg-Toronto game :     Peter Zezel, John Cullen    Mark Osborne and Dave Ellett are questionable to return on Thursday.\",\"ITEM: Klipsch Forte 2 Speakers CONDITION: Mint AGE: 6 months old  PRICE: $1000/pair (retail: $1400/pair)\",\"The stragegy of the government is interesting.  The real fear comes from them doing more than this.  This is a voluntary program, and thus harder for us to object to on the surface.  Their strategy is a business one rather than legal one.  They are pushing to get a standard in place, a secret standard, and if they get it as a standard then they will drive competitors out of the market. It will be legal to sell better, untapable encryption that doesn't have registered keys, but it will be difficult, and thus not a plan for most phone companies.  You see, with clipper chip phones you'll be able to talk to any cellular company, or other phones or ports because they will follow the standard.  AT&T has already announced a clipper chip encryption product.  The government has marketed hard to get major vendors to use these chips.   If they get enough market share, they will rule.  And thus there will be very little market for systems that can't be tapped by the police.  The public isn't that concerned about it now, after all.  They freely do calls that anybody with an old TV can listen to today!  They won't pay big extra bucks for proprietary phones that secure them only from the police.  Well, some people will buy these phones, but they will only work with other proprietary phones, so the market will be small and the phones expensive.  Unless they are made in numbers large enough to sell them cheap, only the Mob will buy them.

The first part of the plan is to begin a comprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues such as export controls which have effectively denied most people easy access to robust encryption, and law enforcement issues posed by new technology.  However, EFF is very concerned that the Administration has already reached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry, before any public comment or discussion has been allowed.  Apparently, the Administration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone equipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed by the National Security Agency.  The so-called \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" is an 80-bit, split key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into chips manufactured by a military contractor.  Two separate escrow agents would store users' keys, and be required to turn them over law enforcement upon presentation of a valid warrant.  The encryption scheme used is to be classified, but the chips will be available to any manufacturer for incorporation into its communications products.       This proposal raises a number of serious concerns .  First, the Administration has adopted a solution before conducting an inquiry.  The NSA-developed Clipper Chip may not be the most secure product. Other vendors or developers may have better schemes. Furthermore, we should not rely on the government as the sole source for the Clipper or any other chips.  Rather, independent chip manufacturers should be able to produce chipsets based on open standards.  Second, an algorithm cannot be trusted unless it can be tested. Yet, the Administration proposes to keep the chip algorithm classified.  EFF believes that any standard adopted ought to be public and open.  The public will only have confidence in the security of a standard that is open to independent, expert scrutiny.    Third, while the use of the use of a split-key, dual escrowed system may prove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and law enforcement needs, the details of this scheme must be explored publicly before it is adopted.  What will give people confidence in the safety of their keys?  Does disclosure of keys to a third party waive an individual's Fifth Amendment rights in subsequent criminal inquiries?  These are but a few of the many questions the Administrations proposal raised but fails to answer.  In sum, the Administration has shown great sensitivity to the importance of these issues by planning a comprehensive inquiry into digital privacy and security.  However, the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" solution ought to be considered as part of the inquiry, and not be adopted before the discussion even begins.  DETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL:  ESCROW  The 80-bit key will be divided between two escrow agents, each of whom hold 40-bits of each key.  The manufacturer of the communications device would be required to register all keys with the two independent escrow agents.  A key is tied to the device, however, not the person using it.  Upon presentation of a valid court order, the two escrow agents would have to turn the key parts over to law enforcement agents.  According to the Presidential Directive just issued, the Attorney General will be asked to identify appropriate escrow agents.  Some in the Administration have suggested that one non-law enforcement federal agency (perhaps the Federal Reserve), and one non-governmental organization could be chosen, but there is no agreement on the identity of the agents yet.  CLASSIFIED ALGORITHM AND THE POSSIBILITY OF BACK DOORS  The Administration claims that there are no back doors -- means by which the government or others could break the code without securing keys from the escrow agents -- and that the President will be told there are no back doors to this classified algorithm.  In order to prove this, Administration sources are interested in arranging for an all-star crypto cracker team to come in, under a security arrangement, and examine the algorithm for trap doors.  The results of the investigation would then be made public.  The Clipper Chipset was designed and is being produced and a sole-source, secret contract between the National Security Agency and two private firms:  VLSI and Mycotronx.  NSA work on this plan has been underway for about four years.  The manufacturing contract was let 14 months ago.  GOVERNMENT AS MARKET DRIVER  In order to get a market moving, and to show that the government believes in the security of this system, the feds will be the first big customers for this product.  Users will include the FBI, Secret Service, VP Al Gore, and maybe even the President.  At today's Commerce Department press briefing, a number of people asked this question, though:  why would any private organization or individual adopt a classified standard that had no independent guaranty of security or freedom from trap doors?  COMPREHENSIVE POLICY INQUIRY  The Administration has also announced that it is about to commence an inquiry into all policy issues related to privacy protection, encryption, and law enforcement.  The items to be considered include:  export controls on encryption technology and the FBI's Digital Telephony Proposal.  It appears that the this inquiry will be conducted by the National Security Council.  Unfortunately, however, the Presidential Directive describing the inquiry is classified.  Some public involvement in the process has been promised, but they terms have yet to be specified.  FROM MORE INFORMATION CONTACT:  Jerry Berman, Executive Director (jberman@eff.org) Daniel J.

This may be a dangerous thing to do.  It is my opinion that most educated or well informed people of this country have some distrust of the government. This should exist because as a bureaucracy, any government given enough time will tend to exist for it self and not for the original purpose it was  created for.  This distrust by the people should keep those in power in-line. That and a properly functioning press.  When a sensationalism oriented press portrays a group of people as \\\"nuts\\\" or crazies, a violation of those people's civil rights seem justified.   Since we, as American's, have the  gurantee of rights as enumerated in the constitution, to include the 2nd ammendment, the government must appease the public's opinion or risk  voted out of existance, or if it has become corrupt enough to tamper with domocratic process itself, being thrown out by force.   Our government as it stands, must appease the public.  Therefore the  official press releases portray the BD's as fanatics who are a threat to public safety.  We must not prejudge people based on one sided information. So far the only information that we are being given is comming from the very agency that was embarrased by the BD(Branch Davidians sp?).  It is to their advantage to make the BD's as fanatical and dangerous as possible.  If they were portrayed as law-abiding citizen's, then they(ATF) had no justification what so ever of doing what they did.    So let's keep an open mind.  Jokes like above, even though it may be funny, may mislead the public from the truth of the matter.  Just as an aside,  my understanding of U.S. vs Rock Island and U.S. vs Dalton leads me to believe that the National Firearms Act, which allows the Fed's (in this case ATF) to regulate firearms(machine guns), has been deemed to be unconstitutional since 1986.(By two federal district courts at least). And since, I believe the only reason ATF was involved in this case is because of firearms violations, it would be interesting to  find out whether or not the search warrent was based on the NFA. It would be very embarrassing indeed if a search warrent based on a possibly unconstitutional law has resulted in 4 deaths(Law enforcement).    **************************************************************************** The above opinions are mine and mine only.

Thanks,  Deepak \",\"   Why do we follow God so blindly?  Have you ever asked a physically blind person why he or she follows a seeing eye dog? The answer is quite simple--the dog can see, and the blind person cannot.   I acknowledge, as a Christian, that I am blind.  I see, but I see  illusions as well as reality.  (Watched TV lately?) I hear, but I hear lies as well as truth.  (Listen to your  radio or read a newspaper.)  Remember, all that tastes well is not healthy.  So, I rely one the one who can see, hear, and taste everything, and knows what is real, and what is not. That is God.   Of course, you may ask, if I cannot trust my own senses, how do I know whether what I see and hear about God is truth or a lie.  That is why we need faith to be saved.  We must force ourselves to believe that God knows the truth, and loves us enough to share it with us, even when it defies what we think we know.  Why would He have created us if He did not love us  enough to help us through this world?   I also do trust my experiences to some extent.  When I do things that defy the seeming logic of my experience,  because it is what my Father commands me to do, and I see the results in the long term, I find that He has led me in the proper direction, even though it did not feel right at the time.  This is where our works as Christians are important:  As exercises of the body make the body strong, excercises of faith make the faith strong.     As for you, no one can \\\"convert\\\" you.  You must choose to follow God of your own will, if you are ever to follow Him.  All we as Christians wish to do is share with you the love we have received from God.  If you reject that, we have to accept your decision, although we always keep the offer open to you.  If you really want to find out why we believe what we believe, I can only suggest you try praying for faith, reading the Bible, and asking Christians about their experiences personally.  Then you may grow to understand why we believe what we do, in defiance of the logic of this world.

Actually, I just finished writing a motif animation program... (take-lots-of-image-data-and-display-it-pretty-darn-fast). When using on-server pixmaps or shared memory, I had to insert a delay loop to keep it from going too quickly :). Testing both methods side by side, they were just about equal.    The advantage of SHM is that your X server doesn't grow to ridiculous sizes; but pixmaps can work over a network and *are* removed if your application dies (one tends to use ipcrm manually quite a bit when debugging SHM apps).    Shared memory also has the problem that some operating systems (e.g. Ultrix) seem to allow only a small number of segments (~6) to be attached to a process at once; consequently, a redraw becomes XShmAttach();XShmPutImage();XShmDetach(); on Dec systems. And Dec's 24 bit displays (like the ones I tend to use most often) don't seem to support the extension (maybe someone compiled them wrong?), and using pixmaps causes the X server to crash (failed mallocs), so one *has* to use the local unix domain socket (which really isn't that bad; one copies the info three times per redraw instead of one).    In short: allowing all three forms of display, within the program is a Good Thing (minus SHM if running over a network), and let the user pick whatever feels fastest.

I would rather have Zane Smith pitch right handed than have Moeller pitch at all.  2) I am sure Simmons was ready to say I told you so after Otto had an impressive win last week. NOw Otto's latest debacle has restored Simmon's reputation. Now he looks like he is back in his '92 form when he had the AL's highest ERA among starters. Four our sake(not Ted's sake), I hope he pitches with a 3.5 ERA for the rest of the season. Yeah, right.  3) Tomlin and Merced are a bit disappointing. They are still doing decently. BUt considering the considerable amount of talent and maturity they have shown their first seasons, they seem to have actually gotten a little bit worse. Tomlin was almost unhittable his rookie year against lefty batters. Merced had a very good OBA his rookie year. He showed a lot of concentration at the plate in his rookie year.  4) Walk: Well, he seems to be on the losing end tonight. BUt I still think that Walk desrved his contract.  5) Leyland should accept a part of the blame for the LaValliere situation. I can't understand his and management's fear of losing Tom Prince through waivers. Even if they do, what's the use. He is aright hander like Slaught. Not a very smart platoon. Also, I am blaming Leyland in this case, since he is hcurrently    convinced that LaVAlliere is through, while giving him way too much time last year in the regular season AND the playoffs(SLaught should have played in all 7 games; he has a good average against right handed pitching). Didn't Leyland and Simmons forsee this last year, and attempt to trade LaValliere last year itself? Any fool could tell them LaVAlliere wasn't very fit last year.  6) Dennis MOeller is SCARY!!! 7) Candeleria: Well, he is not going to have such a high ERA at the end of the season. Maybe it will be in 3-4 range. BUt $1 million  plus? Come on. Other than the customary home run giving stage Patterson goes through for a few weeks, Patterson has served the PIrates very well each year. So far, he seems to have pitched well for the Rangers. I think the PIrates should have spent the money on Patterson in stead.  8) The Rookie batters: Well, Young has surprised me a bit with his instant impact. Other than that, their excellent performance hasn't been too much of a surprise. I think we should thank Doughty for that.  9) Rookie Pitchers: Worse than expected, especially Cooke. 10) Slaught: How come he wasn't given a contract extension last year? NOw his value has increased immensely.  11) Lonnie Smith!! Well, Eric Davis was signed for a comparable amount. Let's see. Eric can hit better. He can run better. He can field better. Now why didnt the PIrates go after Eric Davis. An injured Davis is better than a healthy Lonnie Smith. Even if Lonnnie Smith gets some big hits this year,he won't be an asset. He has looked terrible on the bases and in the field.  12) Management: BIG BIG ZERO. Sauer has yet to make a forceful agreement in favor of revenue sharing. He seems more concerned about pleasing that idiot Danforth by preparing the team for a move to Tampa Bay. 13) Alex Cole fiasco. The PIrates infield and CF positions look good. The RF and LF would have looked good if we could have gotten Cole to replace two of the four outfielders. Eric Davis, Van Slyke and Cole would have made a very respectable outfield. Even without Eric Davis, thye PIrates would have a respectable outfield with Cole, SVan Slyke, and Merced(I think he should hit left handed against lefts in stead of switch hitting). Simmons did have options for the outfield. Ironically, the biggest accomplishment of Simmon's tenure was getting Alex Cole really cheap. Too bad.  14) Compensatory draft picks for Bonds: Forget it. The pirates can rant and rave. they will not get those picks. As of now, the issue is still being appealed. Now, if this doesnt convince anyone that Simmons and Sauer are idiots, nothing else will.  On a final note. Tim Wakefield won't be as awful as he was in his last 2 starts. BUt don't count on him pitching like last year for the rest of the season.

If we  unthinkingly adopt pantheistic ideas that are opposed to Christianity,  we can pervert our faith.  When we clearly recognize pantheism when we  encounter it we have the opportunity to embrace what is consistent with  Christianity and reject what isn't.      We need to be alert, always thinking and questioning.  We must examine  the underlying assumptions of every book we read, tv program we watch  and socio-political movement we participate in.  Ideas are important.   Philosophies and doctrines are what give form to the events of our  lives.  They are the basis from which we live our lives of love and  service.  The command to love God with all one's mind means no fuzzy- headed drifting from idea to idea.    One Christian who acknowledges this is the Pope.  It is a frequent theme  in his writings.  Indeed, thoughtful Christians from most traditions  recognize that consumerism has no place in the lives of Christians.  It  too is a perversion and dangerous to our faith.

Neto):  This all sounds suspiciously like my company might have something to do with this.  Background first: Megatek has a series of framebuffers designed as X accelerators. For the most part these are designed for Sun SBUS and Sun (and other vendor's) VME systems.  That said, Megatek products support multi-screen and/or multi-display on a sigle workstation. Most of our cards have a keyboard/mouse port which can be used to provide additional displays. For example, say you hade a Sparcstation with an Sbus expansion chassis. You could put in six frambuffers, allowing a total of six screens in the system. You could then attach from 1 to 6 keyboard/mice, allowing you to mix and match any combination of screens and displays. You could have 1 6-screen display, 3 2-screen displays, 6 1-screen displays, or 1 2-screen display and 1 4-screen display. Basically any combination.  Because of this, we at Megatek try to be very careful about the use of the words multi-screen and multi-display. They are quite different in meaning, and (at least in X) have exact definitions.  The reason I ramble like this is the mention of an upper limit if 12 screens in a display. As it so happens, there's a define in the server that determines the most screens supported (server/include/misc.h, MAXSCREENS). As released my MIT, this is 3. As released by Megatek, this is 12.  As such, the most screens supported by a single Megatek display (i.e. X server) is 12. If someone construed this to be a limitation of X I'm sorry, but clearly (as pointed out so well by Mr. Neto) this is not the case.  We just did it here because nobody has ever asked us for more. Of course, I could say \\\"Buy all you want, we'll support more.\\\" -- \",\"   If by that you mean anything on the GD approach, there was an article on it in a recent Avation Week.

I have a Mitsubishi 63 meg Hard Drive,  and am running Smartdrv (the version that comes with Windows 3.1) on  it.  I rarely use Windows.  I use a program called Disk Technician  Gold v1.14 to do diagnostics live time on my hard drive.  It works by  having a device driver detect whenever more than one read is  necessary for a file, or if there is anything else is wrong with it,  and minor problems are fully checked out upon rebooting.  My hard  drive is notorious for bad sectors.  I usually end up with 8 new bad  sectors a week.           Here's what happened:  I ran a program, and DTG broke in with  an Emergency Warning and recommended I reboot.  It gave me this  message twice before the program was fully loaded.  I exited the program  and did just this.  DTG went through its bootup process, examining  for new errors etc., and a screen popped up and said something about  sectors for a brief period of time.           I then went back to the program, executed it again, and the  exact same error was detected.  I rebooted and tried again, and the  same error happened again.  So, I removed DTG from memory, and went  to the program to see if I could detect anything wrong.  Sure enough  there was a number of read attempts.  So I rebooted and reloaded DTG,  but removed the cache.  I executed the program.  No read errors,  either audible or detected by DTG.  I quit the program, loaded the  cache, and ran the program again.  The errors were detected.           Ok, so the errors are there, and DTG detects but doesn't fix  them, when the cache is loaded.  When the cache is not loaded there are  no errors.  So, to see if the cache was interfering with any other  files, I went into xtree gold and tagged all files, and searched them  for a random string (in other words, I wanted the program to  completely read every file on my hard drive).  Before I got through  the c's DTG had detected at least six errors and recommended I reboot.           Does anybody, have any idea why Smartdrv is causing misreads on  my hard drive?  Oh, there are exactly two misreads per file, and 1 in  about every 100 files are affected.             I originally posted this message to Disk Technician Corp.'s  system, but I figured someone out in netland may know enough about  smartdrv to help me out. \",\" At issue was not a trial behind closed doors, but arrest, trial and imprisonment in complete secrecy.  This was appraently attempted in the case of Vanunu and failed.  It has happened before, and there is reason to believe it still goes on.  Read this:  From Ma'ariv, February 18 (possibly 28), 1992  PUBLICATION BAN          The State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many         years there have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were         sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of         their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever         being made public.  By Baruch Me'iri  All those involved in this matter politely refused my request, one way or another: \\\"Look, the subject is too delicate.  If I comment on it, I will be implicitly admitting that it is true; If I mention a specific case, even hint at it, I might be guilty of making public something which may legally not be published\\\".  The State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many years there have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever being made public. More precisely: A court ordered publication ban was placed on the fact of their arrest, and later on their imprisonment.  In Israel of 1993, citizens are imprisoned without us, the citizens of this country, knowing anything about it.  Not knowing anything about the fact that one person or another were tried and thrown in prison, for security offenses, in complete secrecy.  In the distant past -- for example during the days of the [Lavon - YA] affair -- we heard about \\\"the third man\\\" being in prison.  But many years have passed since then, and what existed then can today no longer be found even in South American countries, or in the former Communist countries.  But it appears that this is still possible in Israel of 1993.  The Chair of the Knesset Committee on Law, the Constitution and Justice, MK David Zucker, sent a letter on this subject early this week to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice, and the Cabinet Legal Advisor.  Ma'ariv has obtained the content of the letter:  \\\"During the past several years a number of Israeli citizens have been imprisoned for various periods for security offenses.  In some of these cases a legal publication ban was imposed not only on the specifics of the crimes for which the prisoners were convicted, but even on the mere fact of their imprisonment.  In those cases, after being legally convicted, the prisoners spend their term in prison without public awareness either of the imprisonment or of the prisoner\\\", asserts MK Zucker.  On the other hand Zucker agrees in his letter that, \\\"There is absolutely no question that it is possible, and in some cases it is imperative, that a publication ban be imposed on the specifics of security offenses and the course of trials.  But even in such cases the Court must weigh carefully and deliberately the circumstances under which a trial will not be held in public.  \\\"However, one must ask whether the imposition of a publication ban on the mere fact of a person's arrest, and on the name of a person sentenced to prison, is justified and appropriate in the State of Israel.  The principle of public trial and the right of the public to know are not consistent with the disappearance of a person from public sight and his descent into the abyss of prison.\\\"  Zucker thus decided to turn to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice and the Cabinet Legal Advisor and request that they consider the question.  \\\"The State of Israel is strong enough to withstand the cost incurred by abiding by the principle of public punishment.  The State of Israel cannot be allowed to have prisoners whose detention and its cause is kept secret\\\", wrote Zucker.  The legal counsel of the Civil Rights Union, Attorney Mordechai Shiffman said that, \\\"We, as the Civil Rights Union, do not know of any cases of security prisoners, Citizens of Israel, who are imprisoned, and whose imprisonment cannot be made public.  This is a situation which, if it actually exists, is definitely unhealthy.  Just like censorship is an unhealthy matter\\\".  \\\"The Union is aware\\\", says Shiffman, \\\"of cases where notification of a suspect's arrest to family members and lawyers is withheld.  I am speaking only of several days.  I know also of cases where a detainee was not allowed to meet with an attorney -- sometimes for the whole first month of arrest.  That is done because of the great secrecy.  \\\"The suspect himself, his family, his lawyer -- or even a journalist -- can challenge the publication ban in court.  But there are cases where the family members themselves are not interested in publicity.  The journalist knows nothing of the arrest, and so almost everyone is happy...\\\"  Attorney Yossi Arnon, an official of the Bar, claims that given the laws as they exist in Israel today, a situation where the arrest of a person for security offenses is kept secret is definitely possible.  \\\"Nothing is easier.  The court orders a publication ban, and that's that.  Someone who has committed security offenses can spend long years in prison without us knowing anything about it.\\\"  -- Do you find this situation acceptable?  Attorney Arnon: \\\"Definitely not.  We live in a democratic country, and such a state of affairs is impermissible.  I am well aware that publication can be damaging -- from the standpoint of security -- but total non-publication, silence, is unacceptable. Consider the trial of Mordechai Vanunu: at least in his case we know that he was charged with aggravated espionage and sentenced to 18 years in prison.  The trial was held behind closed doors, nobody knew the details except for those who were authorized to.  It is somehow possible to understand, though not to accept, the reasons, but, as I have noted, we at least are aware of his imprisonment.\\\"  -- Why is the matter actually that serious?  Can't we trust the discretion of the court?  Attorney Arnon: \\\"The judges have no choice but to trust the presentations made to them. The judges do not have the tools to investigate.  This gives the government enormous power, power which they can misuse.\\\"  -- And what if there really is a security issue?  Attorney Arnon: \\\"I am a man of the legal system, not a security expert.  Democracy stands in opposition to security.  I believe it is possible to publicize the matter of the arrest and the charges -- without entering into detail.  We have already seen how the laws concerning publication bans can be misused, in the case of the Rachel Heller murder.  A suspect in the murder was held for many months without the matter being made public.\\\"  Attorney Shiffman, on the other hand, believes that state security can be a legitimate reason for prohibiting publication of a suspect's arrest, or of a convicted criminal's imprisonment.  \\\"A healthy situation?  Definitely not.  But I am aware of the fact that mere publication may be harmful to state security\\\".  A different opinion is expressed by attorney Uri Shtendal, former advisor for Arab affairs to Prime Ministers Levi Eshkol and Golda Meir.  \\\"Clearly, we are speaking of isolated special cases.  Such situations contrast with the principle that a judicial proceeding must be held in public. No doubt this contradicts the principle of freedom of expression.  Definitely also to the principle of individual freedom which is also harmed by the prohibition of publication.  \\\"Nevertheless\\\", adds Shtendal, \\\"the legislator allowed for the possibility of such a ban, to accommodate special cases where the damage possible as a consequence of publication is greater than that which may follow from an abridgment of the principles I've mentioned. The authority to decide such matters of publication does not rest with the Prime Minister or the security services, but with the court, which we may rest assured will authorize a publication ban only if it has been convinced of its need beyond a shadow of a doubt.\\\"  Nevertheless, attorney Shtendal agrees: \\\"As a rule, clearly such a phenomenon is undesirable. Such an extreme step must be taken only in the most extreme circumstances.\\\"\",\" Sometimes I have a problem with doctor's prescribing medicine like this.  I of course don't know the exact situation, and anti-depressants may work, but it isn't helping the ringing at all, is it?    Mine started about three years back.  Turns out I have tinnitus bilateral (translation: ringing in both ears, basically ;).  If this is what it is, she'll probably get used to it.  It would keep me up and drive me nuts too, but nowadays, I have to plug both my ears with my fingers to check to see if they are ringing.  Usually they are, but you get so used to it, it just gets tuned out.  Yes, this is what I've read about it... not just from my own personal experience.    Millions have it, according to my physician.  You just learn to cope with it (like I mentioned earlier) by ignoring it.  It eventually becomes unconscious.  The doc also said it could be caused by diet (ie: too much caffeine) and stress, but I haven't changed my lifestyle much, and it just comes and goes (it is always there somewhat, but now I rarely notice it when it really \\\"kicks in\\\").  Also, it doesn't necessarily mean there is any hearing loss, either caused by it or causing it.  I had an ENT (ear/nose/throat) exam, and passed.  In fact, my hearing is quite good considering I don't take as good of care of my hearing as I should.  Her reaction is normal.  If it is tinnitus, chances are good she'll begin to not even notice it.    This info is taken mostly from a few \\\"experts\\\", my own experience, and some readings (sorry, it was a few years back and don't have any specifics handy).\",\"I can not believe the way this thread on candida(yeast) has progressed.

Those that were  raised on farms and saw first-hand the effect of diet on the health of their  farm animals and those students who had made a dramatic diet change prior to  entering medical school(switched to the vegan diet).  Typically, this is  about 1/3 of my class of 90 students.  Those not interested in nutrition  either tune me out or just stop coming to class.  That's okay because I  know that some of what I'm teaching is going to stick and there will be at  least a few \\\"enlightened\\\" physicians practicing in the U.S.  It's really  too bad that most U.S. medical schools don't cover nutrition because if  they did, candida would not be viewed as a non-disease by so many in the  medical profession.  In animal husbandry, an animal is reinnoculated with \\\"good\\\" bacteria after  antibiotics are stopped.  Medicine has decided that since humans do not  have a ruminant stomach, no such reinnoculation with \\\"good\\\" bacteria is  needed after coming off a braod spectrum antibiotic.  Humans have all  kinds of different organisms living in the GI system(mouth, stomach, small  and large intestine), sinuses, vagina and on the skin.  These are  nonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune  system is compromised.  They are also called nonpathogens because unlike  the pathogenic organisms that cause human disease, they do not produce  toxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body.  But any of  these organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up  residence within the body.  A poor mucus membrane barrier can let this  happen and vitamin A is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier. Steve got real upset with Elaine's doctor because he was using anti-fungals  and vitamin A for her GI problems.  If Steve really understoood what  vitamin A does in the body, he would not(or at least should not) be calling  Elaine's doctor a quack.  Here is a brief primer on yeast.  Yeast infections, as they are commonly  called, are not truely caused by yeasts.  The most common organism responsible for this type of infection is Candida albicans or Monilia which is actually a  yeast-like fungus.  An infection caused by this organism is called candidiasis. Candidiasis is a very rare occurance because, like an E. Coli infection, it  requires that the host immune system be severly depressed.    Candida is frequently found on the skin and all of the mucous membranes of  normal healthy people and it rarely becomes a problem unless some predisposing factor is present such as a high blood glucose level(diabetes) or an oral  course of antibiotics has been used.  In diabetics, their secretions contain  much higher amounts of glucose.  Candida, unlike bacteria, is very limited in  it's food(fuel) selection.  Without glucose, it can not grow, it just barely  survives.  If it gets access to a lot of glucose, it blooms and over rides  the other organisms living with it in the sinuses, GI tract or vagina.  In  diabetics, skin lesions can also foster a good bloom site for these little  buggers.  The bloom is usually just a minor irritant in most people but  some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus  membrane or skin bloom site.  Whether this is an allergic like reaction to  the candida or not isn't certain.  When the bloom is in the vagina or on  the skin, it can be easliy seen and some doctors do then try to \\\"treat\\\" it. If it's internal, only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty  nondiscript.     Candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in  the sinuses, the GI tract(mouth, stomach and intestines) and in the  vaginal tract which compete with it for food.  The human immune system  ususally does not bother itself with these(nonpathogenic organisms) unless  they broach the mucus membrane \\\"barrier\\\".  If they do, an inflammatory  response will be set up.  Most Americans are not getting enough vitamin A  from their diets.  About 30% of all American's die with less Vitamin A than  they were born with(U.S. autopsy studies).  While this low level of vitamin  A does not cause pathology(blindness) it does impair the mucus membrane  barrier system.  This would then be a predisposing factor for a strong  inflammatory response after a candida bloom.    While diabetics can suffer from a candida \\\"bloom\\\" the  most common cause of  this type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which  knock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main  competition for candida as far as food is concerned.  While drugs are  available to handle candida, many patients find that their doctor will not  use them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection.  The toxicity of  the anti-fungal drugs does warrant some caution.  But if the GI or sinus  inflammation is suspected to be candida(and recent use of a broad spectrum  antibiotic is the smoking gun), then anti-fungal use should be approrpriate  just as the anti-fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring  vaginal yeast infections, in spite of what Mr. Steve Dyer says.  But even in patients being given the anti-fungals, the irritation caused by  the excessive candida bloom in the sinus, GI tract or the vagina tends to  return after drug treatment is discontinued unless the underlying cause of  the problem is addressed(lack of a \\\"good\\\" bacterial flora in the body and/or  poor mucus membrane barrier).  Lactobacillus acidophilus is the most effective  therapy for candida overgrowth.  From it's name, it is an acid loving  organism and it sets up an acidic condition were it grows.  Candida can not  grow very well in an acidic environment.  In the vagina, L. acidophilius is  the predominate bacteria(unless you are hit with broad spectrum  antibiotics).    In the GI system, the ano-rectal region seems to be a particularly good  reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very  favorable environment around the rectum for transfer(through moisture and  humidity) of candida to the vaginal tract.  One of the most effctive ways to  minimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear.    If the bloom occurs in the anal area, the burning, swelling, pain and even  blood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids.  If the  bloom manages to move further up the GI tract, very diffuse symptomatology  occurs(abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool).  This positive stool  for occult blood is what sent Elaine to her family doctor in the first  place.  After extensive testing, he told her that there was nothing wrong  but her gut still hurt.  On to another doctor, and so on.  Richard Kaplan  has told me throiugh e-mail that he considers occult blood tests in stool  specimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of  false positives(candida blooms guys?).  If my gut hurt me on a constant  basis, I would want it fixed.  Yes it's nice to know that I don't have  colon cancer but what then is causing my distress?  When I finally find a  doctor who treats me and gets me 90% better, Steve Dyer calls him a quack.  Candida prefers a slightly alkaline environment while bacteria  tend to prefer a slightly acidic environment.  The vagina becomes alkaline  during a woman's period and this is often when candida blooms in the vagina.  Vinegar and water douches are the best way of dealing with vaginal  problems.  Many women have also gotten relief from the introduction of  Lactobacillus directly into the vaginal tract(I would want to be sure of  the purity of the product before trying this).  My wife had this vagina  problem after going on birth control pills and searched for over a year  until she found a gynocologist who solved the problem rather than just writting  scripts for anti-fungal creams.  This was a woman gynocologist who had had  the same problem(recurring vaginal yeast infections).  This M.D. did some  digging and came up with an acetic acid and L. Acidophilis douche which she  used in your office to keep it sterile.  After three treatments, sex  returned to our marraige.  I have often wondered what an M.D. with chronic  GI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his  patients is a non-existent syndrome.  The nonpathogenic bacteria L. acidophilus is an acid producing bacteria  which is the most common bacteria found in the vaginal tract of healthy women.   If taken orally, it can also become a major bacteria in the gut.  Through  aresol sprays, it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes. But before this innoculation occurs, the mucus membrane barrier system  needs to be strengthened.  This is accomplished by vitamin A, vitamin C and  some of the B-complex vitamins.  Diet surveys repeatedly show that Americans  are not getting enough B6 and folate.  These are probably the segement of  the population that will have the greatest problem with this non-existent  disorder(candida blooms after antibiotic therapy).   Some of the above material was obtained from \\\"Natural Healing\\\" by Mark  Bricklin, Published by Rodale press, as well as notes from my human  nutrition course.  I will be posting a discussion of vitamin A  sometime in  the future, along with reference citings to point out the extremely  important role that vitamin A plays in the mucus membrane defense system in  the body and why vitamin A should be effective in dealing with candida  blooms.  Another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrate  intake during the treatment phase, this is especially important if the GI  system is involved.  If candida can not get glucose, it's not going to out  grow the bacteria and you then give bacteria, which can use amino acids and  fatty acids for energy, a chance to take over and keep the candida in check  once carbohydrate is returned to the gut.  If Steve and some of the other nay-sayers want to jump all over this post,  fine.  I jumped all over Steve in Sci. Med. Nutrition because he verbably  accosted a poster who was seeking advice about her doctor's use of vitamin  A and anti-fungals for a candida bloom in her gut.  People seeking advice  from newsnet should not be treated this way.  Those of us giving of our  time and knowledge can slug it out to our heart's content.  If you saved  your venom for me Steve and left the helpless posters who are timidly  seeking help alone, I wouldn't have a problem with your behavior.

But you've got my vote.   --I'm outta here like Vladimir --Alan\",\" On the cars mentioned - 3 series from the late 80's the \\\"electronic\\\" odometer is really a mechanical drum type odometer, that is driven by pulses from a speed sensor on the rear axle.  These pulses are  converted into mechanical pulses that turn the odometer - and speedometer. No way changing or erasing an eprom is going to change the mileage reading.  It also means the odometer is just as easy (or hard) to change as any other mechanical odometer.  On the other hand it is a bit easier to disconnect the speed sensor and run the car with no speedometer or odometer reading...a simple switch will do the job.  It also will disable the speed limiter, which will enable the car to reach it's full speed.  ;-)  \",\"  There were many injustices in the middle ages.  And this is truely sad. I would hate to see a day when churches put people to death or torchured them for practicing homosexuality, or any other crime.  The church is not called to take over the governments of the world.  It may be that homosexuals treated cruelly today, but that does not mean that we should teach  Christians to practice homosexual immorality.  Do you think that we should also teach Christians to practice divination and channelling because the witches in the middle ages were persecuted.    And you accuse me of judging?  When did you look into my heart and see if I have love.  I have been writing that we should not teach Christians to practice homosexual immorality, and you pretend to have divine knowledge to look into my heart.  I can't say that I love homosexuals as I should- I can't say that I love my neighbor as I should either.  I don't know very many homosexuals as it is.    But Jesus loves homosexuals, just as He loves everyone else.  If His love were conditional, I not know Him at all.  Yes.  We should show love to  homosexuals, but it is not love to encourage brothers in the church to  stumble and continue in their sin.  That is a very damaging and dangerous  thing.   That is slander.   I could just as easily say  that NAMBLA has been able to implement legislation to make child molesting easier because of the tearing down of societies morality due to people accepting homosexuality as normal, and that this is what you are embracing.  I do believe that homosexual sex is immoral, that does not mean I endorse using violence against them.  There is a problem of hatred in the church.  But there is also the problem of what has been called \\\"unsanctified mercy.\\\" Many in the conservative churches have seen the moral breakdown in  this country and the storm on the horizon, and have gotten militant in  the flesh.  This is truely sad.  Yet others in other churches have  embraced immorality in society, and have pointed to the carnality in the conservative churches to justify their actions.     Certainly we should not use a bullwhip to drive people from Jesus. But we shouldn't water down the gospel to draw people in.  Jesus didn't go out of His way to show only what might be considered positive aspects to draw people in.  He told one man to sell all He had.  He told another not to say good bye to His family.  His words were hard at times. We should present people with the cost of the tower before we allow them to begin construction.  many people have already been innoculated to the gospel.

If you are reading a copy of this FAQ which is more than a few   months old (see the \\\"Last-modified\\\" date above) you should probably   locate the latest edition, since the information may be outdated.    If you do not know how to get those newsgroups and/or your site does   not receive them and/or this article has already expired, you can   retrieve this FAQ from an archive site.    There exist several usenet FAQ archive sites.  To find out more about   them and how to access them, please see the \\\"Introduction to the   news.answers newsgroup\\\" posting in news.answers.

Lewis (faq%craft@uunet.uu.net) maintains the informative and   well written \\\"comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions\\\" document.   Its focus is on general X information, while this FAQ concentrates   on performance.    The comp.windows.x FAQ does address the issue of speed, but only with   regards to the X server.  The gist of that topic seems to be:  \\\"Use X11R5, it is faster than R4\\\".   (Please see the X FAQ for complete details).  --------------- Window Managers ---------------    There are a lot of window managers out there, with lots of different   features and abilities.  The choice of which to use is by necessity a   balancing act between performance and useful features.  At this   point, most respondents have agreed upon \\\"twm\\\" as the best candidate   for a speedy window manager.     A couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger,   is turning off unnecessary things like \\\"zooming\\\" and \\\"opaque move\\\".

Jeff Law   (law@schirf.cs.utah.edu) advises us that on a Sun system, X should be   compiled with gcc (version 2.*) or with the unbundled Sun compiler.   You can expect to get \\\"*very* large speedups in the server\\\" by not   using the bundled SunOS compiler.  I assume that similar results   would occur if you used one of the other high-quality commercial   compilers on the market.

This sounds crazy, but I have confirmed that it works!      Warner Losh (imp@Solbourne.COM) provided me with a good explanation of   why this works, which I have summarized here:      When you start up an X server it takes a huge amount of time to     start accepting connections.  A lot of initialization is done by     the server when it starts.  This process touches a large number of     pages.  Any other process running at the same time would fight the     server for use of the CPU, and more importantly, memory.  If you     put a sleep in there, you give the Server a chance to get itself     sorted out before the clients start up.      Similarly, there is also a lot of initialization whenever an X     client program starts: toolkits registering widgets, resources     being fetched, programs initializing state and \\\"databases\\\" and so     forth.  All this activity is typically memory intensive.  Once this     initialization is done (\\\"The process has reached a steady state\\\"),     the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages.     By using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your     .Xinitrc , you avoid them fighting each other for your     workstation's limited resources    This is most definitely a \\\"Your Mileage May Vary\\\" situation, as there   are so many variables to be considered: available RAM, local swap   space, load average, number of users on your system, which clients   you are starting, etc.    Currently in my .xinitrc I have a situation like:  (sleep 1; exec xclock ) &  (sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &  (sleep 1; exec xterm ) &  (sleep 1; exec xterm ) &    I've experimented with:  (sleep 1; exec xclock ) &  (sleep 2; exec xbiff ) &  (sleep 3; exec xterm ) &  (sleep 4; exec xterm ) &    I've even tried:  (sleep 2; exec start_X_clients_script ) &   and then in start_X_clients_script I had:  (sleep 1; exec xclock ) &  (sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &  (sleep 1; exec xterm ) &  (sleep 1; exec xterm ) &      [ The idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had     completely finished processing my .xinitrc, and had settled down     into a \\\"steady state\\\" before the sleep expired and all my clients     were launched. ]    All of these yielded fairly comparable results, and so I just stuck with   my current setup, for its simplicity.  You will probably have to   experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you.  Fonts - - -   Loading fonts takes time and RAM.  If you minimize the number of fonts   your applications use, you'll get speed increases in load-up time.    One simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts (one small, one   large, one roman, whatever suits you) and configure all your clients -- or   at least all your heavily used clients -- to use only those few fonts.   Client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded   into the server.  This will also conserve server resources, since fewer   fonts will be loaded by the server.          [ Farrell McKay (fbm@ptcburp.ptcbu.oz.au),            Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) ]    eg: My main xterm font is 7x13, so I also have twm set up to use 7x13   in all it's menus and icons etc.  Twm's default font is 8x13.  Since   I don't normally use 8x13, I've eliminated one font from my server.    Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com):     Keep fonts local to the workstation, rather than loading them over nfs.     If you will make extensive use of R5 scalable fonts, use a font server.  About the Resources File - - - - - - - - - - - - -      Keep your .Xresources / .Xdefaults file small.  Saves RAM and saves     on server startup time.          Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)    One suggestion:      In your .Xdefaults (.Xresources) file, try putting only the minimum     number of resources that you want to have available to all of your     applications.  For example:  *reverseVideo: true      Then, separate your resources into individual client-specific     resource files.  For example: $HOME/lib/app-defaults.  In your     .login file set the environment variable XUSERFILESEARCHPATH:   setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH $HOME/lib/app-defaults/%N      [ The \\\"comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions\\\" FAQ contains     an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work.     --ed.]      So, when xterm launches, it loads its resources from     .../app-defaults/XTerm.  Xdvi finds them in .../app-defaults/XDvi,     and so on and so forth.  Note that not all clients follow the same     XXxxx resource-file naming pattern.  You can check in your system     app-defaults directory (often: /usr/X11R5/lib/X11/app-defaults/) to     find the proper name, and then name your personal resource files     with the same name.      This is all documented in the Xt Specification (pg 125 & 666).       [Thanks to: Kevin Samborn (samborn@mtkgc.com),            Michael Urban (urban@cobra.jpl.nasa.gov),                and Mike Long (mikel@ee.cornell.edu).       Kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers.]    This method of organizing your personal resources has the following   benefits:      - Easier to maintain / more usable.      - Fewer resources are stored in the X server in the RESOURCE_MANAGER       property.  As a side benefit your server may start fractionally       quicker, since it doesn`t have to load all your resources.      - Applications only process their own resources, never have to sort        through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them.    It also has drawbacks:      - the application that you are interested in has to load an       additional file every time it starts up.  This doesn't seem to       make that much of a performance difference, and you might       consider this a huge boon to usability.  If you are modifying an       application's resource database, you just need to re-run the       application without having to \\\"xrdb\\\" again.      - xrdb will by default run your .Xdefaults file through cpp.  When       your resources are split out into multiple resource files and       then loaded by the individual client programs, they will not.       WATCH OUT FOR THIS!!        I had C style comments in my .Xdefaults file, which cpp stripped       out.  When I switched to this method of distributed resource       files I spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why       my clients were not finding their resources.  Xt did *NOT*       provide any error message when it encountered the C style       comments in the resource files, it simply, silently, aborted       processing the resource file.        The loss of preprocessing (which can be very handy, e.g. ``#ifdef       COLOR'' ...) is enough to cause some people to dismiss this       method of resource management.      - You may also run into some clients which break the rules.  For       example, neither Emacs (18.58.3) nor Xvt (1.0) will find their       resources if they are anywhere other than in .Xdefaults.      - when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files       with the machine where your resources are stored, your client       will not find its resources.  Loading all your resources into the       server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find       their resources.            Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov)    A possible compromise suggestion that I have (and am planning on trying)   is to put resources for all my heavily used clients (eg: xterm) into my   .Xdefaults file, and to use the \\\"separate resources files\\\" method for   clients that I seldom use.  Define Your Display Properly - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -    Client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server.  In   that situation, rather than setting your DISPLAY environment variable to    \\\"<hostname>:0.0\\\", where <hostname> is the name of your workstation, you   should set your DISPLAY variable to \\\"unix:0.0\\\" or \\\":0.0\\\".  By doing this   you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same   machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests.    [thanks to Patrick J Horgan (pjh70@ras.amdahl.com)]    See the _DISPLAY NAMES_ section of the X(1) man page for further   explanation of how to properly set your display name.    \\\"I don't think it's stock MIT, but (at least) Data General and HP have   libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when   the DISPLAY isn't set specially.\\\"          Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET)    [Jody Goldberg (jody@algorithmics.com) sent me an Xlib patch to change   stock R5 to use local communication even if DISPLAY is not properly set.   I don't want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle   non-MIT patches and so have elected not to include it here.  Hopefully MIT   will apply this minor (~8 lines) patch themselves.  In the meantime, if   you want to try it yourself, email Jody.  --ed.]  ------- Clients -------    If you only have a few megabytes of Ram then you should think   carefully about the number of programs you are running.  Think also   about the _kind_ of programs you are running.  For example:  Is there   a smaller clock program than xclock?    Unfortunately, I haven't really noticed that programs advertise how large   they are, so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word.    [ Suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients   (eg: Xclock, Xterm, Xbiff) are welcome.  --ed.]    I've received some contradictory advice from people, on the subject   of X client programs.  Some advocate the use of programs that are   strictly Xlib based, since Xt, Xaw and other toolkits are rather   large.  Others warn us that other applications which you are using   may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries.  In   this case, using a non-Xt (for example) client program may actually   _increase_ the amount of RAM consumed.    The upshot of all this seems to be: Don't mix toolkits.  That is, try   and use just Athena clients, or just Xview clients (or just Motif   clients, etc).  If you use more than one, then you're dragging in   more than one toolkit library.    Know your environment, and think carefully about which client   programs would work best together in that environment.

I suspect that   xterm is one of the most used clients at many, if not most sites.   Laziness?  Isn't there a better terminal emulator available?  See below.    If you must use xterm, you can try reducing the number of saveLines   to reduce memory usage.  [ Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com),      Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk) ]  1) Xvt    suggested by: Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) :    available: export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib/xvt-1.0.tar.Z     \\\"...if you don't need all the esoteric features of xterm, then get    hold of xvt ...  it was written here just to save swap space as    xterm is rather a hog! \\\"     This was written as a partial 'clone' of xterm.  You don't have to    rename your resources, as xvt pretends to be XTerm.  In it's current    version, you cannot bind keys as you can in xterm.  I've heard that    there are versions of xvt with this feature, but I've not found any    yet.     UPDATE (March 1993):  I recently had a few email conversations with    Brian Warkentin (brian.warkentine@eng.sun.com) regarding xvt.  He    questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm.  For    instance, xvt may initialize slightly faster, but compare scrolling    speed (try this quickie benchmark: /bin/time dd if=/etc/termcap    bs=40) and see which program can scroll faster.  Also, while xterm    may be slightly larger in RAM requirements (We don't have any hard    numbers here, does anyone else?) shared libraries and shared text    segments mean that xterm's paging requirements are not that major.     As an experiment, he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm, but it    made little difference, since if you never use it, it never gets    brought into memory.     So here we stand with some conflicting reports on the validity of    xvt over xterm.  In summary?  Caveat Emptor, your mileage may vary.    If you can provide some hard data, I'd like to see it.

From Scott Barman (scott@asd.com) comes a suggestion regarding Motif   Text Field Widgets:      I noticed that during data entry into Motif text field widgets, I     was getting a slight lag in response to some keystrokes,     particularly the initial one in the field.  Examining the what was     going on with xscope I found it.  It seems that when the resource     XmNblinkRate is non-zero and the focus is on a text field widget     (or even just a text widget) the I-beam cursor will blink.     Every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets, the     widget code is making a request to the server (CopyArea).  The user     can stop this by setting the resource XmNblinkRate to 0.  It is not     noticeable on a 40MHz SPARC, but it does make a little difference     on a [slower system].    This specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots   of areas.  Consider your heavily used clients, are there any minor   embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on Server   requests?  ------------------------- Miscellaneous Suggestions -------------------------  Pretty Pictures - - - - - - - -   Don't use large bitmaps (GIF's, etc) as root window backgrounds.    - The more complicated your root window bitmap, the slower the server     is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows (or redraw, etc)    - These take up RAM, and CPU power.  I work on a Sun SPARC and I'm     conscious of performance issues, I can't comprehend it when I see     people with a 4mb Sun 3/60 running xphoon as their root window.      I'll let someone else figure out how much RAM would be occupied by     having a full screen root image on a colour workstation.    - If you're anything like me, you need all the screen real estate     that you can get for clients, and so rarely see the root window anyway.          [ Thanks to Qiang Alex Zhao (azhao@cs.arizona.edu)     for reminding me of this one. --ed.]  A Quicker Mouse - - - - - - - -   Using xset, you can adjust how fast your pointer moves on the screen   when you move your mouse.  I use \\\"xset m 3 10\\\" in my .xinitrc file,   which lets me send my pointer across the screen with just a flick of   the wrist.  See the xset man page for further ideas and information.    Hint: sometimes you may want to *slow down* your mouse tracking for   fine work.  To cover my options, I have placed a number of different   mouse setting commands into a menu in my window manager.      e.g. (for twm) :       menu \\\"mouse settings\\\" {         \\\"Mouse Settings:\\\"   f.title  \\\"  Very Fast\\\"    ! \\\"xset m 7 10 &\\\"  \\\"  Normal (Fast)\\\"   ! \\\"xset m 3 10 &\\\"  \\\"  System Default (Un-Accelerated)\\\" ! \\\"xset m default &\\\"  \\\"  Glacial\\\"    ! \\\"xset m 0 10 &\\\"       }  Programming Thoughts - - - - - - - - - - -   Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :     To speed up applications that you're developing, there are tons of     things you can do.  Some that stick out:      - For Motif programs, don't set XmFontList resources for individual       buttons, labels, lists, et. al.; use the defaultFontList or       labelFontList or whatever resource of the highest-level manager       widget.  Again, stick to as few fonts as possible.      - Better yet, don't use Motif at all.  It's an absolute pig.      - Don't create and destroy widgets on the fly.  Try to reuse them.       (This will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits, too.)      - Use a line width of 0 in GCs.  On some servers this makes a HUGE       difference.      - Compress and collapse multiple Expose events.  This can make the       difference between a fast application and a completely unusable       one.    Francois Staes (frans@kiwi.uia.ac.be) :     Just a small remark: I once heard that using a better malloc     function would greatly increase performance of Xt based     applications since they use malloc heavily. They suggested trying     out the GNUY malloc, but I didn't find the time yet. I did some     tests on small programs just doing malloc and free, and the     differences were indeed very noticeable ( somewhat 5 times faster)    [ Any confirmation on this from anyone?  --ed.]    Andre' Beck (Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de) :    - Unnecessary NoExpose Events.      Most people use XCopyArea/XCopyPlane as fastest blit routines, but     they forget to reset graphics_exposures in the GC used for the     blits. This will cause a NoExpose Event every blit, that, in most     cases, only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to     run through it's event-loop again and again.    - Thousands of XChangeGC requests.      This \\\"Gfx Context Switching\\\" is also seen in most handcoded X-Apps,     where only one or few GCs are created and then heavily changed     again and again.  Xt uses a definitely better mechanism, by caching     and sharing a lot of GCs with all needed parameters. This will     remove the load of subsequent XChangeGC requests from the     connection (by moving it toward the client startup phase).  Say What!? - - - - - -    Some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first:    David B. Lewis (by day: dbl@osf.org, by night: david%craft@uunet.uu.net) :     How about this: swap displays with someone else. Run all your programs     on the other machine and display locally; the other user runs off your     machine onto the other display. Goal: reduce context switches in the     same operation between client and server.    I'm not in a situation where I can easily try this, but I have received   the following confirmation...    Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se):     I regularly run programs on other machines and I notice a big     difference. I try to run on a machine where I will reduce net usage     and usually with nice to reduce the impact of my intrusion. This     helps a lot on my poor little SS1+ with only 16 MB, it was     essential when I only had 8 MB.    Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov) :     [The X11 Server and the client are] competing for the same CPU as     your server when you run it on the same machine.  Not really a     major problem, except that the X11 client and the server are in     absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing.    Timothy H Panton (thp@westhawk.uucp) :     Firstly it relies on the fact that most CPU's are mostly idle, X's     cpu usage is bursty.  so the chances of you and your teammate     doing something cpu-intensive at the same time is small. If they     are not then you get twice the cpu+memory available for your     action.      The second factor is that context switches are expensive, using 2     cpu's halves them, you pay a price due to the overhead of going     over the network, but this is offset in most cases by the improved     buffering of a network (typically 20k vs 4k for a pipe), allowing     even fewer context switches.  ---------------------------- Other Sources of Information ----------------------------    Volume 8 in O'Reilly's X Window System Series, ``X Window System   Administrator's Guide'' is a book all X administrator's should read.

He works hard, for sure, but is no better than average on defense, and is prone to costly penalties and defensive lapses at times, while being basically an offensive zero (0 goal and 7 assists in 79 games).  He would be hardpressed to make the team next year.  #3 DAVID WILLIAMS  Season: 2nd Acquired: '91-92, free agent from New Jersey Grade:  C/C-  IMO, Williams was the most valuable defenseman for the Sharks in '91-92, playing a combination of good offense (3 goals and 25 assists in 56 games) and good defense.  But he, playing the first part of this season in Kansas City, was good neither offensively nor defensively this year; it, then, appears that '91-92 was a fluke.  Although he improved towards the end of the season, he was prone to being out of position defensively, and did not demonstrate the playmaking skills that made him the team's leading scorer among defensemen last year.  He would also be hardpressed to make the team next year.  #4 JAYSON MORE  Season: 2nd Acquired: '91-92, from Montreal in expansion draft Grade:  B+  After being touted as the team's top defensive prospects in training camp before '91-92, More had a rather disappointing '91-92, as he was not particularly good defensively, and had just 17 points in 46 games.  He, then, proceeded to improve his game massively this season, becoming the team's most reliable defenseman, whom the team can count on night in and night out to play steady defense and providing occasional (but only occasional) offensive flash. Offensively, he was even more disappointing than last year (11 points in 73 games), but his defense improved tremendously.  He is probably best as the defensive part of a defense combination with an offensive defenseman.  #5 NEIL WILKINSON  Season: 4th Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  B-  Wilkinson was probably the team's top defensive defenseman in '91-92.  However, partially because of injuries, he was not the same this year, as he missed 25 games total due to nagging knee and back injuries, and seemed to be slowed even when playing.  He, then, had often to be saved by his defensive partners; that is, if they are there at all.  But he also had some solid games, and if he can be complete healthy, he can still be a force.  #6 SANDIS OZOLINSH  Season: 1st Acquired: '91-92, 2nd round pick in entry draft Grade:  I (A)  At the time of his injury (December 30, against the Philadelphia Flyers), Ozolinsh was well on track to be, IMO, the team's MVP.  A serious knee injury in that game, though, forced him to miss the rest of the season (47 games), but he still finished as the team's top scorer among defensemen (23 points), which, of course, tells more about the lack of offense the Sharks had from their defensemen, but it also tells of Ozolinsh's abilities.  At the time, he was playing very good defense along with excellent offense; he was still susceptible to so-called \\\"rookie mistakes,\\\" but was probably the defenseman who made the least of them on the team, rookie or veteran.  If he can come back from his injuries, he is ready to be a star.  #19 DOUG ZMOLEK  Season: 1st Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  B  Zmolek had basically a solid and durable year, being one of the only two Sharks to play in all 84 games of the season.  He was solid on defense, but after being billed as an offensive defenseman, he didn't show it (15 points). He was also prone to penalties, and his 229 penalty minutes was second on the team; however, that was also an indication that he was fearly when facing tough physical opponents, and he was at his best when playing physically.  But to become a fixture in this league, he needs to improve both offensively and defensively, and cut down on the number of power-plays he gives to opponents.\",\" Doug> NNTP-Posting-Host: se05.wg2.waii.com   Doug> ..continuing on my build problems, I got stuck here build xterm...

Watch them in the offensive zone, especially on the powerplay.  Damphousse or Lebeau will skate all over the bloody zone, maybe pass to the point, get it back, skate some more, pass it around....BUT WHERE'S THE SHOT??! Answer: the shot is totally useless because they lack a forward who stands in front of the net a la` Neely, Shanahan, Tocchet, etc etc.  Too bad  Demers won't put Dipietro or LeClair on the powerplay more often.  Dammit, even Ewen would at least cause some disruptions.  Montreal desperately needs a power forward with some talent, IMO.  Then watch them in their own zone. Patrick Roy is screened on everything. Say what you want about his performance; IMNSHO he cannot stop what he cannot see.  And Montreal's defence does a miserable job of clearing the front of the net.  Last night against Washington Roy played a *great* game.  The first goal came on the most ridiculous goalmouth scramble I've seen in a long time, and he didn't have a hope in hell of stopping the shot.  The second goal came on a deflection of a shot he only partially saw anyway.  Pathetic defence.  The third goal was EN.

Sounds like it would have a *huge* drag area, not a lot of mass, and be in a fairly low orbit.   2) Just what orbital parameters are we talking about here? What real impact are we talking about, really?  How many optical astronomers are *really* going to be impacted?   3) Which is more important; adding a few extra days of 'seeing' for (very few) optical astronomers or getting the data the sensors are supposed to return along with the data for large inflatables (and the potential there for an inflatable space station)? The choice would seem to be one or the other, since the advertising is being used to help fund this thing.   4) If your answer to 3) above was \\\"the astronomers\\\", then feel free to come up with some other way to fund the (to my mind) more important research data that would be gained by this WITHOUT SPENDING ANY MORE OF MY MONEY TO DO IT.

This is possible because it's the same theory used by most color scanners.  I am not looking for the obv ious solution which is to buy a color scanner but what I do need is those equat ions becasue I am starting to write software which will automate the conversion  process.  I would really appreciate it if someone would repost the 3 equations /3 unknowns.

It's somewhat ironic that our exposure to bigotry happens in this instance to have originated in rec.scouting, since I always understood scouting to teach tolerance and diversity.  I understand bigotry to be irrational prejudice against other people who happen to be of a different race, religion, ethnic background, sex, or other inconsequential characteristics.  All the evidence I've seen indicates that sexual orientation and lack of belief in gods are exactly such inconsequential characteristics.  Thus, pending further evidence, I conclude that those who show prejudice against such people are bigots, and organizations that exclude such people are discriminatory.\",\" Hmmmmm you know this happened to me also.

There is no Yzerman-Fedorov-Probert line, except for maybe on a powerplay.  These three players usually play on three different lines. Which would mean that Toronto's checking line would have to pull a triple shift. The Wings' lines usually look like this:                         Gallant-Yzerman-Ciccarelli                         Kozlov-Fedorov-Drake                         Kennedy-Burr-Probert                         Ysebaert-Primeau-Sheppard   Oh by the way:  Start praying! : )\",\" And in other parts of the world, European \\\"Socialists\\\" would be known as fascist capitalist pigs.

That seriously underrepresents the harm he has done in the field.  Owen will cleanly play any ball he reaches.  He will have a fine fielding percentage, like always.  The problem is that he doesn't reach anything that isn't hit straight at him!  This wouldn't be quite as obvious a problem if he were playing next to Kelly Gruber or Robin Ventura.  But the third baseman for the Yankees is Wade Boggs (who should have moved across the diamond *last* year)!

Second, I disagree with the Pen's weak spot being defense and goaltending - for a couple of reasons.  Barrasso has had a spectacular year - no slow start, consistently sharp, GAA < 3.0, and  leads the league in wins.  Tommy deserves the Vezina.  Given the lack of  respect he commands, though, I doubt he will win it.  The other reason  concerns the Pens' team defense.  They are hovering around 3rd or 4th in the fewest goals allowed.  That is a big improvement for them, and it indicates that they are playing better team defense.   We'll see.  It'll be fun.\",\"------------------------------------------------------------------------- One reason that the WHA abandoned the blue puck was the fact that it crumbled very quickly during play.

When we die we are released from the arc of time, and able to comprehend our lives in toto.  To visit each moment in time sequentially or all at once, but not able to alter the actions thoughts or feelings we had/have/will have in this  life.  From that perspective, I posit that all will have direct knowledge of God, and be able to recognize at each moment of time wether we were doing what we ought.  That the experience of having lived a life far from God will be an eternal torment.  That  having lived a life of grace, will be an eternal joy.  That the  resurrection of the body comes not from any physical reconstitution of our present forms, but knowledge of our present forms by our fully cognizant souls.

Christian people have caused \\\"objective morality\\\" to look very \\\"relative.\\\"  After all, that was the point of the original question in this thread, i.e. can we toss out Christianity because it is so obviously inconsistent with its own principles?  If you will bear with me, I will attempt to explain this apparent inconsistency from at least one Christian's viewpoint:  If God exists and is the creator of mankind as the Bible claims, then He has a pretty well-defined concept of what makes people tick physically, emotionally, etc.  GOD has an \\\"objective\\\" morality for us. That is to say, He has no trouble understanding what is good for (or detrimental to) the creature He created.    Galatians 2:10-- For we [mankind] are His workmanship, created in  Christ Jesus for good works [a morality], which God prepared  beforehand [a well-defined design], that we might walk in them.  However, contrary to what many people assume (including the Pharasees of the Bible,) God's morality cannot be completely codified in a list of rules and regulations.  To some extent, every activity of a person's life creates a new situation to which morality must be applied.  There never could be enough volumes to codify God's \\\"objective\\\" morality for us.   Throughout history, mankind has tried to reduce morality to a list of rules (objectivity, if you please.)  In the Old Testament, we have both principles and specific rules.  By the time of Jesus, most of the principles were obscured by the emphasis men had placed on the rules. Volumes of additional rules had been made to try to codify the application of the principles.  We [mankind] weren't comfortable with the \\\"subjectivity\\\" of principles.    For reference see Matthew 5 where Jesus explains the difference  between the Law and the principles of the Law.  For example, in  verses 21-22:  \\\"You have heard that the ancients were told,  'You shall not commit murder'...and 'Whoever commits murder shall  be liable to the court.'  But I say to you that everyone who is  angry with his brother shall be liable to the court...\\\"  The \\\"objective morality\\\" of God gets blurred by our inept interpretation of it.  We [Christians] have made our biggest errors when we have allowed any one person or group of people decide EXACTLY what God intended for us.  If we [Christians] would stay committed to seeking God's will instead of trying to prove we already had it all figured out, we might do a better job of allowing others to find God's \\\"objective morality\\\" for themselves.

Matthew     Wiener (weemba@libra.wistar.upenn.edu) contributed the section on     Voyager, and the section on Sakigake was obtained from ISAS material     posted by Yoshiro Yamada (yamada@yscvax.ysc.go.jp).  US PLANETARY MISSIONS       MARINER (VENUS, MARS, & MERCURY FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)      MARINER 1, the first U.S. attempt to send a spacecraft to Venus, failed     minutes after launch in 1962. The guidance instructions from the ground     stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with its antenna, so the     onboard computer took control. However, there turned out to be a bug in     the guidance software, and the rocket promptly went off course, so the     Range Safety Officer destroyed it. Although the bug is sometimes claimed     to have been an incorrect FORTRAN DO statement, it was actually a     transcription error in which the bar (indicating smoothing) was omitted     from the expression \\\"R-dot-bar sub n\\\" (nth smoothed value of derivative     of radius). This error led the software to treat normal minor variations     of velocity as if they were serious, leading to incorrect compensation.      MARINER 2 became the first successful probe to flyby Venus in December     of 1962, and it returned information which confirmed that Venus is a     very hot (800 degrees Fahrenheit, now revised to 900 degrees F.) world     with a cloud-covered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide     (sulfuric acid was later confirmed in 1978).      MARINER 3, launched on November 5, 1964, was lost when its protective     shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary     space. Unable to collect the Sun's energy for power from its solar     panels, the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in     solar orbit. It was intended for a Mars flyby with MARINER 4.      MARINER 4, the sister probe to MARINER 3, did reach Mars in 1965 and     took the first close-up images of the Martian surface (22 in all) as it     flew by the planet. The probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere     much thinner than previously thought. Many scientists concluded from     this preliminary scan that Mars was a \\\"dead\\\" world in both the     geological and biological sense.      MARINER 5 was sent to Venus in 1967. It reconfirmed the data on that     planet collected five years earlier by MARINER 2, plus the information     that Venus' atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least 90 times     that of Earth's, or the equivalent of being 3,300 feet under the surface     of an ocean.      MARINER 6 and 7 were sent to Mars in 1969 and expanded upon the work     done by MARINER 4 four years earlier. However, they failed to take away     the concept of Mars as a \\\"dead\\\" planet, first made from the basic     measurements of MARINER 4.      MARINER 8 ended up in the Atlantic Ocean in 1971 when the rocket     launcher autopilot failed.      MARINER 9, the sister probe to MARINER 8, became the first craft to     orbit Mars in 1971. It returned information on the Red Planet that no     other probe had done before, revealing huge volcanoes on the Martian     surface, as well as giant canyon systems, and evidence that water once     flowed across the planet. The probe also took the first detailed closeup     images of Mars' two small moons, Phobos and Deimos.      MARINER 10 used Venus as a gravity assist to Mercury in 1974. The probe     did return the first close-up images of the Venusian atmosphere in     ultraviolet, revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover,     plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four     Earth days. MARINER 10 eventually made three flybys of Mercury from 1974     to 1975 before running out of attitude control gas. The probe revealed     Mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than     thought. This would seem to indicate that Mercury has an iron core which     makes up 75 percent of the entire planet.       PIONEER (MOON, SUN, VENUS, JUPITER, and SATURN FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)      PIONEER 1 through 3 failed to meet their main objective - to photograph     the Moon close-up - but they did reach far enough into space to provide     new information on the area between Earth and the Moon, including new     data on the Van Allen radiation belts circling Earth. All three craft     had failures with their rocket launchers. PIONEER 1 was launched on     October 11, 1958, PIONEER 2 on November 8, and PIONEER 3 on December 6.      PIONEER 4 was a Moon probe which missed the Moon and became the first     U.S. spacecraft to orbit the Sun in 1959. PIONEER 5 was originally     designed to flyby Venus, but the mission was scaled down and it instead     studied the interplanetary environment between Venus and Earth out to     36.2 million kilometers in 1960, a record until MARINER 2. PIONEER 6     through 9 were placed into solar orbit from 1965 to 1968: PIONEER 6, 7,     and 8 are still transmitting information at this time. PIONEER E (would     have been number 10) suffered a launch failure in 1969.      PIONEER 10 became the first spacecraft to flyby Jupiter in 1973. PIONEER     11 followed it in 1974, and then went on to become the first probe to     study Saturn in 1979. Both vehicles should continue to function through     1995 and are heading off into interstellar space, the first craft ever     to do so.      PIONEER Venus 1 (1978) (also known as PIONEER Venus Orbiter, or PIONEER     12) burned up in the Venusian atmosphere on October 8, 1992. PVO made     the first radar studies of the planet's surface via probe. PIONEER Venus     2 (also known as PIONEER 13) sent four small probes into the atmosphere     in December of 1978. The main spacecraft bus burned up high in the     atmosphere, while the four probes descended by parachute towards the     surface. Though none were expected to survive to the surface, the Day     probe did make it and transmitted for 67.5 minutes on the ground before     its batteries failed.       RANGER (LUNAR LANDER AND IMPACT MISSIONS)      RANGER 1 and 2 were test probes for the RANGER lunar impact series. They     were meant for high Earth orbit testing in 1961, but rocket problems     left them in useless low orbits which quickly decayed.      RANGER 3, launched on January 26, 1962, was intended to land an     instrument capsule on the surface of the Moon, but problems during the     launch caused the probe to miss the Moon and head into solar orbit.     RANGER 3 did try to take some images of the Moon as it flew by, but the     camera was unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt.      RANGER 4, launched April 23, 1962, had the same purpose as RANGER 3, but     suffered technical problems enroute and crashed on the lunar farside,     the first U.S. probe to reach the Moon, albeit without returning data.      RANGER 5, launched October 18, 1962 and similar to RANGER 3 and 4, lost     all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the Moon     and drifted off into solar orbit.      RANGER 6 through 9 had more modified lunar missions: They were to send     back live images of the lunar surface as they headed towards an impact     with the Moon. RANGER 6 failed this objective in 1964 when its cameras     did not operate. RANGER 7 through 9 performed well, becoming the first     U.S. lunar probes to return thousands of lunar images through 1965.       LUNAR ORBITER (LUNAR SURFACE PHOTOGRAPHY)      LUNAR ORBITER 1 through 5 were designed to orbit the Moon and image     various sites being studied as landing areas for the manned APOLLO     missions of 1969-1972. The probes also contributed greatly to our     understanding of lunar surface features, particularly the lunar farside.     All five probes of the series, launched from 1966 to 1967, were     essentially successful in their missions. They were the first U.S.     probes to orbit the Moon. All LOs were eventually crashed into the lunar     surface to avoid interference with the manned APOLLO missions.       SURVEYOR (LUNAR SOFT LANDERS)      The SURVEYOR series were designed primarily to see if an APOLLO lunar     module could land on the surface of the Moon without sinking into the     soil (before this time, it was feared by some that the Moon was covered     in great layers of dust, which would not support a heavy landing     vehicle). SURVEYOR was successful in proving that the lunar surface was     strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from 1966 to 1968.      Only SURVEYOR 2 and 4 were unsuccessful missions. The rest became the     first U.S. probes to soft land on the Moon, taking thousands of images     and scooping the soil for analysis. APOLLO 12 landed 600 feet from     SURVEYOR 3 in 1969 and returned parts of the craft to Earth. SURVEYOR 7,     the last of the series, was a purely scientific mission which explored     the Tycho crater region in 1968.       VIKING (MARS ORBITERS AND LANDERS)      VIKING 1 was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on August 20, 1975 on     a TITAN 3E-CENTAUR D1 rocket. The probe went into Martian orbit on June     19, 1976, and the lander set down on the western slopes of Chryse     Planitia on July 20, 1976. It soon began its programmed search for     Martian micro-organisms (there is still debate as to whether the probes     found life there or not), and sent back incredible color panoramas of     its surroundings. One thing scientists learned was that Mars' sky was     pinkish in color, not dark blue as they originally thought (the sky is     pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the     thin atmosphere). The lander set down among a field of red sand and     boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image.      The VIKING 1 orbiter kept functioning until August 7, 1980, when it ran     out of attitude-control propellant. The lander was switched into a     weather-reporting mode, where it had been hoped it would keep     functioning through 1994; but after November 13, 1982, an errant command     had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until     further orders. Communication was never regained again, despite the     engineers' efforts through May of 1983.      An interesting side note: VIKING 1's lander has been designated the     Thomas A. Mutch Memorial Station in honor of the late leader of the     lander imaging team. The National Air and Space Museum in Washington,     D.C. is entrusted with the safekeeping of the Mutch Station Plaque until     it can be attached to the lander by a manned expedition.      VIKING 2 was launched on September 9, 1975, and arrived in Martian orbit     on August 7, 1976. The lander touched down on September 3, 1976 in     Utopia Planitia. It accomplished essentially the same tasks as its     sister lander, with the exception that its seisometer worked, recording     one marsquake. The orbiter had a series of attitude-control gas leaks in     1978, which prompted it being shut down that July. The lander was shut     down on April 12, 1980.      The orbits of both VIKING orbiters should decay around 2025.       VOYAGER (OUTER PLANET FLYBYS)      VOYAGER 1 was launched September 5, 1977, and flew past Jupiter on March     5, 1979 and by Saturn on November 13, 1980. VOYAGER 2 was launched     August 20, 1977 (before VOYAGER 1), and flew by Jupiter on August 7,     1979, by Saturn on August 26, 1981, by Uranus on January 24, 1986, and     by Neptune on August 8, 1989. VOYAGER 2 took advantage of a rare     once-every-189-years alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to     outer planet. VOYAGER 1 could, in principle, have headed towards Pluto,     but JPL opted for the sure thing of a Titan close up.      Between the two probes, our knowledge of the 4 giant planets, their     satellites, and their rings has become immense. VOYAGER 1&2 discovered     that Jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics, lightning and     aurorae. Three new satellites were discovered. Two of the major     surprises were that Jupiter has rings and that Io has active sulfurous     volcanoes, with major effects on the Jovian magnetosphere.      When the two probes reached Saturn, they discovered over 1000 ringlets     and 7 satellites, including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep     the rings stable. The weather was tame compared with Jupiter: massive     jet streams with minimal variance (a 33-year great white spot/band cycle     is known). Titan's atmosphere was smoggy. Mimas' appearance was     startling: one massive impact crater gave it the Death Star appearance.     The big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings. Braids,     kinks, and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain.      VOYAGER 2, thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts,     continued the mission to Uranus and Neptune. Uranus itself was highly     monochromatic in appearance. One oddity was that its magnetic axis was     found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational     axis, giving Uranus a peculiar magnetosphere. Icy channels were found on     Ariel, and Miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains. 10     satellites and one more ring were discovered.      In contrast to Uranus, Neptune was found to have rather active weather,     including numerous cloud features. The ring arcs turned out to be bright     patches on one ring. Two other rings, and 6 other satellites, were     discovered. Neptune's magnetic axis was also skewed. Triton had a     canteloupe appearance and geysers. (What's liquid at 38K?)      The two VOYAGERs are expected to last for about two more decades. Their     on-target journeying gives negative evidence about possible planets     beyond Pluto. Their next major scientific discovery should be the     location of the heliopause.   SOVIET PLANETARY MISSIONS      Since there have been so many Soviet probes to the Moon, Venus, and     Mars, I will highlight only the primary missions:       SOVIET LUNAR PROBES      LUNA 1 - Lunar impact attempt in 1959, missed Moon and became first       craft in solar orbit.     LUNA 2 - First craft to impact on lunar surface in 1959.     LUNA 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1959.     ZOND 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1965 since LUNA 3. Was       also a test for future Mars missions.     LUNA 9 - First probe to soft land on the Moon in 1966, returned images       from surface.     LUNA 10 - First probe to orbit the Moon in 1966.     LUNA 13 - Second successful Soviet lunar soft landing mission in 1966.     ZOND 5 - First successful circumlunar craft. ZOND 6 through 8       accomplished similar missions through 1970. The probes were       unmanned tests of a manned orbiting SOYUZ-type lunar vehicle.     LUNA 16 - First probe to land on Moon and return samples of lunar soil        to Earth in 1970. LUNA 20 accomplished similar mission in        1972.     LUNA 17 - Delivered the first unmanned lunar rover to the Moon's        surface, LUNOKHOD 1, in 1970. A similar feat was accomplished        with LUNA 21/LUNOKHOD 2 in 1973.     LUNA 24 - Last Soviet lunar mission to date. Returned soil samples in        1976.       SOVIET VENUS PROBES      VENERA 1 - First acknowledged attempt at Venus mission. Transmissions         lost enroute in 1961.     VENERA 2 - Attempt to image Venus during flyby mission in tandem with         VENERA 3. Probe ceased transmitting just before encounter in         February of 1966. No images were returned.     VENERA 3 - Attempt to place a lander capsule on Venusian surface.         Transmissions ceased just before encounter and entire probe         became the first craft to impact on another planet in 1966.     VENERA 4 - First probe to successfully return data while descending         through Venusian atmosphere. Crushed by air pressure before         reaching surface in 1967. VENERA 5 and 6 mission profiles         similar in 1969.     VENERA 7 - First probe to return data from the surface of another planet         in 1970. VENERA 8 accomplished a more detailed mission in         1972.     VENERA 9 - Sent first image of Venusian surface in 1975. Was also the         first probe to orbit Venus. VENERA 10 accomplished similar         mission.     VENERA 13 - Returned first color images of Venusian surface in 1982.   VENERA 14 accomplished similar mission.     VENERA 15 - Accomplished radar mapping with VENERA 16 of sections of   planet's surface in 1983 more detailed than PVO.     VEGA 1 - Accomplished with VEGA 2 first balloon probes of Venusian       atmosphere in 1985, including two landers. Flyby buses went on       to become first spacecraft to study Comet Halley close-up in       March of 1986.       SOVIET MARS PROBES      MARS 1 - First acknowledged Mars probe in 1962. Transmissions ceased       enroute the following year.     ZOND 2 - First possible attempt to place a lander capsule on Martian       surface. Probe signals ceased enroute in 1965.     MARS 2 - First Soviet Mars probe to land - albeit crash - on Martian       surface. Orbiter section first Soviet probe to circle the Red       Planet in 1971.     MARS 3 - First successful soft landing on Martian surface, but lander       signals ceased after 90 seconds in 1971.     MARS 4 - Attempt at orbiting Mars in 1974, braking rockets failed to       fire, probe went on into solar orbit.     MARS 5 - First fully successful Soviet Mars mission, orbiting Mars in       1974. Returned images of Martian surface comparable to U.S.       probe MARINER 9.     MARS 6 - Landing attempt in 1974. Lander crashed into the surface.     MARS 7 - Lander missed Mars completely in 1974, went into a solar orbit       with its flyby bus.     PHOBOS 1 - First attempt to land probes on surface of Mars' largest         moon, Phobos. Probe failed enroute in 1988 due to         human/computer error.     PHOBOS 2 - Attempt to land probes on Martian moon Phobos. The probe did         enter Mars orbit in early 1989, but signals ceased one week         before scheduled Phobos landing.      While there has been talk of Soviet Jupiter, Saturn, and even     interstellar probes within the next thirty years, no major steps have     yet been taken with these projects. More intensive studies of the Moon,     Mars, Venus, and various comets have been planned for the 1990s, and a     Mercury mission to orbit and land probes on the tiny world has been     planned for 2003. How the many changes in the former Soviet Union (now     the Commonwealth of Independent States) will affect the future of their     space program remains to be seen.   JAPANESE PLANETARY MISSIONS      SAKIGAKE (MS-T5) was launched from the Kagoshima Space Center by ISAS on     January 8 1985, and approached Halley's Comet within about 7 million km     on March 11, 1986. The spacecraft is carrying three instru- ments to     measure interplanetary magnetic field/plasma waves/solar wind, all of     which work normally now, so ISAS made an Earth swingby by Sakigake on     January 8, 1992 into an orbit similar to the earth's. The closest     approach was at 23h08m47s (JST=UTC+9h) on January 8, 1992. The     geocentric distance was 88,997 km. This is the first planet-swingby for     a Japanese spacecraft.      During the approach, Sakigake observed the geotail. Some geotail     passages will be scheduled in some years hence. The second Earth-swingby     will be on June 14, 1993 (at 40 Re (Earth's radius)), and the third     October 28, 1994 (at 86 Re).       HITEN, a small lunar probe, was launched into Earth orbit on January 24,     1990. The spacecraft was then known as MUSES-A, but was renamed to Hiten     once in orbit. The 430 lb probe looped out from Earth and made its first     lunary flyby on March 19, where it dropped off its 26 lb midget     satellite, HAGOROMO. Japan at this point became the third nation to     orbit a satellite around the Moon, joining the Unites States and USSR.      The smaller spacecraft, Hagoromo, remained in orbit around the Moon. An     apparently broken transistor radio caused the Japanese space scientists     to lose track of it. Hagoromo's rocket motor fired on schedule on March     19, but the spacecraft's tracking transmitter failed immediately. The     rocket firing of Hagoromo was optically confirmed using the Schmidt     camera (105-cm, F3.1) at the Kiso Observatory in Japan.      Hiten made multiple lunar flybys at approximately monthly intervals and     performed aerobraking experiments using the Earth's atmosphere. Hiten     made a close approach to the moon at 22:33 JST (UTC+9h) on February 15,     1992 at the height of 423 km from the moon's surface (35.3N, 9.7E) and     fired its propulsion system for about ten minutes to put the craft into     lunar orbit. The following is the orbital calculation results after the     approach:   Apoapsis Altitude: about 49,400 km  Periapsis Altitude: about 9,600 km  Inclination : 34.7 deg (to ecliptic plane)  Period  : 4.7 days   PLANETARY MISSION REFERENCES      I also recommend reading the following works, categorized in three     groups: General overviews, specific books on particular space missions,     and periodical sources on space probes. This list is by no means     complete; it is primarily designed to give you places to start your     research through generally available works on the subject. If anyone can     add pertinent works to the list, it would be greatly appreciated.      Though naturally I recommend all the books listed below, I think it     would be best if you started out with the general overview books, in     order to give you a clear idea of the history of space exploration in     this area. I also recommend that you pick up some good, up-to-date     general works on astronomy and the Sol system, to give you some extra     background. Most of these books and periodicals can be found in any good     public and university library. Some of the more recently published works     can also be purchased in and/or ordered through any good mass- market     bookstore.      General Overviews (in alphabetical order by author):        J.

Other works and periodicals:      NASA has published very detailed and technical books on every space     probe mission it has launched. Good university libraries will carry     these books, and they are easily found simply by knowing which mission     you wish to read about. I recommend these works after you first study     some of the books listed above.      Some periodicals I recommend for reading on space probes are NATIONAL     GEOGRAPHIC, which has written articles on the PIONEER probes to Earth's     Moon Luna and the Jovian planets Jupiter and Saturn, the RANGER,     SURVEYOR, LUNAR ORBITER, and APOLLO missions to Luna, the MARINER     missions to Mercury, Venus, and Mars, the VIKING probes to Mars, and the     VOYAGER missions to Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.      More details on American, Soviet, European, and Japanese probe missions     can be found in SKY AND TELESCOPE, ASTRONOMY, SCIENCE, NATURE, and     SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN magazines. TIME, NEWSWEEK, and various major     newspapers can supply not only general information on certain missions,     but also show you what else was going on with Earth at the time events     were unfolding, if that is of interest to you. Space missions are     affected by numerous political, economic, and climatic factors, as you     probably know.      Depending on just how far your interest in space probes will go, you     might also wish to join The Planetary Society, one of the largest space     groups in the world dedicated to planetary exploration. Their     periodical, THE PLANETARY REPORT, details the latest space probe     missions. Write to The Planetary Society, 65 North Catalina Avenue,     Pasadena, California 91106 USA.      Good luck with your studies in this area of space exploration. I     personally find planetary missions to be one of the more exciting areas     in this field, and the benefits human society has and will receive from     it are incredible, with many yet to be realized.

Is anybody getting throughput anywhere close to the platter->controller rate?  I haven't seen anything even close to the 5MB/sec limit of the IDE interface.

Nowhere do I see anything like \\\"after the bits are whipped of the platter at high speed they sit around in a buffer to thaw before they are sent to the host\\\" (even though I SWEAR that's whats happening ;->).  Here are some relevent quotes from the manual:    \\\"Data is transferred from the disk to the read buffer at a rate of    3.75 MB/s maximum, 1.87MB/s minimum.\\\"  (My calculations show 3121KB/sec    maximum and 1578KB/sec minimum...  disk spins at 4306 RPM with 87    sectors per track on the outside and 44 on the inside)    \\\"Single burst errors of up to 24 bits within one sector can be corrected    'on-the-fly', in real time as they occur, allowing a high degree of    data integrity with no impact to the drive's performance.\\\"  (I take    this to mean error correction isn't the bottleneck)    \\\"For page-mode operations, the data-transfer rate to and from the buffer    RAM is up to 10.0 MB/s. This high transfer rate allows the AT Interface    IC to communicate over the AT bus at a data-transfer rate of 5.0 MB/s,    while the DCS simultaneously controls disk-to-RAM transfers\\\"                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ So the thing can even do it's cache pre-fetch WHILE it's sending the requested sector (it has 3 64KB read buffers for pre-fetching, I guess you could call that a cache :-|).  So when I do a sequential read on the outer tracks, WHY am I getting a measly 862KB/sec when I should be getting around 3MB/sec???

I would suggest you look at some greek and roman historians.  I think you will be disapointed.\",\" I'll tell you my story as an example of what *not* to do.  Early in 1984 I took some riding lessons from my college roommate on his old Honda CB360T.  He had taken the MSF beginner's course, so I actually learned *some* of what I needed to know to ride.  I proceeded to buy a beat-up Honda CL350 for $400 and a $12 helmet and rode around wearing this and a cotton windbreaker.  Then I decided to invest in a full-face helmet (first smart move).  Sometime around then I also passed my road test.  On May 4, 1984, I got caught in a rainstorm on my way home from a 4-mile trip.  Entering the town where I lived (a rather urban suburb), I had to stop suddenly for a red light that I noticed too late, skidded the rear tire out, and was ejected face upward into the oncoming lane of traffic.  Fortunately for me the oncoming traffic was also stopped for the same red light, otherwise I might have slid under a car and been killed.  Now this is anecdotal evidence, to be sure, but I later took the Experienced Rider Course from the MSF and saw that earlier training could have helped me greatly.  In your case the need is even greater since you have nobody to help you practice even the most basic stuff as I did.  So my advice is to take the MSF beginner's course first thing.  I wouldn't even buy a bike until you've taken the course, unless you happen to pick up a real good deal and can store it someplace until you're ready to use it.   While you're waiting to take the course (it might take a few weeks in DC, as I recall there were always waiting lists in Boston), could you save up some more money to start out right?  Say $300 for riding gear, plus the cost bike, plus maybe $100 (guess) to a mechanic to make sure the machine is safe (assuming you economize by buying some old beat-up machine from a private individual), plus insurance, plus registration and licensing fees, plus the course, you're looking at maybe $600 not including the bike itself and a reserve for ongoing maintenance.   I pay about $100 insurance now (upstate NY) but it was closer to $200 in Boston (more urban) for decent insurance including substantial coverage for liability, which you want unless you plan always to be poor.  I'd guess DC is more like Boston than like a rural area, ergo more expensive.   There used to be annual buyer's guides in the usual motorcycle magazines; I found those helpful in getting an idea of what new or recent models might be available.  You could probably look through past issues to size up what used bikes might be available.  (My first bike was 13 years old when I bought it so I went on my friend's advice instead.)  Also look at the bikes that you see people riding or that are parked on the street.  I basically settled on my present bike by noticing that there were a lot of high-mileage BMW's running around and they were generally set up the way I wanted.  Nothing wrong with talking to various dealers in your area or visiting showrooms.  Dealers in the Boston area, at least when I was shopping, were very nice about letting you look around their showrooms and quoting prices for bikes that weren't the latest models (hence cheaper), although I ended up buying both bikes in private sales.\",\"Hi, can anyone direct me to map type gifs?

One might find oneself, as I did in late 1986, anticipating expenses in the near term that require selling off holdings.  Given the choice between waiting a few weeks (and taking an extra tax hit) or selling in December with preferential tax treatment, only a fool would choose the former.  2) The fact that Brett can now construct _post hoc_ calculations of what would have been more beneficial to investors is in many respects beside the point.  There was plenty of _Money_-style advice given to unsophisticated investors in late 1986 to \\\"sell now and save on taxes.\\\"  In case anyone missed it, there was no shortage of similar advice late last year (in the NYTimes, e.g.), even though that advice was based not on the foregone conclusion of enacted law (as in 1986), but merely on the *assumption* that Clinton would raise tax rates (without capping CG taxes, contrary to the current proposal).  It's nice to think that investors always behave in their optimal economic interest.  Like assuming weightless ropes and frictionless pulleys, though, this sort of thinking often fails to describe accurately what happens in the real world.  \",\"I was looking at the amps diagram for Sony 1090/2090 receivers, and I was amazed to find a difference between the US and Canadian model on the capacitor(s) that hangs off the output to the speakers:                           ------\\\\/\\\\/\\\\----- to speaker (identical both models from amp ---------------| (idnetical both models) >                         <  10                          >                         |                        -----                                               |     |                                 0.022        ---   ---        Canadian model only!

However, I think that some people (such as myself) would benefit from answers to the simple(?) question:  Which would YOU choose, and why?  Like lots of people, I'd really like to increase my data transfer rate from the hard drive.  Right now I have a 15ms 210Mb IDE drive (Seagate 1239A), and what I would say is a standard (not special, no cache I believe) IDE controller card on my ISA 486-50.  I'm currently thinking about adding another HD, in the 300Mb to 500Mb range. And I'm thinking hard (you should hear those gears a-grinding in my head) about buying a SCSI drive (SCSI for the future benefit).  I believe I'm getting something like 890Kb/sec transfer right now (according to NU).  How would this number compare if I bought the state-of-the-art SCSI card for my ISA PC, and the state-of-the-art SCSI hard drive (the wailing-est system I could hope for)?  Obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other, but what would YOU want to use on your ISA system? And how much would it cost?  Along those lines, what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HD's if I were to buy the top-of-the-line IDE caching controller for my 200Mb, 15ms HD? And how much would it cost?  I actually have a PAS-16, and could (what a waste I guess it would be...) hook up a SCSI HD through it's SCSI port which yields an optimum of 690Kb/sec. Actually, I have a borrowed 12ms Fujitsu HD hooked up through it now (and own the Trantor HD drivers for the PAS-16 SCSI port).  Is this SCSI port a SCSI-2 port?  How could I tell?  Is the Fujitsu 2623A a SCSI-2?  Are all SCSI HD's SCSI-2?  Thanks for any comments.\",\"Benedikt Rosenau writes, with great authority:   \\\"Contradictory\\\" is a property of language.

It's no accident that the first two names are 1988 only.  As with first and second base, 1988 was the year of the glove.  Average DA was 20 points higher in both leagues than any other year.  Looks good.  Too bad he's moving to short.  Highest five-year regular, though he's only had one year as good as Kevin Mitchell :->.  The other elite fielders in the league.  This is an interesting line.  His 1988 figure was slightly below average. His 1990 was pathetic, and his 1991 was the next best year by anybody.  Part of that may be his mobility.  1988 was with the Yankees.  1990 was with the Padres, who appear to have a rotten infield.  1991 was with the Twins, and judging by Leius and Gaetti, the Metrodome may be a good place to play third.  Add another to the elite fielders list.  Too fielders whose career average may overstate their value.  I don't know what happened to Caminiti -- judging by the three previous years, his low 1992 may be a fluke.  Sabo is merely average, however.  His incredible 1988 (best year ever) brings his average up a lot.  Strange last two years.  According to reputation, one of the best fielders ever at third base. But at the end, he was below average.  (Average in 1988 was .643).  Boggs has been pretty good.  I don't know what happened in 1990, but every other year he has been above average, usually by quite a bit.  Last year -- a fluke or a portent?  Why is it that the two leagues usually have defensive averages very close to one another, but very different from year to year?  Any ideas?  Brook  is declining.  Three first-time regulars, above average in 1992.  I'm not sure why Jefferies gets all the grief about his fielding.  He's never had a good year, but while at second he improved to become an average fielder, and is an average fielder at third.  Zeile, on the other hand, is a below average fielder.  Each year he's about 10 points below average.  And it's probably not just the park, since Terry Pendleton had excellent DAs in the three years before this.  Moving back to second was a good idea.  So why is Hayes supposed to be good defensively?  He's had a grand total of one year above the league DA, and was pretty bad last year.  Howard Johnson and Carney Lansford -- separated at birth.  To his credit, HoJo did have one above average year (1990).  Lansford couldn't even break the .600 mark without the help of the year of the glove.  Good hitter, but his fielding needs work.  Not a good fielder.  Both are better off at shortstop.  Two consecutive horrible years for Leo.  Camden Yards doesn't seem to have helped his fielding any.    Texas slugger debuts with not only the lowest career DA, but the lowest DA at third ever.  Congratulations, Dean. --  Dale J.

So I decided to check it out, on my own.  But, then, that was in BN times (Before Net).  So, here are some  references.  See Robin Lane Fox's _The unauthorized version_, (p.284) where  Lane Fox writes, \\\"... the one passage which appears to [comment on Jesus'  career] is agreed to be a Christian addition.\\\"  In my Re:Albert Sabin response (C5u7sJ.391@sunfish.usd.edu) to Jim Lippard (21 April 93), I noted that consensus is typically indicated subtly as in Elaine  Pagel's _The gnostic gospels_ (p.85), to wit:  \\\"A comment *attributed* to Josephus reports ... [emphasis mine]\\\".  Scholars sometimes do not even mention the two Josephus entries, another subtlety reflecting consensus.  So far as I can deduce, today's consensus is built on at least three things:  1) the long passage is way out of context, 2) Origen did not know about the long passage, and 3) the short and long passages are contradictory.  I don't know the references wherein the arguments which led to consensus are orginally developed (does anyone?).  Biblical scholars as I defined them include theologians and historians.  The former, like the latter, incorporate historical, social, technological and ideological contexts as well as theology.  So the distinction is blurred.  I  didn't elaborate on that.  Sorry.  (In turn, historians are compelled to incorporate theology).  Can't say about the number of copies.  These were, however, BG times (Before  Gutenburg).  A hundred first editions seems exceedingly high; counting on one  hand seems more reasonable.  Perhaps those mss. without the long insert (if any, because anything is possible) have been destroyed.

Until Syria leaves, and free elections take place, its is rediculous to claim that the Lebanese would even be involved in determining what happens to their country.

He used a strange technique I'd never seen before.  He took a big pot with lid, and placed a tray in it made from aluminum foil. The tray was about the size and shape of a typical coffee-table ash tray, made by crumpling a sheet of foil around the edges.  In the tray, he placed a couple spoonfuls of brown sugar, a similar quantity of brown rice (he said any rice will do), the contents of two teabags of Earl Grey tea, and a few cloves.  On top of this was placed an ordinary aluminum basket-type steamer, with two chicken breasts in it.  The lid was put on, and the whole assembly went on the stovetop at high heat for 10 or 12 minutes.  Later, he removed what looked like smoked chicken breasts.  What surprises and concerns me are:  1)  No wood chips.  Where does the smoke flavor come from?  2)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember hearing that carmel color     (obtained by caramelizing sugar -- a common coloring and flavoring     agent) had been found to be carcinogenic.  I believe they injected     it under the skin of rats, or something.  If the results were conclusive,     caramel color would not be legal in the U.S., yet it is still being     used.  Was the initial research result found to be incorrect, or what?  3)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember Earl Grey tea being implicated     as carcinogenic, because it contains oil of bergamot (an extract     from the skin of a type of citrus fruit).  Does anyone know whatever     happened with that story?  If it were carcinogenic, Earl Grey tea     could not have it as an additive, yet it apparently continues to do     so.  WRT natural wood smoke (I've smoking a duck right now, as it happens), I've noticed that a heavily-smoked food item will have an unpleasant tangy taste when eaten directly out of the smoker if the smoke has only recently stopped flowing.  I find the best taste to be had by using dry wood chips, getting lots of smoke right up at the beginning of the cooking process, then slowly barbequing for hours and hours without adding additional wood chips.  My theory is that the unpleasant tangy molecules are low-molecular weight stuff, like terpenes, and that the smoky flavor molecules are some sort of larger molecule more similar to tar.  The long barbeque time after the initial intensive smoke drives off the low-molecular weight stuff, just leaving the flavor behind.  Does anyone know if my theory is correct?  I also remember hearing that the combustion products of fat dripping on the charcoal and burning are carcinogenic.  For that reason, and because it covers the product with soot and some unpleasant tanginess, I only grill non-drippy meats like prawns directly over hot coals.  I do stuff like this duck by indirect heat.  I have a long rectangular Weber, and I put the coals at one end and the meat at the other end.  The fat drops directly on the floor below the meat, and next time I use the barbeque I make the fire in that end to burn off the fat and help ignite the coals.  And yet another reason I've heard not to smoke or barbeque meat is that smoked cured meat, like pork sausage and bacon, contains nitrosamines, which are carcinogenic.  I'm pretty sure this claim actually has some standing, don't know about the others.\",\"  Make sure to take the Sutcliff, Fisk, ect. factor into account. \",\" Depending on how you plan to use your SUV, I might recommend also browsing Trailer Boats and one or more of those Pickup, Shotgun, and 4WD magazines.

I don't happen to have my SAE manual handy, but oil viscosity in general _decreases_ with temperature.  The SAE numbers are based on a `typical' curve that oils used to all have, running from (say) the viscosity of a room-temperature 90-weight at 0C, down to (say) that of a room-temperature  5-weight at 20C, for a typical 40-weight oil.  Oils that are designed for operation in `normal' temperatures just have a weight specification.  Oils that are designed for operation in exceedingly cold temperatures have a `W' tacked on the end, so in winter in a cold place, you'd stick 10W in your car in the winter and 40 in it in the summer, to approximate the appropriate viscosity throughout the year.  Modern multi-viscosity oils change viscosity much less with temperature. As a result, their viscosity graphs cross over several curves.  A multi-vis specification pegs the curve at two temperatures, a `normal' operating temperature and a `cold' one (though I can't remember the numbers...).  In any event, the weights do indicate a significant difference.  Remember that your engine is temperature-regulated (by the thermostat and radiator or air fins) most of the time -- unless you overheat it or something.  Any weight of oil is better than no oil, or than very old, carbonized oil.

That's because truth may be absolute, but it may not be obvious.  Like so many things, the truth is always subject to misinterpretation.  I strongly suspect that we are reaching an impasse here, which is why I deign from commenting much further.   Now hold it.  I never said that Christians cannot be arrogant.  Indeed, as many other Christians on SRC have stressed before, this is a trap that Christians must always be wary about.  However, this does not mean that if you believe in the absolutes established by the Bible, you are necessarily being arrogant.  A Christian can believe that the Word of God is absolute, but he or she should not expect this to be immediately evident to everyone.    Not quite.  You say that according to my stance, we cannot *reliably* determine what is true.  That is not what I said.  I say that as fallible human beings, we cannot discern the truth with 100% certainty.  The  distinction is subtle yet important.  When a scientist performs an experiment, he can claim that his results are reliable, without claiming that absolutely no mistake whatsoever could have been made.  In other words, he can admit that he could be mistaken, without sacrificing his convictions.  Nobody can establish what absolute truth is with 100% certainty. Throughout the centuries, philosophers have argued about what we can know with complete certainty and what we cannot.  Descartes made a step in the right direction when he uttered, \\\"Cogito, ergo sum,\\\" yet we have not advanced much beyond that.  Do you believe that other people aside from you exist?  Do you believe that the computer terminal you are using exists?  If so, can you be absolutely certain about that?  Are you sure it is not some grand illusion?  Of course, you have no such assurance.  This does not mean, however, that for all practical purposes, you can be certain that they exist.  So it is with Christianity.  The most mature Christians I know have deep convictions about absolute morality, yet they acknowledge that there is a non-zero probability  that they are wrong.  This does not, however, mean that they should (or do)  abandon these absolutes.   As I said, we can never be absolutely certain that we are correct.  This does not mean that we cannot be certain enough, in light of the evidence, to  render all doubts unreasonable. \",\" Hismanal (astemizole) is most definitely linked to weight gain.

The crucial thing is not to sit around just having fantasies; they aren't of any use unless they make you do some experiments.  I've known a lot of scientists whose fantasies lead them on to creative work; usually they won't admit out loud what the fantasy was, prior to the consumption of a few beers.  (Simple example: Warren Jelinek noticed an extremely heavy band on a DNA electrophoresis gel of human ALU fragments.  He got very excited, hoping that he'd seen some essential part of the control mechanism for eukaryotic genes.  This fantasy led him to sequence samples of the band and carry out binding assays.  The result was a well-conserved, 400 or so bp, sequence that occurs about 500,000 times in the human genome.  Unfortunately for Warren's fantasy, it turns out to be a transposon that is present in so many copies because it replicates itself and copies itself back into the genome.  On the other hand, the characteristics of transposons were much elucidated; the necessity of a cellular reverse transcriptase was recognized; and the standard method of recognizing human DNA was created. Other species have different sets of transposons.  Fortunately for me, Warren and I used to eat dinner at T.G.I. Fridays all the time.)   I'm not sure that it's random.  But there is no known rational mechanism for generating a rich set of interesting hypotheses.  If you are really working in an unknown area, it is unlikely that you will have much sense of what might or might not be true; under those circumstances, the best thing to do is just follow whatever instincts you have.  If they are wrong, you will find out soon enough; but at least, you will find out _something_. If you try to do experiments at random, with no prior conceptions at all in mind, you will probably get nowhere.   Unfortunately, the critical function does sometimes become hostage to non-rational forces.  Then we get varieties of pathological science: Lysenko, Mirsky's opposition to DNA-as-gene, cold fusion, and so forth.   I don't agree that this follows.  In fact, this is _exactly_ the point at which I disagree with Feyerabend.  It is a most important part of the culture of science that one keeps one's jealousies out of the refereeing process.  Failures there are aplenty, but, on the whole, things work out.  Another point: there are a couple of senses of the phrase ``experimental design''.  I'd say that the less rational part is in experimental _choice_, not design.  Alexander Fleming (Proc. Royal Soc., 1922) chose to look for bacteriophage in his own mucus for strange reasons (Phage had previously been found in locust diarrhea; Fleming probably thought runny bottom, runny nose, what the hell, it's worth a try.) but his method of looking for phage was well-designed to detect anything phage-like; in fact, he found lysozyme.   It is not clear to me what you mean by rational vs. irrational.  Perhaps you can give a few examples of surprising experiments that were tried out for perfectly rational reasons, or interesting new theories that were first advanced from logical grounds.  The main examples I can think of are from modern high-energy physics which is not typical of science as a whole.\",\": > : >ATLANTIC DIVISION : >  : > ST JOHN'S MAPLE LEAFS VS MONCTON HAWKS : > MONCTON HAWKS : >See CD Islanders.

The story is this: I bought a car out of state, and I'm trying to get the safety inspection in Pennsylvania. The problem is that the car has  aftermarket tint on all windows except the windshield. The tint is rather weak, and you can clearly see the inside of the car through the tint.  The inspection garage said that they won't pass it unless I get a waiver from the state police. So I went to the state police - the officer told me that aftermarket tint is illegal, and I can get a waiver only for a pre-84 car or for a medical reason. I asked him to show me the section of the vehicle code that says it's illegal.  He showed it to me and the paraghaph said that you can't have tint, if you can't see the inside of the car because of the tint. When I told him that you can in fact see the inside very well, he shut the book and said \\\"It's just illegal, and in fact we can have someone give you a ticket for it right now.\\\" Well, won't argue with that...  Since the vehicle code says it's OK as long as you can see through the tint, I'd like to keep it (I'll re-read the vehicle code in the library).  I'd also like to get some sort of paper from the police that says it's OK, so I can get the inspection, and so that I won't get in trouble for the tint later on. I also wouldn't mind registering a complaint against that officer - he really pissed me off.  So does anyone have any experience getting that sort of a paper from the police, especially in Pennsylvania? Does anyone have any experience registering a complaint against an officer? I called the station  later on today, but they basically said there is no place where I could register a complaint against an officer... And if I do decide to keep the tint and get a ticket anyway, how much of a chance do I stand to succesfully appeal the ticket in court?  Any comments about it will be welcome!\",\"Hi.

All of the vendors I have called say that the internal video will not work on a true VGA monitor but will work on a IBM Compatible multisync like the sony's or the NEC monitors.  I thought the VGA capability of LCIII was very attractive because it allowed you to use inexpensive VGA monitors.  Am I confused or are these vendors just not up to speed?  Has anyone used an LCIII with a non multisync VGA monitor and if so where did you get your adapter (please be specific w/ vendor and cat #)?

But the ancient Romans did not observe a seven-day week.  Unless a man was working for a Jewish employer, he is unlikely to have been paid on the first day of a seven-day week.

I came to a crisis point, then it finally clicked and now I am a staunch atheist.   This is a very loose explanation, but it's the gist of it.  Now, (at 26) I feel better about myself, better self-esteem, a generally  stronger person. I have well-defined goals. I have a strong and stable sense  of morals and values. I am not a neo-nazi or a corrupt politicain, etc. I  believe in human rights and 'live and let live' among other things. I am very  anti-violent and anti-hatred. (This is to debunk the myth that atheists are depraved.) Religion has no place in my system. Tough.  Bertrand Russell said that we cannot *know* god doesn't exist, we can't prove  it. So, in that sense, we can only truly be agnostic.

Sure, it's been cold, the food lines were long, and the hired hands were surly, but this was all part of the Giants mystique. Or so I thought.  I went to Tuesday's game (3 - 1 Giants over the Marlins) and the 'Stick was  a much different place. Nothing short of a dome will eliminate the wind, but  everything is a lot better. The lines are a lot shorter, the bathrooms are CLEAN and have running water, and the hired hands were very polite.   The new foghorn (lights up and blows after each homerun) and the wooden fence are very nice, as are the new bleachers. The bleachers start right at the top of the fence and give a great view, and they've got beer stands at the bottome of the bleachers. The only complaint is that the electronic  old-fashioned scoreboard looks electronic - could be better.  These things should have been done a long time ago, but it took a real  businessman (ex - Safeway President Peter Magowan) to figure it out.

Perhaps you should examine in yourself why as such a good friend, you  are unwilling to accept this imortant part of your friends life?  Why  do you call into question his faith?  Your friend has changed, he has  found something that fills a need in his life.  You need to decide if  you are still his friend, whether you can accommodate his new life.   It sounds as if you are criticizing him for a fundamental belief in  the Bible, yet you are quick to reveal that your fundamental belief  that it is superstition.  Perhaps if he knew you at least took him  seriously, that you at least took an interest in the light he has found,  that you at least tried to understand what has become a special part of  his life, you could together decide to become fundamentalists, respect  each others differences and remain friends, or part ways.  Maybe even if  you stuck it out with him, you could help him to un-convert.  Of course,  if you go in with that attitude he will surely see through your intentions  and begin to resent you.  I happen to be a person very tolerant of fundamentalists, because I know that the idea of a simple black and white approach to life is appealing. I don't happen to share the beliefs of fundamentalists, but I am not offended by their prosyletizing.  I had a few good conversations with some Witnesses who came to my door.  I didn't switch my beliefs, but for those at home who maybe need a friendly face to invite them somewhere, the Witnesses provide a wonderful service.  You may have been conditioned to believe that religion is unimportant and witnessing is obnoxious, but why?  Are you afraid you might be converted and become one of them, that you will be swept up in fundamentalism, that you will become a weirdo. Friendship's a two-way street.

The messiah comes to build the kingdom of heaven on the earth.  He also comes to first reveal the root cause of original sin (fallen nature) and then provide a means to cut the connection to that original sin.  He also wants to create world peace based on Godism.  The messiah's teachings will build on the foundation of the Bible but provide profound new insights into the nature of God, the fall of man, the purpose of creation, and God's providence of restoration.  It will also provide a foundation for the unity of all the World's religions.  Many Christians expect Jesus to come on literal clouds, so they may miss him when he returns. Just as the Jewish people missed Jesus 2000 years ago.  They are still waiting for his first coming.  The Jewish people of that age expected Elijah to come first.  Jesus said that John the Baptist was Elijah. But John the Baptist denied that he was Elijah.  (How did this reflect on Jesus?)  Later in prison John even questioned who Jesus was: \\\"is he the one who is to come or do we look for another\\\". (see book of Matthew)   David Koresh didn't even come close.  The problem is that people like this make it difficult for people to believe and trust in the real Messiah when he does show up.   Very good point and perhaps the most important point of all for Christians: How to recognize the Second Coming?  The Messiah should not claim to be God.  What sets a Messiah apart is that he is born without original sin.  He is not born perfect but achieves perfection after a period of growth.  Adam and Eve were born sinless but they fell, and this tragedy meant that it would take God thousands of years to create the kingdom of heaven on the earth as God originally intended.  God's restoration providence is still not complete.  The messiah is the true Son of God, one with God, God's representative on the earth, but not God himself.  There is only one God.  ...    Who else in this world is claiming to be the Messiah.

Of course, I said \\\"No problem\\\" and went to work. Unfortunately, the DRDOS refuses to recognize the hard drive during  installation, even though I am still able to boot off of the hard drive using the old DOS.  After openning it up I discovered it was using an 8-bit  Seagate SCSI controller on a ST-157N SCSI 40Mbtye drive.  I then booted  with DRDOS 6.0 off of the floppy a second time and ran fdisk to see if  I could access the drive.  Lo and behold the primary 46.5 Mbyte partition  was intact (created by DOS 3.1 no less, I didn't think you could go over a 32Mbyte partition in the older DOSes. I could be wrong...).  I then tried  to remove the primary partition, which it wouldn't allow me to do.  I am  unaware of anything special that has to be done with a SCSI drive (I  kinda expected it to work just like an IDE/MFM/RLL drive for DOS  installations).

Could you please tell me what was the ethnic composition of  Israel right after it was formed.     No one in his right mind would sell his freedom and dignity. Palestinians are no exception. Perhaps you heard about anti-trust in the business world.  Since we are debating the legality of a commercial transaction, we must use the laws governing the guidelines and ethics of such transactions. Basic ANTI-TRUST law says that, while you can purchase IBM stocks for the purpose of investing, you can not acquire a large number of those shares with the intent or controlling IBM. You can do so only if you make your intentions CLEAR apriori . Clearly, the Jews who purchased properties from palastenians had some designs, they were not buying a dwelling or a real estate. They were establishing a bridgehead for the European Jews.  The palastenians sold their properties to the Jews in the old tradition of arab hospitality. Being a multi-ethnic / multi-religious society, accepting the jews as neighbours was no different, just another religion. Plus they paid fair market value, etc... They did not know they were victims of an international conspiracy. (I'm not a conspiracy theorist myself, but this one is hard to dismiss).     Again Adam, the devil is in the details. I don't want to get on a tangent here but its the same reasonning that says its OK to return 100 deportes and leave the rest. Because 100 is a nice number that you can devide by 10, 100 and besides, it has an integer square root.    Do you actually believe this? My experience tells me that every palestinian I knew still keeps the key to his home, in Palestine. Besides they often refer to their exodus as an escape from hell (so to speak). I know none that agrees with you. Did you sample their opinions? I know you don't care, just being rethorical.     Don't get me wrong. I beleive that Israel is democratic within the constraints of one dominant ethnic group (Jews). Israel probably had a few options after 1948: ethnic cleansing Serbian style, and deserve the wrath of the international community, or make the best out of a no win condition: show the world how good Israel is towards the 'bad' arabs. Personaly, I've never heard anything about the arab community in Isreal. Except that they're there.  So yes, they're there. But as a community with history and roots, its dead.       I stand corrected. I meant that the jewish culture was not predominant in Palestine in recent history. I have no problem with Jerusalem having a jewish character if it were predominantly Jewish.

Is an interpretation of the words of Paul of higher priority than the direct word of Jesus in Matt5:14-19?

Paul closes Romans 14 with, \\\"On the other hand, the person with doubts about something who eats it anyway is guilty, because he isn't acting on his faith, and any failure to act on faith is a sin.\\\" Gaus, ISBN:0-933999-99-2 Have you read the Ten Commandments which are a portion of the Law? Have you read Jesus' word in Matt5:14-19? Is there any doubt in your mind about what is right and what is sin (Greek hamartia = missing the mark)?   Whereas, the Ten Commandments and Jesus' words in Matt5:14-19 are fairly clear, are they not?   Matt5:14-19 doesn't answer your question?   Breaking bread - roughly synonymous with eating.   How do you unite this concept of yours with the Ten Commandments and Jesus's word in Matt5:14-19?   Or, they assumed that the Ten Commandments and Jesus' word in Matt5:14-19 actually stood for something? Perhaps they were \\\"strong in the faith?\\\"  ---------------------------  [No, I don't believe that Paul can overrule God.  However Paul was writing for a largely Gentile audience.  The Law was regarded by Jews at the time (and now) as binding on Jews, but not on Gentiles.  There are rules that were binding on all human beings (the so-called Noachic laws), but they are quite minimal.  The issue that the Church had to face after Jesus' death was what to do about Gentiles who wanted to follow Christ.  The decision not to impose the Law on them didn't say that the Law was abolished.  It simply acknowledged that fact that it didn't apply to Gentiles.  Thus there is no contradiction with Mat 5. As far as I can tell, both Paul and other Jewish Christians did continue to participate in Jewish worship on the Sabbath.  Thus they continued to obey the Law.  The issue was (and is) with Gentile Christians, who are not covered by the Law (or at least not by the ceremonial aspects of it).  Jesus dealt mostly with Jews.  I think we can reasonably assume that Mat 5 was directed to a Jewish audience.  He did interact with Gentiles a few times (e.g. the centurion whose slave was healed and a couple of others).  The terms used to describe the centurion (see Luke 7) suggest that he was a \\\"God-fearer\\\", i.e. a Gentile who followed God, but had not adopted the whole Jewish Law.  He was commended by Jewish elders as a worthy person, and Jesus accepted him as such. This seems to me to indicate that Jesus accepted the prevailing view that Gentiles need not accept the Law.  However there's more involved if you want to compare Jesus and Paul on the Law.  In order to get a full picture of the role of the Law, we have to come to grips with Paul's apparent rejection of the Law, and how that relates to Jesus' commendation of the Law.  At least as I read Paul, he says that the Law serves a purpose that has been in a certain sense superceded.  Again, this issue isn't one of the abolition of the Law.  In the middle of his discussion, Paul notes that he might be understood this way, and assures us that that's not what he intends to say.  Rather, he sees the Law as primarily being present to convict people of their sinfulness.  But ultimately it's an impossible standard, and one that has been superceded by Christ. Paul's comments are not the world's clearest here, and not everyone agrees with my reading.  But the interesting thing to notice is that even this radical position does not entail an abolition of the Law. It still remains as an uncompromising standard, from which not an iota or dot may be removed.  For its purpose of convicting of sin, it's important that it not be relaxed.  However for Christians, it's not the end -- ultimately we live in faith, not Law.  While the theoretical categories they use are rather different, in the end I think Jesus and Paul come to a rather similar conclusion.  The quoted passage from Mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest of the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus shows us how he interprets the Law.  The \\\"not an iota or dot\\\" would suggest a rather literal reading, but in fact that's not Jesus' approach.  Jesus' interpretations emphasize the intent of the Law, and stay away from the ceremonial details.  Indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude towards the Sabbath and kosher laws.  Some scholars claim that Mat 5:17-20 needs to be taken in the context of 1st Cent. Jewish discussions.  Jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a tenth of even the most minor herbs, but neglecting the things that really matter: justice, mercy and faith, and caring about how cups and plates are cleaned, but not about the fact that inside the people who use them are full of extortion and rapacity.  (Mat 23:23-25) This, and the discussion later in Mat 5, suggest that Jesus has a very specific view of the Law in mind, and that when he talks about maintaining the Law in its full strength, he is thinking of these aspects of it. Paul's conclusion is similar.  While he talks about the Law being superceded, all of the specific examples he gives involve the \\\"ceremonial law\\\", such as circumcision and the Sabbath.  He is quite concerned about maintaining moral standards.  The net result of this is that when Paul talks about the Law being superceded, and Jesus talks about the Law being maintained, I believe they are talking about different aspects of the Law.  Paul is embroiled in arguments about circumcision.  As is natural in letters responding to specific situations, he's looking at the aspect of the Law that is currently causing trouble: the Law as specifically Jewish ceremonies.  He certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards of conduct.  On the other hand, when Jesus commends the Law, he seems to be talking the Law in its broadest implications for morals and human relationships, and deemphasizing those aspects that were later to give Paul so much trouble.  It's unfortunate that people use the same terms in different ways, but we should be familiar with that from current conflicts.  Look at the way terms like \\\"family values\\\" take on special meaning from the current context.  Imagine some poor historian of the future trying to figure out why \\\"family values\\\" should be used as a code word for opposition to homosexuality in one specific period in the U.S.  I think Law had taken on a similar role in the arguments Paul was involved in.  Paul was clearly not rejecting all of the Jewish values that go along with the term \\\"Law\\\", any more than people who concerned about the \\\"family values\\\" movement are really opposed to family values.\",\"From: payne@crl.dec.com (Andrew Payne) Message-ID: <1993Apr20.004418.11548@crl.dec.com> Organization: DEC Cambridge Research Lab Date: Tue, 20 Apr 1993 00:44:18 GMT   Does anyone know if a source for the TCM3105 modem chips (as used in the Baycom and my PMP modems)?

Again from my Mac & IBM info sheet {available by FTP on sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6) in the info-mac/report as mac-ibm-compare173.txt}: Expansion Both Mac & IBM SCSI: only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM.  Allows the use of any device: hard drive, printer, scanner, Nubus card   expansion {Mac Plus only}, some monitors, and CD-ROM.  Apple developed some   specifications for SCSI controlers while IBM has no exact controller   specifications {which results in added incompatibilities on IBM machines}.    Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal   terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port   {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and at the   end.  Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}.  SCSI-1:  7 devices per SCSI controller.  8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}  and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfer base.  16-bit SCSI-1 requires a  SCSI-2 controler chip and can provide only fast SCSI-2 not wide SCSI-2  which are both 16-bit interfaces {see SCSI-2}. SCSI-2: 10 devices per SCSI controller in SCSI-2 mode.  SCSI-2 is fully  SCSI-1 complient and tends to be implimented as a very fast SCSI-1 since it   needs a different controller interface in both hardware {which tends to be   very expendsive} and software.  Transfer speeds are 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst   {8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst  {32-bit/wide and fast}.  SCSI-2 in SCSI-1 mode is limited to 7 devices and  reduced 8-bit or 16-bit {fast only} throughput due to the difference between  SCSI-1 and wide SCSI-2 ports.  IBM HD Interfaces {limited to hard drives by design or lack of development}: [...] IDE:  Integrated Device Electronics   currently the most common standard, and is mainly used for medium sized   drives. Can have more than one hard drive. Asynchronous Transfer: ~5MB/s max.  So at its LOWEST setting SCSI-2 interface in Asynchronous SCSI-1 mode AVERAGES  the through put MAXIMUM of IDE in asynchronous mode.  In full SCSI-2 mode it blows poor IDE out the window, down the street, and into the garbage can. The problem becomes can the drive mechanisim keep up with those through put rates and THAT is where the bottleneck and cost of SCSI-2 comes from.  NOT the interface itself but more and more from drive mechanisims to use the SCSI-2 through put.  The cost of SCSI interface is a self fulliling prophisy: few people buy SCSI because it is so expencive for the PC, which in turn convices makes that mass producing SCSI {which would reduce its cost} is unwarented, and so SCSI is expencive. {That is the effect of the Rule of Scale: the more items sold the less EACH item has to bare the brunt the cost of manufacture and so the less each item has to cost}\",\"  May I suggest the book: \\\"Ethics\\\" by Dr. Norm Geisler, of Dallas Theological Seminary.

Petzold's 3.1 book says that it is best to use the module instance handle of the calling program, not the module instance handle of the DLL (page 934).  I have two questions:  1)  Is there a way to find out the module instance handle of a module?  2)  What are the possible problems with using the instance handle of     the DLL?

I'd wear the full facer, but then, I'd be *way* more worried about wind blast in the face, and inability to hear police sirens, than the helmet being a little damaged.    Well, my next helmet will be, subject to it fitting well, an AGV sukhoi. That's just because I like the looks. My current one is a Shoei task5, and it's getting a little old, and I crashed in it once a couple of years ago (no hard impact to head...My hip took care of that.). If price was a consideration I'd get a Kiwi k21, I hear they are both good and cheap.   Be *mildly* mildly paranoid about the helmet, but don't get carried away. There are people on the net (like those 2% you mentioned) that do not consistently live on our planet...  Regards, Charles DoD0.001 RZ350\",\"From my rather rusty knowledge of radio, most radio receivers use a superhet  circuit, so that the incoming signal is mixed with a local oscillator, giving  a fixed intermediate frequency (IF) that is more easily amplified. The detector detectors work by picking up IF re-radiated from your radar  detector. In Britain, where one has/used to pay for a TV licence, there  are/were TV detector vans prowling the streets, looking for people who hadn't  paid their licence fee. They had a couple of long solenoid antennae on the roof, and I believe could triangulate an operating TV from the IF.   I wonder how much of the IF is radiated back from the detector antenna, and  how much from the rest of the module. It might be worth putting the detector  in a proper RF shielded enclosure. \",\"  Preliminary data regarding similar research into kangaroo overpopulation in Australia do not in any way support the cost-effectiveness of this approach.  It _may_ be cost-effective for deer--if you quietly overlook the fact that the net cost to the state of deer hunting is _negative_ (i.e. a profit) because the (majority of) hunters pay for licences. The cost comparisons are probably being done assuming that people have to be employed to cull the animals, which is not in fact the case. You figure people are going to pay for licences to implant contraceptive pellets or spread baits?  There has been a fair bit of discussion about this here recently, because the kangaroo population in the grounds of the Governor- General's residence has now reached plague proportions.  Despite the whines of the rampant animal-libbers, the most effective method of controlling the population is still considered to be controlled shooting.   Some people take satisfaction (IMHO, legitimate satisfaction) in eating food that they have harvested themselves.  The pleasure derived from hunting is the same as that you get from eating fruit and vegetables grown in your own garden (and, in general, game meat is probably much  freer of unpleasant chemicals than what you buy from the butcher or the supermarket).   By \\\"cannot now be justified\\\" I guess you mean that you personally don't see any justification.  Fine--but what makes your opinion so important?   Certainly the last point is correct.  If politicians don't see any votes for themselves in opposing stupid legislation or in developing and supporting measures which might be effective in reducing the  incidence of violent crime they
