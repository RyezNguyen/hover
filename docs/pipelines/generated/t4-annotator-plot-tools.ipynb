Advice from a grad student.   I agree with the gentlemen who wrote the comment before me. The important thing is pick what ever interest you the most and  learn as much as possible about it.     In my five years of education in this field, though brief  compare to alot of people, I had to think about this kind of  question a lot.  Did I make the right decision in going into Electrical Engineering as opposed to Computer engineering or CS?  The more I go thru school, the more I believe that this kind of question is irrelevant.      I have come to believe that choosing CS because one  does not like hardware or choosing hardware because one does not like to program is really doing an injustice of building and computer and making it useful for something.  Everything is interwoven and inseparable.  CS, CE, and EE are all a  part of a really great discipline and do depend on each other.   My advice is don't limit yourself, but make a decision based on which major will give you the best opportunities to  learn.  That of course depends on the curriculum at your  persective school.  I would choose a major that allows me to explore as much as possible.  Beside, I don't know why the school would make a student choose a major before her/his sophamore year.                     Hey you may be so interested in this field that you  decided to learn all about the making of computers in which  case, you suffer a little more and go to grad school.   About the money.  Don't look at the averages, if you are good, you are going to earn more money than anyone else.  If you are a superstar programmer, you will earn millions.

EDT                  Q   Why was the 10:00 a.m. postponed?                  MS. MYERS:  Just due to scheduling conflicts.  So as we  put out, the President will meet with the leaders of the national  police organizations at 2:00 p.m. in the Rose Garden, as opposed to  10:00 a.m.  The only other things on his schedule today are:  At  11:00 a.m. he'll meet with General Vessey, who, as you know, is on  his way to Vietnam to continue working on the MIA-POW issue.  At  12:30 p.m. he'll have lunch with the Vice President in the Oval  Office.  And at 2:00 p.m. he'll meet with the police organizations. Then from 3:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. he'll do his weekly photos with the  various groups.              Q   A photo op with Vessey?              MS. MYERS:  There's no coverage on the Vessey meeting.              Q   Why?              MS. MYERS:  Why?  It's a closed meeting.                Q   What about the lunch?              MS. MYERS:  The lunch?  No, there's no coverage.              Q   Is he meeting with any congress people today?              MS. MYERS:  Nothing scheduled.              Q   There are no meetings --              MS. MYERS:  There are no congressional meetings today,  no.              Q   Has the President been given any information by the  Pentagon or reached any conclusion about the validity of this report  from Hanoi?  Any instructions to Vessey on how to deal with the  Vietnamese on that subject?              MS. MYERS:  Well, clearly, the report is the first order  of business.  It's high on the agenda on something that they'll  discuss.  I think the President and General Vessey will discuss the  parameters of his visit to Vietnam today, but the President hasn't  drawn any conclusions about the report yet.  Certainly, it's  something that he wants General Vessey to talk with the Vietnamese  about first.              Q   Did the President talk with any Republican senators  yesterday about the stimulus package?              MS. MYERS:  He spoke with Senator Dole.              Q   How many times?              MS. MYERS:  I believe once during the day and once last  night.              Q   What was the outcome of that?              MS. MYERS:  They're continuing to work toward some kind  of an agreement on a jobs package.              Q   Is it your impression that Senator Dole is in any  way flexible on this?              MS. MYERS:  Well, I think we're hopeful that we're going  to get some kind of jobs package through the Senate, and we'll  continue to work with Senator Dole and others until we reach some  kind of an agreement.              Q   Did they discuss the VAT tax?              MS. MYERS:  I don't know if that came up.              Q   Can you check that?              MS. MYERS:  Sure.        Q   So what are they -- is the President offering to  scale down his program -- is that what he's trying to do, buy it down  to where Dole will sign on?              MS. MYERS:  Well, he's trying to protect as much of it  as he can.  But it's important to him to get some kind of a jobs  package through the Senate and through Congress now.  And as soon as  we reach some conclusions on that, we'll let you know.  But at the  moment, he's continuing to consult with members of Congress  including, obviously, Senator Dole.              Q   Is he talking to anybody else?              MS. MYERS:  I don't believe he talked to any other  Republicans yesterday.              Q   Is he talking to anybody today?              MS. MYERS:  I don't think anything is scheduled, but I  wouldn't rule it out.              Q   We were led to believe that the President called  Mr. Dole on the subject of Russian aid and that Bob Dole brought the  conversation around to stimulus package.  Is that correct?              MS. MYERS:  I think the President has contacted several  people on Russian aid.  I think that it was always expected that the  stimulus package or the jobs package will be part of any conversation  he would have with Senator Dole.  The primary objective of the  conversation was Russian aid.  That was the first order of business,  but it was both.              Q   In the President's mind, are they linked  politically in that if the Republicans continue to reject the  stimulus package, he thinks it will be harder to sell Russian aid to  the American people?  Has he made that argument?              MS. MYERS:  I can't talk about specifically what  arguments he might have made.  The President is obviously committed  to both.  He liked to see a jobs package to the American people  first.  But as you know, we outlined the details of additional  Russian aid last night in Tokyo.              Q   But does the President believe that the stimulus  package will make it more difficult to persuade Americans to vote for  Russian -- to accept a vote for Russian aid?              MS. MYERS:  I think that the President is going to  continue to work to pass the stimulus package, to pass a jobs  package, and we're still hopeful that we'll get some kind of jobs  package through the Congress.              Q   Is it fair to say that the President is negotiating  now with Dole?              MS. MYERS:  He's discussing options with him.              Q   On the stimulus, is it your understanding that over  the break some Democrats, themselves, have left the support that they  had earlier for the package, the stimulus package?              MS. MYERS:  I think we still have wide support in the  Senate for the jobs package.              Q   But specifically, that you've lost Democrats other  than Shelby?              MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so.  There hasn't been a  vote.              Q   What about Kohl?              Q   Kohl and Feingold?              MS. MYERS:  There hasn't been a vote yet.  And we'll  continue to work with senators to try to get a majority to try to  bring the package to a vote, because we believe that a majority of  the members of the United States Senate support the package.              Q   If you're weren't worried about Kohl and Feingold,  why did George mention Milwaukee projects the other day?              MS. MYERS:  I think George pointed out a number of  projects in a number of states that stand to be funded, or to lose  funding if this jobs package doesn't pass.              Q   No Democrats.  (Laughter.)              MS. MYERS:  I'll let you draw your own conclusions.              Q   Does he plan to talk to Dole again today or any  other Republicans again today?              MS. MYERS:  There's nothing specifically scheduled, but  again, I wouldn't rule it out.              Q   Does he plan to put out any more press releases to  any other states today?              MS. MYERS:  What we've done is we're in the process of  breaking down the benefits of the jobs package state by state.  I  think it's entirely feasible that as we sort of are able to sum those  up, we'll send out press releases to the various states that suggest  how their states would benefit from this package.              Q   Will you share those with us?              MS. MYERS:  Sure.  As we did yesterday.              Q   Do you have copies of the ones you sent --              MS. MYERS:  Yes, we made those available yesterday.  And  we certainly can continue to provide them today.              Q   Dee Dee, since yesterday's questions and subsequent  stories about the VAT, what further consideration of this issue has  been given?              MS. MYERS:  Nothing's changed since yesterday.  I think  the President commented on it this morning to say only that it was  something he knew was being considered by the task force and that he  has not made a decision on, and I don't think we have anything to add  to that.              Q   But he also said that business and labor groups are  telling him they support it.  Can you tell us --              MS. MYERS:  I think that there has been -- I'm not going  to speculate on who supports it.  I think the President said that  there has been some support among business and labor groups.  I don't  think he said he was directly contacted by them.              Q   Are we to take that to mean that the administration  has sounded out business and labor groups on this --              MS. MYERS:  I think there's been plenty of public  discourse on this over the years and even recently, but I don't think  I want to add to that.              Q   In February, though, the President said that this  was something to be considered 10 or 15 years down the road.  What  has happened between then and now to cause this administration to  change its mind?              MS. MYERS:  I think as we said yesterday, it is  something that the working groups are looking at.  They're  considering a wide variety of options on everything from funding to  specific options that will be covered by the President's health care  plan.  The President has not taken it up yet, has not made a decision  on it.  And beyond that, I don't have anything to add.              Q   You haven't answered the question.  It wasn't being  considered by anyone in the White House after the President's  comments in February, and George reaffirmed that in a briefing.              Q   And then suddenly --              Q   What happened?        MS. MYERS:  The working groups, as we have said  throughout, we instructed to consider a wide variety of options  across-the-board.  And one of the things that has been talked about  and that they are clearly considering is some kind of a value-added  tax.        Q   But the President himself took this off the table,  Dee Dee, and suddenly it reappears.  And this goes to the credibility  of this administration in a way.  What has happened in the meantime?        MS. MYERS:  The President has not looked at this, it  hasn't been presented to him, again, yet.  The working groups are  looking at it, as they're looking at a wide variety of options, and  no decisions have been made.        Q   And it raises the question of how independently the  task force is working.        MS. MYERS:  The task force was instructed to consider  all options, and they've taken that mandate seriously and they're  considering all options.        Q   But that's not the impression that the President  left in February.  The impression he left was that this was something  that was long-range, to be looked at 10, 15 years down the road.  The  clear implication of his remarks was that this was something that was  not on the table, not an option.         Q   \\\"If it changes I'll tell you.\\\"              Q   Bring him on.        Q   And you repeatedly referred to the President's  remarks, telling us that those were still in operation.              MS. MYERS:  It's changed, and we told you.  (Laughter.)              Q   But that's what Alice Rivlin's comments and Donna  Shalala comments were about.  I mean, that seemed like an  orchestrated effort because you have two independent Cabinet officers  --        MS. MYERS:  I wouldn't -- no, Alice Rivlin's not a  Cabinet member, first of all.  Second of all, it was not  orchestrated, but clearly, they both said yesterday and in the last  couple of days that it's something that's being looked at.  We  confirmed that yesterday.  And I don't have anything to add to that.        Q   Is it because he has very few options?        Q   Is this something that it will be incumbent upon  the task force to convince the President about?  In other words, has  the President himself personally ruled it out and it's now up to the  task force to convince him to put it back on the table?  Or is it, in  fact, back on the table, having been placed there by discussions with  the President?          MS. MYERS:  It is not the working group's mission at  this point to convince the President of anything.  It is their  mission to put before him his options and to explain the benefits and  the costs and the basic pros and cons of each of those options.  I  think that they will certainly present the VAT to him in that  context, and at this point he's not -- that presentation has not been  made, but it's something that he will hear and he has not made a  decision on.        Q   They will present it to him as one of his options,  though he specifically ruled it out?        MS. MYERS:  Correct.        Q   Dee Dee, is this more than a trial balloon?  Is  this a serious consideration that the working groups are giving to  this form of taxation?        MS. MYERS:  It's simply a statement of fact.  The  working groups are considering a wide variety of options on a number  of issues relating to health care reform.  One of the options that  they're looking at is the VAT.         Q   Dee Dee, when the working groups were examining  this possibility, was this on the table during the same time period  that you were telling us that it was not?        MS. MYERS:  I don't know what the specific timing of  their drafting of options is.  I don't know.        Q   Who was telling you that it was not under  consideration?        MS. MYERS:  I was referring back to the President's  comments.        Q   Have they discovered that the sin taxes won't raise  enough money to fund the core benefit package?        MS. MYERS:  No, there's no decisions that have been made  on how to pay for the health care plan.              Q   I'm asking whether the projections --              MS. MYERS:  There's a number of options depending on how  the plan is structured.  You can't decide how much the plan is going  to cost until you decide what the plan is going to look like.  And so  you can't discuss what financing options have been ruled in our out  until you know.        Q   Dee Dee, we've been told that they have a computer  models on a number of possible packages.        MS. MYERS:  Correct.          Q   The question is whether they have now determined  whether sin taxes would not produce enough money for even the barest  minimum package.  That is not a very difficult computation.        MS. MYERS:  It is a question that you know that we're  not going to answer until -- there's a number of options being  considered.  It depends on how the package is structured.  The exact  details of the package and the financing mechanisms used to pay for  them are all among the decisions that have yet to be made.                Q   And when the President has been meeting with health  care -- his health care advisors, which we are told he has been doing  --              MS. MYERS:  Correct.              Q      they have never once said to him, these are your  funding options, including the VAT?  He has never heard the word VAT  in his --              MS. MYERS:    I am not going to comment on the specific  nature of the daily -- they're not daily, but the quasi-regular  briefings.              Q   Well, you have.              MS. MYERS:  I have not, other than to say that he's not  considered the VAT.  And I think that is a true statement.              Q   No, but you said that it has not been presented to  him as an option.              MS. MYERS:  Correct.              Q   That doesn't mean he hasn't heard about it.              MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to get into the details of  what's discussed.  I think that statement stands for itself.              Q      specific, Dee Dee.  When you say he hasn't  looked at it, do you mean that he hasn't looked at it in terms of  paying for medical coverage, or hasn't looked at it in general?   Because back in Chilicothe he was very specific in defining how it  works, what the advantages are, the whole thing.  It sounds like --              MS. MYERS:  But that was -- I think in Chilicothe, if  you go back to his remarks there, it was a broader philosophical  discussion of the tax structure.  And I think the comments were  generally in reference to the overall economic plan.  But clearly,  it's something that he's thought about in the broad context.  I mean,  that was clear in Chilicothe.  What I'm saying is that in the process  of the working groups it's something that he hasn't considered yet.   It's something that the working groups will present to him among the  number of options, and that no decisions have been made.  And I'm not  going to comment any further on the details of the meetings where  health care issues are being discussed.              Q   It's your statement from this podium that no  discussion of this has taken place.  You say that no option -- that  the option has not been presented to him.              MS. MYERS:  That is correct.              Q   Do you stand by -- does the White House still stand  by George's statement in March that this will not be in the proposal?              MS. MYERS:  No decisions have been made.  We have  nothing to add to what's already been said.              Q   Let me follow up here.  Do you stand by what Rivlin  said yesterday, that if any kind of VAT were to be used or  considered, that other changes to the tax code would have to be made  so that it would be less regressive?              MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to comment any further on what  might happen if.              Q   But do you stand by the previous conversations in  February that if there were to be a VAT, I think the President said  you'd exclude food and energy --              MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to comment on the specific  structure of a decision that hasn't been made.              Q   Was the President aware prior to Donna Shalala's  comments yesterday that this was under consideration by the working  groups?              MS. MYERS:  I don't know specifically what --              Q   Could you check for us, because that's a real  important credibility question?              MS. MYERS:  Sure.              Q   Since the task force was brought together this  issue has been discussed, at the beginning and throughout, as one  fairly painless way to raise a lot of money.  Were you all kept in  the dark?  Was the Press Office kept in the dark over the past month  and a half when you've been denying that a VAT tax would be  considered that it was actually on the table over there as an option?              MS. MYERS:  I think we've said all that we have to say.   It is something the working groups are looking at.  The President has  not made a decision about it yet.  And beyond that, I have nothing to  add.              Q   Well, sorry, Dee Dee, there are still a couple of  questions that we are going to have to ask because we have a problem  with credibility here -- yours primarily.  What we're asking is, if  you all were not told at all that this thing was being considered  while you were coming out here and telling us that it was not, or if  it's a case that you were coming out here and deliberately misleading  us.              MS. MYERS:  I don't believe that anyone has ever come  out here and deliberately misled you from this podium -- ever --ever.              Q   Has anyone tried to shade it a little bit to  indicate something -- has anybody told anybody to come out --              MS. MYERS:  We're not trying to shade answers or  deliberately mislead anybody.  I've said what I have to say about  this issue.              Q   All we were trying to find out --              MS. MYERS:  I understand what you're trying to find out  and I've given you the answers, Helen.              Q   We're trying to find out what changed -- what made  it an option again.  That's the --              MS. MYERS:  The working groups were given a broad  mandate to investigate all options, and they are doing that.                Q   Yes, but it wasn't an option before.  How can you  investigate it if the President has taken it off the table?              MS. MYERS:  It is something that they're obviously  considering and the President has not made a decision on.              Q   Yes, but he took it off the table in February.              MS. MYERS:  Working groups are considering it.  They'll  present it to the President at some point and he'll make a decision.              Q   Why would they consider it if he has taken it off  the table?              MS. MYERS:  It's clearly on the table.               Q   Yes, but he took it off the table.  Did he change  his mind?              MS. MYERS:  It's back on the table, Bill.              Q   Did he change his mind?              MS. MYERS:  He said this morning that he hasn't made a  decision about it.  He obviously knows that it's on the table.  It's  something that he will look at at some and when we have a decision on  this we'll let you know.              Q   So he must have changed his mind, right?              MS. MYERS:  At some point it will be looked at.  I mean,  --              Q   Dee Dee, there's like two options -- either he  changed his mind or the working groups think they're authority  exceeds the President's.              MS. MYERS:  The working groups were given a broad  mandate to look at all options; they've done that.              Q   Are you going to put out his income tax?              MS. MYERS:  Yes, there will be something available on  his income tax probably later this afternoon.  His return will be  available.               Q   Will there be any kind of briefing to go through  it?              MS. MYERS:  No, nothing's planned.  I think someone will  be available, probably not in a briefing setting, but to walk you  through the questions.              Q   We're used to be walked line-by-line through the  presidential tax forms.              MS. MYERS:  I've seen those briefings.  (Laughter.)              Q   Could we have one?              MS. MYERS:   No, I don't think there will be any kind of  a formal briefing, but there will be somebody available to answer  your questions about it.              Q   Did they file a joint form?              MS. MYERS:  Yes.              Q   When did he file it?              MS. MYERS:  I believe it's being filed today.              Q   Dee Dee, is there going to be a backgrounder for  Miyazawa?              MS. MYERS:  No, there will be a readout after the  meeting.              Q   No backgrounder today?              MS. MYERS:  No backgrounder today.              Q   This is complicated stuff.  We need help.   (Laughter.)              MS. MYERS:  We can't give you taxes and Miyazawa all in  one day, it's too confusing.  (Laughter.)              Q   Vance and Owen have opened the doors on the use of  force in Bosnia.   They've both said that, A, they never ruled it  out, and B, it might be necessary now.  Does that influence your  thinking on whether or not to change your approach?              MS. MYERS:  There's been no change in our policy towards  Bosnia.  We have always said that we'd consider --              Q   But does that impact upon your decision?  Are they  people whose opinions would carry weight with you?              MS. MYERS:  They're people whose opinions carry weight  certainly.  I mean, the President supports the process that they've  initiated.  But there's been no change in our policy for Bosnia,  although we're considering a number of options right now.  If the  Serbs don't come back to the negotiating table, if they don't sign on  to some kind of an agreement, we will consider additional options,  which we've been saying regularly.              Q   One follow-up question then?  We cannot get a  straight answer from anyone in the administration.  Why do you not  set a deadline for the Serbs?  Can you tell us the strategic or  tactical reasons for not giving them a deadline to come to the table?              MS. MYERS:  We're continuing to put pressure on them  every day.              Q   Which doesn't work so --              MS. MYERS:  Well, we think it is having some effect.   We're going to continue to tighten sanctions.  As you know, we  support the omnibus resolution.  We expect that to come to a vote on  the 26th.                Q   You say it's having an effect -- can you give us  any documentation?              MS. MYERS:  I'd be happy to provide somebody to talk to  you about the impact of the sanctions and things like that.              Q   There's been no -- you have not been able to  provide anybody who can tell us that the sanctions have had any  effect in Bosnia.  Serbia, yes; in Bosnia, no.              MS. MYERS:  I think that they've had effect in Serbia  and we think they've had some effect in Bosnia.  And again, I'll be  happy to provide somebody to walk you through the details of that, if  you'd like.              Q   We would like to hear from someone who can show us  what the effect has been in Bosnia.  We had the briefing on all of  the terrible things that are happening in Belgrade, but we haven't  seen anything that indicates an impact on the fighting.  Can you  provide something along those lines?              MS. MYERS:  I will see what I can get you.              Q   On the extra Russian aid that Christopher announced  this morning -- where is that money coming from?              MS. MYERS:  We'll have to work with Congress on the  details of that package.              Q   So that would be new money that you would hope to  get?              MS. MYERS:    Yes, that's new money, in addition to the  $1.6 billion announced in Vancouver.  So I assume that you all have  seen the $1.8-billion package that was announced this morning in  Tokyo by Secretary Christopher.              Q   Isn't there a concern, though, about offering  something which you have to get in Congress?  I mean, that was the  concern with Vancouver; you didn't want to do that.              MS. MYERS:  The concern with Vancouver was to do  something immediately, which required money that was already approved  in the Fiscal '93 budget.  What we're looking at now is a little bit  longer-term plan to build on top of the $1.6 billion that we  announced in Vancouver.  This clearly will require congressional  approval, or some of it will anyway, and we're going to continue to  work with Congress to make that happen.              Q   To what extent has that been vetted or agreed to by  Congress?              MS. MYERS:  The President has had a number of  conversations with members and will continue to work with them as  this process moves forward.              Q   Was Christopher able to put this package out with a  fair degree of understanding that you will be able to get it through  Congress?              MS. MYERS:  It was created in consultation with  Congress.              Q   In meeting with the law enforcement officials, is  that -- does that have a set speech and a goal?  A direction?              MS. MYERS:  Yes, the President will talk about -- and  the law enforcement organizations are endorsing the President's jobs  package.  They believe particularly the summer jobs package will help  give kids something to do.              Q   Who are they?              MS. MYERS:  It's members or leadership from three  organizations:  NAPO, which is the National Association of Police  Organizations; IBPO, which is the International Brotherhood of Police  Organizations, I believe; and IUPA, which is the International Union  of Police Associations.              Q   Will the FBI chief be there?              MS. MYERS:  The FBI chief?  No.              Q   Or any other federal law enforcement officials?              MS. MYERS:  No, it will be the President and these  national law enforcement organization leaders.              Q   Does the $1.8 billion announced today include the  $400 million that's in the FY '94 budget for disarmament?              MS. MYERS:  No.  The Nunn-Lugar money is separate.              Q   So this would be the $700 million that's in the  budget already, plus another $1.1 billion?              MS. MYERS:  I believe all of this is on top of the $700  million already in the budget.              Q   Is this going to be part of the supplemental or  Fiscal '94 --              MS. MYERS:  We'll work with Congress on the exact  funding mechanism -- on exactly how this will be paid for.              Q   This $1.8 billion on top of --              MS. MYERS:  On top of $700 million -- on top of the $400  million Nunn-Lugar money we announced earlier.              Q   And this is what prompted the President to call Bob  Dole -- it was on this tranche, not on the previous money he was  calling Bob Dole?              MS. MYERS:  Correct.              Q   Is there a briefing on Miyazawa?              MS. MYERS:  There will be a readout after the meeting  with Miyazawa.  Tomorrow.              Q   Dee Dee, on a totally unrelated matter, some  Republicans who are active in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are  complaining about this new cozy relationship between the White House  and the Chamber of Commerce.  There are -- the town hall meeting the  other night, the satellite and all of this relationship. Does the White House feel that you're getting too close to these  Chambers of Commerce?              MS. MYERS:  That's an interesting charge.  (Laughter.)   After how many years of Democrats being accused of not paying any  attention to the Chambers, now there are those who would accuse us of  being too close.  I think that's interesting.  But no, we're thrilled  by the support we've received from the national Chamber and local  Chambers across the country and we'll continue to work with them on  this and other initiatives.              Q   What's the status of the President thinking about  going to this Democratic retreat?              MS. MYERS:  It's on his calendar.  I think he'll almost  certainly go.              Q   All three days?              MS. MYERS:  We haven't figured out exactly when he'll be  there yet.                Q   Is it open to coverage?              MS. MYERS:  No, I believe the whole thing is closed.              Q   Is he going to have any kind of address, statement,  anything at all on the gay rights march on the 25th?              MS. MYERS:  We're still looking at that.  We haven't  made a final decision about how we'll -- who will make a statement or  what --              Q   Any meetings scheduled with any of the leaders?              MS. MYERS:  Nothing is scheduled, but I wouldn't rule it  out.              Q   What about an AIDS czar?              MS. MYERS:  It's coming.              Q   Anything on the weekend?              Q   There's been a suggestion that he's going to this  retreat to avoid having to participate in the gay rights -- or appear  or have any involvement in the gay rights march.              MS. MYERS:  No, I think this is something he's been  discussing for a long time -- appearing at the Senate Democratic  retreat.              Q   The weekend?              MS. MYERS:  Weekend?  Don't know -- the only thing on  right now is the radio address on Saturday.              Q   Any travel plans?              MS. MYERS:  If it changes -- none right now.              Q   He's not going to be off campaigning for his  stimulus package?              MS. MYERS:  No specific plans right now.              Q   What about mid-week?  Anything likely?              MS. MYERS:  It's possible.  Yes, I think it's likely  that we'll travel next week -- certainly the weekend.              Q   Has he called Thurmond about his daughter?              MS. MYERS:  I don't know.  I'll check.              Q   Going to name a drug czar this weekend?              MS. MYERS:  This weekend?  I don't believe so.              Q   And the radio address on Saturday -- is that going  to be focused on the stimulus package?              MS. MYERS:  I'm sure it will.

If a \\\"reputable firm\\\" produces a chip (with escrowed key) that is a pop-in replacement for the Clipper chip in my phone, and uses an algorithm that is widely known and evaluated and \\\"trusted,\\\" then what's the problem?  The Clipper is going to be reverse engineered anyway by any organization with sufficient resources (can you say \\\"billions of cocaine dollars?\\\") so those drug dealers they're so worried about will be slipping through the cracks.  We law-abiding (non-incredibly-wealthy) citizens, naturally, will not have this recourse.  But claiming that the algorithm can't be released to prevent people from using non-key-escrowed chips is plain deceitful... analysis of the chip output will provide information on the necessary headers and whatnot, so the \\\"bad guys\\\" could build chips using a *different* algorithm and still not escrow their keys.

Some Christian churches claimed to be located at the final resting places of Peter, Mark, and other saints, but no one ever claimed to possess the body of Mary, the greatest of the saints. Why? Because everyone knew that she had been taken up into heaven.  Although there is no definitive scriptural proof for the assumption of Mary, some passages seem suggestive, like the passage in Revelation that describes a woman giving birth to a Son and later being crowned in the heavens. Of course, the woman in this passage has other interpretations; she can also be taken a symbol for the Church.  The assumption of Mary makes sense because of her relationship to Christ.  Jesus, perfect God and perfect man, fulfilled the requirements of the law perfectly.  Under the law God gave to us, we are to honor our mother and father, and Christ's act of taking his mother into heaven is part of his fulfillment of that law. Also, he took his flesh from her, so it seems appropriate that he decide not to allow her flesh to rot in the grave.  One last point: an ex-Catholic attempted to explain Catholic doctrine on the assumption by asserting it is connected to a belief that Mary did not die. This is not a correct summary of what Catholics believe. The dogma of the assumption was carefully phrased to avoid saying whether Mary did or did not die. In fact, the consensus among Catholic theologians seems to be that Mary in fact did die.

First is that the way the sun was shining in Miami, it had a summer atmosphere in early spring for baseball.  In comparison Wrigley Field in early April still has a wintry look to it with the dead ivy and bundled up fans.    The second and most important was the fans.  I like these guys/gals! I will admit I am a football fan first but I still enjoy baseball. It was interesting because most of these fans are only accustomed to the Miami Dolphins.  The way they were cheering, I thought it was the AFC playoffs.

Madness.  /* Written  4:34 pm  Apr 16, 1993 by cpr@igc.apc.org in igc:mideast.forum */ /* ---------- \\\"From Israeli press. Madness.\\\" ---------- */ FROM THE ISRAELI PRESS.  Paper: Zman Tel Aviv (Tel Aviv's time). Friday local Tel Aviv's paper, affiliated with Maariv.  Date: 19 February 1993  Journalist: Guy Ehrlich  Subject: Interview with soldiers who served in the Duvdevan (Cherry) units, which disguise themselves as Arabs and operate within the occupied territories.  Excerpts from the article:  \\\"A lot has been written about the units who disguise themselves as Arabs, things good and bad, some of the falsehoods. But the most important problem of those units has been hardly dealt with. It is that everyone who serves in the Cherry, after a time goes in one way or another insane\\\".  A man who said this, who will here be called Danny (his full name is known to the editors) served in the Cherry. After his discharge from the army he works as delivery boy. His pal, who will here be called Dudu was also serving in the Cherry, and is now about to depart for a round-the-world tour. They both look no different from average Israeli youngsters freshly discharged from conscript service. But in their souls, one can notice something completely different....It was not easy for them to come out with disclosures about what happened to them. And they think that to most of their fellows from the Cherry it woundn't be easy either. Yet after they began to talk, it was nearly impossible to make them stop talking. The following article will contain all the horror stories recounted with an appalling openness.  (...) A short time ago I was in command of a veteran team, in which some of the fellows applied for release from the Cherry. We called such soldiers H.I. 'Hit by the Intifada'. Under my command was a soldier who talked to himself non-stop, which is a common phenomenon in the Cherry. I sent him to a psychiatrist. But why I should talk about others when I myself feel quite insane ? On Fridays, when I come home, my parents know I cannot be talked to until I go to the beach, surf a little, calm down and return. The keys of my father's car must be ready for in advance, so that I can go there. I they dare talk to me before, or whenever I don't want them to talk to me, I just grab a chair and smash it instantly. I know it is my nerve:  Smashing chairs all the time and then running away from home, to the car and to the beach. Only there I become normal.(...)  (...) Another friday I was eating a lunch prepared by my mother. It was an omelette of sorts. She took the risk of sitting next to me and talking to me. I then told my mother about an event which was still fresh in my mind. I told her how I shot an Arab, and how exactly his wound looked like when I went to inspect it. She began to laugh hysterically. I wanted her to cry, and she dared laugh straight in my face instead ! So I told her how my pal had made a mincemeat of the two Arabs who were preparing the Molotov cocktails. He shot them down, hitting them beautifully, exactly as they deserved. One bullet had set a Molotov cocktail on fire, with the effect that the Arab was burning all over, just beautifully. I was delighted to see it.  My pal fired three bullets, two at the Arab with the Molotov cocktail, and the third at his chum. It hit him straight in his ass. We both felt that we'd pulled off something.  Next I told my mother how another pal of mine split open the guts in the belly of another Arab and how all of us ran toward that spot to take a look. I reached the spot first. And then that Arab, blood gushing forth from his body, spits at me. I yelled: 'Shut up' and he dared talk back to me in Hebrew! So I just laughed straight in his face. I am usually laughing when I stare at something convulsing right before my eyes. Then I told him: 'All right, wait a moment'. I left him in order to take a look at another wounded Arab. I asked a soldier if that Arab could be saved, if the bleeding from his artery could be stopped with the help of a stone of something else like that. I keep telling all this to my mother, with details, and she keeps laughing straight into my face. This infuriated me. I got very angry, because I felt I was becoming mad. So I stopped eating, seized the plate with he omelette and some trimmings still on, and at once threw it over her head. Only then she stopped laughing. At first she didn't know what to say.  (...) But I must tell you of a still other madness which falls upon us frequently. I went with a friend to practice shooting on a field. A gull appeared right in the middle of the field. My friend shot it at once. Then we noticed four deer standing high up on the hill above us. My friend at once aimed at one of them and shot it. We enjoyed the sight of it falling down the rock. We shot down two deer more and went to take a look. When we climbed the rocks we saw a young deer, badly wounded by our bullet, but still trying to such some milk from its already dead mother. We carefully inspected two paths, covered by blood and chunks of torn flesh of the two deer we had hit. We were just delighted by that sight. We had hit'em so good ! Then we decided to kill the young deer too, so as spare it further suffering. I approached, took out my revolver and shot him in the head several times from a very short distance. When you shoot straight at the head you actually see the bullets sinking in.  But my fifth bullet made its brains fall outside onto the ground, with the effect of splattering lots of blood straight on us. This made us feel cured of the spurt of our madness. Standing there soaked with blood, we felt we were like beasts of prey. We couldn't explain what had happened to us. We were almost in tears while walking down from that hill, and we felt the whole day very badly.  (...) We always go back to places we carried out assignments in. This is why we can see them. When you see a guy you disabled, may be for the rest of his life, you feel you got power. You feel Godlike of sorts.\\\"  (...) Both Danny and Dudu contemplate at least at this moment studying the acting. Dudu is not willing to work in any security-linked occupation. Danny feels the exact opposite.

We can just call them house Jews, fools, or anti-Semites from Jewish families.

The initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.  For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.  Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.  A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" has been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new, relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today.  This new technology will help companies protect proprietary information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals.   A \\\"key-escrow\\\" system will be established to ensure that the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique                                   2   \\\"keys,\\\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately in two \\\"key-escrow\\\" data bases that will be established by the Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap.  The \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans.  To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings.  The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield criminals and terrorists.  We need the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" and other approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system), the President has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:       --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to           employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;       --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone           calls and data, under proper court or other legal           order, when necessary to protect our citizens;       --   the effective and timely use of the most modern           technology to build the National Information           Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and           the competitiveness of American industry in the global           marketplace; and        --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export           high technology products.  The President has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.                                    3  The Administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a National Information Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks (\\\"information superhighways\\\") will transmit video, images, HDTV programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone system transmits voice.  Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law.  Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet.  The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available.

A:   No.  \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with      no new authorities to access the content of the private      conversations of Americans.  Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on      a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation      encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to      decipher the message?  A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a      court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They      would then present documentation of this authorization to      the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and      obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug      smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are      stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key      escrow system.  Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?  A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent      entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the      Administration have yet to determine which agencies will      oversee the key-escrow data banks.  Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure      how strong the security is?    A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption      systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will      remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow      system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of      cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all      potential users that there are no unrecognized      vulnerabilities.  Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?  A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the      Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in      this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the      President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet      officials.  Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?  A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on      encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify      as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have      briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the      decisions related to this initiative.  Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?  A:   The government designed and developed the key access      encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the      microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product      manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip      manufacturer that produces them.  Q:   Who provides the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\"?  A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,      California, and will sell the chip to encryption device      manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed      to other vendors in the future.  Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices?   A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating      the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" into their devices.       Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological      solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be      willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more      powerful encryption devices?  A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be      considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow      mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product      that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive      than others readily available today, but it is just one      piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to      encryption technology, which the Administration is      developing.       The Administration is not saying, \\\"since encryption      threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,      we will prohibit it outright\\\" (as some countries have      effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \\\"every      American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an      unbreakable commercial encryption product.\\\"  There is a      false \\\"tension\\\" created in the assessment that this issue is      an \\\"either-or\\\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,      and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,      balanced approach such as is proposed with the \\\"Clipper      Chip\\\" and similar encryption techniques.  Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton      Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from      that of the Bush Administration?    A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption      technology in telecommunications and computing and are      committed to working with industry and public-interest      groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'      privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law      enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime      and terrorism.  Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use      the government hardware?  A:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control      requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is      required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The      same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the      attractions of this technology is the protection it can give      to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this      in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a      case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these      devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan      to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability      of these products.         \",\" You're closer than you might imagine.

What does the Bible say about this and how can we encourage our friends with regard to this issue?\",\"From article <1993Apr17.010256.14372@eafs000.ca.boeing.com>, by ten0772@eafs000.ca.boeing.com (Timothy E. Neto):  This all sounds suspiciously like my company might have something to do with this.  Background first: Megatek has a series of framebuffers designed as X accelerators. For the most part these are designed for Sun SBUS and Sun (and other vendor's) VME systems.  That said, Megatek products support multi-screen and/or multi-display on a sigle workstation. Most of our cards have a keyboard/mouse port which can be used to provide additional displays. For example, say you hade a Sparcstation with an Sbus expansion chassis. You could put in six frambuffers, allowing a total of six screens in the system. You could then attach from 1 to 6 keyboard/mice, allowing you to mix and match any combination of screens and displays. You could have 1 6-screen display, 3 2-screen displays, 6 1-screen displays, or 1 2-screen display and 1 4-screen display. Basically any combination.  Because of this, we at Megatek try to be very careful about the use of the words multi-screen and multi-display. They are quite different in meaning, and (at least in X) have exact definitions.  The reason I ramble like this is the mention of an upper limit if 12 screens in a display. As it so happens, there's a define in the server that determines the most screens supported (server/include/misc.h, MAXSCREENS). As released my MIT, this is 3. As released by Megatek, this is 12.  As such, the most screens supported by a single Megatek display (i.e. X server) is 12. If someone construed this to be a limitation of X I'm sorry, but clearly (as pointed out so well by Mr. Neto) this is not the case.  We just did it here because nobody has ever asked us for more. Of course, I could say \\\"Buy all you want, we'll support more.\\\" -- \",\"These word processing utilities all include complete printed manuals and registration cards.

It was pointed out that XtAppInitialize() should never be called more than once.  This helped.  However, I am still having some problems.  Below is a new little test program that more closely models my real program.  In the actual program, I am writing a library, callable from any other program.  This means that the first time the lib function is called, it must initialize things, and after that, it should just use the old stuff (still around because of static variables).  In the demo below, main() represents the main program calling my library and doit() represents the interface to the library function.  #include <X11/Xlib.h> #include <Xm/Xm.h> #include <Xm/PushB.h> #include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h>  void bla(XtAppContext app, Widget top) {         Widget topone = top;  // in real prog, these are member vars         XtAppContext theapp = app; // of a class         int junk = 0;         Display *dis = XtOpenDisplay(theapp, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0, &junk,                                         NULL);          Widget box = XtVaCreateManagedWidget(\\\"blaaa\\\", xmPushButtonWidgetClass,                         topone,                         XmNheight, 50,                         XmNwidth, 50,                         NULL);          XtRealizeWidget(topone);         for (int i=0;i<=25;i++) // real prog returns when \\\"Exit\\\" button clicked         {                 XEvent event;                 XtAppNextEvent(theapp, &event);                 XtDispatchEvent(&event);         }         XtDestroyWidget(box);         XtCloseDisplay(dis); }  // SetItUp - should be called once only void SetItUp(XtAppContext *app, Widget *top) {         int junk = 0;         (*top)=XtAppInitialize (app, \\\"test\\\", NULL, 0, &junk, NULL,                 NULL, NULL, 0); }  // doit - some library function callable from the outside void doit() {         static XtAppContext app; // use these every time called         static Widget top;          static int setup = 0;          if (!setup)         {                 SetItUp(&app, &top);                 setup = 1;         }         bla(app, top); }  // main - program which links to my library main() {         for (int i=0;i<=20;i++)         {                 doit();                 printf(\\\"sleeping...\\\\n\\\");//widget still on screen at this point                 sleep(5);         } }   The problem is that the widget does not go away until the new one is created.

It gives police the power to put innocent people in jail because they (the police) find something they don't understand.  Most police don't know what the return key does, never mind the difference between a core file and classified military secrets.  There are plenty of scenarios where the user would have no idea what something is either.  It could be uninitialized junk.  The burden of proof is on the user to show that it's something a normal upstanding citizen should have.  No one should ever be put in that situation, especially in America.  What's disgusting about this is how easily most people go along with it, to provide a bargaining chip against some hypothetical *alleged* child molester or drug dealer, or whatever bad thing is in style at the time.  Basically most people don't have a clear distinction between criminals and suspects.  As an analogy, it's like they find a loose screw in your house, and they insist that you're building a bomb or machine gun.  They ask you where it came from (like you'd know), and ask you to prove your claim.  When you explain it in such simple terms, people may start to get the idea.  As a matter of fact, i do keep random files on my disk.  The reason is, without special-purpose hardware, it takes a long time to generate good random bits.  I have programs that crank out a couple bits per minute, which is pretty conservative, but over time that's more than i need.  If you think about it, there's no point in actually encrypting random data, because it just gives you different random data.  If you want some data to look like an encrypted file, you just put an appropriate header on it.  If enough people do this, some of them will be put in jail.  When you get arrested and the police ask for your keys, you can tell them it's just random junk, although of course they won't believe you.  While you're sitting in jail, you can take consolation in the fact that the government will burn a few CPU-years trying to find something that's not there. \",\" Don't worry about leaks.

The idea of resurrection is one which can be found in a host of different forms in the religions of antiquity.  The problem was not the resurrection which was a mediorce issue for a tiny fragment of the Jewish population  (the Saducees) but was a non issues for everyone else.  The real problem was that Christians were pacifist and preached there was only one god.  When the state operates by a system of divinitation of the emperor -  monotheism  becomes a capital offense.  The Jews were able to get exemption from this, and were also not evangelistic.  Christians were far more vocal, and gentile, and hence dangerous and were therefore targets of persecution.  Also since Christians were a relatively powerless group, they made good scapegoats as is seen by Nero's blaming them for the burning of Rome.

It was created to meet to the daily research needs of scientists  conducting climate investigations using satellite data and remote sensing techniques.        Intuitive Graphic Interface   Sphinx features an interactive interface with pop-up menus and  point-and-click dialog boxes which makes image processing and analysis simple and fast.  This accessible menuing enables you to build attractive image  layouts quickly while also providing you the flexibility of returning to the main menu to conduct other image analysis and processing operations.        Image Format Compatibility   Using smart read/write functions, Sphinx allows you to easily open and save image files in a variety of formats using bit, integer or real data values.  Sphinx also reads and writes the common TIFF and GIF formats as well as compresses and decompresses image formats to save disk space.        Image Analysis & Processing   For image and pixel analysis, the Sphinx package includes an assortment of processing tools that perform useful statistical and  mathematical filtering operations, such as Fourier transforms, convolution  product or principal component analyses. An interactive interpreter for both algebraic equations and images allows the user to manipulate and combine individual data channels interactively. Standard FORTRAN notation is used for formula entry and for trig onometric and transcendental functions.        Satellite Spectra & Orbit Analysis   Sphinx possesses functions to simulate satellite signal sensitivity for various meteorological satellites (e.g., GOES, METEOSAT, NOAA, Spot etc.). The simulations are conducted for a selection of standard atmospheric and surface conditions and instrument spectral bands. A geometry model computes the solar zenith angles, warping, orbit simulation, and 3-D image projection.        Easy External Program Interfacing   Sphinx allows users the flexibility to integrate externally developed software algorithms for processing and converting satellite observations.  Sphinx exports and imports image files and image parameters to external programs using special interface functions.        Quick Quality Presentation   Sphinx rapidly displays, manipulates, and enhances high-resolution multispectral images and color tables.  Using six 8-bit 1024x1024 image planes and one graphics plane, the package conveniently combines color images, graphics and text to generate sharp digital images for articles and reports. Sphinx's 2-D and 3-D graphics editor provides complete flexibility for modifying and integrating vector graphics and analysis plots with images, such as  histograms and radial graphs.  The package supplies color and gray scale output for standard inkjet and laser printers.  Other Capabilities Sphinx also performs image animation, external  graphics importing, mosaic fitting... what else?        Software Support & Development    Sphinx was developed at the Laboratoire d'Optique Atmospherique (LOA)  of the Universite de Lille, France. The package has received critical feedback and support from scientists at the French national laboratory, Centre National de Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), and the French space agency, Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES). At LOA, Sphinx undergoes continued refinement and development to meet changing research needs and advances in computer technology.  The package, which features on-line help, is supported by an Internet address   sphinx@loasil.citilille.fr through which questions can be answered and  version updates provided without delay.        Performance Tested    CNES has selected Sphinx to analyze and process the satellite data  collected during the upcoming ADEOS/POLDER satellite mission.  Today, the Sphinx package is in use at the NASA - Goddard Space Flight Center and is widely used in many French laboratories, including the Centre de Recherche en Physique de l'Environnement, Ecole Normale Superieure , Laboratoire d' Etudes et de Recherches en Teledetection Spatiale,  Laboratoire  de Meteorologie Dynamique.      A TEST VERSION OF SPHINX IS AVAILABLE AT loasil.citilille.fr    (134.206.50.4) anonymous (bin : cd SPHINX : get ALL_SPHINX.tar.Z)     IN THE TEST VERSION THE OUTPUT FILES ARE DISABLE.

One reply, which I have lost, suggested several parishes in New York that have good Masses, one  of which was Corpus Christi in downtown Manhattan.  By coincidence, last week's _America_, the national Jesuit magazine, carried an interview with Fr. Myles  Bourke, Corpus Christi's pastor emeritus.  Fr. Bourke also directed the NT  translation in the New American Bible.  He noted \\\"...certain practices have  been introduced into the Mass in such a manner that an atmosphere of banality,  and sometimes of hilarity, has trivialized the liturgy.\\\"  I note that at my  parents' parish on Easter, helium filled balloons were distributed at the  offertory, apparently to aid in understanding the word \\\"risen\\\".  This was not a  kiddie mass, either, but the well-attended 11:00 Mass.  I wanted to note the generous spirit behind the replies.  This newsgroup as a whole offers generally moderate (perhaps because it's moderated) conversation on topics that often lead people to extreme behavior (including myself). Sometimes people do go over the top, but the remarkable thing is how that is the exception, I think.  Benefits of the doubt are generally granted.  It seems so...Christian?\",\"Dear SGI and netter GL-X Mixed-Model experts, I am writing a mixed model application that creates a couple different color maps for different windows, and I've been having trouble getting the window manager to reliably honor my requests.  In some environments (entry level R3000 Indigo w/ 4.0.5) all windows are getting properly connected to their designated color maps, but on others (an IRIS 4D 240/GTX; also a different entry level Indigo) the color mapping is unreliable and changes behavior when I compile at different times.  The most common problem is that all non-top-level windows fail to be displayed according to their colormap.  My application starts out by creating three top-level windows; in some cases all but the first of these also fail to be displayed by their colormap.  This is spectacularly aggravating.  I would dearly appreciate   1. an explanation of the standard, RIGHT, CORRECT way to give a window   a colormap such that the Window Manager will Honor and Obey it;    2. any advice about problems that could cause my failure to get my   desired colormaps.  By now I have exhausted my own attempts on this, having tried everything reasonable or imaginable.  Below is example code giving the schematic for how I have been *TRYING* to do this.

If you have questions, you want to send mail to Richard, not me.  -- Dan           Software Tools to help with RSI       -------------------------------   This file describes tools, primarily software, to help prevent or manage RSI. This version now includes information on such diverse tools as calendar programs and digital watches...   Please let me know if you know any other tools, or if you have information or opinions on these ones, and I will update this FAQ.  I am especially interested in getting reviews of these products from people who have evaluated them or are using them.     Richard Donkin                            Internet mail: richardd@hoskyns.co.uk               Tel: +44 71 814 5708 (direct) Fax: +44 71 251 2853  Changes in this version:       Added information on StressFree, another typing management tool       for Windows.   TYPING MANAGEMENT TOOLS: these aim to help you manage your keyboard use, by warning you to take a break every so often.  The better ones also include advice on exercises, posture and workstation setup.  Some use sound hardware to   warn of a break, others use beeps or screen messages.  Often, RSI appears only after many years of typing, and the pain has a delayed action in the short term too: frequently you can be typing all day with little problem and the pain gets worse in the evening. These tools act as an early warning system: by listening to their warnings and taking breaks with exercises, you don't have to wait for your  body to give you a more serious and painful warning - that is, getting RSI.        Tool: At Your Service (commercial software)     Available from:  Bright Star  Tel: +1 (206) 451 3697     Platforms: Mac (System 6.0.4), Windows     Description:  Provides calendar, keyboard watch, email watch, and system info.   Warns when to take a break (configurable).  Has a few recommendations  on posture, and exercises.  Sound-oriented, will probably work best   with sound card (PC) or with microphone (Mac).  Should be possible  to record your own messages to warn of break.       Tool: AudioPort (sound card and software)     Available from:  Media Vision  Tel: +1 (510) 226 2563     Platforms: PC     Description:  A sound card to plug into your PC parallel port.  Includes 'At Your Service'.       Tool: Computer Health Break (commercial software)     Available from:  Escape Ergonomics, Inc  1111 W. El Camino Real  Suite 109  Mailstop 403  Sunnyvale, CA  Tel: +1 (408) 730 8410     Platforms: DOS     Description:  Aimed at preventing RSI, this program warns you to take  breaks after a configurable interval, based on clock time, or  after a set number of keystrokes -- whichever is earlier.  It gives you 3 exercises to do each time, randomly selected from  a set of 70.  Exercises are apparently tuned to the type of work  you do - data entry, word processing, information processing.  Exercises are illustrated and include quite a lot of text on  how to do the exercise and on what exactly the exercise does.   CHB includes hypertext information on RSI that you can use   to learn more about RSI and how to prevent it.  Other information  on non-RSI topics can be plugged into this hypertext viewer.  A full glossary of medical terms and jargon is included.   CHB can be run in a DOS box under Windows, but does not then  warn you when to take a break; it does not therefore appear  useful when used with Windows.   Cost: $79.95; quantity discounts, site licenses.      Comments:  The keystroke-counting approach looks good: it seems better  to measure the activity that is causing you problems than to  measure clock time or even typing time.  The marketing stuff  is very good and includes some summaries of research papers,  as well as lots of arguments you can use to get your company   to pay up for RSI management tools.        Tool: EyerCise (commercial software)     Available from:  RAN Enterprises  One Woodland Park Dr.  Haverhill, MA  01830, US  Tel: 800-451-4487 (US only)     Platforms: Windows (3.0/3.1), OS/2 PM (1.3/2.0) [Not DOS]     Description:  Aimed at preventing RSI and eye strain, this program warns you to take  breaks after a configurable interval (or at fixed times). Optionally  displays descriptions and pictures of exercises - pictures are  animated and program beeps you to help you do exercises at the  correct rate.  Includes 19 stretches and 4 visual training   exercises, can configure which are included and how many repetitions  you do - breaks last from 3 to 7 minutes.  Also includes online help   on workplace ergonomics.     Quote from their literature:   \\\"EyerCise is a Windows program that breaks up your day with periodic  sets of stretches and visual training exercises.  The stretches work  all parts of your body, relieving tension and helping to prevent  Repetitive Strain Injury.  The visual training exercises will improve  your peripheral vision and help to relieve eye strain.  Together these  help you to become more relaxed and productive.\\\"    \\\"The package includes the book _Computers & Visual Stress_ by Edward C.  Godnig, O.D. and John S. Hacunda, which describes the ergonomic setup  for a computer workstation and provides procedures and exercises to  promote healthy and efficient computer use.     Cost: $69.95 including shipping and handling, quantity discounts  for resellers.  Free demo ($5 outside US).       Comments:  I have a copy of this, and it works as advertised: I would say  it is better for RSI prevention than RSI management, because it  does not allow breaks at periods less than 30 minutes.  Also, it  interrupts you based on clock time rather than typing time, which  is not so helpful unless you use the keyboard all day.  Worked OK on  Windows 3.0 though it did occasionally crash with a UAE - not sure  why. Also refused to work with the space bar on one PC, and has  one window without window controls.  Very usable though, and does not  require any sound hardware.      Tool: Lifeguard (commercial software)     Available from:  Visionary Software  P.O. Box 69447  Portland, OR  97201, US  Tel: +1 (503) 246-6200     Platforms: Mac, DOS (Windows version underway)     Description:  Aimed at preventing RSI.  Warns you to take a break  with dialog box and sound.  Includes a list of exercises  to do during breaks, and information on configuring your  workstation in an ergonomic manner.  Price: $59;  quantity discounts and site licenses.  The DOS product is  bought in from another company, apparently; not sure how  equivalent this is to the Mac version.    The Mac version got a good review in Desktop Publisher   Magazine (Feb 1991).  Good marketing stuff with useful   2-page summaries of RSI problems and solutions, with   references.

Anon FTP:   ftp.cica.indiana.edu (and mirroring sites)      Platforms: Windows (3.0/3.1) (Mac and DOS versions underway)     Description:  Aimed at preventing RSI, this program warns you to take  breaks after a configurable interval (or at fixed times).   Displays descriptions and pictures of exercises - pictures are  animated and program paces you to help you do exercises at the  correct rate.  Quite a few exercises, can configure which ones  are included to some extent.  Online help.   Version 2.0 is out soon, Mac and DOS versions will be based  on this.   Cost: $29.95 if support via CompuServe or Internet, otherwise $39.95.                 Site license for 3 or more copies is $20.00 each.        (NOTE: prices may have gone up for V2.0).       Comments:  I have had a play with this, and it works OK.  Its user interface  design is much better in 2.0, though still a bit unusual.  expensive tool around and it does the job.  It is also the only  tool with a redistributable demo, so if you do get the demo, post it  on your local bulletin boards, FTP servers and Bitnet servers!  Does not include general info on RSI and ergonomics, but it does   have the ability to step backward in the exercise sequence,  which is good for repeating the most helpful exercises.      Tool: Typewatch (freeware), version 3.8 (October 1992)     Available from:  Email to richardd@hoskyns.co.uk  Anonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/typewatch.shar     Platforms: UNIX (tested on SCO, SunOS, Mach; character and X Window mode)     Description:  This is a shell script that runs in the background and warns you  to stop typing, based on how long you have been continuously  typing.  It does not provide exercises, but it does check  that you really do take a break, and tells you when you  can start typing again.     Typewatch now tells you how many minutes you have been typing  today, each time it warns you, which is useful so you  know how much you *really* type.  It also logs information  to a file that you can analyse or simply print out.     The warning message appears on your screen (in character mode),  in a pop-up window (for X Windows), or as a Zephyr message  (for those with Athena stuff).   Tim Freeman <tsf@cs.cmu.edu>   has put in a lot of bug fixes, extra features and support for   X, Zephyr and Mach.   Not formally supported, but email richardd@hoskyns.co.uk  (for SCO, SunOS, character mode) or tsf@cs.cmu.edu (for Mach,  X Window mode, Zephyr) if you have problems or want to give   feedback.      Tool: Various calendar / batch queue programs     Available from:  Various sources     Platforms: Various     Description:  Any calendar/reminder program that warns you of an upcoming  appointment can be turned into an ad hoc RSI management tool.  Or, any batch queue submission program that lets you submit  a program to run at a specific time to display a message to  the screen.   Using Windows as an example: create a Calendar file, and  include this filename in your WIN.INI's 'load=' line so  you get it on every startup of Windows.  Suppose you  want to have breaks every 30 minutes, starting from 9 am.  Press F7 (Special Time...) to enter an appointment, enter  9:30, hit Enter, and type some text in saying what the break  is for.  Then press F5 to set an alarm on this entry, and repeat   for the next appointment.   By using Windows Recorder, you can record the keystrokes  that set up breaks throughout a day in a .REC file.  Put this  file on your 'run=' line, as above, and you will then, with  a single keypress, be able to set up your daily appointments  with RSI exercises.   The above method should be adaptable to most calendar programs.   An example using batch jobs would be to submit a simple job  that runs at 9:30 am and warns you to take a break; this will  depend a lot on your operating system.   While these approaches are not ideal, they are a good way of forcing   yourself to take a break if you can't get hold of a suitable RSI   management tool.  If you are techie enough you might want to  write a version of Typewatch (see above) for your operating  system, using batch jobs or whatever fits best.      Tool: Digital watches with count-down timers     Available from:  Various sources, e.g. Casio BP-100.     Description:  Many digital watches have timers that count down from a settable  number of minutes; they usually reset easily to that number, either  manually or automatically.     While these are a very basic tool, they are very useful if you  are writing, reading, driving, or doing anything away from  a computer which can still cause or aggravate RSI.  The great  advantage is that they remind you to break from whatever you  are doing.       Comments:  My own experience was that cutting down a lot on my typing led to  my writing a lot more, and still reading as much as ever, which  actually aggravated the RSI in my right arm though the left  arm improved.  Getting a count-down timer watch has been  very useful on some occasions where I write a lot in a day.   I have tried an old fashioned hour-glass type egg timer, but  these are not much good because they do not give an audible  warning of the end of the time period!   KEYBOARD REMAPPING TOOLS: these enable you to change your keyboard mapping so you can type one-handedly or with a different two-handed layout.   One-handed typing tools may help, but be VERY careful about how  you use them -- if you keep the same overall typing workload you are simply doubling your hand use for the hand that you use for typing, and may therefore make matters worse.      Tool: hsh (public domain)     Available from:  Anonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/hsh.shar     Platforms: UNIX (don't know which ones)     Description:  Allows one-handed typing and other general keyboard remappings.  Only works through tty's (so, you can use it with a terminal or  an xterm, but not most X programs).      Tool: Dvorak keyboard tools (various)     Available from:  Anonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/xdvorak.c  Also built into Windows 3.x.      Description:  The Dvorak keyboard apparently uses a more rational layout  that involves more balanced hand use.   It *may* help prevent  RSI a bit, but you can also use it if you have RSI, since   it will slow down your typing a *lot* :-)   \",\"Excerpts from netnews.comp.sys.mac.misc: 5-Apr-93 Re: HELP INSTALL RAM ON CEN.. by Jason Harvey Titus@farad     oh boy am i confused, I thought the entire point of the 72 pin simms was that you could use diffrent size simms so you could avoid having to use sets.  all horror stories not withstanding.\",\"  I think you'd have to do some massive data compression just to fit a bit of key information on each primary particle of the known universe.

Now, we no longer live in the days of big filing cabinets. We live in the electronic age. I asked myself, how big could the escrow database get? How hard might it be to steal the whole thing, particularly were I an NSA official operating with the tacit permission of the escrow houses? (We can pretend that such will not happen, but thats naive.)  Well, lets see. Ten bytes of each escrow half. Lets asume ten bytes of serial number -- in fact, I believe the serial number is smaller, but this is an order of magnitude calculation. We assume 250*10^6 as the population, and that each person has a key. I get five gigabytes for each of the two escrow databases. Fits conveniently on a single very valuable Exabyte tape. This can only get easier with time, but who cares -- I can already hold all the clipper keys in the country in my pocket on two 8mm tapes.  Admittely, they will think of safeguards. They won't put the whole database on one disk, prehaps. Maybe they will throw stumbling blocks in the way. This changes nothing -- they keys will be needed every day by hundreds if not thousands of law enforcement types, so convenience will dictate that the system permit quick electronic retrieval. At some point, with or without collusion by the agencies, those exabyte tapes are going to get cut. Dorothy Denning and David Sternlight will doubtless claim this can't happen -- but we know that \\\"can't\\\" is a prayer, not a word that in this instance connotes realism.  With two exabyte tapes in your pocket, you would hold the keys for every person's conversations in the country in your hands. Yeah, you need the \\\"master key\\\" two -- but thats just ten bytes of information that have to be stored an awful lot of places.  Come to think of it, even if the NSA getting a copy of the database isn't a threat to you because unlike me you have no contraversial political views, consider foreign intelligence services. You know, the ones that David Sternlight wants to protect us from because of the evil industrial espionage that they do. The French apparently do have a big spying operation in friendly countries to get industrial secrets, so he isn't being completely irrational here (although why our companies couldn't use cryptosystems without back doors is left unexplained by those that point out this threat.)   Presumably, foreign intelligence services can get moles into the NSA and other agencies. We have proof by example of this: its happened many times. Presumably, someday they will get their hands on some fraction of the keys. You can't avoid that sort of thing.  Don't pretend that no one unauthorized will ever get their hands on the escrow databases.  We crypto types are all taught something very important at the beginning of intro to cryptography -- security must depend on the easily changed key that you pick to run your system, and not on a secret. The escrow databases aren't the sorts of secrets that our teachers told us about, but they are the sort of big secrets they would lump into this category. Imagine trying to replace 100 million Clipper chips.  I cannot believe that the NSA or whomever it is thats doing this doesn't realize all this already. They are too smart. There are too many of them who have made their bones in the real world. I suspect that they know precisely what they are doing -- and that what they are doing is giving us the appearance of safety so that they can continue to surveil in spite of the growth of strong cryptography. I suspect that they realize that they can't put things off forever, but they can try to delay things as long as possible.  Who knows. Maybe even some of the higher ups, the inevitable bureaucratic types that rise in any organization, really do believe that this scheme might give people some security, even as their subordinates in Fort Meade wring their hands over the foolishness of it all.  -- Perry Metzger  pmetzger@shearson.com\",\"Recently the following problem has arrisen.

In the light of Dr. Ijaz's statement, the above statement should be corrected: \\\".......................................is that (some) non-Ahmadi Muslims don't consider Ahmadi-Muslims as Muslims\\\"  So, the problem does not get solved:-) Who is a muslims and who is not? Humans cannot decide. Humans may not declare others faiths. Its that  simple. I don't understand, why the mere use of the word \\\"ISLAM\\\" is becomming such a big issue. I have seen numorous postings on the net on this subject, and all they say, \\\"No, NO, you cannot use ISLAM as  the name of your newsgroup\\\". ??   I haven't seen a single posting stating what right do they have in declaring the name of other's faiths? Who gives them this authority? Quran? or Hadith? or something else? I want to know this!   Just a small reminder to all my Muslim Brothers, Did _EVER_ the  Holy Prophet of Islam (Muhammad PBUH), say to anyone who called himself a Muslim:  No, You are not a Muslim ! ???????  NEVER! I challenge all my Muslim brothers to produce a single  such evidence from the history of Islam!  Hence, if the Prophet Muhammad could never do that to anyone, how could the Muslims, Mullahs or even Governments of today do it to anyone.

This week's MacWeek reports that Apple is probably planning a drop in August.  My guess is that it may come sooner if Apple decides to  change the price structure upon release of the multimedia units this summer.  Your price looks pretty good at about $50 more then I payed for mine last month.  I would have rather waited for one of the new machines this sommer (like the Cyclone) but the resale value of my IIci would have not been squat by then.  Thus, financing forced me to purchase now.  I'm happy with the machine and won't feel betrayed at all when Apple cuts the price to less then $1000 next week (heh).  Bottome line:  If the C650 does what you want, buy it.  If you wait until the Cylcones come out for a price break then you might as well wait for the PowerPCs to come out for another price break and then the units which follow them.  You may save some money but you've lost a lot of time when you could have been using the computer.  Face it, Apple's prices are going to be in a continuous state of flux.

There is only one way of determin- ing \\\"best\\\" in baseball.  And that is by looking at the  scoreboard  at the  end  of  the game.  Each game determines which *team* is the best that day.  At the end of the season, the team that was  the  best  the most  often  is  the best in the division.  The playoffs determine the best of the best.  But the point is that the only decision making pro- cess  used to determine the \\\"best\\\" is the score of the game and it re- lates to the *teams*.  Not the individual players.  There is no method inherent  in  baseball of comparing individual performances.  And that is how it should be, because, after all, baseball is a team game.  To say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab- solutely  that  player A's team would have played better with player B in their lineup.  Sheer speculation.  Impossible to ascertain.  If you want to select a group of statistics and claim that Clemens has done  better  with those statistics as a criteria, then fine.  But you have  to  be  able  to  prove  that  those  statistics   measure   the individual's  contribution  to  winning  the WS - because  that is the only measure of \\\"best\\\" that has any meaning in the  context  of  base- ball.   So  until you can prove that Clemens contributes to a WS cham- pionship more than Morris your evaluation of  Clemens is totally  sub- jective  and  is  mere opinion.  I have yet to see that any of you can predict a WS winner with any greater accuracy than Jeanne Dixon.   Exactly.  The Jays won with Morris pitching.   And  Boston  wins  with Clemens pitching.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens. I am saying that individual comparisons between  players  are  totally meaningless  and  that anyone claiming that Clemens is better based on his ERA has missed the point of what baseball is all about.   You don't have to be rude.   For you to say that means that you have either missed the entire point of  my  argument, or you yourself have committed a fallacy - Ignoratio Elenchi.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens   because he   has  more   rings   (although  I  have,  tongue in cheek, claimed that in the past).  I am saying that it is impossible to  isolate   an individual's  performance   from that of his team's for the purpose of comparing that individual's performance with another individual's per- formance.  The stats are a nice hobby and  that's  about  it.  There  is  no  new knowledge being produced.  So when a poster claims that Morris is better than Clemens because he has more rings, the poster is no more nor less  incorrect than the rest of you baying hounds.  -- \",\"Generally, an organization has influence in proportion to:   The narrowness of its objectives  The number of members  The strength of belief of its members  This is why the pro- and anti-abortion groups are so strong: narrow objectives, lots of interested members who are real passionate.

Several people responded with good information, but I don't think I communicated  exactly what I am looking for.  I'm working on a custom I/O device that will communicate with a host via RS-232.  My custom circuitry will use an 80C186EB or EC CPU and require about 64K of RAM (preferably FLASH RAM).  In looking around, I see that lots of people have engineered UART-CPU-ROM-RAM subsystems that are ready to be interfaced to your custom I/O devices.  It's been done so much, that it  would be best if I can avoid reinventing a system.  It just needs to use an 80C186 (or 188) CPU, and be able to load a program from the host then  transfer control to that program.  Well, there's one other thing the ROM needs to know how to do.  It should have routines to send and receive bytes to/from the host, that utilize the hardware control lines (DTR,RTS,DTS,CTS). Everything I've seen is in the $200.00 and up range.  That's too much for this application.  I need something around $100.00.  The CPU has the UART built-in, so you're only looking at a few chips.  Does anyone know a  company that markets a good board in this range, or some public domain  circuitry I can use?

Certainly the people who use the population for cover are *also* to blaim for dragging the innocent civilians into harm's way.  Are you suggesting that, when guerillas use the population for cover, Israel should totally back down? So...the easiest way to get away with attacking another is to use an innocent as a shield and hope that the other respects innocent lives?   Your damn right Israel insists on some sort of \\\"demilitarized\\\" or \\\"buffer\\\" zone. Its had to put up with too many years of attacks from the territory of Arab states and watched as the states did nothing. It is not exactly surprizing that Israel decided that the only way to stop such actions is to  do it themselves.   What? So the whole bit about attacks on Israel from neighboring Arab states  can start all over again? While I also hope for this to happen, it will only occur WHEN Arab states show that they are *prepared* to take on the  responsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attacks on Israel from their  soil. They have to Prove it (or provide some \\\"guaratees\\\"), there is no way Israel is going to accept their \\\"word\\\"- not with their past attitude of  tolerance towards \\\"anti-Israel guerillas in-residence\\\".  Good lord, Brad. What in the world goves you the idea that UN troops stop anything? They are ONLY stationed in a country because that country allows them in. It can ask them to leave *at any time*; as Nasser did in '56 and '67. Somehow, with that \\\"limitation\\\" on the troops \\\"powers\\\" I don't think that Israel is going to be any more comfortable. Without a *genuine* commitment to peace from the Arab states, and concrete (not intellectual or political exercises in jargon) \\\"guarantees\\\" by other parties, the UN is worthless to Israel (but, perhaps useful as a \\\"ruse\\\"?).   Perhaps you are aware that, to most communities of people, there is the feeling that it is better that \\\"many of us die fighting against those who attack us than for few to die while we silently  accept our fate.\\\" If,however, you call on Israel to see the sense of  suffering fewer casualties, I suggest you apply the same to Palestinian, Arab and Islamic groups.   From Israel's perspective, \\\"concessions\\\" gets it NOTHING...except the  realization that it has given \\\"something\\\" up and now *can only  hope* that the other side decides to do likewise. Words *can be taken back* by merely doing so; to \\\"take back\\\" tangible items (land, control of land) requires the sort of action you say Israel should stay away from.   Israel put up with attacks from Arab state territories for decades  before essentially putting a stop to it through its invasion of Lebanon. The entire basis of that reality was exactly as you state above: 1) Israel  would express outrage at these attacks and protest to the Arab state  involved, 2) that state promptly ignored the entire matter, secure  in the knowledge that IT could not be held responsible for the acts  committed by \\\"private groups\\\", 3) Israel would prepare for the next  round of attacks. What would Israel want to return to those days (and don't be so idiotic as to suggest \\\"trust\\\" for the motivations of present-day Arab states)?  Ah, ok...what is \\\"different\\\" about the present situation that tells us that the Arab states will *not* pursue their past antagonistic  policies towards Israel? Now, don't talk about vague \\\"political factors\\\" but about those \\\"tangible\\\" (just like that which Israel gave up) factors that \\\"guarantee\\\" the responsibility of those states. Your assessment of \\\"difference\\\" here is based on a whole lot of assumptions, and most states don't feel confortable basing their existence on that sort of thing.   It has not. Without the support, and active involvement, of Syria, Lebanon would not have been able to accomplish all that has occurred. Once Syria leaves who is to say that Lebanon will be able to retain  control? If Syria stays thay may be even more dangerous for Israel.

In 1950, science fiction writer Robert Heinlein published \\\"The Man Who Sold the Moon,\\\" which involved a dispute over the sale of rights to the Moon for use as billboard.

Observers were startled this spring when a NASA launch vehicle arrived at the pad with \\\"SCHWARZENEGGER\\\" painted in huge block letters on the side of the booster rockets.  Space Marketing Inc. had arranged for the ad to promote Arnold's latest movie. Now, Space Marketing is working with University of Colorado and Livermore engineers on a plan to place a mile-long inflatable billboard in low-earth orbit.  NASA would provide contractual launch services. However, since NASA bases its charge on seriously flawed cost estimates (WN 26 Mar 93) the taxpayers would bear most of the expense. This may look like environmental vandalism, but Mike Lawson, CEO of Space Marketing, told us yesterday that the real purpose of the project is to help the environment!

Their cheer quickly turned into a roar, and finally, the sellout crowd of 17,816 rose as one to rock the old barn at 5700 Oakland Avenue in a salute to the playoff-bound Blues.  The scoreboard had just flashed the news from Detroit -- Red Wings 5, Stars 3. With the North Stars' loss, the Blues officially clinched fourth place and the final playoff spot in the Norris Division. Good thing, because the Blues quit playing.  They held a 5-1 lead over Tampa Bay when the Detroit-Minnesota final appeared with 3 minutes 52 remaining in the second period. They promptly went to sleep and barely held on for a 6-5 victory that nearly slipped away at the buzzer. Tampa's Bob Beers tipped in a pass from Shawn Chambers, but officiating supervisor John D'Amico and video goal judge Rich Schweigler ruled that the shot had gone into the net after time had expired.  ``I'm glad I didn't see it go in at the end,\\\" Blues coach Bob Berry said.  If the goal had counted, he'd have been more upset than he was by the Blues' disappearance in the final 24 minutes. Holding on for the victory and making the playoffs tempered Berry's anger.  ``It wasn't pretty at the end,\\\" he said. ``We played 36, 37 great minutes, as good as we played all year. It slipped away at the end. It shouldn't have, but it did.\\\"  Still, the Blues won, prompting another ovation from the crowd at game's end. Despite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil this season, the Blues still made the playoffs. They'll meet the Chicago Blackhawks in a best-of-seven Norris Division semifinal, beginning at noon Sunday at Chicago Stadium.  The Blues finished the regular-season with a record of 37-36-11 for 85 points, their fourth consecutive plus-.500 season. Minnesota finished three points behind in fifth place, with a record of 36-38- 10 for 82 points. Tampa Bay, which played spoiler last week by tying the Blues 2-2 at Tampa, ended its first season with a record of 23-54-7 for 53 points.  The poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyous Blues locker room. Instead, the mood was one of relief and some disappointment.  ``It's a shame we let down,\\\" said Kevin Miller, one of three Blues to score two goals. Brendan Shanahan and Bob Bassen were the others. ``There was no need for a letdown. If we'd have kept working, it would have ended 6-2 and everyone would be happy.\\\"  Instead, a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs. ``We won, and that's all that matters,\\\" said Brett Hull, scoreless and minus-3 for the night. ``Once we got up 4-0, it was really tough to play.\\\"  Some players didn't have a problem.  ``Just because the score was announced, our line didn't quit,\\\" said Rich Sutter, who played with Bassen and Miller. ``We still had a game to play. You can't allow five goals like we did, that's not right.  ``It was disappointing to see what was going on.\\\"  Bassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the Blues' effort. Somehow, he missed the announcement of Minnesota's loss.  ``I didn't know it was final,\\\" he said. ``I was kind of looking around on the bench. I didn't realize it was a final for some reason. We're in the playoffs, and that's great, but it's a little disappointing to play like we did at the end.\\\"  The letdown was precisely the reason that Berry had instructed the scoreboard operators to keep the Minnesota-Detroit score off of the board. The score showed 0-0 until it first popped up with Detroit leading 4-2 in the third period. The Blues already led 4-0 at the time.  ``I told them I didn't want to see the score, I didn't want to know the score,\\\" Berry said. ``I felt we had to win the game, and that's the approach we took.\\\"  If Minnesota took a lead, Berry feared, the pressure of having to win might bother the Blues. If Detroit led, he worried, the Blues might quit.  Until the announcement, the Blues played splendidly. Shanahan got the crowd going at 10:44 of the first period, scoring his 50th of the season. Then, Miller and Bassen took charge late in the period.  With the teams playing four on four, Miller broke in on left wing, deked defenseman Roman Hamrlik and beat former Blues goalie Pat Jablonski with the rebound of his own shot with 21.6 seconds remaining in the period.  Then, just 10.5 seconds later, Bassen rifled a long slap shot past Jablonski after defenseman Rick Zombo intercepted a Tampa pass in the neutral zone.  Bassen made it 4-0 just 14 seconds into the second period, scoring on the  rebound of Bret Hedican's shot. The goal gave him his first two-goal game of the season and reminded him of a special friend.  Last year, Bassen befriended young Oliver Mulvihill, who died of a rare form of cancer at age 6 on Feb. 23.  ``I was thinking of my buddy Oliver,\\\" Bassen said. ``He's in heaven now, and I know he was watching. I know he's happy.\\\"  Miller increased the Blues lead to 5-0 on a break-away goal set up by Zombo at 11:09. Then, Steve Maltais broke Curtis Joseph's shutout just 18 seconds later, making it 5-1.  Less than a minute after the North Stars' final was announced, Tim Bergland scored and cut the lead to 5-2. But Shanahan scored his 51st, converting a pass from Nelson Emerson with 21.3 seconds remaining in the  second period.  Then, it was all Lightning. Adam Creighton scored 40 seconds into the third period, prompting Berry to rest the overworked Joseph. Guy Hebert allowed goals to Shawn Chambers and Danton Cole in a span of 1:21 midway through the third period.  The goals by Chambers and Cole made Shanahan's second goal stand up as the winner. ``We were in there,\\\" Shanahan said. ``The game was over. We were in.\\\"\",\" Recommended for what, DOS?

The estimated population  of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were  Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem.  Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third  of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the   Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan  uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians  as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,  however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the  guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000  inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character   notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian   Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the   southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.\\\"   (See also Map 1.

Our troops surrounded village after village.   Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts   into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable   and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets   completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They   found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border   into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole   length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to   Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain   plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of   Tartar villages. They are quiet now, those villages, except for   howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the   scattered bones of the dead.\\\"                                Ohanus Appressian                             \\\"Men Are Like That\\\"                                    p. 202.

You are merely expressing \\\"approval\\\" of the consequences I find therein. Which says more about our politics and cultural trappings than about my (or any) religion.  \\\"Love\\\" is a highly ambiguous word, of which Christians can write both the \\\"gentle\\\" words Paul uses of it in 1 Corinthians -- in a passage that even the \\\"conservatives\\\" will quote at you :-) -- and the words of T. S. Eliot in his Pentacost Hymn, \\\"Love is the unfamiliar Name that wove the intolerable shirt of flame ...\\\"  This is in any case rather to the side of what I was attempting to raise in my note, as will become more evident below.   blechhh.  I think you are misreading me, rather seriously.  Though, given my principle that one CANNOT force one's own notion of \\\"sin\\\" on another, and my unshakeable \\\"disestablishmentarianism\\\", Russel Turpin and others (believers and unbelievers alike) are under no threat of my legislating my own understanding of Christian love.   You misread.  I can do (and have repeatedly done) a complete bill of accusation against the Inquisition by exhibiting in as thorough a form as anyone might want a demonstration of the harm it has done to human beings (in the first place) and to respect for (let alone love of) \\\"God\\\" in near succession.  Please go back to my quoted words above:  The \\\"possibility that always exists\\\" is that I (or, to revert to proper time sequence, my predecessors over the last several centuries) could persuade \\\"Christian B\\\" of my case that the Inquisition *does* indeed constitute an egregious violation of the Law of Love.  I must also note that the majority of Christians HAVE been so persuaded.  By Christian argumentation, as well as by secular [both Christian and non-Christian] prohibitions.  What Mr. Turpin alludes to is a trickier point:   A.  I demonstrate the human pain and violation of love involved      in the Inquisition.   B.  The Inquisitor responds that Mother Church must, however      painful this *seems*, \\\"discipline\\\" her children for their      own good -- in this case the salvation of their souls (or      if the tortured heretic will not recant, than by bad example      \\\"deterring\\\" others from the same loss-of-soul.)   A.  I point out that this \\\"justification\\\" of a failure in love      depends on a highly speculative construal of texts and of      philosophical assertions that are quite undemonstrable.   B.  Burns me at the stake.  My rhetoric has failed, but the point I am making is sustained.  What is going on here has a *lot* to do with \\\"cultural baggage.\\\"  In this case, the baggage includes a (nearly universal, and absolutely secular) belief that an accused person must prove innocence and that testimony is most believable if taken under torture.  The elimination of Inqisitorial practice (in those places where it *has* been eliminated, or at least greatly reduced) has very little, if anything, to do with the discussion of sin in the exchange between A and B.  Mr. Turpin is pointing out that, if I am A versus the Grand Inquisitor's B, then my persuasion is not very likely to work.  I know this; and in what- ever personal agony, I consign the issue to God and my ghostly defense attorney.  So, \\\"one possibility\\\" fails in this case -- as it will fail in may others.  At the other extreme, the \\\"persuasion\\\" will succeed when it properly SHOULD not, if it entails mistaken assumptions I share with the Inquisitor.  And that is potentially an even more troubling case, in that many of the victims of Inquisition will have \\\"accepted\\\" that they were in fact sinful (in such random cases as they may actually have been guilty of charges brought against them.)  The point is that the \\\"persuasion\\\" breaks down when the parties do NOT share enough to agree on all the cultural baggage -- and given the main thrust of the Inquisition, against \\\"heresy\\\", it is *bound* to break down in precisely the \\\"worst\\\" cases.  The \\\"conservative\\\" (I don't think that is the right word, BTW) will take refuge in what I attribute to B above, that he is \\\"justified\\\" in causing harm because he *thinks* that works to a \\\"greater good.\\\"  But this is a violent and extravagant REFUSAL to follow the gospel, as if one's theories about \\\"sin\\\" entitled one to cast aside Jesus' words on dealing with sinners (cf. Matthew 5:39ff).  I am a \\\"radical\\\" Christian *only* in that I take the gospel seriously.   Well, the whole *point* of making these the \\\"base\\\" commandments is that they *aren't* reducible to rules.  A set of rules is a moral code or a law code or an algorithm for acting.  Such things can be very helpful to individuals or societies -- but not if they are used *instead* of a personal involvement in and responsibility for one's actions.  The Great Commandment is, more than anything else, a call to act *as if you were God and accepting ultimate responsibility* in your every action.  A demand that I, like most, would rather *not* hear, but it keeps popping up nonetheless (along with the reassurance that it is more important that I be open to trying this, than succeeding at it).  \\\"Conservatives\\\" may twist this \\\"act as if you were God\\\" to mean \\\"lay down rules for other people and be as nasty to them as possible if they don't keep YOUR rules.\\\" They are so insistent (and obvious) about this that they have convinced a lot of people (who rightly reject the whole concept!) that such idiocy IS how God acts.  That, after all, is the standard accusation \\\"against God\\\" by the atheists here and elsewhere.  That the \\\"conservatives\\\" have confused THEIR manipulative, hoop-jumping notions of coercing other people with the Nature of God is almost the entire content of standard American atheism -- and I quite agree with it on this point.   And different bodies of Christians have, from the beginning, urged *different* \\\"ethical systems\\\" (or in some cases, none).  As a result, it is bizarre to identify any one of these systems, however popular (or infamous) with Christianity.  Christianity DOES NOT HAVE A TORAH. It does not have a QU'RAN.  Specifically Christian scripture has very little, if anything, in the way of \\\"commandments\\\" -- so little that the \\\"Christians\\\" who desperately *want* commandments go \\\"mining\\\" for them with almost no support (and thus almost no obvious limitation :-)) for their efforts.  The one, single, thing in the gospels which Jesus specifically \\\"gives\\\" as \\\"a commandment\\\" to us is \\\"love one another.\\\"   [I will be expanding on this point in a reply to Paul Hudson   that I hope to get to in a day or so -- it is quite true that   SOME Christians infer LOTS of commandments from the NT; I'll   point out what has to be going on in these inferences, and why   there is a huge amount of \\\"cultural baggage\\\" involved.]  You are quite right that this is \\\"goo\\\" if one is looking for an ethical system.  But why should anyone BE looking for an ethical system, since our society is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do?  It may be that we need a principle for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems -- in which case I will profer the _agapate allelou_ once again.   I think you are begging the question. Why don't I and the (myriads of) other Christians like me tell you something about Christianity? [Nor is this very new in Christianity -- you might want to look up the origins and fundamental doctrines of the Quakers, from the 17th century onwards, and they are not at all the first to understand the gospel in a manner that is congenial to my case.]\",\" Sounds a lot more like an Opel GT to me.

Apologies to regular t.a folks.    You must be using 'values' to mean something different from the way I see it used normally.  And you are certainly using 'Science' like that if you equate it to \\\"the real world\\\".  Science is the recognition of patterns in our perceptions of the Universe and the making of qualitative and quantitative predictions concerning those perceptions.  It has nothing to do with values as far as I can see. Values are ... well they are what I value. They are what I would have rather than not have - what I would experience rather than not, and so on.  Objective values are a set of values which the proposer believes are applicable to everyone.   I don't agree. Science is useful insofar as it the predictions mentioned above are accurate.  That is insofar as what I think *will be* the effect on my perceptions of a time lapse (with or without my input to the Universe) versus what my perceptions actually turn out to be.  But values are about whether I like (in the loosest sense of the word) the  perceptions :-)   I don't see why. 'Usefulness' in science is synonomous with 'accuracy' - period. Tarot predictions are not useful because they are not accurate - or can't be shown to be accurate. Science is useful because it is apparently accurate.

We'd like to sit down and ask for it. By all means, lands and properties were taken away from us and they should be returned to the rightful owners, the Turkish and Kurdish  people, who were there 3,000 years, long before the Armenians ever showed up in that area. Entire population of the region was subjected  to genocide beyond belief; genocide which was planned to exterminate  the whole Turkish people of the region to the last man, woman and child.  Armenians tortured and massacred millions of defenseless civilians. To  assemble innocent civilians in the mosques and burn them in the buildings  was one of their methods. Even today the traveler in that region is seldom  free from the evidence of these Armenian crimes.

Strictly, a 1 of 4 decoder need only take two lines in and make one output change state, according to the inputs.  A demux, on the other hand, uses two control inputs to determine which of four outputs will reflect the state of the input signal. So there are three inputs required.  A decoder can be used as a demux if it is equipped with an output enable input, since this can be used as the data input (e.g. when high, all outputs are high; when low, only the selected (by control inputs) output will be low).  An eight way decoder is created by using the high order bit (bit 2) to select which of two four way demuxes is enabled. Thus you achieve your aim of having only one output of eight reflecting the input bits. Note that this method cannot be used to create a true eight way demux, since you have no data input (the enable line on a four way decoder) left once you commit the enable lines to their intended purpose.  A sixteen way decoder obviously requires four, four-way decoders, plus a mechanism to enable only one of the four at a time. Therefore, use the fifth decoder, attached to the two high order bits, to provide the four enable lines.  Of course, the two low order bits must be connected in parallel to the four final stage decoders.  Please give me the credit when you submit your homework.

Unless the law has been changed recently, carrying a weapon openly is legal in Colorado but concealing it is illegal. I read a newspaper account last year where police stopped a car on a traffic infraction and observed a .357 magnum revolver sitting on the seat.  The driver could not be cited for possessing or carrying the weapon because it was not concealed.  The article stated that if the gun had been discovered in the glove box, it would have been considered a crime. \",\"  This is probably the best part of your post.  Everything else is shrill speculation.\",\" Hmmmmm you know this happened to me also. I am not sure what caused it.  I think there might have been a system error and dumped windows.  I came back and all was well except no groups. Program Manager was EMPTY.  All the .grp files were in the directory.  I had to remake the groups with the new and group selection.  ALL THE ICONS AND FILES INSIDE THE GROUPS WERE STILL THERE AND WORKING FINE.  Just the groups had gone out of program manager.  Strange !!!!

For example, Why couldn't Magellan just be told to go into a \\\"safe\\\" mode and stay bobbing about Venus in a low-power-use mode and if maybe in a few years if funding gets restored after the economy gets better (hopefully), it could be turned on again.    For that matter, why exactly were the Apollo lunar experiments \\\"turned off\\\" rather than just \\\"safed\\\".  Was it political (i.e. as along as they could be used, someone would keep bugging congress for funds)?  Turning them off keeps them pesky scientists out of the bureaucrat's hair....    I've heard the argument that an active but \\\"uncontrolled\\\" spacecraft causes \\\"radio noise.\\\"  I find that hard to believe that this could be a problem in a properly designed \\\"safe\\\" mode. This safe mode could be a program routine which causes the spacecraft to go to least fuel using orientation, and once a (week, month, year, whatever) attempts a signal lock on Earth. At that time, if funding has been restored, the mission can continue.  If no signal is recieved, the spacecraft goes back to the safe mode for another time period. As we would know when the spacecraft is going to try to contact Earth, we could be prepared if necessary.    As another a spacecraft could do at the attempted contact is beam stored data towards Earth.  If someone can receive it, great, if not, so it's lost and no big deal. By making the time and signal location generally known, perhaps someone in the world might be able and willing to intercept the data even if they're not willing to contact the spacecraft.  I see this as being particularly useful for spacecraft which could have an otherwise long life and are in or are going to places which are otherwise unaccessible (Jupiter/Saturn Orbit, exiting the solar system, etc).     Perhaps those designing future spacecraft (Cassini, Pluto Flyby, etc) should consider designing in a \\\"pause\\\" mode in case their spacecraft gets the ax sometime in the future after completion of the primary mission. Perhaps Mars Observer and Galilleo could have some kind of routine written in for the post mission \\\"drift\\\" phase.  So any holes in all this? \",\"Recently while looking around in Traders Sporting Goods store, a very well stocked firearms store, I discovered a printed document that was being  distributed by the good folks who work there.

The newspapers have now decided to censor gun ads - which is why you no longer see the ads that Traders, San Leandro, has run for many years.  These ads were run for the law-abiding honest citizens who own firearms for sporting use or self-protection.  They certainly have the right to do so, under the Second Amendment Right to Bear Arms.

EDT              Q   Mr. President, what do you think of Jesse Jackson's  protest today?              THE PRESIDENT:  I think it's an informational protest.   I think it's fine.  The owners put out a statement few days ago,  which they say was the first step in, you know, efforts to increase  minority ownership and minority increases in management.  I think we  should.  I'm encouraged by Don Baylor's appointment out in Colorado.   And I think it's time to make a move on that front.  So, I think it's  a legitimate issue, and I think it's -- like I said, it's an  informational picket and not an attempt to get people not to go to  the game.  So, I think it's good.              Q   Do you think they're moving fast enough?              THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think that it was a good first  step.  And I think you'll see some movement now.  And I think it's an  issue that deserves some attention, and they're obviously going to  give it some.  And I think that Reverend Jackson being out there will  highlight the issue.  So I think it's fine.              Q   Mr. President, how about the logjam in the Senate  on the economic stimulus plan?  Do you think they'll be able to break  that and get cloture?              THE PRESIDENT:  I don't know, we're working at it.  I  mean, it's a classic -- there was an article in the paper today, one  of the papers I saw, which pretty well summed it up.  They said, you  know, this is a -- it's just a political power play.  In the Senate  the majority does not rule.  It's not like the country.  It's not  like the -- it's not like the House.  If the minority chooses, they  can stop majority rule.  And that's what they're doing.  There are a  lot of Republican senators who have told people that they might vote  for the stimulus program but there's enormous partisan political  pressure not to do it.                And, of course, what it means is that in this time when  no new jobs are being created, even though there seems to be an  economic recovery, it means that for political purposes they're  willing to deny jobs to places like Baltimore and Dallas and Houston  and Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and Portland and Seattle.  It's very  sad.  I mean, the block grant program was designed to create jobs in  a hurry based on local priorities, and it's one that the Republicans  had always championed.  Just about the only Democrat champions of the  program were people like me who were out there at the grassroots  level, governors and senators.  I just think it's real sad that they  have chosen to exert the minority muscle in a way that will keep  Americans out of work.  I think it's a mistake.

H. Welbon)]         For many atheists, the lack of belief in gods is secondary to an epistemological consideration:  what do we accept as a reliable way of knowing?  There are no known valid logical arguments for the existence of gods, nor is there any empirical evidence that they exist.  Most philosophers and theologians agree that the idea of a god is one that must be accepted on faith.  Faith is belief without a sound logical basis or empirical evidence.  It is a reliable way of knowing?   There is probably nothing else most people would accept in the absence of any possibility of proof.  Even when we agree to take someone elses word \\\"on faith\\\", we just mean that having found this person to be reliable in the past, we judge him likely to be a reliable source now. If we find faith less reliable than logic and empirical evidence everywhere else, why assume it will provide reliable knowledge about gods?   The difference between the atheist and the theist is fundamentally then one of whether or not faith is held to be a reliable way of knowing, rather than, as some agnostic posters would have it, whether ones faith is in gods or no gods.  The theist believes that faith is an acceptable basis for a belief in gods, even if he rejects faith as reliable at other times, for example in his work as a scientist.  The atheist believes that only logic and empirical evidence lead to reliable knowledge.  Agnosticism seems to me a less defensible position than theism or atheism, unless one is a sceptic in regards to all other knowledge.  Without evidence, why should we believe in gods rather than Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny?   I would also like to point out as others have that the atheist doesn't require absolute knowledge of the lack of gods.  I don't believe that there is any such thing as absolute knowledge.  Atheism is the best and simplest theory to fit the (lack of) facts and so should be held until contrary evidence is found.\",\"I was wondering if anyone types in the box scores each day.

The husband is usually physically  stronger than his wife but is not permitted to use this to dominate her.   He must honor her as his sister in Christ.  This would therefore be an  example of a specific sin that blocks prayer.  This verse also makes me think of the kind of husband who decides what  is God's will for his family without consulting his wife.  God reveals  His will to both the husband and the wife.  There needs to be some  degree of mutuality in decision making.  Even those whose understanding  of the Bible leads to a belief in an authoritarian headship of the  husband need to incorporate this in order to have a functional family.   One way to look at it is that God speaks to the wife through the husband  and to the husband through the wife. \",\" Probably because everyone (that is, everyone who has cable) can watch every Braves game.

I was wondering: although a DX-50 is faster because of the path to it's external cache, shouldn't the choice be the DX2-50 as that one can be made to work properly with a local-bus? I mean, cache speed is one thing, but all your speed will be blocked during video I/O, so just get that faster...  I'm willing to speculate that the DX2-50 with local-bus will be 2-4 times  as fast as the DX-50 and probably as expensive (or cheap ;-)!\",\"there is a file out there (look for it with archie) that is called 'theref22.zip' which has lots of info on various PC things, amongst which is also a detailed description of all Floppy controller commands, I think hard drive controller commands are not there.  it is possible to read an entire track including all gaps, sector headers etc.   by setting sector size to something very large (like 8K).\",\"I'm in the market for a laser printer. Used printers are fine, non-apple printers are fine, but whatever printer I get must fit the following:  Required features:  - PostScript  - 300 dpi  - emough memory to download fonts  - The cheaper, the better.  I'd prefer under $1000.   Nice things:  - anything over 4 pages per minute  - scsi output for a font disk  - smallish footprint    Don't Care About:  - PostScript Level II  - networking (its just for me, and always will be)  - color   I know about Freedom of Press, but I've also heard that its painfully slow. I can tolerate about 4 ppm, but anything slower than that and I'm not going to consider the price savings worth it.  I'd be curious to hear people's experience with it, tho.   I also infinitely prefer laser over ink; I used to use HP deskjets in my last job and wasn't impressed with the quality.  I'm a laser bigot and the first to admit it. :)   I'll be using the printer to layout pages of a book I'm writing.  The page will include multiple fonts, PS graphics, scanned line art and maybe greyscale pictures (not sure yet).  The quality doesn't need to be spectacular, but it needs to be clear and readable.   Printers I've been looking at:   - used LaserWriters: The plus, the NT, the NTR.  Its my understanding that   only the NTR has a SCSI out for a disk. True?  - Personal LaserWriter (LS and NTR).  I have access to the Apple Employee   discount (I work for one of Apple's spinoffs), so I can get these reasonably   cheaply.  I've heard bad things about the LS; comments?  I'm leaning   towards the Personal NTR, cause it has a nice small footprint.  - LaserWriter Select 300.  I hear it doesn't have PostScript, but I haven't   seen anything for sure.  I heard mumbles once about a \\\"postscript upgrade.\\\"   ??  - Used HP LaserJets.  I've worked with the II and IIP on another platform, and   they were *painfully* slow.  Are they that bad on the mac?  - I've seen ads for an Epson PS laserprinter that is running quite cheap.   Any comments on this printer?  I hate the styling (too many ouput trays),   but if its a decent printer I'll consider it.

Juan Carlos Leon    \",\"   The word that is missing in this whole discourse is not the \\\"B\\\" word, or the \\\"H\\\" word, or even the \\\"N\\\" or \\\"W\\\" words. It is the \\\"L\\\" word - LOSER !!   That's right. When we boil all the crap out of this argument, it is all about WINNING and LOSING, and nothing else. Let me explain.   Remember the eighties ? No excuses. Nobody who can handle a mail buffer can claim they are \\\"too young\\\" to remember Ronald Reagan - yet. The eighties were about \\\"How America Learned to Win Once Again\\\". Then (wouldn't you know), we won so well that there was nothing left to win. No Cold War to endure. No nuclear holocaust. No more worlds to conquer (We forgot about outer space long ago). The kind of overwhelming, no holds barred success that killed Alexander the Great. Yes, there were a few \\\"little\\\" problems along the way - stock market meltdown here, an S&L bailout there, a few revolts and crazy Middle Eastern dictators to contend with, but as Tacitus would tell ya', the God Augustus never had it so good.    In the meantime, there is guilt for winning, maybe a fear that one doesn't deserve one's bounty - or success. So there is a \\\"kinder and gentler type of politician these days, Bill Clinton, affirmative action, and lots of discourse about people who \\\"don't get it\\\". For those of us in the winning business, this kind of talk is mildly irritating, but there is still no  suggestion of losing.   But what do we find now ? To put it mildy, the stereotype of our  \\\"white male\\\" non-winner is Woody Hayes in the Rose Bowl, punching out  photojournalists when those California fruits and nuts steal another one with a \\\"Hail Mary\\\" pass in the Fourth Quarter. (The whole idea behind 'three yards and a cloud of dust' is to wear your opponent down until he collapses in the final period) But Woody just used his fists - Uzzies seem to be the  weapon of choice these days.     Who is D-FENS, anyway ? The answer is as plain as the horn rims on  your face. The guy is MICHAEL DOUGLAS, posing as a LOSER. This  is known as controversial casting. But that baggy short-sleeved white shirt  sure does look natural on Mike doesn't it. Gordon Gekko will never look the  same. (Though Woody always dressed that way.) Did we really expect Gekko to  take it easy and enjoy that kind of wardrobe, without putting up a fuss ?   What we are starting to lose sight of is, that bashing D-FENS is  the same game as bashing that poor African American slug that Clint Eastwood used to blow away all the time. As that arch-WASP (male gender) George C. Scott declaimed, \\\"Americans traditionally LOVE TO WIN. They love a winner, and will  not tolerate a loser.\\\" And so on.    The political implications are simple. If, as many socialists - and Democrats - do, you consider society a finite pie to a apportioned in some  \\\"equitable\\\" way, then you have to worry about who is a winner and who is a  loser to tell whose side you are on. That could be black women today, Asian homosexuals tommorrow, and yes indeed, white men some yet to be determined day when the balance of the pie has finally swung against that (39%)  minority.   Or you can just blow the whole thing off and say - as do most conservatives and all the libertarians - and act is if you didn't care who's winning and who's losing. In some cases, you might say something about make sure the game is fair (equality of opportunity, not of condition). In the latter case, you might be able to identify yourself as a  \\\"neoconservative\\\" or a \\\"neoliberal\\\" depending on how much you want to limit the pot.   Either way you go, the way of the Winner is no longer the way to be popular - at least after you graduate from High School (but you'll still be popular at High School reunions). But it beats being a Nerd, as I  would imagine Michael Douglas would now agree, and in the long run, it is the only way to go. (Even in Hollywood, which treats Losers worse than any other place in America except for New York and Washington, D.C. - and even in Columbus, Ohio, which produced Alex Keaton, but no champion football teams in the eighties and the first quarter of the nineties) I'd like to  see more Winners in this society, regardless of race, gender, religious  preference, and sexual orientation. Maybe we should even let a few more of  them be white men !!

Basically, stupidity will get you hurt/killed a lot faster on a motorcycle than in a car.  But with care, it is not unreasonably dangerous.  Also, buying good protective clothing is helpful, that way if something does go wrong, you are likely to be less severely injured.  First thing, if possible take a (MSF) driver training course, this will get you started on the right foot -- they teach control of the vehicle and safe riding practices.  Second, buy protective gear.  At minimum a good helmet and a pair of leather gloves are a must.  A good sturdy  piece of footgear is also very helpful, though leather hiking boots, a pair of old army boots, or something similar works fine for this purpose as long as you make sure the laces stay  tied.  After those, a leather jacket and leather pants or chaps are nice as well; but these are also expensive items.  For the pants, many people consider a good pair of jeans to be reasonable, preferably recent and of a fairly heavy weight.  Similarly for a jacket, a good jean jacket is a reasonable compromise, though more people tend to have leather jackets around than pants.  Another thing to do is drop in on garage sales looking for a second-hand leather jacket.  Look for a fairly thick leather in these items.  Third don't do anything stupid -- don't ride after  drinking, even one drink can noticeably affect you judgement and balance; don't ride in the snow, or when conditions are such that black ice is likely; be very careful riding in the rain -- slow way down, take corners gingerly,  brake early and gently;  try not to ride if you are sick, tired, taking any medication with drowsiness warnings, or otherwise not in average shape.  With care, you should be ok.   I would suggest mid to late 80's japanese mid-sized standard. Something in 400-650 cc range would probably be reasonable.  If you are shorter/lighter than average, you might want to go as low as a 300-400 cc bike.  Possible models:  The Suzuki GS### series (eg. GS500, GS650, etc.).  These are generally inline 4 bikes, generally dependable except for a tendency to  weakness in the charging system.  (Stator and/or Regulator/Rectifier  problems.)  My first bike was a (about '82) GS650, it server me well.  The Honda Nighthawk series (this may also be known as the CB### series I think).  eg. Honda CB450, CB650, etc.  This is another series of standard motorcycles.  Also fairly dependable.  Kawasaki and Yamaha probably have similar bikes, but I don't know them as well.  For mid to late '80s models of the above, you should be able to buy the bike for under $2000, leaving you money for protective  clothing and insurance and licensing costs.\",\"-| I just installed a Motorola XC68882RC50 FPU in an Amiga A2630 board (25 MHz -| 68030 + 68882 with capability to clock the FPU separately).

A:  In the US, currently Virgina and the District of Columbia prohibit     all usage of radar detectors.  New York prohibits their use in     large trucks.  In Canada, they are illegal in Manitoba, Ontario,     Quebec, Newfoundland and PEI (Prince Edward Island).  They     are apparently are illegal through most, if not all, of Europe.     Legislation which would make them illegal is pending in many other     jurisdictions; chances of such legislation passing varies a great deal.  Q:  Where are Radar Detector Detectors used?  Do they really work?  A:  Usage is spreading rapidly; initially they were used only in Canada,     but now they are appearing in New York and Virginia.  It is unsafe     to assume that they are not in use in Connecticut and D.C.     They work by detecting a certain frequency radiated by many currently     available super Het radar detectors; some brands of detector radiate     more strongly than others, and are thus more likely to be spotted.     New radar detectors are becoming available which may not be detected     by the current generation of detector detectors.  Note that a     detector may only be spotted by one of these devices if it is turned     on.  Q:  What is VASCAR?  Is it some kind of Radar?  A:  VASCAR is nothing more than a fancy stopwatch and time-speed-distance     computer.  It depends on the operator pressing buttons as the target     vehicle passes landmarks.  No radar signals are emitted by a VASCAR     system.  Q:  What is Ka band radar?  Where is it used?  Should a radar detector be     able to handle it?   A:  Ka band has recently been made available by the FCC for use in the US     in so-called photo-radar installations.  In these installations, a     low-powered beam is aimed across the road at a 45 degree angle to the     direction of traffic, and a picture is taken of vehicles which the     radar unit determines to have been in violation of the speed limit.     Tickets are mailed to the owner of the vehicle.  Because of the low     power and the 45 degree angle, many people believe that a radar     detector cannot give reasonable warning of a Ka band radar unit,     although some manufacturers of radar detectors have added such     capability anyway.  The number of locales where photo-radar is in use     is limited, and some question the legality of such units.  Best advice:     learn what photo radar units look like, and keep track of where they     are used (or else, don't speed.)  Q:  Do radar jammers work?  Are they legal?  A:  Quick answer:  No, and Not in the USA.     Detailed answer:  Cheap radar jammers do not work well at all.     Jammers that work are expensive and usually the property of the     military.  Jammers are a major violation of the regulations of the     Federal Communications Commission of the USA.  Driving technique and Vehicle Dynamics Questions:  Q:  What are understeer and oversteer?  A:  Understeer and oversteer are terms describing the behaviour of a     car while cornering near the `limit' (limit of adhesion, that is.)     Most drivers do not normally drive hard enough for these terms to     be descriptive of the situations they encounter.  Simply put, they     tell whether the car wants to go straight in a corner (steer `less',     or `understeer') or it wants to turn more in a corner (`oversteer'.)     Understeer is commonly designed into most production cars so that     untrained drivers, inadvertantly traveling too fast, won't get into     trouble.  Understeer may also be induced by using too much throttle     in a corner.  Oversteer is designed into some more performance     oriented cars; it may be induced by lifting on the throttle (Trailing     throttle oversteer, or TTO).  In extreme cases, lifting on the throttle     may induce so much oversteer that the car reacts by fishtailing or     spinning.      Some technical details:  in a corner at speed, the tires on the car     will develop what are called `slip angles'; the slip angle is the     angular difference between the direction that the car is traveling     and the direction that the steering wheel is directing the car to     travel.  In understeer, the front wheels have a greater slip angle     than the rear wheels.  In oversteer, the rear wheels have a greater     slip angle than the front wheels.  Q: What is a rev-matched downshift?  A: When downshifting, the engine must be rotating faster in the lower gear    than it was in the higher gear.  However, during a downshift, normally    you declutch and lift your foot from the throttle, so the revs drop    rather than increase.  In rev-matched downshift, you blip the throttle    before re-engaging the clutch so that the engine will already be up to    the new speed.  This results in a much smoother and faster downshift.  Q: What does heel-and-toe mean?  A: Heel-and-toe is a technique used to do a rev-matched downshift while    braking.  This is normally challenging, because you need the right foot    for both the brake and throttle.  It is called heel-and-toe because you    use one end of the foot on the brake, and the other on the throttle to    match revs for the downshift.  In many modern cars this is a misnomer;    often you must use the ball of the foot on the brake and the right side    on the throttle.     Note that some race car drivers will skip the clutch, and just use the    left foot on the brake and the right foot on the throttle, accomplishing    the same thing.  Q: What is double-clutch downshifting?  A: While your right foot is doing the above, your left foot can do one of    three things:  nothing, declutch once, or declutch twice.  The reason for    declutching twice is to match the speeds of the two shafts in the    transmission to the speed of the engine.  This is usually coupled with    rev-matching, so that while the engine is in neutral and the clutch    engaged, the throttle is blipped and both shafts of the transmission    speed up.     The procedure is as follows:    (0) declutch    (1) move gearshift lever to neutral    (2) engage clutch    (3) match revs    (4) declutch    (5) move gearshift lever to next lower gear    (6) engage clutch     This sounds like a lot of work, but with practice it becomes natural.    The problem that double-clutching solves is normally the function of the    synchronizers within the gearbox.  In transmissions without synchros or    with very worn synchros, double-clutching makes it much easier to shift.    Basically, if you double-clutch well, you are not using the synchros at    all.  This is generally unnecessary on street cars with synchros in good    condition.  Q: What do the numbers for acceleration from 0-60, 1/4 mile, skidpad, and    slalom times in the Auto Magazines really mean?  May they be compared?  A: In short, 1) not as much as the magazines want you to believe, and    2) almost never.     In more detail:  the acceleration numbers (0-60mph and 1/4 mile times    in the US) may be vaguely compared as long as they all come from the    same source.  Testing procedures vary so much from magazine to magazine    that comparing a Road & Track number to a Car & Driver number is quite    pointless.  Keep in mind, too, that the same variation applies from    driver to driver on the street; the driver is a major (often *the*    major) part of the equation.     Skidpads vary, and even if they didn't, skidpad figures are really    only tests of the stickiness of the stock tires; they change radically    when tire compounds change.  DO NOT make any assumptions about the    comparative handling of, say, two sports sedans based on skidpad numbers.    This is not to suggest that skidpads are without value, however. Skidpads    are an excellent educational tool at driving schools.  They are simply    of limited value in the comparison of anything except tires.     Slalom times are slightly more useful; they test some small parts of the    automobile's transient response.  However, they are also heavily influenced    by the stock rubber on the car, and they do not test many corners of the    car's envelope.  They DO NOT tell you all you need to know before making    a buying decision.  For example, they don't tell you what the rear end    of the car will do on a road which suddenly goes off-camber.  When a car    has an adjustable suspension, these tests are usually done in the `sport'    setting, which may be quite unsuitable for daily driving.  The list of    caveats could go on for page after page.  Q: My buddy claims that wide tires don't make any difference, according    to his freshman physics textbook, and that you can't ever accelerate    or corner at more than 1.0G.  Does he know what he's talking about?  A: 1) in short:  he hasn't got a clue.     2) in more detail: the equations for friction used in freshman physics    textbooks presume that the surfaces are smooth,  dry and non-deformable,    none of which properly apply to tire traction except in the case of a    stone cold tire on dry pavement which is far below its proper operating    temperature.     Pavement is _never_ smooth; it is always irregular to a greater or lesser    extent.  Tires, which are not really dry and solid (as rubber is a    substance which in its natural form is liquid, and which has only been    coerced into a semblance of solidity by chemical magic), deform to match    the surface of the pavement which a vehicle is traveling over.  In a tire    at operating temperature, grip is actually generated by shear stresses    inside the deformed rubber, and not by anything even remotely resembling    friction in the freshman physics sense of the term.  The colder a tire    is relative to its operating temperature, the closer its behaviour will    be to the traditional concept of friction; if much hotter than the its    proper operating temperature, the more likely the possibility of some    part of the tire actually ``reverting'' to liquid, which is mostly like    to happen deep in the tread, causing characteristic blisters and chunking.    (This latter, though, is almost completely unlikely to happen in normal    street driving, so unless you're a competition driver or do a lot of    high speed track driving, don't worry about it.)     Because tire traction is completely out of the domain of simple friction,    it does not obey the freshman physics equation at all; thus dragsters    accelerate at more than 1.0G and race cars corner and brake at more than    1.0G.  Because simple friction does not apply, it is actually possible    for different sized contact patches to generate differing amounts of    grip.  An actual analysis of tire behavior would require techniques    such as Finite Element Analysis, due to the complexity of the mechanism.  Misc. Questions:  Q:  What does <name or acronym> stand for?

In particular, NEVER     ask in rec.humor if you want a useful result.      Saab:   Svenska Aeroplan A.

A:  No.  Porsche is a publicly held company, controlled by the Porsche and     Piech families.  Porsche has extensive business dealings with VW/Audi,     which causes some confusion.  Since currently Porsche is in some     financial difficulty, there is a possibility that Mercedes or VW may     be interested in purchasing the company in the near future, but this     is only speculation at this time.\",\"     The Olds Supreme Convertible got high marks in C/D's recent test, if you can get by the stupid body moldings and stuff.

Nazi Armenians were of service  to Germans in Arab countries as well. As Uzun put it, one well-known  case which received a lot of media-coverage involved two Nazi Armenian  agents which were dropped over Syria by Italian war planes. The mission  of the agents was to mingle among the Armenian population in Syria and  to acquire relevant information for the German Wehrmacht on the allied  forces in the area.[1] Nazi Armenians also helped German propaganda  efforts in Arab countries designed to promote pro-Nazi sentiments among  the French- and British-ruled Arab populations. Beirut had traditionally been strong-hold of the Nazi Armenians and until very recently it was the center of international Armenian terrorism.   In Russia General Dro (the Butcher), the architect of the Turkish genocide in WWI, was working closely with the German Secret  Service. He entered the war zone with his own men and acquired important intelligence about the Soviets. His experience with the Turkish genocide in x-Soviet Armenia made him an invaluable  source for the Germans.[2]  [1] Meyer, Berkian, ibid., p. 150.

Dec. 1989  Leading Israeli author and cultural commentator, A.B. Yehoshua, launched a ferocious attack on diaspora Jewry at a Zionist Youth Council meeting in North London, last week.  The diaspora, he claimed, \\\"was the cancer connected to the main tissue of the Jewish people\\\". He was scathing about its failure to act before the Holocaust.  He said the diaspora's religious and secular leadership had ignored the warning signs in the 1920s, and had fiercely opposed Zionism. Consequently, he considered the Holocaust, \\\"the failure of Judaism\\\".  His talk, entitled \\\"Diaspora: A Neurotic Solution\\\", covered 5,000 years of Jewish history.  Mr. Yehoshua's other targets included Soviet Jews who were, he said \\\"not staying [in Israel], but running [away]\\\", and all Jews outside Israel \\\"who were using other people's countries like hotels\\\".  The only conclusion he could draw was that the diaspora was immoral, because it looked to Israel for its identity but lived elsewhere.  Worse, it threatened Israel itself, creating a distraction for her citizens, who were leaving by the thousands.  Mr. Yehoshua, who described himself as \\\"a soldier for aliyah\\\", ended by calling for the creation of a new \\\"total Jew\\\", living in Israel.  Earlier, speaking at a meeting of Jewish students on the difficulties of forging a national identity in Israeli literature, Mr. Yehoshua claimed that Israeli writers were paralyzed by the country's political situation.  He said Israel's wars had once provided writers with a vital source of inspiration.  Today, Israeli writers avoided writing directly about the Arab-Israeli conflict. No major work had been produced about the intifada.  Instead, writers were tackling themes such as Jewish identity, emigration from Israel and personal and family issues.  Mr. Yehoshua admitted he also felt unable to write about the Israeli political situation. He could no longer step into an Israeli Arab's shoes and portray him as a real \\\"flesh and blood character\\\".  He claimed that after 40 years of statehood, the problem of Israeli identity had not been solved. He said Jews remained too pre-occupied with the borders of identity between Jew and non-Jew, and were not concerned with the nature of that identity.  Jewish values in Israel embraced every aspect of daily life, unlike in the diaspora, where Jews had no responsibility for the country they lived in, he said.  He warned that modern Hebrew, a unifying force for the Jewish people, would have to struggle for its future, especially in literary circles. It faced fierce competition from the English language. \",\" From the limited details released so far, It seems that the clipper chip  system must employ some sort of public key cryptography. Otherwise, the key  management problems inherent to symetric ciphers would make the system  unworkable. It probably has some sort of public key exchange that takes place at the start of each call. Thats how they would identify the private key in  their data base?  This means that either the NSA has developed some non RSA public key  algorythm or the feds have decided to subsidize PKP & RSADSI. The former is  rather an exciting posibility since keeping the algorythm secret while making chip implimentations widely avalibe will be exceptionally hard. If the feds are forced to make it avalible in order to gain public acceptance than that  could break RSA's stranglehold on public key crypto in the U.S.     As for my impressions of the whole scheme It seems that instead of trying to ban strong crypto, they are trying to co-opt it. Their contention that they  need to keep the algorythm secret to protect the security of the key registration suggests possible inherent weakness to the algorythm. More likely is that they dont want anyone constructing black market devices which dont  have the keys registered. Anyone else notice that in their Q&A session, they talk about releasing the keys only to people with proper autiorization but carefully dance around stating that the keys will simply have to be supeonaed. They seem to be trying to keep open the posibility of obtaining keys without  court order even though tapping a phone line requires one. Also pick up on  their implicit threat of eithe accept this or we'll ban strong crypto outright? I dont trust this plan at all and plan to oppose it in all (legal) ways possible.\",\"Well now that the hawks have won the division the road is a little easier for the playoffs.

Please  include: Name, Organization, Address and Telephone Number.       (6)  We would benefit from knowing why users that know about NASA remote  sensing data do not use the data.  Is it because they do not have ties to NASA investigators, or high cost, lack of accessibility, incompatible data formats, poor area of interest coverage, inadequate spatial or spectral resolution, ...?        \",\"   It's about time.  Why do atheists spend so much time paying attention to the bible, anyway?  Face it, there are better things to do with your life!  I used to chuckle and snort over the silliness in that book and the absurdity of people believing in it as truth, etc.  Why do we spend so little time on the Mayan religion, or the Native Americans?  Heck, the Native Americans have signifigantly more interesting myths.  Also, what about the Egyptians.  I think we pay so much attention to Christianity because we accept it as a _religion_ and not a mythology, which I find more accurate.   I try to be tolerant.  It gets very hard when someone places a book under my nose and tells me it's special.  It's not.\",\": I was posting to Alt.locksmithing about the best methods for securing  : a motorcycle.  I got several responses referring to the Cobra Lock : (described below).  Has anyone come across a store carrying this lock : in the Chicago area? :  : Any other feedback from someone who has used this?  What about the new Yamaha \\\"Cyclelok\\\" ? From the photo in Motorcyclist, it looks the same hardened steel as a  Kryptonite U lock, except it folds in five places. It seems to extend out far enough to lock the rear tire to the tube of a parking sign or similar.  Anyone had any experience with them, how easy is it to attack the lock at the jointed sections ?\",\"In <1993Apr15.143320.8618@desire.wright.edu>, demon@desire.wright.edu sez:  There's this minor thing called \\\"interest of finality/repose\\\".  What it means is that parties aren't dragged into court over and over again because the losing side \\\"discovers\\\" some \\\"new\\\" evidence.  I don't know about you, Brett, but I suspect GM had the resources to find just about as many expert and fact witnesses as it wanted before the trial started.  Letting them re-open the case now is practically an invitation to every civil litigant on earth to keep an ace in the hole in case the verdict goes against him.  BTW, in federal criminal cases, Rule 33 does permit a motion for a new trial \\\"based on . . . *newly discovered* evidence\\\" if made within 2 years of the verdict.  (Emphasis mine.)  If you're trying to make a backhanded point about criminal justice in a discussion that has little to do with criminal trials -- as the estimable David Brock did in his amusing WSJ piece last week -- save your breath.     Yup.  Which is why they shoulda been brought around the first time through.     Unless there's some reason to believe that this supposed bias predated the trial (as opposed to being a product of it), and that GM was unfairly prevented from discovering it (by venireman concealment or otherwise), why should GM be allowed to complain? \",\" ------------ Part 6 of 14 ------------ MAZ)75U=7R!1KP\\\"5A8=F>`7;UG)\\\\&V0&>*YZ>*W5&$'Z]M;T0AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX=7HLAL(;7(5U\\\\,MEIH@$H^,#\\\",4*&?8%'U#6#,-V`W!H>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'A[0E9:0E97PM8]8M9#MH M6CNL]%&'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AUL4SU=7Z/*V&U<2X!!:6M3BYK7L:.Q-TZ#Q M[/%#\\\\>SL[.R'AX>'A\\\\!$%$-:U`Q7S]1_S\\\\BB%!2B5Q2'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'A\\\\\\\"@ M`B'Q(DCQ[$H=L;FGO;5:X(>'AX>J\\\"<]75\\\\B`P;Z@,-\\\"X@^&?S%$<JPV?-P;K MH9\\\\WS!=@-XQ<AX>'AS'$9@L+I4=Z>BJ[P#9U)5L4`LA75P);V6$KGJEXE5-3 M[>V+BXN+BXN+BXN+BXLT-,7%-#0T-#0T-#0T-#0TBXN+[>WM4[\\\"PSU?/@$H, M5\\\\]-(8AH:(#!0]QH:&S30QVQ:$,0L;&([/%'1T='W]_?W]_?W]^I=3:F:JQ2 M`2NTOJYN#N`0:.SP99LI])0GGV!1%X&,]\\\"0M<(>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AS'$9F8+I:5'1Z6E M\\\"V;$,3$QQ,3$9F8+\\\"PNEI0L+9L0Q,3$Q,3$Q,3'$Q&9F9@L+\\\"PL+\\\"PMF\\\"PL+ M\\\"PL+9L3$Q#$QAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX=4 M5%22DI*2DI*2DI*2DI*2DI*2DI*2DI*2DI*2DI*2DI*2DI*2DI*2DI*2DI*2 MDI*2DI*2DI*2DI*2DI*25%145%145%145%145%14%A86%A86%LG)R<G)R<G) MR<G)R<G)R<G)R<G)R<G)R<G)R<F)B8F)B8F)B8F)B8F)B8G)R<G)R<G)B8F) MB8F)B8F)B8F)3$Q,3$P/9\\\\4T-(OM[>U3L!D9<3T]F0,#7KN[*BHJ*GIZ>M_?

Are the Moslem fanatics who strap bombs to their backs and driving into Jewish embassies dying for the truth (hint: they think they are)? Were the NAZI soldiers in WWII dying for the truth?   People die for lies all the time.    Was Hitler a liar? How about Napoleon, Mussolini, Ronald Reagan? We spend millions of dollars a year trying to find techniques to detect lying? So the answer is no, they wouldn't be able to tell if he was a liar if he only lied about some things.   Why do you think he healed people, because the Bible says so? But if God doesn't exist (the other possibility) then the Bible is not divinely inspired and one can't use it as a piece of evidence, as it was written by unbiased observers.   Were Hitler or Mussolini lunatics? How about Genghis Khan, Jim Jones... there are thousands of examples through history of people being drawn to lunatics.   So we obviously cannot rule out liar or lunatic not to mention all the other possibilities not given in this triad.   Possibly self-fulfilling prophecy (ie he was aware what he should do in order to fulfil these prophecies), possibly selective diting on behalf of those keepers of the holy bible for a thousand years or so before the general; public had access. possibly also that the text is written in such riddles (like Nostradamus) that anything that happens can be twisted to fit the words of raving fictional 'prophecy'.

This past summer I upgraded (increased) the memory in a powerbook and a ci.   When I called to place the order for the PB RAM, I was told by the sales person that they would give me a $50 rebate if I would return the original RAM (which was also TechWorks RAM.)  I followed the instructions for returning the old RAM, expecting to see a credit on my VISA within a few weeks.  Well, months went by, and no credit.  After many calls (almost none of which were ever returned - arghhh) I finally found someone who told me \\\"Why we never received your old chips.\\\"  I then explained I the procedure that I had followed to return them, to which the person replied \\\"You mean you sent them US Mail?\\\" (which I had, per the original sales person's instructions.)  I was told that they their loss of US mail shipments is not uncommon (come on) and that I should have sent the stuff via FedEx, etc.  I reasoned that I had done exactly what I had been told to, but they would not budge, the people I spoke with were absolutely no help.  I sent letters, copies of the original receipts, attempted to trace the package through the US mail, made *many* more phone calls to TechWorks, all to no avail (I wouldn't give-up because I was so disgusted.) Sales/support people, supervisors, there was nothing I could do to pursuade them to \\\"make it right.\\\"  I finally (in total disgust) wrote a letter to my credit card company, asking them to investigate the problem.   Three weeks later, the credit miraculously appeared on my statement.  I have not (in recent memory) been so disgusted with the service that I received from a company.  In all fairness, they had no way of knowing that was not trying to rip them off, but I went to *such* great lengths to prove to them that this really happened.  Oh well, c'est la vie.

Box 605  Amherst, NY 14226-0605       COMPUTING CRATER DIAMETERS FROM EARTH-IMPACTING ASTEROIDS      Astrogeologist Gene Shoemaker proposes the following formula, based on     studies of cratering caused by nuclear tests.         (1/3.4)     D = S  S  c  K  W     : crater diameter in km   g  p  f  n          (1/6)     S = (g /g )      : gravity correction factor for bodies other than      g   e  t        Earth, where g = 9.8 m/s^2 and g is the surface          e        t          gravity of the target body. This scaling is          cited for lunar craters and may hold true for          other bodies.    (1/3.4)     S = (p / p )     : correction factor for target density p  ,      p   a   t           t          p  = 1.8 g/cm^3 for alluvium at the Jangle U           a          crater site, p = 2.6 g/cm^3 for average          rock on the continental shields.      C       : crater collapse factor, 1 for craters <= 3 km          in diameter, 1.3 for larger craters (on Earth).             (1/3.4)     K       : .074 km / (kT TNT equivalent)      n         empirically determined from the Jangle U          nuclear test crater.         3     2         19     W = pi * d * delta * V  / (12 * 4.185 * 10  )        : projectile kinetic energy in kT TNT equivalent          given diameter d, velocity v, and projectile          density delta in CGS units. delta of around 3          g/cm^3 is fairly good for an asteroid.      An RMS velocity of V = 20 km/sec may be used for Earth-crossing     asteroids.      Under these assumptions, the body which created the Barringer Meteor     Crater in Arizona (1.13 km diameter) would have been about 40 meters in     diameter.      More generally, one can use (after Gehrels, 1985):      Asteroid     Number of objects  Impact probability  Impact energy     diameter (km)         (impacts/year)    (* 5*10^20 ergs)       10       10       10^-8  10^9       1    1 000       10^-6  10^6       0.1        100 000       10^-4  10^3      assuming simple scaling laws.

The latter was written with     simplicity of exposition and suitability of digital computation in mind     (spherical trig formulae also appear, as do digitally-plotted examples).      More than you ever cared to know about map projections is in John     Snyder's USGS publication \\\"Map Projections--A Working Manual\\\", USGS     Professional Paper 1395. This contains detailed descriptions of 32     projections, with history, features, projection formulas (for both     spherical earth and ellipsoidal earth), and numerical test cases. It's a     neat book, all 382 pages worth. This one's $20.      You might also want the companion volume, by Snyder and Philip Voxland,     \\\"An Album of Map Projections\\\", USGS Professional Paper 1453. This     contains less detail on about 130 projections and variants. Formulas are     in the back, example plots in the front. $14, 250 pages.      You can order these 2 ways. The cheap, slow way is direct from USGS:     Earth Science Information Center, US Geological Survey, 507 National     Center, Reston, VA 22092. (800)-USA-MAPS. They can quote you a price and     tell you where to send your money. Expect a 6-8 week turnaround time.      A much faster way (about 1 week) is through Timely Discount Topos,     (303)-469-5022, 9769 W. 119th Drive, Suite 9, Broomfield, CO 80021. Call     them and tell them what you want. They'll quote a price, you send a     check, and then they go to USGS Customer Service Counter and pick it up     for you. Add about a $3-4 service charge, plus shipping.      A (perhaps more accessible) mapping article is:   R. Miller and F. Reddy, \\\"Mapping the World in Pascal\\\",  Byte V12 #14, December 1987   Contains Turbo Pascal procedures for five common map projections.

Any answer will be highly appreciated. Thanks in advance.  Regards,\",\"  The company was probably \\\"Public Missiles, Inc\\\" of Michigan.   Yup.   Nope, it's not illegal. It is, however, closely regulated. In order to  purchase and use the big rocket motors required, it is necessary to be one of the following: a) An employee of a government agency. b) An employee or student at a university doing research involving rockets. c) A member or representative of an educational organization involved in research or other uses of rockets. There are two such organizations:  The Tripoli Rocketry Association and the National Association of Rocketry. Members of either organization must demonstrate proficiency in construction and flight before they are allowed to purchase large motors on their own.  The FAA will issue a waiver of its regulations, upon request, to any  organization which can persuade them it has taken adequate precautions  to avoid conflicts with aircraft. The usual stipulations are: - Only operation up to a specified ceiling is allowed. Depending on the location, this ceiling may be from 5000 to 50000 feet AGL.  - The operator of the rocket is responsible for avoiding any aircraft within the operating radius around the launch site. - Flight into clouds or beyond visual range in haze is expressly prohibited. - The FAA will provide a NOTAM informing other users of the airspace that unmanned rocket operations are taking place at the specified place and time.  Most of the launches that are held (and there are dozens of them every year) are held in areas where air traffic is relatively light, such as over the western deserts (the Black Rock Desert north of Reno is particularly popular since it is 25 x 150 miles of *nothing to hit* on the ground).  The two rocketry associations test and approve motors for their members' use, to insure safety. Depending on motor size, the launcher setback is from 50 to 500 or more feet.   By the way, rockets under 1 lb and powered by an \\\"F\\\" motor are exempt from most Federal regulations on unmanned rockets anyway. See FAR 101, Subpart C, for details.  As for recovery...although the higher altitude rockets can reach up to 50,000 feet, most of them only get to 2,000 to 5,000 feet. The typical rocket is 2 to 6 inches in diameter, and carries a 3 to 6 foot parachute, or multiple parachutes, depending on the payload. Many rockets also carry either a small transmitter or an audio sounder--particularly at launches in the eastern US, where there are more obstructions.  Camera, telemetry transmitter, and video payloads are becoming quite common.   Why not? It's a lot of fun...check out the traffic on rec.models.rockets for information about the model (3 lb and under) and high power (everything bigger) rocket hobbies. As with all dangerous activities, the key is to practice safety. I've been flying consumer rockets ranging up to 4-5 lbs takeoff weight for 27 years, and still have all my extremities intact.   That's another thing. NO EXPLOSIVE WARHEADS OF ANY KIND ARE ALLOWED ON THESE ROCKETS. NONE! Please forgive me for shouting, but that's one of the biggest misconceptions people have about our hobby.   True. But it will not be related to the rocket hobby, unless I get  hit while crossing a road with a rocket in my hand. \",\"  Never said you didn't publish, merely that there is data you don't publish,  and that no-one scoriates you for those cases.

There is an issue also of measurement against a rule.  Thus the words that are spoken need to be compared against the rule/canon but not added to the canon.  Is new revelation necessary?  Topical, current, personal revelation I'd say is necessary.  New revelation for all people for all times is not necessary as we have that in Scripture.  You also seem to confuse canon with scripture.  Scripture may speak of itself being open - ie God speaking today.  It would speak that it is closed in the sense that the canon is unchangeable.  (Though the concept of canon is later historically.)   I agree with the problem of confusion.  If prophecy is meant to encourage, exhort or correct then is an overlap with scripture.  If prophecy is meant to bring a `word' of the form \\\"the man you live with is not your husband\\\" then that is knowledge.  Yet the exact words their are scripture. I would expect the difference to be the motive and means for delivery. The reading of scripture itself can be a powerful force.

AA and other 12-step abuse- recovery programs are acknowledged as being among the most effective.  Unfortunately, as evidence for God, this can be dismissed by stating that the same defect of personality makes substance abusers as makes  people 'religious', and the debunker could perhaps acknowledge that being religious is a better crutch than being a drug addict, but still maintain that both are escapism.  (And I suspect that there are some atheists who would find the substance abuse preferable to Christianity.)

Certainly this was mentioned on comp.sys.sgi on more than one occasion as being likely.  If our sales folks were saying otherwise, they were either confused, or less than honest/ethical, or somebody further up the chain inside SGI was misleading them.   There were 4 versions (20, 25, 30, 35), although admittedly the 30 came out at the same time as the 35, over a period of 2 1/2 years.  The chassis simply couldn't be pushed any further.  I'd say 4 years was a pretty good lifespan, myself, for a system design in this day and age.  Getting the 35 to work caused a lot of gray hairs in both the hardware and product design groups; we would have been out of our minds to push it further, and I *know* that was made clear, almost from the day the 35 started shipping.  We had one last kicker in the form of the Elan graphics, which made 3 graphics versions over its lifespan, which I also think is pretty good.   Please, by all means send a complaint letter through SGI support or sales on your concerns.  There should be no reason for sales folks to misrepresent future upgrades to customers (sure, sometimes there will be confusion for a while, over whether an upgrade will be available, but that shouldn't last too long, and doesn't seem to be what you are referring to).  Yes, the sales folks *do* get bonus's at the end of some (all?) quarters, but that is pretty common industry wide, and sometimes that can result in good deals for customers (sometimes it probably pushes folks into systems that aren't what they need, I'm sure, but nobody is *forcing* you to buy at end of quarter, after all...)   They don't get all that long a lead time either; although certainly they get presentations on possible new products, and their opinions may well influence the end product, but that also is life in the industry.  We can't design systems that meet just their needs, or we won't sell too many systems, after all (which is not to say that we don't have some niche products, like Reality Engine).   But surely you don't expect a system you buy now for a five year period to be constantly upgradable over that entire five year period?  That's a rather unreasonable expectation, in my experience (with workstations/microcomputers).  Supported, and parts available, yes, but certainly not upgradable to the latest and greatest!

He called a total of 4 penalties on the Habs and one on the Nordiques. The Nords' penalty came in O.T.  Stewart, being an ex-Nordique himself, was looking to call penalties on the Habs while letting the Nords get away with murder...WE WAS ROBBED!!!!  It was an excellent game with plenty of end-to-end rushes and tremendous goalkeeping.  The Nords tied it with over 1 minute to go while Lebeau was serving a penalty.  I don't mind Stewart calling a penalty in the last 5 min. of the game, but AT LEAST BE FAIR ABOUT IT.  The Nords were caught with their hand in the cookie jar more than once.  Stewart turned the other cheek...BASTARD!  Patrick Roy collapsed after letting in the tieing goal. He was shaky and on his knees for the rest of the night.  The winning goal shouldn't have gone in.

[From Chapter XX of _The Prince_, by N. Macchiavelli, as translated by Daniel Donno.]   In order to keep their lands secure, some princes have disarmed their subjects; others have prompted division within the cities they have subjugated.  Some have nurtured animosities against themselves; others have sought to win the approval of those they initially distrusted.  Some have erected fortresses; others have destroyed them.  Now, although it is impossible to set down definite judgements on all of these measures without considering the particular circumstances of the states where they may be employed, I shall nevertheless discuss them in such broad terms as the subject itself will allow.   To begin with, there has never been a case of a new prince disarming his subjects.  Indeed, whenever he found them disarmed, he proceeded to arm them.  For by arming your subjects, you make their arms your own.  Those among them who are suspicious become loyal, while those who are already loyal remain so, and from subjects they are transformed into partisans.  Though you cannot arm them all, nonetheless you increase your safety among those you leave unarmed by extending privileges to those you arm.  Your different treatment of the two categories will make the latter feel obligated to you, while the former will consider it proper thoat those who assume added duties and dangers should receive advantages.     When you disarm your subjects, however, you offend them, by showing that, either from cowardliness or from lack of faith, you distrust them; and either conclusion will induce them to hate you. Moreover, since it is impossible for you to remain unarmed, you would have to resort to mercenaries, whose limitations have already been discussed. Even if such troops were good, however, they could never be good enough to defend you from powerful enemies, and doubtful subjects.  Therefore, as I have said, a new prince in a newly acquired state has always taken measures to arm his subjects, and history is full of examples proving that this is so.   But when a prince takes posession of a new state which he annexes as an addition to his original domain, then he must disarm all the subjects of the new state except those who helped him to acquire it; and these, as time and occasion permit, he must seek to render soft and weak.  He must arrange matters in such a way that the arms of the entire state will be in the hands of soldiers who are native to his original domain.   ...\",\"Help!

I've got a problem that  I need as many people's help from as possible.  Before I go in to the details of this, let me go ahead and tell you that (though it may sound it) this is not one of those boy meets girl problem...at least not totally like that to me....Anyway...  OK, I am a 19 year old Sophmore at NCSU. About 10 years ago, my family and I were vacationing at the coast in a cottage we rented. Across the street, was ths girl who would whistle at me whenever she saw me... her name in Erin. Well, we became friends that week at the beach and have been writing each other for about 10 years....there was a period of about 2 years we lost contact..but that was a while ago.   By the way...Erin lives in Kansas and me in NC.  OK, last year in one of her letters, she says that she is coming back to NC to see some of her family who are gonna be there. So I drove about 4 hours to see her. This is where it begins....I spent the whole day with Erin....one of the best days of my life. Even though we had been writing each other, we still had to get used to being in person....she has got to be the most incredible woman I ever met. (She's one year older than me BTW). I mean, no person in the world could ask for a better person. Not only was she incredibly beautiful (not to  mention WAY out of my league...although I'm  not unattractive mind you), but she had a great personality and a great sence of humor. Her family is one of those families who goes to church but that is about the extent of their Christianity...you know the kind of people. But she knows I am a Christian.   Well, you get the idea of what I think of her. If there is ever such a thing as love at first sight....I found it. That was last year...I kid you not when I say that I have thought about her EVERY day since then.  In out letters, Erin and I always kid each other about not finding dates..(which is true for me, but I know it can't be for her). She has had some problems at home, her folks split up and she ended up leaving school....Now we are at the present...  Let me give you part of the letter I got from her last week....   \\\"Okay, now I'm going to try to explain my life to you. I'm not going to KU anymore because something just isn't right.

Apple can't deliver that right now because the 040 saps too much power, radiates far too much heat, and is too large for a notebook. How does one get around that without designing a new chipset? Use existing PowerBook technology to your best advantage. The Duo Dock gives Apple a unique ability to give users that 040 power in a \\\"Semi-Portable\\\" fashion. By plunking the 040 into the Dock, you've got \\\"quadra\\\" power at your desk. On the road, that 33mhz 68030 should be able to handle most of your needs. Okay, not the BEST solution, but its an answer to a no-win situation. :-) So, does this mean one will be able to use the PowerBook's processor in parallel to the dock's processor? Okay, we're getting REALLY hypothetical now... \",\"[...] [...] [...]  Try something like 24.2 feet.

I see...  :-)   You can believe that if you wish.  It is undeniable, however, that people  have left the compound unharmed and alive earier in the standoff.  And since their leader was preaching that they would have an apocalypse, you  can not say undeniably that there wouldn't have been a mass suicide if the  FBI had simply stayed outside and waited another 51 days.   I am the heartless bleeding heart?  You are not making sense. You seem to have no concern that someone would keep children inside this  compound when they had 51 days to let them out.  That sounds pretty heartless  to me.  I just heard on the news that some of the survivors regret they hadn't  stayed in the inferno to prove their loyalty to Koresh.  This makes me  sad and sick.   Have you ever heard of Jonestown? The sad thing is the people inside the compound were the authority  worshipers and their only authority was Koresh/Howell.   If these  people were able to think for themselves, there would likely be a lot  more survivors today.  Koresh preached a fiery apocalypse as early as  last year.   By all means, the FBI should be investigated, too.

Here is a reply to one of the letters.  Seems to me that atheist do not like the doctrine of hell!]    Your using 20th century concepts to interprete 1st century writers.  Of course, in your termonology, God could not \\\"cease to exist.\\\"  However, that is not what death ever means in the Scriptures.  If you will study the word, you will see that it signifies \\\"separation.\\\"  Death is separation, not ceastation.  This is the reason for the agony of the cross.  For the first time in eternity, one member of the Godhead was separated from the other two.    I once met a young lady that was as beautiful as any model that ever lived.  She was as personable as any saint ever imagined.  She was to become my \\\"girlfriend\\\" for several years.  However, having been drafted, we were separated by distance.  To me that was a form of death.  Later, she decided that she couldn't wait for me to come home and bid me adue.  That to me was death.  It was separation from that which had made me whole.  Death is separation and eternal death is eternal separation from His fellowship, not because He chose to send you into outer darkness, but because you chose to go there.      When I rebelled against my earthly father, he spanked me.  I found no wisdom in that until I had grown older and especially until I had my own children.  He was trying to guide me away from hurt that would enter my life if I continued on my suicidal course.  He did it in love though I interpreted it as harsh and unloving.  If God warns of impending danger, that is love.  If choose to let us do as we please, and then at the end tell us the rules, that would be harsh.  You have a conscience, no matter how calused or fallen it is, that witnesses to you that a thing is wrong and that there is cause for fear.     This may give light to the error of your understanding.  One must have correct knowledge in order to have correct faith.  Faith and knowledge are inseparable.  Jesus most certainly felt the \\\"pinpricks\\\" of life.  As the Scripture say:  Heb. 4:15 For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all things as we are, yet without sin.  The kenosis passage of Phil 2 states that He gave up His Godhead attributes when He took upon Himself humanity.  It has been a favorite meditation of mine to think about this.  It was to be my PhD thesis.  \\\"The Consciousness of Christ.\\\"  I have talked at length with a great many people about this interesting study, including clh.    It is my conclussion that as Jesus, the 2nd member of the Trinity, actually suffered as we do.  He became part of the human race and experienced it as we do.  He \\\"grew in knowledge.\\\"  He chose not to grasp His omniscience, but chose to be taught.  It is my understanding that He was \\\"led of the Spirit\\\" to such an extent that sometimes it is hard to distinquish between Jesus the man and Jesus as God.  But in Jn 8 where the adulterous women was thrown before Him, the tenses are quite clear in that the whole situation took Him by surprise.  That is, He was not aware that this event was to take place in time.  He was living sequential history as you or I.    Maybe some other time we can discuss this, but it is a very lengthy discussion and one that causes the curcuit breakers of the brain to pop more often than not.   I was once a member of that club.  THe \\\"free thinker\\\" is a glorious ideal.  By contrast, of course, you believe that the believer is the unforunate repository of everything that is dogmatic, inhibited, reactionary and repressive.  I find such a stance to be as amusing as it is absurd.   If the liberal humanist wishes to criticize a Christian or a Buddhist or a Marxist, that is his right.  But what he must not pretend is that he was led to this solely by his \\\"rational doubt\\\" when in fact he was led to it by his \\\"faith\\\".  He must acknowledge that while it is rational doubt for him as a \\\"free thinker\\\" to criticize the Christian, it might equally be a rational doubt for the Christian to criticize him as a humanist.  If there is no faith, there can be no dout.  There is no faith which cannot choose to cast doubt on some other faith.  Pascal pointed out that \\\"sceptical arguments allow the positive to be positive.  Few. . .speak dubiously of scepticism.\\\"  The fact that skeptics are not skeptical about skepticism is further evidence that to doubt anything we must believe in something else!  THe person who is skeptical toward one faith or even most faiths, will be the devoted adherent of another.  In fact, it is a measure of his poverty both that he is unaware of it and that he can define himself only in negative terms, hence the term \\\"a\\\"-theist.  Some people claim otherwise and argue vociferously for complete skepticism.  In my campus ministry I ran across this more times than I care to remember.  However, they disproved their own argument with every thought, every word, every point of logic that they used.  Every moment of shared communication speaks against their total skepticism.  Their very insistence of trying to make sense is eloquent testimony to assumptions that are powerful though silent.  That is to say, that complete skepticism is impossible and limited skepticism is arbitrary.  Next time you're in a room of skeptics, yell out \\\"Look, your fly is undone!\\\"  Each person chooses what he is skeptical about and what he believes without skepticism.  To stress this is to belabor the obvious, but it underlines the point that no one can know exhaustively how he knows what he knows.  Pure objectivism is a myth and complete skepticism an impossiblity.  The answer to this impasse lies in  a 3rd way of knowing, one which is based on presuppositions.  But if knowledge proceeds on what must be presupposed before it is proved, the cover is blown on the pretentions of critical doubt, and critical doubt depends on the idea that human knowledge is totally objective and neutral.  In other words, another myth.    Presuppositions my friend.  It is impossible to doubt anything unless there is something we do not doubt -our own assumptions/presuppostions.  Even these can be criticezed only upon the basis of other assumptions.  Presuppostitons are our silent partners in thought but their silence must not be mistaken for absence.   Of course that is hardly an original statement.  Milton coined it but it had been in use for millenia.  It was even used in the first \\\"Highlander\\\" movie.  But again, your presuption is based on a faulty knowledge of the character of God.  You are operating off of a presuppositional premise of humanistic theology, not what He has revealed of Himself through history, through His prophets, through His Word, and lastly, but most of all, thru His Son.  If you are to reject God's annointed savior, then reject Him from a correct understanding of Himself.\",\"Can anyone tell me where to find a MPEG viewer (either DOS or Windows).

In practice I suspect most people do what you describe.   If you don't slide the tyre, you have no way of knowing whether you've achieved maximum braking or not. I'm not suggesting that you should always aim to brake as hard as you possibly can - but if you want to find the limits of the machine, you have to go beyond them. \",\"  This sounds like a VERY good thing to do.

I have a record that shows a IIsi with and without a 64KB cache. It's small enough that I will attach it.  I have also measured some real programs with and without the 64 KB cache.  The speedup varies a lot from app to app, ranging from 0% to 40%.  I think an average of 20%-25% is about right.  The subjective difference is not great, but is sometimes noticable.  A simple cache card certainly does not transform a IIsi into something enormously better.  I do not have an FPU.  The conventional wisdom says that cache cards from all of the makers offer about the same speedup and that there is not much difference between 32K and 64K caches.  I bought mine from Third Wave for well under $150.  I have had absolutely no problems at all with it.  If you get *complete* speedometer runs for a 32K cache, I'd like to see them.

Some personal thoughts:  It is of no great astonishment that there is a concerted effort by a major portion of the Church to control and mandate change of a minority among its ranks.  This was the momentum behind the Spanish Inquisition, only all they required was a confession of faith (after much torture) and then, to save their souls they would dispatch them to heaven through death.  Even later, the Bible was used vigorously to defend slavery, oppression and segragation of African-Americans, even to the justification of lynchings. Today's scholars are just a bit more slick in their approach.  The tool is still coersion, but now it is mostly by means of brainwashing and mind control, convincing people that they should see themselves as less than God sees them, then maintaining a cultic hold on them until it is felt thier mind-conditioning is complete.  Sure, no one is \\\"physically\\\" forced to stay in this \\\"reparative therapy\\\" but sheer social pressure is enough for many to keep themselves in this new found bondage of self-hate.  As an abolitionist I advocate the abolishment of oppression and persecution against gays in all facets of civil life.  A person should be judged by the contibution, or non-contribution to the society in which they live, not by some high-brow standard of conformity imposed by those who haven';t a clue what is in their heart.  For those who seek more information about Gays and groups that accept them please contact your nearest chapter of PFLAG (Parents & Friends of Lesbians And Gays) who will be more than happy to assist you.  This is a group of people comprised of Gays, Lesbians and Bisexuals, their parents and friends who have formed a support group for help and understanding.  Try talking to a parent of a gay son or daughter and learn some \\\"first-hand\\\" real life and loving understanding.  God's love and understanding for Gay people is no less abundant.\",\"   [chop]  Could you please post it to the net too please, as I, and I'm sure many others would like to know.  Thanks!

In comparison, in  the United States, reported cases of gonorrhea in 1992 continued an overall  decreasing trend (1). This report summarizes an analysis of the increase in  gonorrhea in Colorado in 1992 and characterizes trends in the occurrence of  this disease from 1985 through 1992.       In 1992, 4679 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the Colorado Department  of Health (CDH) compared with 3901 cases reported in 1991. During 1992,  reported cases increased 22.7% and 17.5% among females and males, respectively  (Table 1). Similar increases occurred among blacks, whites, and Hispanics  (15.6%, 15.1%, and 15.9%, respectively); however, the number of reported cases  with race not specified increased 88% from 1991 to 1992 and constituted 9.7%  of all reported cases in 1992. Although the largest proportional increases by  age groups occurred among persons aged 35-44 years (80.4%) and greater than or  equal to 45 years (87.7%), these age groups accounted for only 11.0% of all  reported cases in 1992. Persons in the 15-19-year age group accounted for the  largest number of reported cases of gonorrhea during 1992 and the highest age  group-specific rate (639 per 100,000).       Reported cases of gonorrhea increased 32.9% in the five-county Denver  metropolitan area (1990 population: 1,629,466) but decreased elsewhere in the  state (Table 1). Half the cases of gonorrhea in the Denver metropolitan area  occurred in 8.4% (34) of the census tracts; these represent neighborhoods  considered by sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)/acquired immunodeficiency  syndrome (AIDS) field staff to be the focus of gang and drug activity.       When compared with 1991, the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed among  men in the Denver Metro Health Clinic (DMHC, the primary public STD clinic in  the Denver metropolitan area) increased 33% in 1992, and the number of visits  by males to the clinic increased 2.4%. Concurrently, the number of cases  diagnosed among women increased by 1%. Among self-identified heterosexual men,  the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed at DMHC increased 33% and comprised  94% of all cases diagnosed in males, while the number of cases diagnosed among  self-identified homosexual men remained low (71 and 74 in 1991 and 1992,  respectively).       Four selected laboratories in the metropolitan Denver area (i.e., HMO,  university hospital, nonprofit family planning, and commercial) were contacted  to determine whether gonorrhea culture-positivity rates increased. Gonorrhea  culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories contacted increased  23%-33% from 1991 to 1992, while the rate was virtually unchanged in the  fourth (i.e., nonprofit family planning).       From 1985 through 1991, reported cases of gonorrhea among whites and  Hispanics in Colorado decreased; in comparison, reported cases among blacks   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 14 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  increased since 1988 (Figure 1). During 1988-1992, the population in Colorado  increased 9.9% for blacks, 9.8% for Hispanics, and 4.5% for whites. In 1992,  the gonorrhea rate for blacks (1935 per 100,000 persons) was 57 times that for  whites (34 per 100,000) and 12 times that for Hispanics (156 per 100,000)  (Table 1). Among black females, reported cases of gonorrhea increased from  1988 through 1992 in the 15-19-year age group; among black males, cases  increased from 1989 through 1992 in both the 15-19-and 20-24-year age groups.

Surveillance and Information Systems Br,  Div of Sexually Transmitted Diseases and HIV Prevention, National Center for  Prevention Svcs, CDC.   Editorial Note: The increase in reported gonorrhea cases in Colorado in 1992  may represent an overall increase in the occurrence of this disease or more  complete reporting stimulated by visitations to laboratories by CDH  surveillance staff during 1991-1992. The increases in confirmed gonorrhea  cases at DMHC and in culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories  suggest a real increase in gonorrhea rather than a reporting artifact.  However, the stable culture-positivity rate in the nonprofit family planning  laboratory (which serves a network of clinics statewide) indicates that the  gonorrhea increase did not uniformly affect all segments of the population.       One possible explanation for the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in  Colorado may be gang- and drug-related sexual behavior, as implicated in a  recent outbreak of drug-resistant gonorrhea and other STDs in Colorado Springs  (2). Although the high morbidity census tracts in the Denver metropolitan area  coincide with areas of gang and drug activity, this hypothesis requires  further assessment. To examine the possible role of drug use -- implicated  previously as a factor contributing to the national increase in syphilis (3-6)  -- the CDH STD/AIDS program is collecting information from all persons in whom  gonorrhea is diagnosed regarding drug use, exchange of sex for money or drugs,  and gang affiliation.       The gonorrhea rate for blacks in Colorado substantially exceeds the  national health objective for the year 2000 (1300 per 100,000) (objective  19.1a) (7). Race is likely a risk marker rather than a risk factor for  gonorrhea and other STDs. Risk markers may be useful for identifying groups at  greatest risk for STDs and for targeting prevention efforts. Moreover, race- specific variation in STD rates may reflect differences in factors such as  socioeconomic status, access to medical care, and high-risk behaviors.       In response to the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in Colorado,  interventions initiated by the CDH STD/AIDS program include 1) targeting  partner notification in the Denver metropolitan area to persons in groups at  increased risk (e.g., 15-19-year-old black females and 20-24-year-old black  males); 2) implementing a media campaign (e.g., public service radio   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 15 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  announcements, signs on city buses, newspaper advertisements, and posters in  schools and clinics) to promote awareness of STD risk and prevention targeted  primarily at high-risk groups, and 3) developing teams of peer educators to  perform educational outreach in high-risk neighborhoods. The educational  interventions are being developed and implemented with the assistance of  members of the target groups and with input from a forum of community leaders  and health-care providers.

Child safety seats and safety  belts can substantially reduce this loss (2). From 1977 through 1985, all 50  states passed legislation requiring the use of child safety seats or safety  belts for children. Although these laws reduce injuries to young children by  an estimated 8%-59% (3,4), motor-vehicle crash-related injuries remain a major  cause of disability and death among U.S. children (1), while the use of  occupant restraints among children decreases inversely with age (84% usage for  those aged 0-4 years; 57%, aged 5-11 years; and 29%, aged 12-18 years) (5). In  addition, parents who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to  use restraints for their children (6). To characterize the association between  adult safety-belt use and adult-reported consistent use of occupant restraints  for the youngest child aged less than 11 years within a household, CDC  analyzed data obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System  (BRFSS) during 1988 and 1989. This report summarizes the findings from this  study.       Data were available for 20,905 respondents aged greater than or equal to  18 years in 11 states * that participated in BRFSS -- a population-based,  random-digit-dialed telephone survey -- and administered a standard Injury  Control and Child Safety Module developed by CDC. Of these respondents, 5499  (26%) had a child aged less than 11 years in their household. Each respondent  was asked to specify the child's age and the frequency of restraint use for  that child. The two categories of child restraint and adult safety-belt use in  this analysis were 1) consistent use (i.e., always buckle up) and 2) less than  consistent use (i.e., almost always, sometimes, rarely, or never buckle up).  Data were weighted to provide estimates representative of each state. Software  for Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) (7) was used to calculate point estimates  and confidence intervals. Statistically significant differences were defined  by p values of less than 0.05.       Each of the 11 states had some type of child restraint law. Of these, six  (Arizona, Kentucky, Maine, Nebraska, Rhode Island, and West Virginia) had no  law requiring adults to use safety belts; four (Idaho, Maryland, Pennsylvania,  and Washington) had a secondary enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., a  vehicle had to be stopped for a traffic violation before a citation for nonuse  of safety belts could be issued); and one state (New York) had a primary  enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., vehicles could be stopped for a  safety-belt law violation alone). In nine states, child-passenger protection   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 17 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  laws included all children aged less than 5 years, but the other two states  used both age and size of the child as criteria for mandatory restraint use.  The analysis in this report subgrouped states into 1) those having a law  requiring adult safety-belt use (law states), and 2) those without such a law  (no-law states).       Overall, 21% of children aged less than 11 years reportedly were not  consistently restrained during automobile travel. Both child restraint use and  adult restraint use were significantly higher (p less than 0.05, chi-square  test) in law states than in no-law states (81.1% versus 74.3% and 58.7% versus  43.2%, respectively).       High rates of restraint use for children aged less than or equal to 1  year were reported by both adults indicating consistent and less than  consistent safety-belt use (Figure 1). Adults with consistent use reported  high rates of child-occupant restraint use regardless of the child's age  (range: 95.5% for 1-year-olds to 84.7% for 10-year-olds). In comparison, for  adults reporting less than consistent safety-belt use, the rate of child- occupant restraint use declined sharply by the age of the child (range: 93.1%  for 1-year-olds to 28.8% for 10-year-olds). When comparing children of  consistent adult safety-belt users with children of less than consistent adult  safety-belt users, 95% confidence intervals overlap for the two youngest age  groups (i.e., aged less than 1 and 1 year).       Reported child-occupant restraint use in law states generally exceeded  that in no-law states, regardless of age of child (Table 1). In addition,  higher adult educational attainment was significantly associated with  increased restraint use for children, a factor that has also been associated  with increased adult safety-belt use (8).   Reported by: National Center for Injury Prevention and Control; National  Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC.   Editorial Note: The findings in this report are consistent with others  indicating that adults who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely  to employ occupant restraints for their children (6,9). Because these  nonbelted adults are at increased risk of crashing and more likely to exhibit  other risk-taking behaviors, children traveling with them may be at greater  risk for motor-vehicle injury (10).       Educational attainment of adult respondents was inversely associated with  child restraint use in this report. Accordingly, occupant-protection programs  should be promoted among parents with low educational attainment. Because low  educational attainment is often associated with low socioeconomic status, such  programs should be offered to adults through health-care facilities that serve  low-income communities or through federal programs (i.e., Head Start) that are  directed at parents with young children.       Injury-prevention programs emphasize restraining young children. In  addition, however, efforts must be intensified to protect child occupants as   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 18 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  they become older. Parents, especially those with low educational attainment,  those who do not consistently wear safety belts, and those from states that do  not have mandatory safety-belt use laws, should be encouraged to wear safety  belts and to protect their children by using approved child safety seats and  safety belts. Finally, the increased use of restraints among children may  increase their likelihood of using safety belts when they become teenagers --  the age group characterized by the lowest rate of safety-belt use and the  highest rate of fatal crashes (5).

SURVEILLANCE FOR AND COMPARISON OF BIRTH DEFECT PREVALENCES                                IN TWO GEOGRAPHIC                          AREAS -- UNITED STATES, 1983-88        Problem/Condition: CDC and some states have developed surveillance  systems to monitor the birth prevalence of major defects.       Reporting Period Covered: This report covers birth defects surveillance  in metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia, and selected jurisdictions in California for  the years 1983-1988.       Description of System: The California Birth Defects Monitoring Program  and the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program are two population- based surveillance systems that employ similar data collection methods. The  prevalence estimates for 44 diagnostic categories were based on data for 1983- 1988 for 639,837 births in California and 152,970 births in metropolitan  Atlanta. The prevalences in the two areas were compared, adjusting for race,  sex, and maternal age by using Poisson regression.       Results: Regional differences in the prevalence of aortic stenosis, fetal  alcohol syndrome, hip dislocation/dysplasia, microcephalus, obstruction of the  kidney/ureter, and scoliosis/lordosis may be attributable to general  diagnostic variability. However, differences in the prevalences of arm/hand  limb reduction, encephalocele, spina bifida, or trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) are  probably not attributable to differences in ascertainment, because these  defects are relatively easy to diagnose.       Interpretation: Regional differences in prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy  termination may affect prevalences of trisomy 21 and spina bifida. However,  the reason for differences in arm/hand reduction is unknown, but may be  related to variability in environmental exposure, heterogeneity in the gene  pool, or random variation.       Actions Taken: Because of the similarities of these data bases, several  collaborative studies are being implemented. In particular, the differences in  the birth prevalence of spina bifida and Down syndrome will focus attention on  the impact of prenatal diagnosis.

INFLUENZA -- UNITED STATES, 1988-89       Problem/Condition: CDC monitors the emergence and spread of new influenza  virus variants and the impact of influenza on morbidity and mortality annually  from October through May.       Reporting Period Covered: This report covers U.S. influenza surveillance  conducted from October 1988 through May 1989.       Description of System: Weekly reports from the vital statistics offices  of 121 cities provided an index of influenza's impact on mortality; 58 WHO  collaborating laboratories reported weekly identification of influenza  viruses; weekly morbidity reports were received both from the state and  territorial epidemiologists and from 153 sentinel family practice physicians.  Nonsystematic reports of outbreaks and unusual illnesses were received  throughout the year.       Results: During the 1988-89 influenza season, influenza A(H1N1) and B  viruses were identified in the United States with essentially equal frequency  overall, although both regional and temporal patterns of predominance shifted  over the course of the season. Throughout the season increases in the indices  of influenza morbidity in regions where influenza A(H1N1) predominated were  similar to increases in regions where influenza B predominated. Only 7% of  identified viruses were influenza A(H3N2), but isolations of this subtype  increased as the season waned, and it subsequently predominated during the  1989-90 season. During the 1988-89 season outbreaks in nursing homes were  reported in association with influenza B and A(H3N2) but not influenza  A(H1N1).       Interpretation: The alternating temporal and geographic predominance of  influenza strains A(H1N1) and B during the 1988-89 season emphasizes the  importance of continual attention to regional viral strain surveillance, since  amantadine is effective only for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A.       Actions Taken: Weekly interim analyses of surveillance data produced  throughout the season allow physicians and public health officials to make  informed choices regarding appropriate use of amantadine. CDC's annual  surveillance allows the observed viral variants to be assessed as candidates  for inclusion as components in vaccines used in subsequent influenza seasons.  Authors: Louisa E.

Copyright 1993, The University of Arizona                   High Tech Assisted Reproductive Technologies  Following the birth of the first in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF- ET) baby in 1978, a host of assisted reproductive technologies have been  developed that include IVF-ET, gamete intrafallopian tube transfer (GIFT),  embryo cryopreservation (freezing) and gamete micromanipulation. Together,  these technologies are referred to as the high-tech assisted reproductive  technology (ART) procedures.   Ovulation induction, sperm insemination and surgery for tubal disease and/or  pathology still are the mainstays of the therapies available for infertility  management. However, when these fail, it almost always is appropriate to  proceed with one of the ART procedures.   Therefore, in addition to a comprehensive basic and general infertility  service at The University of Arizona Center for Reproductive Endocrinology and  Infertility, there is a program of Assisted Reproduction that specializes in  ART procedures. This program serves as a tertiary provider for those patients  in the state of Arizona whose infertility problems cannot be resolved by the  traditional therapies.   The following article (on back) describes the ART procedures available in our  Center, clarifies appropriate applications for each, and considers the  realistic expectations for their success. Procedures included are:   o in vitro  o fertilization - embryo transfer (IVF-ET),  gamete intrafallopian tube    transfer  o (GIFT),  cryopreservation of human embryos and  gamete micromanipulation.  This article also considers ongoing research in our program that is directed  towards improved success of these technologies.

This technology involves biopsying the preimplantation human embryo and then  subjecting the biopsied cells to genetic analysis using either DNA  amplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization.   There are recent reports of the successful application of DNA amplification by  other centers, for example, for diagnosis of the genes for cystic fibrosis and  hemophilia. We hope to apply and further focus fluorescent in situ  hybridization technology for probing the X chromosome, the identification of  which will provide a scientific basis for counselling patients who exhibit  sex-linked disorders.   The considerable clinical application of such technology lies in the fact that  it circumvents the need for prenatal diagnosis, in addition to the possibility  of a subsequent termination of affected fetuses, in order to avoid the birth  of affected children.

In Vitro Fertilization - Embryo Transfer is the core ART procedure of our  Assisted Reproduction Program.  This procedure involves retrieval of  unfertilized eggs from the ovary, their insemination in vitro in a dish, and  the culture of resultant embryos for 1 or 2 days, before they are transferred  to the patient's uterus. All cultures are maintained in an incubator under  strictly controlled atmospheric and temperature conditions. Before being  processed for use in insemination, semen samples are evaluated in our  andrology laboratory using both subjective light microscopy and computer-  HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 25 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  assisted semen analyses. To ensure an adequate number of eggs with which to  perform IVF-ET, or indeed, GIFT, follicular development is typically  stimulated, with gonadotropins (perganol, metrodin), gonadotropin releasing  hormone (GnRH, Factrel, lutrepulse) and/or GnRH analogues (lupron, Depo  lupron, synarel). Occasionally, however, IVF-ET is accomplished with eggs  obtained in non-stimulated cycles. While some programs utilize laparoscopic  egg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia,  we undertake the less costly approach of ultrasound-guided retrieval in our  Infertility Unit, with the patient sedated.        Couples who resort to IVF-ET exhibit such pathologies as tubal  deficiencies, ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, and/or mild forms of male  factor infertility.  According to the United States IVF Registry, the overall  success rate for IVF-ET nationwide has stabilized at about 14 percent per  cycle. Results from our program, involving 86 patients who have undergone 173  IVF-ET cycles, reflect a comparable success rate.       Nevertheless, the overall incidence of success with this procedure is  disconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiological  factors that limit achievement of a higher percentage of pregnancies.  Well  recognized predictors of outcome include patient age, response to exogenous  ovarian stimulation, quality of sperm and number of repeated IVF-ET cycle  attempts. However, among these, age is the single most significant determinant  of conception. Therefore, it is critical that such patients are referred to an  Assisted Reproduction Program at the earliest opportunity following failure of  traditional therapies.       The underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has not  been clearly delineated beyond recognition that: 1) the number of eggs  available for retrieval declines markedly with age; 2) fertilization rates  significantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over 40 years;  and 3) provided the appropriate hormonal background is present, age is  unrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy. Ongoing research in our  Center, therefore, is investigating physiological changes in the egg that may  be impacted by age. We have determined that more than 50 percent of eggs that  fail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal, and that a significant  proportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age. Currently,  the only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from a donor. Our  program has initiated recruitment of volunteer egg donors to satisfy the needs  of a list of recipients interested in this form of therapy.        GIFT - This high-tech ART procedure is performed in the operating room,  usually with the use of a laparoscope and, in contrast to IVF-ET, involves  introducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the Fallopian  tube (an average of 3 eggs/tube). Under these circumstances, fertilization  occurs in vivo and, if excess eggs are retrieved, the remainder undergo IVF,  with subsequent options for embryo transfer in that cycle, or freezing for  transfer in a subsequent cycle. This ART procedure is applied to cases in   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 26 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  which there is at least one patent Fallopian tube but the couple has such  pathologies as ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, male factor infertility  and/or idiopathic infertility.          The data reported in the United States IVF Registry for 1985 through 1990  indicate that the overall success rate with GIFT is higher than that obtained  with the IVF-ET technique (range of clinical pregnancies for GIFT is 24 to 36  percent and for IVF-ET 14 to 18 percent). In view of this fact, one might  expect more patients to be treated with GIFT than IVF-ET. However, in our  program we have taken into account three basic concerns which, while  substantially reducing the number of GIFT cycles performed, benefit the  patient. These concerns are: 1) the increased costs associated with performing  a procedure in the operating room; 2) the risks, albeit minimal, of undergoing  general anesthesia; and 3) the considerable benefits to be accrued from  obtaining direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the eggs,  and the developmental competency of resultant embryos.       The increased success with GIFT undoubtedly reflects the artificial  environment provided by the laboratory in the IVF-ET procedure. Between  January 1, 1991, and December 31, 1992, we have performed a total of 12 GIFT  cycles, with an overall success rate of 20 percent.       Embryo cryopreservation, or freezing, is applied in our program when  embryos result from residual GIFT eggs or from non-transferred IVF embryos.  This procedure not only provides patients with a subsequent opportunity for  success at much reduced costs, but also circumvents the legal and ethical  issues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos. Therefore, as stipulated  by the American Fertility Society ethical guidelines for ART programs, from  both a practical and an ethical standpoint, all Assisted Reproduction programs  should have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys.       Gamete Micromanipulation - This ART procedure, which is still very new,  is applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen but  who have severe male factor infertility (less than 10 million sperm/ml in  combination with fewer than 20 perccent motile sperm, and/or less than 10  percent sperm with normal morphology). We are currently developing the  procedure of sub-zonal insertion (SZI), which entails injecting sperm under  the coating around the egg, the barrier normally penetrated by the sperm  through enzymatic digestion.       Available data from SZI programs world-wide indicate that only 5 to 10  percent of SZI cycles result in a pregnancy. This statistic undoubtedly  relates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the sperm.  Therefore, we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniques  for the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation. Such  efforts are unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that this technology  offers the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patients to  establish conception.

In the San Jose area we have a population of 800,000 and that population is served by 2 ice arenas.  In contrast, Kamloops, British Columbia has a population of about 50,000 and has 5 rinks!  There are also myriad ponds, pools, etc that freeze in the winter.  Down here it's hard to find a kid without a bicycle; up there it's hard to find a kid without a pair of skates.  And before you say \\\"what does he know? He's from California.\\\" let me say that I was born and raised in Trail, British Columbia, a town of about 8,000 with lots of ice in the winter.  My father did radio play by play for the local team, the Trail Smokeaters, who by  the way, were the last Canadian team to win the World Championship (back in 1961).  I was on skates almost as soon as I could walk, and have been playing recreational hockey for about 35 years.    Lack of ice is a big factor, but costs is a bigger factor.  Both my kids play for the Santa Clara Valley Hockey Association and this season, which just ended, cost me $75 per kid for membership in Hockey USA, plus $750 per kid for club dues.  The Hockey USA fees cover excess medical insurance, and the club dues cover ice time, officials, trophies, etc.  Other areas have similar fees, unless the city government subsidises some of the costs, as Stockton does.  By the way; most ice arenas are located in what could be called the \\\"inner city\\\" areas.  Eastridge and Vallco are exceptions ... Redwood City's rink is in an industrial area on Bay Rd, near 101, Berkeley's is near Ashby and Martin Luther King, Stockton's is in Oak Park, Sacramento's is in an older section of downtown (I forget the name of the street), Fresno's is out on the edge of town, just west of 99.  Santa Rosa's is a nice rink, but it's in an older section of town. Dublin's is outside of town, off 580.  Most of the rinks are old, and expensive to run, with huge electric bills and insurance premiums.  If you want to buy ice time expect to pay around $100 per hour at any of these rinks.  Some of them give you a 60 minute hour for your money; others give you a 50 minute hour and include the resurfacing time in the fee.  \",\"Another fish to check out is Richard Rast -- he works for Lockheed Missiles, but is on-site at NASA Johnson.

Now, after the Sumgait tragedy, we, the victims, divide our lives into \\\"before\\\" and ''after.\\\" We talk like that: that was before the war. Like the people who went through World War II and considered it a whole epoch, a fate. No matter how many years go by, no matter how long we live, it will never be forgotten. On the contrary, some of the moments become even  sharper: in our rage, in our sorrow, we saw everything differently, but now . . . They say that you can see more with distance, and we can see those inhuman events with more clarity now . . . we more acutely perceive our losses and everything that happened.  Nineteen eighty-eight was a leap year. Everyone fears a leap year and wants it to pass as quickly as possible. Yet we never thought that that leap year would be such a black one for every Sumgait Armenian: those who lost someone and  those who didn't.  That second to last day of winter was ordinary for our family, although you  could already smell danger in the air. But we didn't think that the danger was near and possible, so we didn't take any steps to save ourselves. At least, as my parents say, at least we should have done something to save the children.  My parents themselves are not that old, 52 and 53 years. But then they thought that they had already lived enough, and did everything they could to save us.  In our apartment the tragedy started on February 28, around five in the afternoon. I call it a tragedy, and I repeat: it was a tragedy even though all our family survived. When I recall how they broke down our door my skin crawls; even now, among Armenians, among people who wish me only well, I feel like it's all starting over again. I remember how that mob broke into our  apartment . . . My parents were standing in the hall. My father had an axe in  his hands and had immediately locked both of the doors. Our door was rarely  locked since friends and neighbors often dropped by. We're known as a  hospitable family, and we just never really thought about whether the people  who were coming to see us were Azerbaijanis, Jews, or Russians. We had friends of many nationalities, even a Turkmen woman.  My parents were in the hall, my father with an axe. I remember him telling my  mother, \\\"Run to the kitchen for a knife.\\\" But Mother was detached, pale, as  though she had decided to sell her life a bit dearer. To be honest I never  expected it of her, she's afraid of getting shot and afraid of the dark. A  girlfriend was at the house that day, a Russian girl, Lyuda, and Mamma said,  \\\"No matter what happens, no matter what they do to us, you're not to come out  of the bedroom. We're going to tell them that we're alone in the apartment.\\\"  We went into the bedroom. There were four of us. Marina and the Russian girl  crawled under the bed, and we covered them up with a rug, boxes of dishes, and Karina and I are standing there and looking at one another. The idea that  perhaps we were seeing each other for the last time flashed somewhere inside  me. I'm an emotional person and I express my emotions immediately. I wanted to embrace her and kiss her, as though it were the last second. And maybe Karina  was thinking the same thing, but she's quite reserved. We didn't have time to  say anything to each other because we immediately heard Mamma raise a shout.  There was so much noise from the tramping of feet, from the shouting, and from excited voices. I couldn't figure what was going on out there because the door to the bedroom was only open a crack. But when Mamma shouted the second time Karina ran out of the bedroom. I ran after her, I had wanted to hold her back, but when she opened the door and ran out into the hall they saw us  immediately. The only thing I managed to do was close the door behind me, at  least so as to save Marina and her friend. The mob was shouting, all of their  eyes were shining, all red, like from insomnia. At first about 40 people burst in, but later I was standing with my back to the door and couldn't see. They  came into the hall, into the kitchen, and dragged my father into the other  room. He didn't utter a word, he just raised the axe to hit them, but Mamma  snatched the axe from behind and said, \\\"Tell them not to touch the children.  Tell them they can do as they want with us, but not to harm the children.\\\" She said this to Father in Armenian.  There were Azerbaijanis from Armenia among the mob who broke in. They  understood Armenian perfectly. The local Azerbaijanis don't know Armenian,  they don't need to speak it. And one of them responded in Armenian: \\\"You and  your children both . . . we're going to do the same thing to you and your  children that you Armenians did in Kafan. They killed our women, our girls,  our mothers, they cut their breasts off, and burned our houses . . . ,\\\" and  so on and so forth, \\\"and we came to do the same thing to you.\\\" This whole time some of them are destroying the house and the others are shouting at us. They  were mostly young people, under 30. At first there weren't any older people  among them. And all of their faces were unfamiliar. Sumgait is a small town,  all the same, and we know a lot of people by their faces, especially me, I'm  a teacher.  So they dragged my father into the other room. They twisted his arms and took  him in there, no they didn't take him in there, they dragged him in there, because he was already unable to walk. They closed the door to that room all  but a crack. We couldn't see what was happening to Father, what they were  doing to him. Then a young man, about 26 years old, started to tear off  Mamma's sarafan, and Mamma shouted at him in Azerbaijani: \\\"I'm old enough to  be your mother! What are you doing?!\\\" He struck her. Now he's being held,  Mamma identified him. I hope he's convicted. Then they went after Karina,  who's been talking to them like a Komsomol leader, as though she were trying  to lead them down a different path, as they say, to influence their  consciousness. She told them that what they were doing was wrong, that they  mustn't do it. She said, \\\"Come on, let's straighten this out, without  emotions. What do you want? Who are you? Why did you come here? What did we  ever do to you?\\\" Someone tried to explain who they were and why they had come  into our home, but then the ones in the back--more of them kept coming and  coming--said, \\\"What are you talking to, them for. You should kill them. We  came here to kill them.\\\"  They pushed Karina, struck her, and she fell down. They beat her, but she  didn't cry out. Even when they tore her clothes off, she kept repeating, \\\"What did we do to you? What did we do to you?\\\" And even later, when she came to,  she said, \\\"Mamma, what did we do to them? Why did they do that to us?\\\"  That group was prepared, I know this because I noticed that some of them only  broke up furniture, and others only dealt with us. I remember that when they  were beating me, when they were tearing my clothes off, I felt neither pain  nor shame because my entire attention was riveted to Karina. All I could do  was watch how much they beat her and how painful it was for her, and what they did to her. That's why I felt no pain. Later, when they carried Karina off,  they beat her savagely . . . It's really amazing that she not only lived, but  didn't lose her mind . She is very beautiful and they did everything they  could to destroy her beauty. Mostly they beat her face, with their fists,  kicking her, using anything they could find.  Mamma, Karina, and I were all in one room. And again I didn't feel any pain,  just didn't feel any, no matter how much they beat me, no matter what they  did. Then one of those creeps said that there wasn't enough room in the apartment. They broke up the beds and the desk and moved everything into the  corners so there would be more room. Then someone suggested, \\\"Let's take her  outside.\\\"  Those beasts were in Heaven. They did what they would do every day if they  weren't afraid of the authorities. Those were their true colors. At the time  I thought that in fact they would always behave that way if they weren't  afraid of what would happen to them.  When they carried Karina out and beat Mamma-her face was completely covered  with blood--that's when I started to feel the pain. I blacked out several  times from the pain, but each moment that I had my eyes open it was as though  I were recording it all on film. I think I'm a kind person by nature, but I'm  vengeful, especially if someone is mean to me, and I don't deserve it. I hold  a grudge a long time if someone intentionally causes me pain. And every time  I would come to and see one of those animals on top of me, I'd remember them,  and I'll remember them for the rest of my life, even though people tell me  \\\"forget,\\\" you have to forget, you have to go on living.  At some point I remember that they stood me up and told me something, and  despite the fact that I hurt all over--I had been beaten terribly--I found the strength in myself to interfere with their tortures. I realized that I had to do something: resist them or just let them kill me to bring my suffering  to an end. I pushed one of them away, he was a real horse. I remember now that he's being held, too. As though they were all waiting for it, they seized me and took me out onto the balcony. I had long hair, and it was stuck all over me. One of the veranda shutters to the balcony was open, and I realized that they planned to throw me out the window, because they had already picked me up with their hands, I was up in the air. As though for the last time I took a  really deep breath and closed my eyes, and somehow braced myself inside, I  suddenly became cold, as though my heart had sunk into my feet. And suddenly  I felt myself flying. I couldn't figure out if I was really flying or if I  just imagined it. When I came to I thought now I'm going to smash on the  ground. And when it didn't happen I opened my eyes and realized that I was  still lying on the floor. And since I didn't scream, didn't beg them at all, they became all the more wild, like wolves. They started to trample me with their feet. Shoes with heels on them, and iron horseshoes, like they had spe- cially put them on. Then I lost consciousness.  I came to a couple of times and waited for death, summoned it, beseeched it.  Some people ask for good health, life, happiness, but at that moment I didn't  need any of those things. I was sure that none of us would survive, and I had  even forgotten about Marina; and if none of us was alive, it wasn't worth  living.  There was a moment when the pain was especially great. I withstood inhuman  pain, and realized that they were going to torment me for a long time to come  because I had showed myself to be so tenacious. I started to strangle myself,  and when I started to wheeze they realized that with my death I was going to put an end to their pleasures, and they pulled my hands from my throat. The  person who injured and insulted me most painfully I remember him very well,  because he was the oldest in the group. He looked around 48. I know that he  has four children and that he considers himself an ideal father and person,  one who would never do such a thing. Something came over him then, you see,  even during the investigation he almost called me \\\"daughter,\\\" he apologized,  although, of course, he knew that I'd never forgive him. Something like that  I can never forgive. I have never injured anyone with my behavior, with my  words, or with my deeds, I have always put myself in the other person's shoes, but then, in a matter of hours, they trampled me entirely. I shall never  forget it.  I wanted to do myself in then, because I had nothing to lose, because no one  could protect me. My father, who tried to do something against that hoard of  beasts by himself, could do nothing and wouldn't be able to do anything. I knew that I was even sure that he was no longer alive.  And Ira Melkumian, my acquaintance I knew her and had been to see her family a couple of times--her brother tried to save her and couldn't, so he tried to  kill her, his very own sister. He threw an axe at her to kill her and put an  end to her suffering. When they stripped her clothes off and carried her into  the other room, her brother knew what awaited her. I don't know which one it  was, Edik or Igor. Both of them were in the room from which the axe was  thrown. But the axe hit one of the people carrying her and so they killed her  and made her death even more excruciating, maybe the most excruciating of all  the deaths of those days in Sumgait. I heard about it all from the neighbor  from the Melkumians' landing. His name is Makhaddin, he knows my family a  little. He came to see how we had gotten settled in the new apartment in Baku, how we were feeling, and if we needed anything. He's a good person. He said,  \\\"You should praise God that you all survived. But what I saw with my own eyes, I, a man, who has seen so many people die, who has lived a whole life, I,\\\" he says, \\\"nearly lost my mind that day. I had never seen the likes of it and  think I never shall again.\\\" The door to his apartment was open and he saw  everything. One of the brothers threw the axe, because they had already taken  the father and mother out of the apartment. Igor, Edik, and Ira remained. He  saw Ira, naked, being carried into the other room in the hands of six or seven people. He told us about it and said he would never forget it. He heard the  brothers shouting something, inarticulate from pain, rage, and the fact that  they were powerless to do anything. But all the same they tried to  do something. The guy who got hit with the axe lived.                                                                           I     I  After I had been unsuccessful at killing myself I saw them taking Marina and  Lyuda out of the bedroom. I was in such a state that I couldn't even  remember my sister's name. I wanted to cry \\\"Marina!\\\" out to her, but could not. I looked at her and knew that it was a familiar, dear face, but couldn't for the life of me remember what her name was and who she was. And thus I saved her, because when they were taking her out, she, as it turns out, had told them that she had just been visiting and that she and Lyuda were both there by chance, that they weren't Armenians. Lyuda's a Russian, you can tell  right away, and Marina speaks Azerbaijani wonderfully and she told them that she was an Azerbaijani. And I almost gave her away and doomed her. I'm glad  that at least Marina came out of this all in good physical health . . .  although her spirit was murdered . . .  At some point I came to and saw Igor, Igor Agayev, my acquaintance, in that  mob. He lives in the neighboring building. For some reason I remembered his  name, maybe I sensed my defense in him. I called out to him in Russian, \\\"Igor, help!\\\" But he turned away and went into the bedroom. Just then they were  taking Marina and Lyuda out of the bedroom. Igor said he knew Marina and  Lyuda, that Marina in fact was Azerbaijani, and he took both of them to the  neighbors.  And the idea stole through me that maybe Igor had led them to our apartment,  something like that, but if he was my friend, he was supposed to save me.   Then they were striking me very hard--we have an Indian vase, a metal one,  they were hitting me on the back with it and I blacked out--they took me out  onto the balcony a second time to throw me out the window. They were already  sure that I was dead because I didn't react at all to the new blows. Someone  said, \\\"She's already dead, let's throw her out.\\\" When they carried me out onto the balcony for the second time, when I was about to die the second time, I  heard someone say in Azerbaijani: \\\"Don't kill her, I know her, she's a  teacher.\\\" I can still hear that voice ringing in my ears, but I can't remember whose voice it was. It wasn't Igor, because he speaks Azerbaijani with an  accent: his mother is Russian and they speak Russian at home. He speaks Azerbaijani worse than our Marina does. I remember when they carried me in and threw me on the bed he came up to me, that person, and  I having opened my  eyes, saw and recognized that person, but immediately passed out cold. I had  been beaten so much that I didn't have the strength to remember him. I only  remember that this person was older and he had a high position. Unfortunately  I can't remember anything more.  What should I say about Igor? He didn't treat me badly. I had heard a lot  about him, that he wasn't that good a person, that he sometimes drank too much. Once he boasted to me that he had served in Afghanistan. He knew that  women usually like bravery in a man. Especially if a man was in Afghanistan, if he was wounded, then it's about eighty percent sure that he will be treated very sympathetically, with respect. Later I found out that he had served in  Ufa, and was injured, but that's not in Afghanistan, of course. I found that  all out later.  Among the people who were in our apartment, my Karina also saw the Secretary  of the Party organization. I don't know his last name, his first name is  Najaf, he is an Armenian-born Azerbaijani. But later Karina wasn't so sure, she was no longer a hundred percent sure that it was he she saw, and she  didn't want to endanger him. She said, \\\"He was there,\\\" and a little while  later, \\\"Maybe they beat me so much that I am confusing him with someone else.  No, it seems like it was he.\\\" I am sure it was he because when he came to see  us the first time he said one thing, and the next time he said something  entirely different. The investigators haven't summoned him yet. He came to see us in the Khimik boarding house where we were living at the time. He brought  groceries and flowers, this was right before March 8th; he almost started  crying, he was so upset to see our condition. I don't know if he was putting  us on or not, but later, after we had told the investigator and they summoned  him to the Procuracy, he said that he had been in Baku, he wasn't in Sumgait.  The fact that he changed his testimony leads me to believe that Karina is  right, that in fact it was he who was in our apartment. I don't know how the  investigators are now treating him. At one point I wondered and asked, and was told that he had an alibi and was not in our apartment. Couldn't he have gone  to Baku and arranged an alibi? I'm not ruling out that possibility.  Ill now return to our apartment. Mamma had come to. You could say that she  bought them off with the gold Father gave her when they were married: her  wedding band and her watch were gold. She bought her own and her husband's  lives with them. She gave the gold to a 14-year old boy. Vadim Vorobyev. A  Russian boy, he speaks Azerbaijani perfectly. He's an orphan who was raised by his grandfather and who lives in Sumgait on Nizami Street. He goes to a  special school, one for mentally handicapped children. But I'll say this--I'm  a teacher all the same and in a matter of minutes I can form an opinion--that boy is not at all mentally handicapped. He's healthy, he can think just fine,  and analyze, too . . . policemen should be so lucky. And he's cunning, too.  After that he went home and tore all of the pictures out of his photo album.  He beat Mamma and demanded gold, saying, \\\"Lady, if you give us all the gold  and money in your apartment we'll let you live.\\\" And Mamma told them where  the gold was. He brought in the bag and opened it, shook out the contents, and  everyone who was in the apartment jumped on it, started knocking each other  over and taking the gold from one another. I'm surprised they didn't kill one  another right then.  Mamma was still in control of herself. She had been beaten up, her face was black and blue from the blows, and her eyes were filled with blood, and she  ran into the other room. Father was lying there, tied up, with a gag in his mouth and a pillow over his face. There was a broken table on top of the pil- low. Mamma grabbed Father and he couldn't walk; like me, he was half dead,  halfway into the other world. He couldn't comprehend anything, couldn't see,  and was covered with black and blue. Mamma pulled the gag out of his mouth,  it was some sort of cloth, I think it was a slipcover from an armchair.  The bandits were still in our apartment, even in the room Mamma pulled Father  out of, led him out of, carried him out of. We had two armchairs in that room, a small magazine table, a couch, a television, and a screen. Three people  were standing next to that screen, and into their shirts, their pants,  everywhere imaginable, they were shoving shot glasses and cups from the coffee service--Mamma saw them out of the corner of her eye. She said, \\\"I was afraid  to turn around, I just seized Father and started pulling him, but at the  threshold I couldn't hold him up, he fell down, and I picked him up again and  dragged him down the stairs to the neighbors'.\\\" Mamma remembered one of the  criminals, the one who had watched her with his face half-turned toward her,  out of one eye. She says, \\\"I realized that my death would come from that  person. I looked him in the eyes and he recoiled from fear and went stealing.\\\" Later they caught that scoundrel. Meanwhile, Mamma grabbed Father and left.  I was alone. Igor had taken Marina away, Mamma and Father were gone, Karina  was already outside, I didn't know what they were doing to her. I was left all alone, and at that moment . . . I became someone else, do you understand? Even though I knew that neither Mother and Father in the other room, nor Marina and Lyuda under the bed could save me, all the same I somehow managed to hold out. I went on fighting them, I bit someone, I remember, and I scratched another.  But when I was left alone I realized what kind of people they were, the ones  I had observed, the ones who beat Karina, what kind of people they were, the  ones who beat me, that it was all unnecessary, that I was about to die and  that all of that would die with me.  At some point I took heart when I saw the young man from the next building. I  didn't know his name, but we would greet one another when we met, we knew that we were from the same microdistrict. When I saw him I said, \\\"Neighbor, is that you?\\\" In so doing I placed myself in great danger. He realized that if I lived I would remember him. That's when he grabbed the axe. The axe that had been  taken from my father. I automatically fell to my knees and raised my hands to  take the blow of the axe, although at the time it would have been better if he had struck me in the head with the axe and put me out of my misery. When he  started getting ready to wind back for the blow, someone came into the room.  The newcomer had such an impact on everyone that my neighbor's axe froze in  the air. Everyone stood at attention for this guy, like soldiers in the  presence of a general. Everyone waited for his word: continue the atrocities  or not. He said, \\\"Enough, let's go to the third entryway.\\\" In the third  entryway they killed Uncle Shurik, Aleksandr Gambarian. This confirms once  again that they had prepared in advance. Almost all of them left with him, as  they went picking up pillows, blankets, whatever they needed, whatever they  found, all the way up to worn out slippers and one boot, someone else had  already taken the other.  Four people remained in the room, soldiers who didn't obey their general. They had to have come recently, because other faces had flashed in front of me over those 2 to 3 hours, but I had never seen those three. One of them, Kuliyev (I  identified him later), a native of the Sisian District of Armenia, an  Azerbaijani, had moved to Azerbaijan a year before. He told me in Armenian: \\\"Sister, don't be afraid, I'll drive those three Azerbaijanis out of here.\\\" That's just what he said, \\\"those Azerbaijanis,\\\" as though he himself were not  Azerbaijani, but some other nationality, he said with such hatred, \\\"I'll drive them out of here now, and you put your clothes on, and find a hammer and nails and nail the door shut, because they'll be coming back from Apartment 41.\\\"  That's when I found out that they had gone to Apartment 41. Before that, the  person in the Eskimo dogskin coat, the one who came in and whom they listened  to, the \\\"general,\\\" said that they were going to the third entryway.  Kuliyev helped me get some clothes on, because l couldn't do it by myself.  Marina's old fur coat was lying on the floor. He threw it over my shoulders, I was racked with shivers, and he asked where he could find nails and a hammer.  He wanted to give them to me so that when he left I could nail the door shut.  But the door was lying on the floor in the hall.  I went out onto the balcony. There were broken windows, and flowers and dirt  from flowerpots were scattered on the floor. It was impossible to find  anything. He told me, \\\"Well, fine, I won't leave you here. Would any of the  neighbors let you in? They'll be back, they won't calm down, they know you're  alive.\\\" He told me all this in Armenian.  Then he returned to the others and said, \\\"What are you waiting for? Leave!\\\"  They said, \\\"Ah, you just want to chase us out of here and do it with her  yourself. No, we want to do it to.\\\" He urged them on, but gently, not  coarsely, because he was alone against them, although they were still just boys, not old enough to be drafted. He led them out of the room, and went down to the third floor with them himself, and said, \\\"Leave. What's the mat- ter, aren't you men? Go fight with the men. What do you want of her?\\\" And he came back upstairs. They wanted to come up after him and he realized that  he couldn't hold them off forever. Then he asked me where he could hide me. I  told him at the neighbors' on the fourth floor, Apartment 10, we were on really good terms with them.  We knocked on the door, and he explained in Azerbaijani. The neighbor woman  opened the door and immediately said, \\\"I'm an Azerbaijani.\\\" He said, \\\"I know.  Let her sit at your place a while. Don't open the door to anyone, no one knows about this, I won't tell anyone. Let her stay at your place.\\\" She says, \\\"Fine, have her come in.\\\" I went in. She cried a bit and gave me some stockings, I  had gone entirely numb and was racked with nervous shudders. I burst into  tears. Even though I was wearing Marina's old fur coat, it's a short one, a  half-length, I was cold all the same. I asked, \\\"Do you know where my family  is, what happened to them?\\\" She says, \\\"No, I don't know anything. I'm afraid  to go out of the apartment, now they're so wild that they don't look to see  who's Azerbaijani and who's Armenian.\\\" Kuliyev left. Ten minutes later my  neighbor says, \\\"You know, Lyuda, I don't want to lose my life because of you,  or my son and his wife. Go stay with someone else.\\\" During the butchery in our apartment one of the scum, a sadist, took my earring in his mouth--I had pearl earrings on--and ripped it out, tearing the earlobe. The other earring was  still there. When I'm nervous I fix my hair constantly, and then, when I  touched my ear, I noticed that I had one earring on. I took it out and gave it to her. She took the earring, but she led me out of the apartment.  I went out and didn't know where to go. I heard someone going upstairs. I  don't know who it was but assumed it was them. With tremendous difficulty I  end up to our apartment, I wanted to die in my own home. I go into the  apartment and hear that they are coming up to our place, to the fifth floor.  I had to do something. I went into the bedroom where Marina and Lyuda had  hidden and saw that the bed was overturned. Instead of hiding I squatted near  some broken Christmas ornaments, found an unbroken one, and started sobbing.  Then they came in. Someone said that there were still some things to take. I  think that someone pushed me under the bed. I lay on the floor, and there were broken ornaments on it, under my head and legs. I got all cut up, but I lay  there without moving. My heart was beating so hard it seemed the whole town  could hear it. There were no lights on. Maybe that's what saved me. They were  burning matches, and toward the end they brought in a candle. They started picking out the clothes that could still be worn. They took Father's sport  jacket and a bedspread, the end of which was under my head. They pulled on the one end, and it felt like they were pulling my hair out. I almost cried out.  And again I realized I wasn't getting out of there alive, and I started to  strangle myself again. I took my throat in one hand, and pressed the other on  my mouth, so as not to wheeze, so that I would die and they would only find me afterward. They were throwing the burned matches under the bed, and I got  burned, but I withstood it. Something inside of me held on, someone's hand was protecting me to the end. I knew that I was going to die, but I didn't know  how. I knew that if I survived I would walk out of that apartment, but if  I found out that one of my family had died, I would die for sure, because I  had never been so close to death and couldn't imagine how you could go on  living without your mother or father, or without your sister. Marina, I  thought, was still alive: she went to Lyuda's place or someone is hiding her.  I tried to think that Igor wouldn't let them be killed. He served in  Afghanistan, he should protect her.  While I was strangling myself I said my good-byes to everyone. And then I thought, how could Marina survive alone. If they killed all of us, how would  she live all by herself? There were six people in the room. They talked among  themselves and smoked. One talked about his daughter, saying that there was no children's footwear in our apartment that he could take for his daughter.  Another said that he liked the apartment--recently we had done a really good  job fixing everything up--and that he would live there after everything was  all over. They started to argue. A third one says, \\\"How come you get it? I  have four children, and there are three rooms here, that's just what I need.  All these years I've been living in God-awful places.\\\" Another one says,  \\\"Neither of you gets it. We'll set fire to it and leave.\\\" Then someone said  that Azerbaijanis live right next door, the fire could move over to their place.

To me, an absolute is something that is constant across time, culture, situations, etc.  True in every instance possible.  Do you agree with this definition?  I think you do:   A simple example:  In the New Testament (sorry I don't have a Bible at work, and can't provide a reference), women are instructed to be silent and cover their heads in church.  Now, this is scripture.  By your definition,  this is truth and therefore absolute.    Do women in your church speak?  Do they cover their heads?  If all  scripture is absolute truth, it seems to me that women speaking in and  coming to church with bare heads should be intolerable to evangelicals.   Yet, clearly, women do speak in evangelical churches and come with bare  heads.  (At least this was the case in the evangelical churches I grew  up in.)  Evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture  to be absolute truth.  (And there are plenty of other examples.) Can you reconcile this?   I don't claim that there are *no* absolutes.  I think there are very few, though, and determining absolutes is difficult.    But you are claiming that all of Scripture is absolute.  How can you determine absolutes derived from Scripture when you can't agree how to interpret the Scripture?    It's very difficult to see how you can claim something which is based  on your own *interpretation* is absolute.  Do you deny that your own background, education, prejudices, etc. come into play when you read the  Bible, and determine how to interpret a passsage?  Do you deny that  you in fact interpret?\",\" > > :has 2^80 possible keys.  > >  > > We don't yet know if all 80 bits count.  >  > That doesn't worry me at all; they're not going to cheat at something  >they can get caught at.

I agree that Arab news sources are also inherently biased. But I believe the statement I was reacting to was that since the american accounts of events are not fully like the Israeli accounts, the Americans are biased. I just thought that the Israelis had more motivation for bias.  The UN has tried many times to condemn Israel for its gross violation of human rights. However the US has vetoed most such attempts. It is interesting to note that the U.S. is often the only country opposing such condemnation (well the U.S. and Israel).

Before you can buy a handgun, you have to be an active member of a gun club. Well, how active can you be without a gun, chief?  Most gun owners feel a check of criminal records for crimes and mental disorders would be a very good thing -- IF it couldn't be abused by the government.  But every time this is proposed, there is always some trapdoor by which the government can deny your purchase EVEN IF you are perfectly qualified to own a gun.  And we oppose this.   Since the fatal accident rate for licensed automobile drivers in the US  is around 50 times the fatal accident rate of largely unlicensed gun owners, I'd think twice before using this analogy.  Besides, the problem is criminal use of guns, not accidents.  (There are about 500,000 criminal uses of guns in the US every year -- but only 1,400 accidents.)  I don't think it's necessary to spend a lot of energy making sure a criminal CAN shoot a gun before he gets one.  Just like the check, most gun owners feel positively about requiring safety courses -- IF they couldn't be abused by the government.  But  they already have!  One state doesn't hold the courses, another doesn't  fund them, a third holds them only once a year with limited attendence  to those with political connections.  Is this fair?   And how many of them acquire these guns from legal retail outlets? How many are borrowed, stolen, smuggled, bought on the black market?   Some states allow ONLY open carry.  Some allow ONLY concealed carry. Some allow both.  Some allow both, but require licenses for concealed  carry.  All you can say is if one of these modes has a clear advantage over another in terms of reducing crime or any other public good, then state legislators SOMEPLACE are doing exactly the wrong thing. Which means that they really don't have any objective reasons for  these laws other than their preferences -- a bad way to govern.   (\\\"Hot-livered.\\\"  I LOVE that expression.  Here, we say \\\"hot-headed.\\\")   Typically, the only criminals who can affect the rights of ALL the other people are criminals in government offices.  The rest of our criminals affect the rights of only one or a few people at a time, and they do this during the commission of a crime.  POSSESSION of a gun by someone hurts NO ONE else.  It is when they do something violent with that gun that the crime occurs.  Of course, it is a crime for a felon or ex-felon to possess a gun, but we don't feel it is right to treat common citizens who have lived good lives as if they were just \\\"pre-felons\\\" waiting to commit crimes.   I don't understand this sentence.   Life isn't fair.  I shouldn't need a fire extinguisher either, or flood and theft insurance, or to lock the doors of my house and car. But pining for a better world won't do anything to address what I have to do to live in this one.   None of ours, I'm sure.   Frankly, I'm not sure I know what good a driver's license does anyone, either.  The people who drive safely never use it, and the people who  drive drunk, drive without it!  However, a car is a good tool, but not one that protects my right to life. I rank the right to life somewhere north of the right to travel freely.   The question is not whether or not you want to own guns personally.  It's whether or not you think that ALL people should be forced to do as you do. I don't have any problem with someone who says they would never own a gun. I do have a problem with someone who says I should be prevented from owning one, too. -- \",\"  Wow, you're quicker to point out heresy than the Church in the Middle ages.

The anecdotal experiences of individuals is ``superstition, not science,'' he said. ``I don't think glutamate has made them sick.''  And Dr. Robert Kenney of George Washington University conducted an double blind test in 1980 showing that the 35 people who reacted to MSG also had similar reaction when they thought they had MSG but actually not.  Although there are many contradicting personal stories told in this group, some of them might have been due to other causes. But because the anti MSG emotion runs so high, that some blame it for anything and everything.

On February 4th, the Wall Street Journal carried a front-page article by Erik Larson entitled \\\"Armed Force.\\\"  I felt a reply was in order to his citation of the notorious scare stat that \\\"A Gun is 43 times more likely to kill than to protect.\\\"  I sent the following to the WSJ.  -----  Gun Stats & Mortal Risks  Preston K. Covey    Erik Larson~s even-handed article on Paxton Quigley (~Armed Force,~ 2/4/93, WSJ) cites the world~s most notorious ~statistic~ regarding guns in the home:  ~A pioneering study of residential gunshot deaths in King County, Washington, found that a gun in the home was 43 times more likely to be used to kill its owner, spouse, a friend or child than to kill an intruder.~  The ~43 times~ stat is everywhere these days;  it has grown in media lore like the proverbial urban myth: it was inflated by one pugilistic talk-show pundit to ~93.~  Given the shock value of the finding, the conclusion of the 1986 New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) study is remarkably understated:  ~The advisability of keeping firearms in the home for protection must be questioned.~     Responsible people should indeed question the risks and benefits of bringing a firearm into their home.   But what we need to know is this:  What exactly are the risks and benefits?  The NEJM testimony is neither the whole truth about the benefits nor nothing but the truth about the risks.  Further, as with motor vehicles, we want to know:  What control do we have over the risks and benefits?  And, as with the risks of cancer or heart disease or auto accidents:  How can we minimize the risks?  Like raw highway death tolls, the NEJM stat is not very helpful here.    The NEJM finding purports to inform us, but it is framed to warn us off.  It is widely promulgated in the media as a ~scare stat,~ a misleading half-truth whose very formulation is calculated to prejudice and terrify.  The frightful statistic screams for itself:  The risks far outweigh the benefits, yes?   What fool would run these risks?   If your car were 43 times more likely to kill you, a loved one, a dear friend or an innocent child than to get you to your destination,  should you not take the bus?     Uncritical citation puts the good name of statistics in the bad company of lies and damned lies.   Surely, we can do better where lives are at stake.   Let~s take a closer look at this risky business:   The ~43 times~ stat of the NEJM study is the product of dividing the number of home intruders/aggressors justifiably killed in self-defense (the divisor) into the number of family members or acquaintances  killed by a gun in the home (the dividend).  The divisor of this risk equation is 9: in the study~s five-year sample there were 2 intruders and 7 other cases of self-defense.  The dividend is 387:  in the study there were 12 accidental deaths, 42 criminal homicides, and 333 suicides.  387 divided by 9 yields 43.  There were a total of 743 gun-related deaths in King County between 1978 and 1983,  so the study leaves 347 deaths outside of homes unaccounted.   The NEJM~s notorious ~43 times~ statistic is seriously misleading on six counts:   1.  The dividend is misleadingly characterized in the media:  the ~or acquaintances~ of the study (who include your friendly drug dealers and neighborhood gang members) is equated to ~friends.~  The implication is that the offending guns target and kill only beloved family members, dear friends, and innocent children.  Deaths may all be equally tragic, but the character and circumstance of both victims and killers are relevant to the risk.  These crucial risk factors are masked by the calculated impression that the death toll is generated by witless Waltons shooting dear friends and friendly neighbors.  This is criminological hogwash.   2.   The study itself does not distinguish households or environs populated by people with violent, criminal, or substance-abuse histories -- where the risk of death is very high -- versus households inhabited by more civil folk (for example, people who avoid high-risk activities like drug dealing, gang banging and wife beating) -- where the risk is very low indeed.  In actuality, negligent adults allow fatal but avoidable accidents; and homicides are perpetrated mostly by people with histories of violence or abuse, people who are identifiably and certifiably at ~high risk~ for misadventure.  To ignore these obvious risk factors in firearm accidents and homicides is as misleading as ignoring the role of alcohol in vehicular deaths: by tautology, neither gun deaths nor vehicular deaths would occur without firearms or vehicles; but the person and circumstance of the gun owner or driver crucially affect the risk.    3.  One misleading implication of the way the NEJM stat is framed is that the mere presence of a gun in the home is much more likely to kill than to protect, and this obscures -- indeed, disregards -- the role of personal responsibility.  The typical quotation of this study (unlike Larson~s) attributes fatal agency to the gun:  ~A gun in the home is 43 times as likely to kill . . . .~  (The Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, a major promulgator of the NEJM statistic, uses this particular formulation.)  We can dispense with the silly debate about whether it~s people or guns that accomplish the killing:  again, by tautology, gun  deaths would not occur without the guns.  The question begged is how many deaths would occur anyway, without the guns.  In any case, people are the death-dealing agents, the guns are their lethal instruments.  The moral core of the personal  risk factors in gun deaths are personal responsibility and choice.  Due care and responsibility obviate gun accidents; human choice mediates homicide and suicide (by gun or otherwise).  The choice to own a gun need not condemn a person to NEJM~s high-risk pool.  The gun does not create this risk by itself.  People have a lot to say about what risk they run with guns in their homes.  For example, graduates of Paxton Quigley~s personal protection course do not run the touted ~43 times~ risk any more than skilled and sober drivers run the same risks of causing or suffering vehicular death as do reckless or drunk drivers.  Undiscriminating actuarials disregard and obscure the role of personal responsibility and choice, just as they disregard and obscure the role of socio-economic, criminological and other risk-relevant factors in firearm-related death.  This is why we resent insurance premiums and actuarial consigment to risk pools whose norms disregard our individualities.  Fortunately, nothing can consign us to the NEJM risk pool but our own lack of choice or responsibility in the matter.   4.  Suicide accounts for 84% of the deaths by gun in the home in the NEJM study.  As against the total deaths by gun in King County, including those outside the home, in-house suicides are 44% of the total death toll, which is closer to the roughly 50% proportion found by other studies.  Suicide is a social problem of a very different order from homicide or accidents.  The implication of the NEJM study is that these suicides might not occur without readily available guns.  It is true that attempted suicide by gun is likely to succeed.  It is not obviously true that the absence of a gun would prevent any or all of these suicides.  This is widely assumed or alleged, but the preponderance of research on guns and suicide actually shows otherwise, that this is wishful thinking in all but a few truly impulsive cases.  (See:  Bruce L. Danto et al., The Human Side of Homicide,  Columbia University Press, 1982;  Charles Rich et al.,  ~Guns and Suicide,~  American Journal of Psychiatry,  March 1990.)  If suicides were removed from the dividend of the NEJM study~s risk equation, the ~43 times~ stat would deflate to ~six.~  The inclusion of suicides in the NEJM risk equation -- like the causes, durability, or interdiction of suicidal intent itself -- is a profoundly debatable matter.  Quotations of the NEJM study totally disregard this issue.   5.  Citations of the NEJM study also mislead regarding the estimable rate of justifiable and excusable homicide.  Most measures, like the NEJM homicide rate, are based on the immediate disposition of cases.  But many homicides initially ruled criminal are appealed and later ruled self-defense.  In the literature on battered women, immediate case dispositions are notorious for under-representing the rate of justifiable or excusable homicide. Time~s January 18, 1993, cover story on women ~Fighting Back~ reported one study~s finding that 40% of women who appeal have their murder convictions thrown out.  Time~s July 17, 1989, cover story on a week of gun deaths reported 51% of the domestic cases as shootings by abuse victims; but only 3% of the homicides were reported as self-defense.  In a May 14, 1990, update, Time  reported that 12% of the homicides had eventually been ruled self-defense. In Time~s sample, the originally reported rate of self-defense was in error by a factor of four.  The possibility of such error is not acknowledged by promulgators of the NEJM statistic.    6.  While both the dividend and the product of the NEJM risk equation are arguably inflated, the divisor is unconscionably misleading.  The divisor of this equation counts only aggressors who are killed,  not aggressors who are successfully thwarted without being killed or even shot at.   The utility of armed self-defense is the other side of the coin from the harms done with guns in homes.  What kind of moral idiocy is it to measure this utility only in terms of killings ?  Do we measure the utility of our police solely in terms of felons killed  -- as opposed to the many many more who are otherwise foiled, apprehended, or deterred?  Should we not celebrate (let alone count ) those cases where no human life is lost as successful armed defenses?  The question posed to media that cite the NEJM scare stat is this:  Why neglect the compendious research on successful armed defense, notably by criminologist Gary Kleck (Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America , Aldine de Gruyter, 1992)?  Kleck~s estimations of the rate and risk of defensive firearm use are based on victimization surveys as well as other studies:  the rate is high (about one million a year) and the risk is good (gun defenders fare better than anyone, either those who resort to other forms of resistance or those who do not resist).  Dividing one million gun defenses a year by 30,000 annual gun deaths (from self-defense, homicides, suicides, and accidents) yields 33.  Thus, we can construct a much more favorable statistic than the NEJM scare stat:    A gun is 33 times more likely to be used to defend against assault or other crime than to kill anybody.      Of course, Kleck~s critics belittle the dividend of this calculation; what is good news for gun defenders is bad news for gun control.  We should indeed question the basis and method of Kleck~s high estimation of defensive firearm use, as I have questioned the NEJM statistic.  Clearly, the issue of how to manage mortal risks is not settled by uncritical citation of statistics.   One thing troubles me still:  we can hardly escape the unquestioned NEJM scare stat in our media,  but we hardly ever find Kleck~s good work mentioned,  even critically. \",\"     For discussion purposes, I will ignore dynamic effects like pulses in the exhaust pipe, and try to paint a useful mental picture.  1.  Unless an engine is supercharged, the pressure available to force air into the intake tract is _atmospheric_.  At the time the intake valve is opened, the pressure differential available to move air is only the difference between the combustion chamber pressure (left over after the exhaust stroke) and atmospheric.  As the piston decends on the intake stroke, combustion chamber pressure is decreased, allowing atmospheric pressure to move more air into the intake tract.  At no time does the pressure ever become \\\"negative\\\", or even approach a good vacuum.  2.  At the time of the exhaust valve closing, the pressure in the combustion chamber is essentially the pressure of the exhaust system up to the first major flow restriction (the muffler).  Note that the volume of gas that must flow through the exhaust is much larger than the volume that must flow through the intake, because of the temperature difference and the products of combustion.  3.  In the last 6-8 years, the Japanese manufacturers have started paying attention to exhaust and intake tuning, in pursuit of almighty horsepower.  At this point in time, on high-performance bikes, substitution of an aftermarket free-flow air filter will have almost zero affect on performance, because the stock intake system flows very well anyway.  Substitution of an aftermarket exhaust system will make very little difference, unless (in general) the new exhaust system is _much_ louder than the stocker.  4.  On older bikes,  exhaust back-pressure was the dominating factor. If free-flowing air filters were substituted, very little difference was noted, unless a free-flowing exhaust system was installed as well.  5.  In general, an engine can be visualized as an air pump.  At any given RPM, anything that will cause the engine to pump more air, be it on the intake or exhaust side, will cause it to produce more horsepower. Pumping more air will require recalibration (rejetting) of the carburetor.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\",\"thus  Curiously, in modern PostScript, the point in a polygon problem can be solved even more easily.

It was never a very stable package, but now it seems to crash every   day.  The worst part about it is that it does not crash consistently: ie I   can't reproduce crashes, and they are not always GPF's in the same   application. Sometimes I can recover by simply closing the application   that caused an error, but other times, windows acts very strange, and I   need to re-boot.  Some background:  I have a Leading Edge 486sx25 with Phoenix BIOS.  When I   first got it it had 4Mg of memory.  It ran windows fine (not too many   GPF's).  Then, a couple of weekends ago, I installed Lotus 123 for windows   (with ATM), a game card and an additional 4  1Mg SIMMS.  The Leading edge   machine is kind of strange, in that it has the IDE controler built into   the motherboard, the CPU is actually on a sparate board that plugs into   the motherboard and the SIMMS it uses are Macintosh SIMMS! Apparently I   was told that the Leading Edge had the parity bit built into the mother   board.  The original 4Mg 80ns SIMMS where of the 2 chip variety from   SAMSUNG, and the ones I installed are 8 chip SIMMS. They are recognized   fine by the BIOS RAM check. The game card is a generic $20 gamecard.  The reason why I mention the hardware like this is that sometimes   rebooting the machine using the reset button or ctl-alt-del still leaves   the machine kind of flaky, but turning it on and off doesn't.   I haven't tried taking out the RAM or the game card, because as I said   these GPF are not reproducible at will.  I have gone through and entire   day using the computer with no problems and then I might get 5 or so GPF's   in the sppace of 20 minutes?  What can I do.  This situation is most annoying... Are there any good   diagnostic tools for hardware? Do you think that this might be a software   problem (ie EMM386 etc.)? If it helps, i have manage to get GPF's on After   Dark, quicken, Paint shop pro. A lot of them have been in user.exe or   gdi.exe.  Any help is truly appreciated.....  -Eric\",\"If you hold off, there are a number of interesting convertibles coming to market in the next few years.

The point is that the land was sold legally, often at prices above its actual value.  It was legal, and good business for the sellers, though it left the Palestinians who worked the land in a poor situation.    I don't know if others share this opinion.  It is mine, and I'm sure there are some who agree and some who don't The way I see it, the fallahin were caught in circumstances  beyond their control, in that since they didn't own the land, they didn't have a say. Of course, now for the sake of the \\\"greater  Arab unity\\\" the Arabs are angry that the land was sold to the Jews (an act that is illegal in Jordan), but when it happened, it was just  business.     The purpose of buying the land was to provide space and jobs for  Jewish immigrants.

But they have been systematically            IGNORING or SUPPRESSING an excellent one for 30 years!                  The late Physicist Dewey B. Larson's comprehensive            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he            calls the \\\"Reciprocal System\\\", is built on two fundamental            postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of            space and time:                      (1) \\\"The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE            component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE            UNITS, and in two RECIPROCAL forms, SPACE and TIME.\\\"                      (2) \\\"The physical universe conforms to the relations of            ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its magnitudes are            ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN.\\\"                      From these two postulates, Larson developed a COMPLETE            Theoretical Universe, using various combinations of            translational, vibrational, rotational, and vibrational-           rotational MOTIONS, the concepts of IN-ward and OUT-ward            SCALAR MOTIONS, and speeds in relation to the Speed of Light            (which Larson called \\\"UNIT VELOCITY\\\" and \\\"THE NATURAL            DATUM\\\").                        At each step in the development, Larson was able to            MATCH objects in his Theoretical Universe with objects in the            REAL physical universe, (photons, sub-atomic particles            [INCOMPLETE ATOMS], charges, atoms, molecules, globular star            clusters, galaxies, binary star systems, solar systems, white            dwarf stars, pulsars, quasars, ETC.), even objects NOT YET            DISCOVERED THEN (such as EXPLODING GALAXIES, and GAMMA-RAY            BURSTS).                            And applying his Theory to his NEW model of the atom,            Larson was able to precisely and accurately CALCULATE inter-           atomic distances in crystals and molecules, compressibility            and thermal expansion of solids, and other properties of            matter.                  All of this is described in good detail, with-OUT fancy            complex mathematics, in his books.                   BOOKS of Dewey B.

This is the            organization that was started to promote Larson's Theory.             They have other related publications, including the quarterly            journal \\\"RECIPROCITY\\\".                         Physicist Dewey B. Larson's Background                     Physicist Dewey B. Larson was a retired Engineer            (Chemical or Electrical).  He was about 91 years old when he            died in May 1989.  He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in            Engineering Science from Oregon State University.  He            developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE            chemical properties based only on the elements used.                      Larson's lack of a fancy \\\"PH.D.\\\" degree might be one            reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is            NOT A VALID REASON.  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider            to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES.  At the same            time, it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX            physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer,            well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC            ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, ETC..                       Larson did NOT have the funds, etc. to experimentally            test his Theory.  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so.             He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER            researchers' experimental and observational data.  And in            many cases, HIS explanation FIT BETTER.                      A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX            physicists and astronomers have!  They CLAIM to be looking            for a \\\"unified field theory\\\" that works, but have been            IGNORING one for over 30 years now!                      \\\"Modern physics\\\" does NOT explain the physical universe            so well.  Some parts of some of Larson's books are FULL of            quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who            agree.  And remember that \\\"epicycles\\\", \\\"crystal spheres\\\",            \\\"geocentricity\\\", \\\"flat earth theory\\\", etc., ALSO once SEEMED            to explain it well, but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG.                           Prof. Frank H. Meyer, Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior,            was/is a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson's Theory, and was (or            still is) President of Larson's organization, \\\"THE            INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE\\\", and Editor of            their quarterly Journal \\\"RECIPROCITY\\\".  He moved to            Minneapolis after retiring.                   \\\"Super Collider\\\" BOONDOGGLE!

It would be a GROSS            WASTE of money, and contribute almost NOTHING of \\\"scientific\\\"            value.                      Most physicists don't realize it, but, according to the            comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist            Dewey B. Larson, as described in his books, the strange GOOFY            particles (\\\"mesons\\\", \\\"hyperons\\\", ALLEGED \\\"quarks\\\", etc.)            which they are finding in EXISTING colliders (Fermi Lab,            Cern, etc.) are really just ATOMS of ANTI-MATTER, which are            CREATED by the high-energy colliding beams, and which quickly            disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible            with their environment.                      A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a            few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not            seen there before, and the physicists will be EVEN MORE            CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW!                      Are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $8.3            BILLION cost?!!  Don't we have much more important uses for            this WASTED money?!                            Another thing to consider is that the primary proposed            location in Texas has a serious and growing problem with some            kind of \\\"fire ants\\\" eating the insulation off underground            cables.  How much POISONING of the ground and ground water            with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of            the \\\"Supercollider\\\"?!                                 Naming the \\\"Super Collider\\\" after Ronald Reagon, as            proposed, is TOTALLY ABSURD!  If it is built, it should be            named after a leading particle PHYSICIST.                     LARSONIAN Anti-Matter                           In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe, anti-matter is NOT a simple case of            opposite charges of the same types of particles.  It has more            to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the            photons of which they are made, in relation to the            vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light,            which Larson calls \\\"Unit Velocity\\\" and the \\\"Natural Datum\\\".                       In Larson's Theory, a positron is actually a particle of            MATTER, NOT anti-matter.  When a positron and electron meet,            the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their            respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each            other.                        In Larson's Theory, the ANTI-MATTER half of the physical            universe has THREE dimensions of TIME, and ONLY ONE dimension            of space, and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our            MATERIAL half.                      LARSONIAN Relativity                           The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury            has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the            rate of 574 seconds of arc per century.  531 seconds of this            advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational            perturbations from the other planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter,            etc.).  The remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to            help \\\"prove\\\" Einstein's \\\"General Theory of Relativity\\\".                      But the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieved results            CLOSER to the 43 seconds than \\\"General Relativity\\\" can, by            INSTEAD using \\\"SPECIAL Relativity\\\".  In one or more of his            books, he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH            ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury.                      Larson TOTALLY REJECTED \\\"General Relativity\\\" as another            MATHEMATICAL FANTASY.  He also REJECTED most of \\\"Special            Relativity\\\", including the parts about \\\"mass increases\\\" near            the speed of light, and the use of the Lorentz Transform on            doppler shifts, (Those quasars with red-shifts greater than            1.000 REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT,            although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME.).                       In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe, there are THREE dimensions of time instead            of only one.  But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured            from our material half of the physical universe.  The one            dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time.  At low            relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are            NEGLIGIBLE; but at high speeds, they become significant, and            the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR.            [Larson often used the term \\\"COORDINATE TIME\\\" when writing            about this.]                            In regard to \\\"mass increases\\\", it has been PROVEN in            atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near            the speed of light.  But the formula for acceleration is            ACCELERATION = FORCE / MASS, (a = F/m).  Orthodox physicists            are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR: FORCE.  In Larson's Theory,            mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero.  FORCE is            actually a MOTION, or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS, or RELATIONS            BETWEEN MOTIONS, including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS.             The expansion of the universe, for example, is an OUTward            SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of            the so-called \\\"Big Bang\\\" (which is yet another MATHEMATICAL            FANTASY).                                                                 THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION                 I wish to recommend to EVERYONE the book \\\"THE UNIVERSE            OF MOTION\\\", by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North Pacific            Publishers, (P.O. Box 13255, Portland, Oregon  97213), 456            pages, indexed, hardcover.                      It contains the Astrophysical portions of a GENERAL            UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by that            author, an UNrecognized GENIUS, more than thirty years ago.                      It contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL Astrophysical            mysteries, including the FORMATION of galaxies, binary and            multiple star systems, and solar systems, the TRUE ORIGIN of            the \\\"3-degree\\\" background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma-           ray bursts, and the TRUE NATURE of quasars, pulsars, white            dwarfs, exploding galaxies, etc..                      It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL            looking for, if they are ready to seriously consider it with            OPEN MINDS!                      The following is an example of his Theory's success:            In his first book in 1959, \\\"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL            UNIVERSE\\\", Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING            GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding            them.  They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson's            comprehensive Theory.  And when QUASARS were discovered, he            had an immediate related explanation for them also.                    GAMMA-RAY BURSTS                 Astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching            their heads about the mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS.  They were            originally thought to originate from \\\"neutron stars\\\" in the            disc of our galaxy.  But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in            Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions            uniformly, and their source locations in space do NOT            correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of            directional coincidence).                      Gamma-ray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by            the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson.  According to page 386 of            his book \\\"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\\\", published in 1984, the            gamma-ray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the            ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls            the \\\"Cosmic Sector\\\".  Because of the relationship between the            anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and            the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can            pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at            random.  (This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do            not correspond with known objects, and come from all            directions uniformly.)                      I wonder how close to us in space a source location            would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most            life on Earth!  There would be NO WAY to predict one, NOR to            stop it!                      Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past, which            are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were            actually caused by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS!                   LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation                           About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the            vicinity of the sun are binary or double.  But orthodox            astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory            theory about how they form or why there are so many of them.                      But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY            CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of            the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey            B. Larson.                      I will try to summarize Larsons explanation, which is            detailed in Chapter 7 of his book \\\"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\\\"            and in some of his other books.                      First of all, according to Larson, stars do NOT generate            energy by \\\"fusion\\\".  A small fraction comes from slow            gravitational collapse.  The rest results from the COMPLETE            ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements (heavier than IRON).  Each            element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT.  The heavier the            element is, the lower is this limit.  A star's internal            temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and            absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually            reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and            lighter elements.                      When the internal temperature of the star reaches the            destructive temperature limit of IRON, there is a Type I            SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION!  This is because there is SO MUCH iron            present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms            and the atom building process, which Larson explains in some            of his books [better than I can].                      When the star explodes, the lighter material on the            outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less            than the speed of light.  The heavier material in the center            portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to            the speed of light, because of the high temperature.  The            explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light, and            it expands OUTWARD IN TIME, which is equivalent to INWARD IN            SPACE, and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while.                      Over long periods of time, both masses start to fall            back gravitationally.  The material that had been blown            outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star.  The            material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a            WHITE DWARF star.  BOTH stars then start moving back toward            the \\\"MAIN SEQUENCE\\\" from opposite directions on the H-R            Diagram.                      The chances of the two masses falling back into the            exact same location in space, making a single lone star            again, are near zero.  They will instead form a BINARY            system, orbiting each other.                       According to Larson, a white dwarf star has an INVERSE            DENSITY GRADIENT (is densest at its SURFACE), because the            material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown            outward) in time.   This ELIMINATES the need to resort to            MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about \\\"degenerate matter\\\", \\\"neutron            stars\\\", \\\"black holes\\\", etc..                   LARSONIAN Solar System Formation                 If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the            exploding star is relatively SMALL, then, instead of a single            white dwarf star, there will be SEVERAL \\\"mini\\\" white dwarf            stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably            still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affected            by its heat, etc.).  These will become PLANETS!                        In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, Larson used all            this information, and other principles of his comprehensive            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, to derive            his own version of Bode's Law.                         \\\"Black Hole\\\" FANTASY!                 I heard that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently            completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO \\\"black            holes\\\" merging together into a SINGLE \\\"black hole\\\", and            concluded that the new \\\"black hole\\\" would have MORE MASS than            the sum of the two original \\\"black holes\\\".                      Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED            FLAG, causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of \\\"black            holes\\\", etc.!                      After reading Physicist Dewey B. Larson's books about            his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe, especially his book \\\"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\\\", it is            clear to me that \\\"black holes\\\" are NOTHING more than            MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES!  The strange object at Cygnus X-1 is            just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR, NOT the \\\"black            hole\\\" that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want            to \\\"prove\\\" their theory.                           By the way, I do NOT understand why so much publicity is            being given to physicist Stephen Hawking.  The physicists and            astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawking's severe physical            problem somehow makes him \\\"wiser\\\".  It does NOT!                      I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist            Dewey B. Larson while he was still alive.  Widespread            publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson's            Theory, books, and organization (The International Society of            Unified Science).                                             ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION                 I heard of that concept many years ago, in connection            with UFO's and unorthodox inventors, but I never was able to            find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed.                      I found a possible clue about why they might work on            pages 112-113 of the book \\\"BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER\\\", by            the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson, which describes part of            Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe.  I quote one paragraph:                      \\\"As indicated in the preceding chapter, the development            of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally            different concept of the nature of electrical resistance.             The electrons, we find, are derived from the environment.  It            was brought out in Volume I [Larson's book \\\"NOTHING BUT            MOTION\\\"] that there are physical processes in operation which            produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that,            although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in            many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities            for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are            limited.  It follows that there is always a large excess of            free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the            universe, most of which are uncharged.  In this uncharged            state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension            space, because they are inherently rotating units of space,            and the relation of space to space is not motion.  In open            space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently            in the same location with respect to the natural reference            system, in the manner of a photon.  In the context of the            stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron,            like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by            the progression of the natural reference system.  All            material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons            similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation.             Meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later,            whereby electrons are returned to the environment.  The            electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth            therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level.\\\"                            Note that in Larson's Theory, UNcharged electrons are            also massLESS, and are basically photons of light of a            particular frequency (above the \\\"unit\\\" frequency) spinning            around one axis at a particular rate (below the \\\"unit\\\" rate).             (\\\"Unit velocity\\\" is the speed of light, and there are            vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light,            according to Larson's Theory.)  [I might have the \\\"above\\\" and            \\\"below\\\" labels mixed up.]                      Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass-           LESS UN-charged electrons flying around at the speed of            light!                      If this is true, then the ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION            fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these            electrons, or other particles in space, perhaps GIVING them a            charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to            achieve propulsion. (In Larson's Theory, an electrical charge            is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular            frequency (above the \\\"unit\\\" frequency) superimposed on the            rotation of the particle.)                        The paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to            confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is            generated in clouds.               SUPPRESSION of LARSONIAN Physics                 The comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson has            been available for more than 30 YEARS, published in 1959 in            his first book \\\"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE\\\".                      It is TOTALLY UN-SCIENTIFIC for Hawking, Wheeler, Sagan,            and the other SACRED PRIESTS of the RELIGION they call            \\\"science\\\" (or \\\"physics\\\", or \\\"astronomy\\\", etc.), as well as            the \\\"scientific\\\" literature and the \\\"education\\\" systems, to            TOTALLY IGNORE Larson's Theory has they have.                      Larson's Theory has excellent explanations for many            things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers, such            as gamma-ray bursts and the nature of quasars.                      Larson's Theory deserves to be HONESTLY and OPENLY            discussed in the physics, chemistry, and astronomy journals,            in the U.S. and elsewhere.  And at least the basic principles            of Larson's Theory should be included in all related courses            at UW-EC, UW-Madison, Cambridge, Cornell University, and            elsewhere, so that students are not kept in the dark about a            worthy alternative to the DOGMA they are being fed.

Use of guns in crimes (in Norway): Some crimes are commited with guns that have been in the owners 'arms' for a long time, but these are rather the exeption.

For me it is a conclusion, and I have no more faith in it than I have in the premises and the argument used.       No, that's a word game. The term god is used in a different way usually. When you use a different definition it is your thing, but until it is commonly accepted you would have to say the way I define god is ... and that does not exist, it is existence itself, so I say it does not exist.   Interestingly, there are those who say that \\\"existence exists\\\" is one of the indubitable statements possible.   Further, saying god is existence is either a waste of time, existence is already used and there is no need to replace it by god, or you are implying more with it, in which case your definition and your argument so far are incomplete, making it a fallacy.

The primary reason, and the essence of the details that you are seeking, is that the Grahm-Rudman budget controls were working.  In fact, they were working so well that unless the feds did something, they were going to have to start cutting pork. So Bush and the Democrats got together in a Budget Summit and replaced Grahm-Rudman with the now historic Grand Compromise in which Bush \\\"consented\\\" to raise taxes in exchange for certain caps on spending increases.

Oak Park also has an illegal handgun ban as well, but does allow those with a \\\"collectors FFL\\\" to possess (\\\"collectible?\\\") handguns.   Probably a fine in practical terms.   It wouldn't impede your defense at all. There was an actual incident in Oak Park where a gas station owner engaged in a shootout with a handgun; the grand jury decided not to presecute. On the other hand, a black man used an illegally owned handgun in Oak Park to defend himself, and the Village tried to make an example out of him. An NRA Director who lived there made a stink about this, and it was decided not to charge the guy.

Presumably the protocol can be recovered (if by nothing else, differential analysis).  Postulate if you will, a chip (or logic) sitting between the clipper chip and its communications channel.  The purpose of this chip is twofold:       1) Transmit Channel       The spoof chip XORs the 30 bit encrypted serial number with      a secondary keying variable.  This renders the serial number      unrecoverable with just the system key   2) Recieve Channel       The spoof chip XORs the incoming encrypted serial number      with a secondary keying variable (assuming the serial number      is necessary for local operation).  This has the net result of hiding the serial number.  This gets more interesting when the number of serial numbers issued becomes large, making it difficult to distinguish between valid serial numbers and a spoofed serial number.  Without knowing the system key, you could lie about the serial number, but risk detection of the lie.  IF you had the system key and the encryption algorithm you could successfully lie with a lower probability of detection by emulating the format of your own serial number.\",\"All you have to do is turn it in to the police like you would an accident, get a report and send it in to your insurance company and they will contact the other guys insurance company and they will have to pay just as they would in an accident they caused.

[1]  Born 1964 Secretary-Typist Azsantekmontazh Trust Sumgait Construction and Installation Administration Secretary of the SMU Komsomol Organization  Resident at Building 17/33B, Apartment 15 Microdistrict No. 3 Sumgait [Azerbaijan]   On the 27th my sister Marina and I went to the movies the seven o'clock show, at the theater that is across from the City Party Committee, about 50 yards  away. The SK theater. They were showing an Argentinian film, \\\"The Abyss.\\\"  Before the film we noticed about 60 to 70 people standing near the podium at  the City Party Committee, but they were silent, there's no conversation  whatsoever, and we couldn't figure out what was going on. That is, we knew it  was about Karabagh, but what it was exactly, what they were talking about, if  someone gave a speech or not, we didn't know. We bought our tickets. There  were 30 or 40 people in the theater. This was a very small number for that  large movie theater. The film started. About 30 minutes later they stopped the film. A crowd burst in. About 60 people. They came up onto the stage. Well  mostly they were young people, from 16 to 23 years old. They demanded that an  Armenian woman come up onto the stage. They used foul language and said that  they were going to show what Azerbaijanis were capable of, what they could do  to Armenian girls. I thought that's what they meant because they had demanded  a girl specifically. Marina and I were sitting together. I told her to move  over, there were some Russian girls sitting nearby. So that if someone  recognized me or if something happened, they would take me, and not Marina.  It got quiet, 2 or 3 girls jumped up to run out, but the door was closed--it's only opened at the end of the   show--and they returned to their seats.  Everyone in the theater was looking at one another, Russians, Azerbaijanis,  people of various nationalities. But no one reacted at all, no one in the  auditorium made a sound. They were silent, looking at one another, and  gradually started to leave. Some guy, a really fat one, says, \\\"OK, we've  scared them enough, let's leave.\\\" They leave slowly, pompously. It seemed to  me that those people were not themselves. Either they had smoked a bunch of  \\\"anasha\\\", or had taken something else, because they all looked beastly, like  they were ready to tear anyone apart. Then it was all over, as though nothing  had happened at all. The film started up again, it was one of those cheerful  films which should have only brought pleasure, made you happy to be alive. We  could barely sit to the end. So it had started at seven it was over by nine,  and it was dark . . .  Marina and I were walking home, Lenin Street, that's the center of town. Lenin Street was packed, just packed with young people. They were shouting,  something about Karabagh and something about Armenians. We weren't especially  listening, because the way we were feeling we didn't know if we were going to  make it home or not, and just what had happened anyway? Public transportation  wasn't running. Incidentally, when we came out of the theater we saw police,  policemen standing there. The director of the movie theater was looking at the doors, because when they were leaving they had broken the glass, the doors  there are basically all glass. Everything was broken. He stood there grief- stricken, but looking as though nothing really big had happened, like some  naughty boys had just broken them quite by accident, with a slingshot. Well,  since he looked more or less calm I decided that, nothing all that super  serious had happened. We went out very slowly; we wanted to catch a bus, we  live literally one stop away. We didn't want to go on foot, not because it was dark, but because something might happen. We flagged down a cab, but the  driver didn't want to take us. We told him we live near the bus station, and  he said he'd take us to the bus station and not a yard farther. I said, well,  OK . . .  So we got into the cab and managed to get there. Something incredible was  happening at the bus station. There was a traffic jam. Public transportation  was at a standstill and everyone was shouting \\\"Ka-ra-bagh,\\\" they're not going  to give up Karabagh. I go home and tell my family what's going on, and there's immediate panic in the house. Mamma says, what should we do? Like the end had  come, they were going to come, kill us, that's it . . . Somehow we managed to  cheer ourselves up: Nothing that bad could happen. Where are we living anyway, just what kind of social order do we have? Somehow we manage to calm Mamma  down. And we went to bed. But no one could sleep. Everyone made as though  nothing had happened.  That was on Saturday. In short, the day went by. We didn't go anywhere and  didn't call our relatives. No one did anything. Because . . . life goes on. That day I realized something was approaching, but what exactly, I couldn't guess.  On the 28th everything was like it was supposed to be, we lived like we always had. There were five of us at home: Mamma, Papa and us, three sisters: Lyuda,  Marina, and I. My sister Lyuda was in Yerevan at the time. We sat at home and  no one went out. Later we learned that a demonstration had started that  morning. It all started . . . They were smashing up stores. We were sitting at home and didn't know anything about it. Then a girlfriend of mine, Lyuda  Zimogliad, came by at around three o'clock I think. We worked together, we did our apprenticeships together, she's a Russian girl. She said that something awful was happening in town. I asked, \\\"Don't they want Armenians? Well what  are they after, if they're already in that state?\\\" She says, no, nothing like  that, it's just a demonstration, but it's awful to watch it. Somehow, it feels like a war has broken out. Public transportation has been stopped . . . The  cabs, the buses, well it's just a nightmare.  Then Papa decides to go to the drugstore, my mother was having allergy  problems at the time . . . He left the house and our neighbor, Aunt Vera, asked him, \\\"Where are you going? Stop! There are such terrible things going on in the courtyard; aren't you afraid to go out?\\\" Papa didn't know what she was talking about. She simply pushed him back into the entryway. He came home  and told Mamma. Mamma said, \\\"Well, if Aunt Vera was talking like that it means that something is really going on.\\\" But we didn't go see her, she's a Russian, she lives across from us. I had to see my friend out. Around five o'clock I  tell Lyuda, \\\"Ok, look, it's time for you to go, it's late already, I'll see  you out.\\\" Mamma says, \\\"You don't need to go, it's too late already, you can  see what the situation in town is.\\\" So we decided to stay home. Dinner was  ready. Mamma says, \\\"Let her eat with us, then she can go.\\\" We sat down at the  table. But no one was hungry, no one was in the mood, we just put everything  out on the table to calm ourselves down, and make it appear that we're eating. We turned on the television, and the show \\\"In Fairy-Tale Land\\\" was coming on.  We cleared the table.  We hear some noise out in the courtyard. I go out on the balcony, but I can't  see what's going on, because the noise is coming from the direction of the bus station, and there is a 9-story building in the way. There is mob of people  . . . I can't figure out what's happening. They're shouting something, looking somewhere, I can't make out what is going on. I go down to a neighbor, she's  an Azerbaijani; we've been friends of her family for about 25 years. I go down to look from their place. I see people shouting, looking at the 5-and 9-story  buildings near the bus station. Just then soldiers set upon them, about 20  people, with clubs. The mob runs off in different directions. I even see  several people from our building. They are looking and laughing . . . I decide that means it's not all that bad if they are laughing: it means they're not  killing anyone. But now the crowd suddenly dashes toward the soldiers. One of  the soldiers cannot manage to get away, they start stomping on him with their  feet, everyone's kicking him . . . I become ill and go home, and explain in  general terms that horrible things are going on out there . . .  can't speak . . . Well, they've probably killed that soldier, the way that crowd is . . . If each of them kicked him just once . . . They took his club away from him and started to beat him with it. But it was far away and I couldn't see if he got up and left or not.  I become terrified and go home and say, \\\"Lyuda, don't go anywhere, stay at our place, because if you go out they could kill you or . . . \\\" Then the crowd  runs over closer toward our building and stands at the 12-story building and  starts shouting something. We go out onto the balcony. All of our neighbors  are also out on theirs, too. Everyone is standing, staring. The mob is  shouting and about 5 minutes later comes running toward our building. As it  turns out, at the 12-story building the Azerbaijani neighbors went down and  kept them from coming in. There's only one entryway there, they could stop  them.  They all run up to our building. Mamma immediately starts closing the windows, afraid that they might throw stones. They have stones and they break the  windows, all of them. There are very many people. We have a large courtyard,  and it's packed with people. They spill up to the first floor so they don't  crush each other. They crawl up on trees, posts, and garages. It's just a huge cloud of people. They break and burn the motorcycle of the Armenian Sergey  Sargisian, from our building. We close the windows and immediately hear  tramping in our entryway. They come up to our fifth floor with a tremendous  din and roar. It's incomprehensible. Mamma told me later that they were  shouting Father's name, \\\"Grisha, open the door, we've come to kill you!,\\\" or something like that. I don't remember that, I was spaced out, kind of. Mamma  says, \\\"Into the bedroom, quickly!\\\" In the bedroom we have two tall beds, part  of our dowry; Mamma says, \\\"Hide there, they probably won't come in there,  they'll ask something, say something, and leave.\\\" She says, \\\"We'll tell them  that we live alone here.\\\" I can't imagine that my parents will stand out in  the hall alone talking with some sort of beasts . . . I go to them and say  that I'll stand together with them, I'll talk with them if they come, maybe I  can find a common language with them, all the more so if they know me: I speak  Azerbaijani more or less, and I can find out what they want. I told Marina and Lyuda to hide under the bed, and my sister Lyuda, I can't remember if I told  her anything or not.  Then . . . they open the door: it's like they blew on it and it broke and fell right into the hall. The crows bursts in and starts to shout: Get out of here, leave, vacate the apartment and go back to your Armenia; things like that. I tell them, \\\"What has happened, speak calmly. One of you, tell me, calmly, what has happened.\\\" In Azerbaijani, they say, \\\"Get out of the apartment, leave.\\\" I  say, \\\"OK. Go downstairs. We'll gather everything we need and leave the  apartment.\\\" I realize that it is senseless to discuss any sort of rights with them, these are animals. They must be stopped. The ones standing in the doorway, the young guys, say, \\\"There are old people and one girl with them. Too bad!\\\" They take two or three steps back. It seems as though I have pacified them with our exchange. Then someone in the courtyard shouts,  commanding them: \\\"Don't you understand what you are saying? Kill them?\\\"  And that was it! That was all it took. They grab Papa, carry him into one room, and Mamma and me into another. They put Mamma on the bed and start  undressing her, beating her legs. They start tearing my clothes, right there,  in front of Mamma. I don't remember where they went, what they did, or how  much time passed. I had the feeling that they beat me on the head, on my body, and tore my clothes, all at the same time, I don't even know what I said. The  atrocities started. I was savagely raped in that room. They argued among  themselves who would go first.  Later, I remember, I came to. I don't know if I'm dead or alive. Someone comes in, someone tall, I think, clean-shaven, in an Eskimo dogskin coat, balding.  He looks around at what's happening. At that instant everything stops. It  seems to me that he is either their commander or . . . that somehow everything depends on him. He looks and says, \\\"Well, we're done here.\\\" They are beating Mamma on the head. They break up the chairs and beat her with the chair legs  . . . She loses consciousness, and they decide that she's dead. Papa . . . was out cold. They want to throw Lyuda off the balcony, but they can't get the  window open. Apparently the window frames are stuck after the rain and the  windows can't be opened. They leave her next to the window. She was thinking  about being thrown out the window and passed out. She's not a real strong  person anyway . . . He looks at me and sees that I'm saying something, that I'm still twitching. Well, I start saying the opposite of what I should be,  which is humbling myself and pleading. I start shouting, cursing . . . they  don't get any entreaty out of me. I  already know that I'm dead, why would I  humble myself before anyone? And he says that if that's what I think, since my tongue is so long . . . maybe he thinks that I still look quite appealing  . . . In short, he commands that I be taken outside.  I no longer saw or remembered what was happening to Marina and Lyuda, I don't  know if they are alive or not. They take me outside. They are dragging me by  my arms, by my legs. They are hitting me against the wall, the railings,  something metal . . . While they are carrying me someone is biting me, someone else is pinching me . . .I don't even know. I think, my God, when will death  come? If only it were sooner . . . Then . . . they carry me out, throw me near the entryway . . . and start kicking me. I lose consciousness . . . What  happened after that, how many people there were, I don't remember.   I come to after a while, I don't remember how long. A neighbor is bringing me  clothing. I'm entirely covered with blood, she puts a dress on me. I remember  that I said the same words over and over again: \\\"Mamma, what happened, Mamma,  what have they done to us, where are we, whose house are we at?\\\" I can't make  sense out of anything. There is a guy standing over me, I sort of know him, he served in Afghanistan, his name is Igor, he brought me indoors. When they all  went to the third entryway and killed a person there, Igor gathered his  courage, took me into his arms, and brought me to the neighbors', even though  he's small-minded, he put himself at risk. Igor Agayev is Azerbaijani; he  served in Afghanistan. There are three brothers. The older brother also served there, I think; now he's stationed here, on the border, in Armenia. Igor  brought me to the neighbors', and then helped me come to my senses, saying,  \\\"Karina, I know you, calm down, I'm not one of them.\\\" How do I know who's who  and what's what? I come to, and they clean me up. I was covered in blood. Then Papa . . . I saw Papa, I saw Mamma. And Marina, too . . . Igor was there when  they dragged Marina and Lyuda out from under the bed . . . Marina . . . Lyuda  said that she was Russian, they said, we'll let you go, we aren't touching the Russians, go. And while they are dragging Marina out she decides she's going  to tell them she's Azerbaijani. Igor immediately grabs Marina's and Lyuda's  hands, because he knows Marina, and knows that she is Armenian and is our  sister, and takes her to the second floor to a neighbor's and starts pounding  on the door so she will open up. She opens the door and Igor pushes them in  there. So they survived.  My sister Lyuda lost consciousness after the bandits started stealing things. While they were going downstairs, taking things downstairs, then coming back  up again, Lyuda seized the opportunity and crawled under the bed and stayed  there. Then, when she was herself again, she found a torn night shirt and put  it on, and some sort of robe and went to a neighbor's on the fourth floor, the one whose apartment I had watched the crowd from, the friend of ours, and  knocked on the door. The neighbor opened and said, \\\"I'm not going to let you  in the apartment because I'm afraid of them. But I'll give you some stockings  and we'll leave the building.\\\" Lyuda says, \\\"I'll stay at your place because of what's going on, they keep going up and down the stairs.\\\" It was just for a  moment, just a moment in life, but the neighbor wouldn't consent. Lyuda came  back to our place and lay under the bed . . .  I came to. Mother was there. I can't remember my supervisor's telephone  number, but something had to be done. Somehow I remembered and called, and he  came to get us. He didn't have any idea what was going on. He thought we were  simply afraid, he didn't know that they were killing us and that we had passed between life and death. He came and got us and took us to the police precinct. There they looked us over. I was having trouble walking, my lungs hurt badly,  it was hard to breathe . . .  My supervisor's name is Urshan Feyruzovich Mamedov. He's the head of our  administration. They took us there. When we were leaving, I saw a great number of buses full of soldiers at the entrance to town. The buses were ordinary  passenger buses. There were very many soldiers. We left around eleven, right  after eleven. If these people could stop what was happening they could save a  great many lives . . . Because the crowd was moving on, toward the school, and what was going on there . . . I think everyone know not only in Sumgait, not  only in Yerevan. Because there they murdered them all one after the next,  without stopping. After us.  I think 14 people died in Microdistrict No. 3, and 10 to 12 of them were from Buildings 4, 5, and 6. In our building one person died, and one old woman died from Building 16, that's the building in front of ours. There young  Azerbaijani men stopped the mob and wouldn't let it into their building.  Incidentally, when we were at the neighbors', Marina called our relatives to warn them, so they would all know what was happening. I called a aunt in  Microdistrict No. 5. They have three neighbors who are Armenians. I said, \\\"Run quickly, I can't explain what's going on; hide, do what you can, just stay alive. Hide at Azerbaijanis', ones who won't give you away.\\\" At that moment  three people came in, policemen. I think they were Azerbaijanis. I was in such awful condition, my face was completely distorted my lips were puffed up,  there was blood, my eye was swollen, no one thought I would ever see anything  out of that eye again . . . my forehead was badly cut, and one-half of my face was pushed out forward. No one would have thought that I would survive, get my normal appearance back, and be able to grasp anything at all. I started to  scream at those people, why did you come, who sent you here, no one wants you  here, haven't you killed people people yet, what are you doing here? One of  the soldiers said, \\\"Don't scream at us. We're Muslims, but we're not from the  Sumgait police. They called in from Daghestan.\\\" So at that point the  Daghestan police were there.  When we got to the police precinct there were an awful lot of police there, there were soldiers, police with dogs, ambulances, firemen . . . I don't know, maybe they were waiting for people to bring them the goners and the seriously  injured to treat them there in the police precinct. I don't know what they  were there for. There were also doctors from Baku there. They examined Lyuda  and me and said, \\\"These women need to go to the Maternity Home, but we don't  know what to do with the rest.\\\"  So they took us, and I lost contact with my parents, my boss, everyone. My  boss said, \\\"Don't worry, I'll find you, no matter where you are, no matter what happens.\\\" We went to the hospital. There we were examined by a department head from the Sumgait Maternity Home, Pashayeva, I think her name was. She  examined us. The ambulance was from Baku; I figured out that the Sumgait  ambulances hadn't done anything, they didn't respond to any calls. People  called and neither the police nor the ambulances showed any sign of life.  That doctor looked me over and I could tell from her behavior that something very good had happened, for she became quite glad. I even thought to myself,  \\\"God, can it be that nothing all that bad is wrong?\\\" She looks me over and  says, \\\"Now why are you suffering so? You don't know what your people have been doing, your people did even worse things.\\\" And I think, great, I have to deal  with her . . . And I felt so bad, I thought, why don't I just die so as not to have to hear more stuff like this from people like her? Here I am in this  condition and being told about something that our people did. I just didn't  have the energy to say, \\\"How could our people possibly be smart enough to  think of something that yours haven't already done?\\\" I stayed there. Then they brought in another woman, Ira B., she was married, and she was raped in her  own apartment, too. There were three of us, Ira, Lyuda, and 1. The next  morning they took Lyuda and Ira away. They didn't do anything to help us. This was in the old Maternity Home, in the combined block. They didn't do anything  more than examine me, that was it. I didn't want any shots or tranquilizer,  nothing. What shots could have calmed me down? I didn't even want to look at  them.  I lay in the ward. Either it just worked out that way or they did it on pur- pose, but I was alone. I was alone even though the wards were packed. That same evening a woman came by and asked me what was wrong with me, that my face was disfigured. She asked what had happened to me, and I said, \\\"Better to ask  your brother what happened, there's no point in asking me, your brother can  better explain what happened.\\\" She fell into a faint. All the doctors threw  themselves at her, and the doctor categorically forbade anyone to come into my ward.  Then people from work came to see me, my boss, his daughter; they brought me  clothing, because I was literally naked. The only thing I had on was a dress,  but the woman who gave it to me was very short, and the dress was way up  above my knees, and the woman orderly said, \\\"I can't believe you put on such a short dress, who are you showing off your legs to here?\\\" I went back to my  ward thinking, just one more thing from something. People from work came and  brought me something in a sack, apples, I think, three or four pounds, but I  couldn't take them. I had become so weak that it was just embarrassing. I said that I couldn't take the apples, and really didn't have any appetite. No one  had to bring me anything. Some woman took the sack . . . And, oh yes! . . .  Then I heard that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history should  be hidden or torn up completely so that no one would know that I was an  Armenian, maybe they wouldn't figure it out from looking at me. So they must  have been thinking that there would be some kind of attack, that something  else would happen. That it would be worse. Or, perhaps, someone was outside on the street, I don't know. In any case, I didn't sleep a wink that night.  The next morning they picked me up, a whole police detail, put me in a bus,  and off we went. I didn't even know where they were taking me. They took me to the club where the troops were, the very one I was in that ill-fated evening. I got off the bus. Near the City Party Committee there were a great many  troops, tanks, armored personnel carriers; the whole scene was terrible. I saw  a few people I knew there, and that calmed me a little. I had already thought  that I was the only one left. So there were five or six of us left in Sumgait  after that night. I still didn't know what happened to my parents, they didn't  come to see me in the hospital, and my boss told me that everything was fine.  I didn't know whether to believe him or not. Maybe he was just trying to calm  me down, maybe something happened on the way. Then I went to the club and saw  a lot of people I knew. They all knew one another, they were all kissing each  other and asking, \\\"What happened, what went on?\\\" Two days later they came to  see me from work. They were there all the time. Each day they came, showed  interest, and were constantly bringing me money. They did everything they  could. Of course I'm most thankful to my boss, the only one of my colleagues  who didn't lose his presence of mind and who didn't change his opinions,  neither before, nor after, nor in the heat of the moment, no matter what  happened. He constantly took an interest. A sincere interest, from the heart  . . . Then, about two days later, the secretary of the Party Committee came,  not from our Party organization, but from the First Trust, which ours is part  of, Comrade Kerimov, a very important figure in our town. He made arrangements with the emergency medical personnel to take me away, because if I sat down by myself I couldn't get up or lie down again. There was something wrong with my lungs, it was hard to breathe. They examined me there several times, there I  lay were several doctors, they all thought that . . . that it must just be  from all the blows, I don't know. They didn't diagnose anything in particular. When I was in the Maternity Home I even asked . . . I made it a point of  insisting that they take me to the trauma section because I felt so awful.  There was no way something inside wasn't broken, my ribs . . . Well they took  me there and took x-rays and said that everything was fine. There were  emergency medical workers on duty in the club. The mother of one of Marina's  friends was there. She was the head doctor at the Sumgait Children's Clinic.  They had every kind of antifever agent in the world, which was exactly what I needed at that moment, I thought. I said that I was having great difficulty breathing, I couldn't seem to get enough air, something was wrong with me. They put tight bandages around my chest and waist. Later I overheard some people saying that I had been cut all over. I think they just saw me being all bandaged up and decided that my breasts and face had been cut . . . But I wasn't cut.  They took us to the Khimik boarding house. We lived there a long time. Soon  appeared representatives . . . They were agitating. At first people would not  talk to them, and drove them off. One of the Armenian women shouted, \\\"We  demand that Seidov come!\\\" The response was, \\\"It's Seidov who sent us.\\\" Seidov  is the Chairman of the Azerbaijani Council of Ministers. The woman said,  \\\"We'll only see Seidov's daughter, have her come here, we'll do the same  things to her that they did to our daughters, and then we'll deal with you  agitators.\\\" And so on. More of them said, \\\"Have Seidov himself come.\\\" This  went on day in, day out. The agitators kept coming and coming, this drove us  out of our wits. Then people gradually started departing for Yerevan because  they realized it was senseless to stay. Everything got on our nerves: The  smell, the small children. There were children at the SK club, children who  had literally just come out of the Maternity Home. What were they doing in a  club that didn't even have running water all the time? At first we had to pay  to eat there. They even overcharged us, as it turned out. On the second day  someone told us that they would bring us food for free. The children were ill. Everything stank there. Well imagine about 3,000 people in a small movie  theater with seating for no more than 500. You couldn't sit or lie down, it  was impossible to even move. The stench was awful. Even the smallest infants  took ill overnight there. I heard that they were arriving seriously ill in  Yerevan, the infants. They have to be washed, they have to be bathed, not to  mention that we, the adults, were ill and needed care. People were fainting  right and left. I just don't know, everyone was crying, everyone . . . Only  the young people, the men, somehow managed to keep it together. But the women  were in a constant state of panic. It seemed to everyone that they would come  any minute and kill and stab. It seemed clear that we had been gathered  together purposely, like during the war, so that they could burn the movie  theater and there wouldn't be a single Armenian left. Then people went up to  the attic. I didn't see them, I only heard them, because I was lying down and  couldn't get up. I lay right on the stage, we had some room there. Apparently  they caught two people with either oil or gas. I think they wanted to burn the theater. Maybe someone saw them, I didn't. I was in no condition to open my  eyes.  Everyone was suspicious of everyone else. They would ask, \\\"Aren't you an  Azerbaijani? I think I saw you somewhere, I think you're an Azerbaijani.\\\" They led out all the men and started letting them back in by checking their passports, relatives might be covering for each other. Half of the people did not have any documents. There were people who had run out of their homes in  nothing but a pair of pants and slippers, or wearing just a shirt, not like they should have, with their IDs.  So on the 28th, on Sunday, I think, the police did nothing to help us. On Monday everything resumed where it had left off on Block 41A. They didn't  spare a soul there: not children, not pregnant women, nobody. They killed, they burned, they hacked with axes, just everything possible. They murdered  the Melkumian family whom I knew, my mother worked with them. Their daughter- in-law went to school with my older sister. They were brutally murdered. Only  the two daughters-in-law survived. By a miracle one was able to save herself,  she ran away, the neighbors wouldn't take her in, so she ran about the  building until she found refuge. She was pregnant and had two small children.  This all continued on Monday in Block 41A, on the 29th, when the troops were  already in the city.  They murdered people, they overturned automobiles, and they burned entire  families. They say they didn't even know for sure if the people were Armenians or not. I heard that the Lezgins suffered, too. I'm not sure myself, I didn't  see any Lezgins who had been injured. They burned cars so it's very difficult  now to say exactly who died and who didn't. It was very difficult to identify  the corpses, or rather, what remained of the corpses after they were doused in gasoline and burned . . . it's all very hard to imagine, of course I heard  that many people disappeared without a trace, from the BTZ plant two people,  including a woman who worked the night shift, Aunt Razmella, who also lived in Microdistrict 3.  They were stopping buses between Baku and Sumgait. In the evening people who  had been visiting Baku were returning to Sumgait, and people from Baku were  going home from Sumgait, and there were students, too. They were simply  savagely murdered. They were stopping the buses, the drivers immediately did  what they were told because there was just no other way to deal with that  hoard of brutally minded people. They stopped the buses, dragged the Armenians out and killed them on the spot. I didn't see it myself, but I heard that they put them all in a pile so as to burn them. Later it was hard to discern from  the corpses, well you can't call them corpses, you had to figure out from the  ashes who it was. l heard that two fellows saved two women, one a student, Ira G., if I'm not mistaken. She was in the hospital a long time after that, and  she still can't figure out who saved her. She was also brutally raped and  beaten and thrown onto a pile of corpses. The fellow pulled her out of that  whole pile of corpses, put his coat on her, took her into his arms, and  carried her to the city. I still can't imagine how he managed to do that.  I heard that from Engels Grigorian. He knows her, apparently. Well a lot of  people went to that hospital anyway. She was in the hospital and singing a  song in Armenian, and they wrote the words down, and, I think he still has  that piece of paper, because he says that a lot of people now have that song,  the one she sang in the hospital where she lay in such bad shape. They  couldn't find the guy who saved her. He left her in someone's apartment and called the ambulance, she was in such awful shape that, probably, like me, she couldn't remember anyone's face.  I think that I knew one of the people who broke into our house, maybe I had  talked with him once. But I received so many blows everything was just knocked out of my head. I can't remember to this day who he was. Then, it seems, I saw the Secretary of the Directorate's Party organization, where Marina works. She goes to school and works, she goes to night school at AZI, and works by day at the Khimzashchita Construction and Installation Administration. I'm the  Secretary of the Komsomol organization at our administration and often met  with the secretaries of Party and Komsomol organizations. We had joint  meetings. I know them all, I've even talked with them, and he, I know, is from Armenia. An Azerbaijani, but from Armenia. It became obvious that many of  those people were Azerbaijanis born in Armenia.  They took me to various police stations, to the police precinct, and to the Procuracy, because the USSR Procuracy got involved in the case, and I iden- tified the photographs of people who I could more or less recognize. They showed me the people who were in our apartment, they're working on our case, but I can't even recognize them, although it was proved that they were the ones, they're processing it somehow. They tell me that they know that someone held me by the arm and someone else held me by the leg when they were  dragging me. There was someone else in our apartment who did not even touch  me, he just stole a blanket and an earring or something like that. All these  people, all of them, as much as I've heard about them and seen them, they were all from Kafan.  The Secretary of the Party organization is named Najaf, Najaf Rzayev. He was  there when everything started. It must have been him because I didn't  recognize anyone else in the crowd whom I knew besides him. All the more since I told him, \\\"Listen, you do something, because you know me.\\\" He turned away  and went toward the bedroom, where Marina was. Well you couldn't see Marina  anyway. There was such a noisy confusion of people that you couldn't make out  anyone. All of it flew right out of my head, and then gradually I became  myself again, at the City Party Committee . . . There were military people  there. I told them what went on, and they wrote it all down. I told them his  name. On March 8 the Secretary of our First Trust Party organization, the one  we're part of, came to see us, his name is Najaf Rzayev. I tell Mamma, \\\"If he's here despite the fact that I gave his name, it means that either his  alibi has been confirmed or, probably, that they think I'm crazy, not  responsible for my words.\\\" He said, \\\"What did they do to you, how awful,  myself, I hid an Armenian family.\\\" Then after some time goes by he comes back  again and says something entirely different: \\\"I wasn't at home, my family and  I went to Baku.\\\" I said, \\\"Marina, what is he saying? He said something totally different before.\\\" After that I didn't go to see our Procurator, our case is  being handled by a procurator from Voronezh, Fedorov by name. Fedorov told me  that Rzayev's case had just gotten to him, and there were so names involved.  What are they doing with Rzayev? Did he prove his alibi or not? They just think that since I was hit in the  head I can't say anything for sure, whether it was him or not. It will be an  insult if he was in our apartment and doesn't have to pay for it, but at the  same time  I'm afraid to say I'm a hundred percent sure that it was he. Because no mat- ter who I name, they tell me, no, you're wrong, he didn't do that, that one wasn't there. All the faces have gotten mixed up in my mind. Who did what exactly I can't say.                                                       When they took me outside there was a whole crowd there, but I didn't see it,  because I had my eyes closed all the time. It seemed to me that I always got it because of my eyes, people were always hassling me, for some reason it  always seemed to me that my eyes are responsible. When they were beating my  face I thought they were trying to put my eyes out. So I had my eyes closed,  they took me outside and started to beat me. A young guy, 22, held my arms, he works at the BTZ plant. And right nearby, across the road from us, Block 41,  is where all this was going on. Right across the road from us. The BTZ  dormitory is over there, that's where he lives. Now he's in custody, they even have proved, as far as I know, that it was he who killed Shurik Gambarian, the clarinet player from the third entryway of our building. One person in our  building was killed, it was that man.  A guy comes by who shared a room with the guy who was holding me. He saw that he was holding me by the arms and that he was beating me, but he didn't come  over, he just looked and then went into the dormitory. A while after it was  all over, people started making announcements in town saying that  investigators had been summoned. That guy went and told them everything. Now  they've caught him, everything's been proved. Now, evidently, they've been beating him, I don't know what they're doing with them over there, but he  himself said that he was working the night shift at the plant. Some young guy  came to the plant and said, \\\"Everyone who wants to kill Armenians come to the  bus station on Saturday at ten.\\\" That was it. He said, the ones who wanted to, went. This was at the BTZ plant, during the night shift, probably, late Friday night. It was at night, they were at the sauna together. And he said, what do  you mean, do you understand what you are saying? The others were silent,  probably, in their hearts they were thinking, I'm going to go. But they didn't say anything to one another. He said that he thought it important to to go,  because he had heard a lot about what had happened in Kafan, that they had  killed their Azerbaijani sisters, their mothers, burned villages, and all of  that. That guy was also born in Kafan. That is certain. And Marina says that  the Secretary of the Party organization is from Armenia, too.                                                             from  I've participated in the investigation a couple of times. I'm satisfied with them thus far. They summoned us and asked about what happened, and every word  I said was recorded. I met some guy there . . . By the way, he was an  Armenian. I said that he was in our apartment, but what he did, I don't know.  His last name was Grigorian, Eduard Grigorian. He s from Sumgait, from  Microdistrict 1. He was sentenced I think, to five years, not his first time.  His mother is Russian. I met with him at the KGB in Baku, at the Azerbaijani  KGB. They took us there and showed me photographs. There were so many  photographs, I think they even photographed those people who were caught at  curfew, and I've got them all confused. I say, the face was about like this,  the guy in the white coat with the red clasps. But he could take that coat off and burn it somewhere, and it would be like looking for a needle in a  haystack. Well. This guy, Grigorian, I said, he was in our apartment, but he  is so light-complected that he looks like a Lezgin. I don't know what he did,  I can't remember. Maybe he beat me or raped me. But he was in our apartment.  At the KGB he started asking me, pleading with me, there's no need for this,  all this stuff, look me in the eyes, you're like a sister to me. I took a look at him and thought, \\\"My God, Heaven forbid that I should have a brother like  you.\\\" But they were satisfied with my responses, because I said everything  without great certainty. I was there with Mamma. Then Lyuda came in, but when  she came in she got sick immediately. She wanted to kill him, she crawled over the table at him. She recognized him. When she came to, Lyuda was lying on the balcony, the mob threw her there and all of them ran into the bedroom. We had  all kinds of boxes with dishes in them, the dowries for all three sisters.  They stole everything in the apartment, leaving only small things. At that  moment Lyuda came to and started remembering everything. Well, seeing the  faces, hearing the voices . . . Two people were saying they could burn the  apartment. Another says, why burn the apartment when I've got three kids and  no place to live. So this guy was in temporary housing, he didn't have  anywhere to live, he was from Sumgait. They were sure that they would get the  apartment. Besides, the neighbors were Azerbaijani. Why should they burn the  apartment, they might burn Azerbaijanis. That's what they said. How did they  know there were Azerbaijanis there, if they just picked a place, thinking that Armenians lived there? We have a list of the residents for our part of the  building, our name is in there, but how could they know that Azerbaijanis  lived on the other side of the wall from us? So they didn't set fire to our  apartment.  I don't know, I was in such bad shape that if all of it had come to a halt  when I was outside, if someone had asked me what was happening, I would have said that a civil war was going on. Well, maybe not civil . . . but probably civil, because when they were beating me I opened my eyes and saw that all the neighbors were standing on their balconies and watching, like at a free horror film. So a civil war was going on, and only the Armenians were being fought. If it were a world war or something like that, they would have been fighting everyone. But they only fought us. Then I met some women from  our building, some Azerbaijanis. They are crying, they tell me, \\\"Karina, we  saw all of it, how could it happen?\\\" They're asking me! Well I just don't know what to call it if a normal girl can stand there and watch what happened to  me. I think that if it were the other way around either I wouldn't have been  able to take it, or I would have tried to avert it, like that one Azerbaijani  woman did in front of our building. A woman lives there, an awful, dissipated  woman, if you can call her a woman, the dissipated life she leads. Two  Armenian families live there, in her part of the building. She came out on the balcony and saw what was happening to me and started to scream and curse. She  came down to the entryway and said, \\\"You'll come in this entryway over my dead body.\\\" So not one of them took it in his head to go in that entryway. Some  folks were saying that those people were so out of control that they didn't  even know what they were doing. I don't think that's true. They knew very well what they were doing if they didn't even lift a hand against that woman. They  couldn't have cared less about her, but the fact that she was an Azerbaijani  stopped them.  They were just beasts, they had smoked so much. When they came to our place  they were all chewing something. I noticed: Everyone who came into the  apartment was chewing something. I think, my God, maybe I just think that?  Maybe I'm losing my mind? But no, they're all chewing something. Maybe it is  some kind of drug, it must be, because . . . At first glance they all seemed  to be such normal people, young, clean-shaven, looking exactly as if they had  come to some sort of celebration. But they were shouting something. They didn't talk, they shouted, as though there were deaf people there. They  screamed and screamed: \\\"Yeah, killing, killing, we're killing the Armenians!\\\"  Only they didn't shout \\\"kill,\\\" they shouted \\\"gurun ermianlary.\\\" Gurun  literally means \\\"kill,\\\" or \\\"destroy.\\\"  That's how it was! I'll continue. We hid in a captain's apartment, he's an Azerbaijani, his wife is a Tatar. We were sitting in their apartment, their  kids were out in the yard. Their kids knew a whole lot. This was in our part  of the building, on the third floor. When Mamma came to and couldn't find Lyuda she took Papa's hand, this was while the looters were stealing things, but they didn't pay attention because they were stealing things. Apparently they had already ceased killing and switched to stealing. Mamma found the courage to . . .  A boy said to my mother \\\"Where's the gold?\\\" Mamma said he must have been 12  to 14 years old. He even looked Russian, he was so fair-skinned. But the  Azerbaijanis from Armenia are fair-skinned. I noticed they were all on the  fair side. He shouted, they were all smashing things, and he asks Mamma where  the gold is. We kept our gold in the wardrobe with our important papers. In a  little black bag, we kept everything in there. Mamma doesn't really like to  wear gold. She probably never even wore those things from the time they were  bought for her. They took everything that was lying on the cheval glass. Mamma thinks that the gold saved us. Because they threw themselves at the gold, and  Mamma grabbed Papa, who was trying to breathe. They had closed his mouth,  bound his hands, and put a pillow and a chair on his face . . . They had  shoved something into his mouth so he would suffocate. Mamma grabbed him and  tore all that stuff off . . . He had something in his mouth, he was having  trouble breathing, his nose was filled with blood. Mamma grabbed him and  started running from the fifth down to the first floor because no one wanted  to open their doors to them. Mamma said that by accident, completely by  accident that person opened his door, he was sleeping, and said, half-awake,  \\\"What's happened?\\\" He sees that they are bloody. Mamma said, \\\"At least go and  find out what's happening to my daughters, even if they've burned them or  murdered them, at least bring the corpses.\\\" He went looking for us. At that  moment Lyuda was under the bed. She says that after they left it seemed that  someone was calling her name. When he quietly called her she couldn't get out  from under the bed. She wanted to get out and was calling softly. She thought  she was shouting, but in fact she was either silent or was only talking to  herself, it just seemed to her that she was shouting. When she got out from  under the bed everyone was gone. And again . . . She thought that she had lost her mind. I'll never leave here, never! To hell with it! It just seems that  way to me, I'll come to eventually. But then, when everything had settled  down, stopped, that mall brought Lyuda down, and Igor carried me in from outside. Or first I was brought in, then Lyuda, I don't remember what order it happened in.  And Mamma said, \\\"Listen, they're all running around down there, shouting  something or other, and running toward the other building.\\\" It had more or  less calmed down where we were. Who's dead, who's alive, we don't know. I  tried to call my girlfriend. I had basically come to. Mamma says, \\\"Listen; let's go upstairs, at least get a mattress or something. We don't know how  long we'll be here. Maybe they didn't burn everything.\\\" I don't get it, all women have that feeling, they want to get something from their homes, maybe  not everything was taken? I tell Mamma, \\\"Mamma, what do you need any of that  for? To hell with it! We're alive, forget the rest of it, all of it!\\\" She says, \\\"No, let's go get at least something. Maybe we'll leave here, spend the  night at someone else's.\\\" Mamma went upstairs, and their little boy, their son Alik, was standing on the lookout. lIe was standing there to see if they were  coming. They only managed to run up there and grab something one time. He  shouts, \\\"Come back, they're coming!\\\" They didn't have enough time to get a  lot, mattresses from one apartment, a blanket from another . . . Mamma got my  knitting . . . Someone managed to grab our old things, the ones we never wore, out of the hall . . . Someone took Father's old coveralls. The neighbor, his  wife, Mamma and Papa . . . Marina went with them. I was in no condition to  leave. Neither was Lyuda. We just sat. They ran out and we closed the door and just then we hear that the mob is on its way toward our place upstairs,  they're dragging something again. They were going toward the other building,  maybe over by the school, or . . . There was an unfinished building over there, people said they were going toward the basement or the unfinished  building, they could gradually carry everything over there. Then things more  or less calmed down. I tried to call my boss.  Later there was more noise. We were on the third floor, in a one-bedroom apartment, and a woman lives in the one-bedroom place on the second floor, Asya Dallakian. She's an old woman, retired. She wasn't at home, at that time she was usually in the country, she has a married daughter there, and her grandson is in the army. She is only very rarely in town; she gets her retirement money and the apartment is essentially vacant. They started pounding on her door and broke it down. She had two or three beds in there,  something like that, she's a 60-to 70-year-old woman who really does not even  live there. Probably she had some pots, a couple of metal bed frames and  mattresses, and a television. When her grandson came she bought a television.  They started wrecking everything. I started getting sick again. I think, \\\"My  God, what is going on around here? When will this end?\\\" We turned off the  lights and sat. As it turns out the people who weren't afraid, the ones who  knew what was going on, knew not to turn off the lights. We didn't know, but  they didn't come to where we were all the same. They all knew very well that  he was a captain. He went out and closed the door, and we sat in his  apartment. His last name was Kasumov. He's an exserviceman, retired, works up  at the fire station at some plant or other. He went out and stood at his door. They tell him, \\\"Comrade Captain, don't worry, we won't harm you, you're one of us.\\\" He went upstairs, and they say, \\\"Aren't you taking anything from this  apartment?\\\" He says, \\\"I don't need anything.\\\" And the women who were standing  in the yard . . . we have a basement, full of water . . . the women who were  standing in the yard saw. Those guys, they left everything they stole on the  first floor and ran upstairs again. The women threw everything they had time  to into the basement, to save our property. Some things were left: dirty  pillows, two or three other things and a rug. A guy came downstairs, really  mad, and he says, \\\"Where's the rug? I just put it right here!\\\" They tell him,  \\\"Some guy came and took it and went off toward the school.\\\" He ran off in that direction.  Oh! I forgot the most important point. When Igor picked me up in his arms,  there were women standing there who saw everything that was going on. They  just didn't tell me about it for a long time. The wife of that military man,  she didn't want to kill my spirit, I was already dead enough. Later she told  me, that after they murdered Uncle Shurik in the third entryway one of them,  the ringleader, apparently a young man, said, \\\"Where's the girl who was here?\\\" And he became furious. The woman tells him, \\\"She came to . . . \\\" She didn't know what to say: Think something up? Someone carried her off? Then they would comb the whole house and find me and our whole family. So the woman says, \\\"She came to and went to the basement.\\\" Now, our basement is full of water. So the  whole mob dashes off to the basement to look for me or my corpse. They took  flashlights; they were up to their waists in water, water which had been  standing there for years, and soot, and fuel oil. They climbed down in there  to get me. Then one of them said, \\\"There's so much water down there, she  probably walked and walked and then passed out and died. She met her death in  the basement. That's it, we can leave, no problem!\\\" I didn't know that, and  when I was told, I felt worse. Two times worse. A lot worse! So they didn't  just want to pound me flat, something more awful was awaiting me . . .  After that we of course didn't want to live in Sumgait any longer. We really  didn't want to go back to our apartment. When we moved, I went up there and  started to quiver and shake all over, because I started remembering it all.  Although the neighbors all sobbed, it was all . . . so cheap . . . The people  who sat in their apartments and didn't help us at a time like that. I think  that they could have helped! I don't think that they were obligated to, but  they could have helped us! Because that one woman was able to stop that whole  brutal crowd by herself. That means they could have, too. It would have been enough foe one man or women to say, What do you think you're doing?\\\" That's  all! That would have done it. There were 60 apartments in our building. Not  one person said it! When I was lying on the ground and all those people were  standing on their balconies I didn't hear anyone's voice, no one said what are you doing, leave her alone . . . Mamma even told one of the neighbor women  that if it had been an Azerbaijani woman in my place they would have dropped a bomb if it would have killed even one Armenian. They would have stood up for  one of their own. True, they say that our neighbor from the fourth entryway,  an old/ sick woman tried to stop the pogrom. The Azerbaijanis have a custom:  if a woman takes her scarf and throws it on the ground, the men are supposed  to stop immediately. The old woman from the fourth entryway did that, but they stomped her scarf into the ground, pushed her off to the side, and said, \\\"If you want to go on living, you'll disappear into your apartment.\\\" So she left. That trick didn't work on them.  Even the neighbors who helped us move told me, OK, fine, calm down, forget  that it happened. I said I'd only forget it if I told them right then that it had happened to their daughter--and if that didn't have any effect on them,  then I would forget everything, too. Imagine that it happened to your sister.  And no one did anything. Anything.

Gradually, however, I came to conclude that because I was acting in a strictly secular, public capacity, established as such by both the state and the expectations of the couples involved, I was really conducting a purely secular, legal civil event, with no greater moral or religious implications than if I had been conducting a civil trial (the couple who told me, mid-ceremony, to \\\"please hurry it up\\\" may have helped me to this conclusion).

The region has escaped the ethnic warfare of neighboring Nagorno-Karabakh, Abkhazia and Ossetia, but Lezhgis could become the next minority in the former Soviet Union to fight for independence.  Lezghis, who are Muslim descendents of nomadic shepherds, are angry about the conscription of their young men to fight in Azerbaijan's 5-year-old undeclared war with Armenia.  They also want to unite the Lezghi regions of Azerbaijan and Russia, which were effectively one until the breakup of the Soviet Union created national borders that had been only lines on a map.  A rally of more than 3,000 Lezghis in March to protest conscription and demand a separate \\\"Lezghistan\\\" alarmed the Azerbaijani government.  Officials in Baku, the capital, deny rumors that police shot six demonstrators to death. But the government announced strict security measures and began cooperating with Russian authorities to control the movement of Lezhgis living across the border in the Dagestan region of Russia.  Visitors to Gussar, the center of Lezhgi life, found the town quiet soon after the protest. Children played outdoors in the crisp mountain air.  At the Sunday bazaar, men in heavy coats and dark fur hats gathered to discuss grievances ranging from high customs duties at the Russian border to a war they say is not theirs.  \\\"I have been drafted, but I won't go,\\\" said Shamil Kadimov, gold teeth glinting in the sun. \\\"Why must I fight a war for the Azerbaijanis? I have nothing to do with Armenia.\\\"  More than 3,000 people have died in the war, which centers on the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, about 150 miles to the southeast.  Malik Kerimov, an official in the mayor's office, said only 11 of 300 locals drafted in 1992 had served.  \\\"The police don't force people to go,\\\" he said. \\\"They are afraid of an uprising that could be backed by Lezghis in Dagestan.\\\"  All the men agreed that police had not fired at the demonstrators, but disagreed on how the protest came about.  Some said it occurred spontaneously when rumors spread that Azerbaijan was about to draft 1,500 men from the Gussar region, where 75,000 Lezghis live.  Others said the rally was ordered by Gen. Muhieddin Kahramanov, leader of the Lezhgi underground separatist movement, Sadval, based in Dagestan.  \\\"We organized the demonstration when families came to us distraught about draft orders,\\\" said Kerim Babayev, a mathematics teacher who belongs to Sadval.  \\\"We hope to reunite peacefully, by approaching everyone -- the Azerbaijanis,  the Russians.\\\"  In the early 18th century, the Lezhgis formed two khanates, or sovereignties, in what are now Azerbaijan and Dagestan. They roamed freely with their sheep over the green hills and mountains between the two khanates.  By 1812, the Lezghi areas were joined to czarist Russia. After 1917, they came under Soviet rule. With the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the  600,000 Lezghis were faced for the first time with strict borders.  About half remained in Dagestan and half in newly independent Azerbaijan.  \\\"We have to pay customs on all this, on cars, on wine,\\\" complained Mais Talibov, a small trader. His goods, laid out on the ground at the bazaar, included brandy, stomach medication and plastic shoes from Dagestan.  \\\"We want our own country,\\\" he said. \\\"We want to be able to move about easily. But Baku won't listen to us.\\\"  Physically, it is hard for outsiders to distinguish Lezhgis from other Azerbaijanis. In many villages, they live side by side, working at the same  jobs and intermarrying to some degree.  But the Lezhgis have a distinctive language, a mixture of Arabic, Turkish and Persian with strong guttural vowels.  Azerbaijan officially supports the cultural preservation of its 10 largest ethnic minorities. The Lezghis have weekly newspapers and some elementary  school classes in their language.  Autonomy is a different question. If the Lezghis succeeded in separating from Azerbaijan, they would set a precedent for other minorities, such as the  Talish in the south, the Tats in the nearby mountains and the Avars of eastern Azerbaijan.    \",\"      There are some issues which come to mind when one considers the law enforcement aspects of the use of the Big Brother (Clipper) chip.      The drug dealers and terrorists aren't going to let themselves be caught by using this type of encryption.  In 1985 the New York Times reported that government investigators broke up a narcotics ring that was operating highly sophisticated equipment capable of allowing the leaders of the ring to eavesdrop on the law-enforcement agents who were trying to arrest them.      A Mr. Deely, an NSA official, said \\\"There are a lot of medium-sized countries that would have been proud to have the signals intelligence operation of this group.\\\"      For every John Gotti there are probably many more people who have the sophistication to know what the risks of unsecure communications are.  The press given to the Big Brother chip will only increase their numbers.      Even if there is some benefit to law-enforcement through the use of Big Brother, it must be weighed against the constitutional and civil liberties questions involved.      For example, in some areas of the world torture is used as an investigative tool by the local \\\"law-enforcement\\\" people.  I suspect it is an effective means of obtaining information and shortening many investigations.  It probably also helps keep the conviction rate high.      The fact that the torture tool is not used in this country (even with a court order obtained by showing \\\"probable cause\\\") is because we have rightly balanced the questions of expediency and what is ethically and morally right.      I think that the same question of expediency versus morality should come into play when considering the use of Big Brother.  I vote for morality.      I am quite disturbed by what I interpret as a veiled threat to prohibit the use of all encryption if this Big Brother chip is not put into wide spread use.  After a quick reading of the White House press release I came away with that impression.      To most of the American public, the word \\\"hacker\\\" has rightly or wrongly come to mean \\\"high tech adolescent vandal\\\". It has struck me that most of the people posting to sci.crypt regarding this issue are intelligent, thoughtful individuals who have genuine concerns about the privacy and constitutional issues surrounding Big Brother.  I hope that the use of Big Brother does not become mandatory and other encryption become illegal.  I would hate to see this become some kind of high tech Volstead Act.      The high speed digital communications revolution is coming at us with the speed of an SST.  The times they are a changing, and just as IBM is learning that they can't do business the same way they have done it for the past 40 years, maybe NSA should evaluate another approach.      EFF, who have correctly questioned the cryptographic strength of Big Brother, may need to send a stronger message out regarding the constitutional issues involved.      Al Gore may want to think this one through a little more.

One approach is simply to try and move political opinion and hope a new more libertarian consensus lasts for a while.  Another approach is to try and amend the constitution.

The First Amendment, though weakened in many ways, still restrains government (particularly state and local), even though on many particular issues the majority is in favor of censorship.  I think libertarians would be happy with another 100 years of restraint via an amendment or two (not that I think that's likely to happen).  Not necessarily Mr. Hendricks, but other posters seem to see this as a problem with libertarianism, that it cannot be stable.  That might be true, but it is not an objection to libertarianism per se.  If a libertarian political consensus forms for a decade or two and then falls apart again, we would just be back where we are now.  This is unlike the case for socialism where a socialist consensus that held for a while and then fell apart would not leave us where we are now, but instead with lots of bureaucracy that would be hard to get rid of, if not tyranny as the end condition of a strong socialist consensus.\",\"    Try putting one of the IRQs for your COM ports onto IRQ2. The hardware will automagically wrap IRQ2 to IRQ9 on AT class machines (eg, anything with high IRQs). This is what I'm doing on my set up right now.     I've got COM2 on IRQ2 (really IRQ9 - address it this way in software), COM1 on IRQ3, SoundBlaster on IRQ5, LPT1 on IRQ7, and my ATI BusMouse port on one of the interrupts in between. Works just great.    If you need even more, there's a text file floating around somewhere that details how to hack up any serial card (and probably any others) to work on the higher IRQs. It basically involves cutting the trace to the low IRQ and running a wire over the a high IRQ pin on the 16bit expansion bus.    It will be best to put the modem's COM port onto IRQ2/9. This will be the   first IRQ serviced by the system, giving the modem a better response --  especially handy under multitaskers like OS/2 -- which I'm running with no problems.

(Sorry all HP fans, but I have a hard time being convinced that their scopes match the rest of their (excellent) gear).  One of the principal functions I look for when considering a DSO is whether you can turn interpolation off. The other important feature is to disable repetitive waveform acquisition i.e. being able to lock the instrument into real time capture mode.   I agree with you here. The only consolation is that manufacturers are _beginning_ to pay attention to ergonomics when designing the menus. However, to be fair, it seems that first time scope users (our students) seem to adjust to menus easier than navigating around the twenty or more knobs required of a \\\"real\\\" scope :-)   This is one area that newer DSOs are addressing. I recently evaluated the latest box from Tek - their TDS320 - which seems to be a worthy alternative to a standard 100MHz analogue CRO. This instrument has a 100MHz, 500Ms/s spec, meaning that it is _always_ in real time capture mode. The pricing also matches equivalent analogue scopes in the range. The downer is that the instrument uses menus again, but at least they appear to be logically laid out.  One more thing about the new, \\\"simpler\\\", front panels. These instruments tend to use digital rotary encoders as knobs now. This is a vast improvement over the old oak switch. The single most common cause of failure in our scopes (other than students blowing up inputs!) is mechanical wear on these switches. I look at the new panels as a great step toward increasing the longevity of the instruments.

I think the support droid was malfunctioning and confused the disk space limit with the virtual address space limit.  As far as the disk is concerned, you are limited only by the amount of contiguous free space.

Increasing this value increases the  amount of available linear address space, causing the size of data  structures to increase.

Overacker writes, responding to Simon:     I may be interesting to see some brief selections posted to the    net.  My understanding is that SSPX does not consider ITSELF in    schism or legitimately excommunicated.  But that's really beside    the point.  What does the Roman Catholic church say?    Excommunication can be real apart from formal excommunication, as    provided for in canon law.  Here's some of the theology involved for the interested.  There is confusion over this issue of the SSPX's \\\"schism\\\"; often the basic problem is lack of an ability to distinguish between:  - true obedience - false obedience - disobedience - schism  Take the various classifications of obedience first.  There are 2 important elements involved here for my purposes:  1) a command 2) the response made to the command  As far as the command goes, commands can be LEGITIMATE, such as the Pope ordering Catholics to not eat meat on Fridays.  Or they can be ILLEGITIMATE, such as the Pope ordering Catholics to worship the god Dagon when every other full moon comes around.  As far as the response to a command goes, it can be to REFUSE to do what is commanded, or to COMPLY.  Making a table, there are thus 4 possibilites:  command         response            name ----------------------------------------------------- LEGITIMATE      COMPLY              true obedience ILLEGITIMATE    REFUSE              true obedience LEGITIMATE      REFUSE              disobedience ILLEGITIMATE    COMPLY              false obedience  So now you see where my 3 classifications of obedience come from.  Obedience is not solely a matter of compliance/refusal.  The nature of the commands must also be taken into account; it is not enough to consider someone's compliance or refusal and then say whether they are \\\"obedient\\\" or \\\"disobedient\\\".  You also have to take into consideration whether the commands are good or bad.  In my example, if the Pope commands all Catholics to worship the god Dagon, and they all refuse, they aren't being disobedient at all!  As far as the Society of Saint Pius X goes, they are certainly refusing to comply with certain things the Pope desires.  But that alone is insufficient to allow one to label them \\\"disobedient\\\".  You also have to consider the nature of the Papal desires.  And there's the rub: SSPX says the Popes since Vatican II have been commanding certain very bad things for the Church.  The Popes have of course disagreed.  So where are we?  Are we in another Arian heresy, complete with weak Popes?  Or are the SSPX priests modern Martin Luthers?  Well, the only way to answer that is to examine who is saying what, and what the traditional teaching of the Church is.  The problem here is that very few Catholics have much of an idea of what is really going on, and what the issues are.  The religion of American Catholics is especially defective in intellectual depth.  You will never read about the issues being discussed in the Catholic press in this country.  (On the other hand, one Italian Catholic magazine I get -- 30 Days -- has had interviews with the Superior General of the Society of Saint Pius X.)  Many Catholics will decide to side with the Pope.  There is some soundness in this, because the Papacy is infallible, so eventually some Pope *will* straighten all this out.  But, on the other hand, there is also unsoundness in this, in that, in the short term, the Popes may indeed be wrong, and such Catholics are doing nothing to help the situation by obeying them where they're wrong.  In fact, if the situation is grave enough, they sin in obeying him.  At the very least, they're wasting a great opportunity, because they are failing to love Christ in a heroic way at the very time that He needs this badly.  Schism... let's move on to schism.  What is it?  Schism is a superset of disobedience (refusal to obey a legitimate command).  All schismatics are disobedient.  But it's a superset, so it doesn't work the other way around: not all disobeyers are schismatics.  The mere fact that the SSPX priests don't comply with the Holy Father's desires doesn't make them schismatics.  So what is it that must be added to disobedience to constitute a schism?  Maybe this something else makes the SSPX priests schismatics.  You must add this: the rejection of the right to command.  Look in any decent reference on Catholic theology, and that's what you'll find: the distinguishing criterion of schism is rejection of the right to command.  Here's what the Catholic Encyclopedia says, for example:      ... not every disobedience is a schism; in order to possess this     character it must include besides the trangression of the commands     of superiors, denial of their Divine right to command.     (from the CE article \\\"Schism\\\")  Is the Society of Saint Pius X then schismatic?  The answer is a clear no: they say that the Pope is their boss.  They pray for him every day.  And that's all that matters as far as schism goes.  What all this boils down to is this: if we leave aside the consideration of the exact nature of their objections, their position is a legitimate one, as far as the Catholic theology of obedience and schism goes.  They are resisting certain Papal policies because they think that they are clearly contrary to the traditional teaching of the Papacy, and the best interests of the Church.  (In fact, someone who finds himself in this situation has a *duty* to resist.)  Now, what is the stance of Rome on all this?  Well, if you read the Holy Father's motu proprio \\\"Ecclesia Dei\\\", you can find out.  It's the definitive document on the subject.  A motu proprio is a specifically Papal act.  It's not the product of a Roman congregation, a letter that the Pope has possibly never even read.  It's from the Pope himself.  His boss is God... there's no one else to complain to.  In this document, the Holy Father says, among other things:  1) The episcopal consecrations performed by Archbishop Lefebvre constituted a schismatic act.  2) Archbishop Lefebvre's problem was a misunderstanding of the nature of Tradtion.  Both are confusing: I fail to see the logic of the Pope's points.  As far as the episcopal consecrations go, I read an interesting article in a translation of the Italian magazine \\\"Si Si No No\\\".  It all gets back to the question of jurisdiction.  If episcopal consecrations imply rejection of the Pope's jurisdiction, then they would truly constitute a schismatic act, justifying excommunication under the current code of canon law.  But my problem with this is this: according to the traditional theology of Holy Orders, episcopal consecration does not confer jurisdiction.  It only confers the power of Order: the ability to confect the Sacraments.  Jurisdiction must be conferred by someone else with the power to confer it (such as the Pope).  The Society bishops, knowing the traditional theology quite well, take great pains to avoid any pretence of jurisdiction over anyone.  They simply confer those Sacraments that require a bishop.  The \\\"Si Si No No\\\" article was interesting in that it posited that the reason that the Pope said what he did is that he has a novel, post-Vatican II idea of Holy Orders.  According to this idea, episcopal consecration *does* confer jurisdiction.  I lent the article to a friend, unfortunately, so can't tell you more.  I believe they quoted the new code of canon law in support of this idea.  The Pope's thinking on this point remains a great puzzle to me. There's no way there is a schism, according to traditional Catholic theology.  So why does the Pope think this?  As far as the points regarding the nature of Tradition goes, here's the passage in question:      The root of this schismatic act can be discerned in an incomplete     and contradictory notion of Tradtion.  Incomplete, because it does     not take sufficiently into the account the living character of     Tradition, which, as the Second Vatican Council clearly taught,          comes from the apostles and progresses in the Church with the         help of the Holy Spirit.  There is a growth in insight into         the realities and words that are being passed on.  This comes         about in various ways.  It comes through the contemplation and         study of believers who ponder these things in their hearts.         It comes from the intimate sense of spiritual realities which         they experience.  And it comes from the preaching of those who         have received, along with their right of succession in the         espiscopate, the sure charism of truth.      But especially contradictory is a notion of Tradition which     opposes the universal Magisterium of the Church possessed by the     Bishop of Rome and the body of bishops.  It is impossible to     remain faithful to the Tradition while breaking the ecclesial bond     with him to whom, in the person of the Apostle Peter, Christ     himself entrusted the ministry of unity in His Church.      (Papal motu proprio \\\"Ecclesia Dei\\\", 2 July 1988)  It seems to me that the Holy Father is making two points here that can be simplified to the following:  - Vatican Council II has happened. - I am the Pope.  The argument being that either case is sufficient to prove that Archbishop Lefebvre must be wrong, because he disagrees with them. This is weak, to say the least!  It would have helped clarify things more if the Pope had addressed Archbishop Lefebvre's concerns in detail.  What is John Paul II's stand on the social Kingship of Christ, as taught by Gregory XVI, Pius IX, Leo XIII, Pius XI and Pius XII, for example?  Are we supposed to ignore what all these Popes said on the subject?  I don't know what the future will hold, but the powers that be in the SSPX are still talking with Rome and trying to straighten things out.  --------------------------------------------------------------  [Many people would prefer to call a justified refusal to obey \\\"justified disobedience\\\" or even \\\"obeying God rather than man\\\". Calling a refusal to obey obedience puts us into a sort of Alice in Wonderland world where words mean whatever we want them to mean.  Similarly, schism indicates a formal break in the church.  If the Pope says that a schism exists, it seems to me that by definition it exists.  It may be that the Pope is on the wrong side of the break, that there is no good reason for the break to exist, and that it will shortly be healed.  But how can one deny that it does in fact exist?  It seems to me that you are in grave danger of destroying the thing you are trying to reform: the power of the papacy.  What good will it do you if you become reconciled to the the Pope in the future, but in the process, you have destroyed his ability to use the tools of church discipline?  It's one thing to hold that the Pope has misused his powers, and excommunicated someone wrongly.  It's something else to say that his excommunication did not take effect, and the schism is all in his imagination.  That means that acts of church discipline are not legal tools, but acts whose validity is open to debate.  Generally it has been liberal Catholics who have had problems with the Pope. While they have often objected to church sanctions, generally they have admitted that the sanctions exist.  You are now opening the door to people simply ignoring papal decisions, claiming to be truly obeying by disobeying, and to be in communion while excommunicated. This would seem to be precisely the denial of Divine right to command that you say defines schism.\",\" You seem to be assuming that all arrests are of equal value, and that the use of wiretaps is spread uniformly among them.\",\"Just a quick THANKS to the many who explained the backing up of my masters.

Lankford was hurt, although the announcer said he told Torre he  could pinch hit if they needed him to.  I wondered the same thing.

Alicea I was completely  confused about.  Maybe he had a good record hitting against that  particular pitcher?  I don't know.  Anybody got an idea?

Yup, I looked for this on the replay too.  If I'm Joe Torre, I'm  going to have a talk with Bucky after the game on that one.  He's  got Lankford at third with Todd Zeile I believe - a hot hitter -   coming up - there's no reason to risk giving Lankford the go sign   in that situation unless he was sure the ball is going to the stands.    It's his job to watch the play develop - he should have known Larkin   was there to back up a bad throw.  That seemed inexcusable in my book.

In short, I am happy with the monitor and unhappy with the card.  I have spent a lot more time futzing with the card, so that is what I am going to write about.  The monitor is pretty.  The moires I had under Simcity on my 17\\\" Magnavox went away.  It isn't as heavy as I thought it would be (45 lbs, I think).  So much for the monitor.  On to the bitch session and test results.  In going with the modern trend, the Orchid P9000 card only supports 16 colors in 640x480 mode without a driver.  Of course, this breaks any DOS program which uses SVGA modes (like most of my CD-ROMs).  The Compudyne Whiplash VGA, Orchid Fahrenheit 1280, and Orchid F. VLB all share this limitation.  Those are all S3 cards, which means it is an S3 problem for them (the P9000 uses a Weitek VGA chip which also doesn't support them).  The Hercules Graphite card does seem to have these modes, but I didn't run the same test cases as I did on the other boards during the brief time I had it.  It was able to print the splash screen for the Grolier's Encyclopedia, though, which the S3 cards just printed as hash, which is why I suspect the SVGA modes are supported.  The supported resolutions really annoy me.  You can do 1280x1024 at 75Hz if you tell the driver you have an NEC 5FG (they only have about six monitors listed plus 'Generic', and if you choose Generic you can't get any high refreshes at ALL).  But at 1024x768 you are limited to 70Hz.  Seems to me that the hardware should be able to support the bandwidth (if it can do 75Hz at 1280 it sure should be able to do it at 1024!).  Higher vertical resolution was the main reason I bought the card over the Orchid F. VLB I currently have, and it will do 1024x768x70 Hz as well.  The higher graphics modes all crash HP Dashboard.  I just got off the phone with Orchid, and with the 1.1 drivers (I don't know what I have) he was unable to recreate the problem.  On the plus side, their tech rep was as helpful as he could be and booted up the program on his computer to verify he didn't have the problem.  He didn't know why they limited the refresh to 70 Hz either.  The board is faster that the OFVLB for most things according to the Hercules Speedy program. This program tests various operations and reports the results in pixels/second.  I don't have the numbers for the Graphite card, but they were close to half of the OFVLB (ie, slower) but that was running in a 20MHz 386, ISA, so the numbers aren't really comparable.  The following numbers were all obtained using a 486, 33 MHz, AIR motherboard (UMC chipset), with 8 MB memory.  I give ranges because the program reports the numbers as it computes them, and these tend to jump around a bit.

I have no idea what is being done internally as far as conversions go.  The memory to screen takes the same face and copies it to the screen, my guess is after it has been rasterized into a bitmap that can just be copied to the video display.  The screen to screen test copies that face from place to place on the screen.  Awesome!  Interestingly, the solid vectors and shaded polygons show no improvement, and hatched polygons (ie, filled with cross-hatching) and Ternary Rops (whatever they are.  Graphics operations like XORs maybe????) are a dead loss on the 9000.  I give two numbers for the 9000 fonts, because I think they are caching. When the fonts are first drawn on the screen they are done fairly slowly -- 1/3 the speed of the OFVLB.  Then the speed increases dramatically.  Sounds like programming to a benchmark to me....  I make no claims that these numbers mean anything at all.  Its just what I saw when I ran them on my computer.  I normally don't write disclaimers, but this time maybe I'd better.

These are generalizations but for the most part that is what the difference is.\",\" The difference in the litigation environment is reflected in the fees.  Lack of defensive medicine and near-absence of malpractice is really why we spend less using the most expensive approach of pure insurance in Canada (along with France and Germany) without HMO's --- the NYT has admitted that malpractice insurance fees are an order of magnitude lower in Canada but doctors take-home pay is almost equal to American doctors; also, minimal bureaucracy 'cos the system is so-o-o simple (early March).  Part of the deal for using the all-insurance approach like the French and Germans do (hey, why don't they criticize France and Germany?  Is it because too many people take French and German in college to make the accusations stick? (-;) was to preserve the doctors independance. Since the provincial wings of the CMA are the ones that go to bat when the fee schedule hikes are presented, the politically-bent doctors were just cackling when they realized the CMA would grow in strength rather than diminish, especially when unopposed unlike in socialized medicine approaches like Britain's National Health Service.   For non-life threatening things, market arguments adequately cover why certain procedures are in scarcer demand.  I have MD friends who can't make a living as specialists back in Manitoba not due to the insurance rates but because they won't get enough customers -- the CMA medical monopoly's grip on doctors licencing (as in the US) aside -- so they must move to larger places.  However, this does not refute debunking of waiting lines for urgent AND routine care, as has been done in the U.S. by Consumers Reports, health policy studies cited by Prof. Dennis E. Shea on USENET, CNN, NYT, etc.  Doug Fierro has posted a NYT article from 3 weeks ago about Canada's health insurance approach, on Talk.politics.medicine.  There is one small error in the article: not all of our hospitals are private.   Of course, the one thing to note is that in the Canada/France/Germany case, private insurance *offloaded* the basic coverage to the public sector.  They realized they were keeping low-risk/high-profit extra insurance for things like private/semi-private rooms (vs. ward accomodation), dental, glasses, etc. for corporate or personal benefits, they'll have nothing to do with you if you want to be covered for basic care.  At that point, they wouldn't even consider a \\\"voucher\\\" approach to broker the universal coverage and sell policies to make up the difference in the federal guidelines and market stuff.   It is \\\"free\\\" in that there are no deductibles nor copayments (two things which I advocate to make the Canadian insurance look more like real health insurance -- which actually it is).  I know that when working in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec, I was aware that I was paying for health insurance - e.g., in Toronto, OHIP fees were listed on my pay stub; Manitoba did not collect at paycheque time, but only annually at income tax time (built into the tax rate).  Only fiscal naifs will proclaim that it's free, along with the Canadian Left for that is part of their brainwashing agenda.  The French do have copayments, though.  France Magazine's Summer  1992 edition has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance coverage, including a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For  1-30 days, you're covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100% afterward.  With extra private insurance, you can get into a private hospital and be covered for any differences beyond the public hospital rate.  The public insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same cash amount for a private hospital and the difference is paid out-of-pocket or according to your supplementary private insurance. Over 2/3rds of French have some form of extra private insurance.  So, the other 30% of health costs in Europe are out of private funds, not gleaned from other taxes.  The GDP figures are combined public and private expenditures for total outlay using the same methods that yield the 13-14% figure for the U.S.   Health insurance does exist in Canada and in Western Europe, its just that it doesn't cover basic care.  You can opt out in Canada and Germany, but you'll have to go uninsured as a result because there are too few other people that do so --- i.e., no market.  When private insurance realized how much money they'd make without the risks involved in basic insurance (e.g., neurosurgery) versus deluxe amenities (e.g., having to call Granada TV to replace a rental set on the fritz in someone's private hospital room), they started to pat themselves on the back for their social responsibility.  In Quebec last spring, a consortium of private insurers publicly warned against any thoughts of privatizing routine, low cost parts of that province's public health insurance plan.  gld\",\" Yes, and what about Paul saying:  26 Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath: (Ephesians 4:26).

Yet it was still home to thousands of people who, in happier  times, tended fields and flocks of geese. Last week it was wiped off  the map.  .......  As sickening reports trickled in to the Azerbaijani border town of  Agdam, and the bodies piled up in the morgues, there was little doubt  that Khojaly and the stark foothills and gullies around it had been  the site of the most terrible massacre since the Soviet Union broke  apart.  .......  I was the last Westerner to visit Khojaly. That was in january and  people were predicting their fate with grim resignation. Zumrut Ezoya,  a mother of four on board the helicopter that ferried us into the  town, called her community \\\"sitting ducks, ready to get shot\\\". She and  her family were among the victims of the massacre on February 26.  .......  \\\"The Armenians have taken all the outlying villages, one by one, and  the government does nothing.\\\" Balakisi Sakikov, 55, a father of five,  said. \\\"Next they will drive us out or kill us all,\\\" said Dilbar, his  wife.

CORPSES LITTER HILLS IN KARABAKH  ANATOL LIEVEN COMES UNDER FIRE WHILE FLYING WITH AZERBAIJANI FORCES TO  INVESTIGATE THE ALLEGED MASS KILLINGS OF REFUGEES BY ARMENIAN TROOPS...  As we swooped low over the snow-covered hills of Nagorno-Karabagh we saw  the scattered corpses. Apparently, the refugees had been shot down as  they ran. An Azerbaijani film of the places we flew over, shown to  journalists afterwards, showed DOZENS OF CORPSES lying in various parts  of the hills.  The Azerbaijanis claim that AS MANY AS 1000 have died in a MASS KILLING  of AZERBAIJANIS fleeing from the town of Khodjaly, seized by Armenians  last week. A further 4,000 are believed to be wounded, frozen to death  or missing...   Seven of us squatted in the cabin of an Azerbaijani M24 attack helicopter  as we flew to investigate the claims of the mass killings. Suddenly there  was a thump against the underside of the aircraft, a red flash of tracer  ripped past the starboard wing, and the helicopter rocked sharply. We  swung round, and there was a deafening burst of fire from the cannon  under our wing as the helicopter crew returned fire.  We had been fired on from an Armenian anti-aircraft post. We swung round  again, tipped to starboard and appeared to dive straight down into a  valley. The brown earth swooped around our heads, the helicopter swung  round again and followed the contours of the ground. Our cannon fired  repeated blasts.  Later it emerged that a civilian helicopter that we had been escorting  had landed successfully at Nakhichevanik in the east of the disputed  enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, to pick up some of the dead. We had, in  fact, been attacked both by ground fire and by an Armenian helicopter.  I had seen the Armenian helicopter intermittently through the window,  its cannons firing, but had thought - mistakenly - that it was on  \\\"our side\\\". Our group of Western journalists had embarked on a  search-and-rescue flight that had become a combat mission.  Our flight consisted of the civilian passenger helicopter and two  M24 Soviet attack helicopters in the Azerbaijani service, nicknamed  flying crocodiles for their armour. Our party was in the second  crocodile. The civilian helicopter's job was to land in the mountains  and pick up bodies at sites of the mass killings. The attack helicopters  were there to give covering fire if necessary.  The operation showed a striking sign of the disintegration of the Soviet  armed forces because our pilot was a Russian officer. An Azerbaijani  official told us that there were now five former Soviet military  helicopters -and their pilots- fighting for Azerbaijan. \\\"They have  signed contracts to fly for us,\\\" he said. The helicopter we engaged  in combat was most probably flown by a brother-officer of our Russian  pilot, but fighting for the Armenians.  We had taken off just before 5pm on Saturday from Agdam airfield, an  heated for the Armenian-controlled mountains of Karabakh, a sheer  white wall in the distance. The civilian helicopter picked up four  corpses, and it was during this and a previous mission that an  Azerbaijani cameraman filmed the several the several dozen bodies  on the hillsides. We then took off again in a hurry and speed back  towards Azerbaijani lines. Azerbaijani gunners on the last hill before  the plain - and safety - gazed up at us as we passed.  Back at the airfield in Agdam, we took a look the bodies the  civilian helicopter had picked up. Two old men a small girl were  covered with blood, their limbs contorted by the cold and rigor  mortis. They had been shot.  What did our Russian pilot think of the tragedy, our close shave,  and the war in Nagorno-Karabakh? He gave us CHEERFUL GRIN, POLITELY  DECLINED TO ANSWER QUES TIONS, AND MARCHED OFF TO HIS DINNER.

An Appeal to Mankind  During the last three years Azerbaijan and its multinational population are vainly fighting for justice within the limits of the Soviet Union. All humanitarian, constitutional human rights guaranteed by the UN Charter, Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Helsinki Agreements, Human Problems International Forums, documents signed by the Soviet Union - all of them are violated.  The USSR's President, government bodies do not defend Azerbaijan though they are all empowered to take necessary measures to guarantee life and peace.  The 140,000 strong army of Armenian terrorists with Moscow's tacit consent wages an undeclared war of annihilation against Azerbaijan. As a result, a part of Azerbaijan has been occupied and annexed, hundreds of people killed, thousands wounded.  Some 200,000 Azerbaijanis have been brutally and inhumanly deported from the Armenian SSR, their historical homeland. Together with them 64,000 Russians and 22,000 Kurds have also been driven out, a part of them now settled in Azerbaijan. Some 40,000 Turkish-Meskhetians, Lezghins and representatives  of other Caucasian nationalities who escaped from the Central Asia where the President and government bodies did not guarantee them the life and peace also suffered from these deportations.  One of the scandalous vandalisms directed not only against Azerbaijan science but the world civilization as well is the Armenian extremists' destruction of the Karabakh scientific experimental base of The Institute of Genetics and Selection  of the Academy of Sciences of the Azerbaijan SSR.  We beg you for humanitarian help and political assistance, for the honour and dignity of 7 million Azerbaijanis are violated, its territory, culture  and history are trampled, its people are shot. There is persistent negative image of Azerbaijanians abroad, and this defamation is spread over  the whole world by Soviet mass media, Armenian lobby in the USSR and the United States.   One of the myths is that all events allegedly involves and generated by interethnic collisions and religious intolerance while the truth is that all these shootings and recent  events stem from the territorial claims of Armenia on Azerbaijan.  It is a well documented fact that before the conflict there were no frictions between Armenians and Azerbaijanis on the issue of Karabakh. Hundreds and thousands Armenians placidly and calmly lived and worked in Azerbaijan land, had their representatives in all government bodies of the Azerbaijan SSR.  We are for a united, indivisible, sovereign Azerbaijan, we  are for a common Caucasian home proclaimed in 1918 by one of the founding fathers of the Azerbaijan Democratic  Republic - Muhammed Emin Rasulzade.  But all these goals and expectations are trampled upon the Soviet leadership in favour of the Armenian expansionists encouraged by Moscow and intended to create a new '1,000 Year Reich' - the 'Great Armenia' - by annexing the  neighboring lands.  The world public opinion shed tears to save the whales, suffers for penguins dying out in the Antarctic Continent.  But what about the lives of seven million human beings? If these people are Muslims, does it mean that they are less valuable? Can people be discriminated by their  colour of skin or religion, by their residence or other attributes?  All people are brothers, and we appeal to our brothers for help and understanding. This is not the first appeal of Azerbaijan to the world public opinion. Our previous appeals were unheard. However, we still carry the hope that the truth beyond the Russian and Armenian propaganda will one day reveal the extent of our suffering and stimulate at least as much help and compassion for Azerbaijan as tendered to whales and penguins.

The Armenians are Christians, the Azerbaijanis are Moslems, and Islam is a religion especially unloved by the democrat-westernizers. Besides, at the root of this conflict lie the territorial claims on Azerbaijan, a consequence of which were the blood and suffering of innocent Azeri people, hundreds of thousands of refugees, and gross violations of human rights.   Recently Armenians attacked the Azeri town of Khojaly and massacred thousands of Azeris. The Paris-based 'Association for Democracy and Human Rights in Azerbaijan' puts the number of Khojali victims at 3,145. Some of the dead were scalped and mutilated. This whole thing has now gone entirely too far.   They already did.

The republic of Armenia reiterated denials that its militants had killed 1,000 people in the Azerbaijani populated town of Khojaly last week and  massacred men, women and children fleeing the carnage across snow-covered mountain passes.

Plenty of theists  I think the argument that a particular theist system causes genocide can be made more convincingly than an argument that atheism causes genocide. This is because theist systems contain instructions on how to act, and one or more of these can be shown to cause genocide.

Scum has no guilt or freedom to choose anything.  Griffen does.  God did not make scum when he made Griffen. He made a precious person and this person chose to do wrong.  The same goes for Dr. Gunn.  : But if you are to examine it more closely, Griffen would have preferred that : these children were born -- yet AFTER their birth, did Griffen have any  : assistance to offer them?  Did Griffen intend to support them, educate them, : raise them up to be useful citizens?  Did he have any intent whatsoever : to help these children after birth? :   Here's the real problem.  Americans have become so insensitive to the needs of others and so completely wrapped up in themselves that they cannot see straight or think clearly enough to make even the slightest and most obvious moral decisions based on reality.  If a man abandons a woman to care for their child on her own, he is not considered to be a very respectable or decent man by anyone.  This man has fled his responsibility, has behaved like a lazy coward, and has turned away from his responsibility to his wife and child.  However, if a woman decides to kill her unborn child to release her burden, she is not thought of in the same way.  When the man abandons, the woman suffers but the child is free to grow up and live a happy and normal life. When the woman abandons, the child is diced or killed with saline or vacuumed out, and the man has no choice, and the man sometimes suffers so badly that he wishes he could trade places with his child.  Ths root of this whole problem is selfishness--the arrogance that says, \\\"My feelings and desires are supreme and your well being is not worth dung.\\\" And when you come down to it, this is the substance of what hell is made of. It's the reason a loving God can throw selfish people to the devil and his demons for all of eternity.  Let any one of us unrepentant into heaven, and we'll ruin it the first chance we get.  : Now, I don't really know the answer to these questions, but I've got a real : good guess. :   And, it's probably right.  : And I wouldn't call *that* 'benevolent', either. :   It is a move in the right direction.  As it is now, we don't see our responsibility because we kill it and get it out of sight.  The media backs us completely.  Real responsibility does not sell.  The only \\\"responsibility\\\" that sells in the marketplace is that which is just enough to make us \\\"feel responsible\\\" without showing anything that might show us our own true irresponsibility.  We want to \\\"feel\\\" like good people, but we want nothing with *being* good people.  Just give me the freedom to say \\\"I'm good\\\", and the rest of the world can burn. Rape and kill my children and throw my parents to the places where poor old folks rot until they're dead.  I'll hate my brother and sister if I wish and I'll cheat on my wife or husband.  Screw the government, because it screws me, and don't talk to me about giving to the church because church people are all a bunch of money grubbing hypocrites. But, I'm a good person.  At least I admit what I do.  At least I love myself and we all know that is the greatest love in the world--not that a man lay down his life for his brother...That sounds too \\\"christian\\\".  At the root, this is the substance of what hell is made of.  We've become a self indulgant, backslidden society no longer responsible to our children, to our parents, to our families, to our government, or to our God.  This is the root behind justification of every evil, of every corruption in government, of every slanderous remark, of every lie, and of every murder.

Smith, D.D.                               (1894-1977)            When Jesus was on Earth, He made an amazing prediction about      Himself, and frequently repeated it.  Let me quote it for you:                   Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son                of Man shall be betrayed unto the chief                priests and unto the scribes, and they shall                condemn Him to death, and shall deliver Him                to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and                to crucify Him; and the third day He shall                rise again\\\" (Matthew 20:18-19).            Wholly different from the normal experience of men, Jesus,      who had *never* done anything worthy of death, even deserving      reproval, knew He would die before He was 40 years of age.  He      knew the very city where He would die.  He knew that the religious      leaders of His own race would condemn Him to death.  He knew that      one of His own would betray Him.  He knew that before His actual      death took place He would be mocked and scourged.  He knew exactly      how He would die--*by crucifixion.*            All this is in itself remarkable.  But more amazing than the      minute particulars of His foreknowledge was what He predicted      would follow shortly after He was buried--*that He would rise      again.*  He even designated the time--on the third day.            But since it is on this central fact--the death and resurrec-      tion of Jesus Christ--that the whole truth or untruth of Chris-      tianity turns, let us examine it more closely.            The body of Jesus was embalmed in long sheets of cloth      between the layers of which a great abundance of spices and      ointments was distributed.  The body was placed in a tomb which      had never before been used, and a great stone was rolled against      the entrance.  The Jewish authorities, fully aware that Jesus had      predicted He would rise again, had the stone officially sealed and      on Saturday placed a guard before the tomb to prevent the      disciples from carrying away the body.  Early Sunday morning some      of the women who were faithful followers of Christ went out to the      tomb to further anoint the body.  To their utter astonishment,      they found the stone rolled away, the body gone.  They rushed back      to tell the disciples.  Shortly two of Jesus' friends, Peter and      John, utterly skeptical about the whole affair, came and found the      tomb empty, just as the women had said.  Even the guards came      hurrying into the city to tell the Sanhedrin that had hired them      to guard the tomb that the body was gone (Matthew 28:11).            How did this tomb become empty?            One of the most famous New Testament scholars in America--      professor of New Testament literature in a large theological      seminary--wrote to the author in answer to my question of *how*      the tomb became empty, and wrote it in a letter *not* marked by      bitterness or sarcasm, that he could no more explain how the tomb      became empty than he could explain how Santa Claus comes down the      chimney at Christmas time.            But he didn't realize that Santa Clause never did come down      any chimney at Christmas time, *because there never was a Santa      Claus!*  ...And there *is* a Jesus.  He died; He was buried in the      tomb of Joseph of Arimathea, and on Sunday the body was gone.            Those are facts of history.  No one can escape the responsi-      bility of coming to some conclusion about what really happened by      mentioning a myth we all abandoned before we were eight years old.            Another professor, Dr. Kirsopp Lake of Harvard University,      tried to explain the empty tomb by saying (what no other scholar      in the field of New Testament criticism has ventured to adopt)      that the women went to the wrong tomb.            The facts are these:            First, so far as we know, there was no other tomb nearby to      which by mistake they could have gone.            Second, it is contrary to all similar experience for three or      more people to forget the place where they have buried their      dearest loved one within less than three days.  Even if the women      did miss the tomb, when Peter and John came, did they too go to      the wrong tomb?            Third, were the soldiers *guarding* the wrong tomb?            There is, of course, a record of an attempt to escape the      evidence of the empty tomb in the New Testament itself.                    Now when they were going, behold, some                of the watch came into the city and showed                unto the chief priests all the things that                were done.  And when they were assembled                with the leaders and had taken counsel, they                gave large money unto the soldiers, Saying,                Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole                Him away while we slept.  And if this come to                the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and                secure you.  So they took the money, and did                as they were taught:  and this saying is com-                monly reported among the Jews until this day                (Matthew 28:11-15).            This is a good illustration of many later attempts to escape the      fact that the tomb was empty.            You will notice at once that the chief priests and the elders never      questioned but that the tomb *was* empty.  They never even went out to      see if what the guards had reported was true--they *knew* it was true.            Another fact about this story makes it ridiculous to maintain that      the tomb was empty--the soldiers were told to say that Jesus' disciples      came and stole the body away *while they* (the soldiers) *were asleep!*            How could they know what was going on while they were asleep?      Obviously, such testimony would be valueless in any court.            Even aside from the shallowness and sordidness that make us reject      the explanation, the very character and the later history of the      disciples compel us to believe they did not steal and secretly carry away      the body of Jesus.            First, as Professor Heffern points out, the leaders of Judaism in      Jerusalem, who had put the Lord Jesus to death, had nothing to offer to      contradict these disciples as they continued to preach Jesus and His      resurrection--because all Jerusalem knew the tomb was empty.  If there      had been trickery here, sooner or later it would have been suspected,      then proved.            Second, surely *one* of the disciples, even *most* of them, would      have confessed the fraud under the terrific persecution they underwent.      It may be possible to live a lie, but men seldom die for a lie--and most      of these men did.            The result ultimately would have been that the message that Christ      had risen would have suffered the fate of all such unfounded stories--it      would have lost it *power.*  Instead, this truth swept the world, closed      pagan temples, won millions of disciples, brought hope to a despairing      humanity, was the very foundation truth of the early church, and is today      as believable and as freshly glorious as ever.            But not only did Jesus come alive again, He did not disappear to      leave the disciples speculating through all the subsequent days as to      what had happened to Him.            Instead, He appeared to them--literally, visibly, frequently.            He appeared to the women at the tomb on Resurrection morning      (Matthew 28:1-10); later that day to Mary Magdalene alone (John 20:11-      18); and to Simon Peter, also alone (Luke 24:34).  In the afternoon He      walked with two of His followers toward Emmaus (Luke 24:13-35); and that      night He appeared to ten of the apostles gathered together in an upper      room at Jerusalem (Mark 16:14-16; Luke 24:36-40; etc.).            A week later He appeared to all eleven of the apostles, probably at      the same place (John 20:26-28).  Once He was seen by above 500 brethren      on a mountain in Galilee (I Corinthians 15:6); and finally to the      apostles just before His ascension (Mark 16:19; Luke 24:50-52; Acts 1:3-      8).            As with the fact of the empty tomb, so in regard to these histor-      ically recorded appearances, all kinds of theories have been proposed      attempting to deny their literalness.  But these theories are      unreasonable, without supporting evidence.  None has ever won the      unanimous approval of those who refuse to believe in the reality of the      appearances.            Moreover, while it is true we are living in an age when may of our      leading scientists and agnostics and many of our philosophers are      antisuperanaturalistic, let us not forget that some of the greatest      thinkers of the ages have firmly believed in this great miracle.      Increase Mather, president of Harvard; Timothy Dwight, president of Yale;      Nathan Lord, president of Dartmouth; Edward Hitchcock, president of      Amherst; Mark Hopkins, president of Williams; John Witherspoon, president      of Princeton--these men and countless others have believed it.            But suppose Christ *did* rise from the dead, what of it?  What has      it to do with *my* life?  What has it to do with *your* life?  Just this:      it seals with certitude the teachings of Christ.            Jesus taught many great truths--especially many about Himself.  He      claimed to have come down *from* God.            He said He was the way *to* God.            He said He was the Son of God, who alone knew God perfectly.            He said that whoever believed on Him had eternal life, and no one      else had it.            He said that whatever we ask God in His name, He would grant it to      us.            Thus when He did rise from the grave on the third day, He revealed      that in these amazing, unparalleled predictions, *He spoke the truth!*            Do you know any reason, *any good reason,* why we should not believe      that His words are all true?            The point is, does not the truth of the Resurrection convince us      that He is none other than the One He claimed to be--the Son of God?            And then, of course, the fact that Christ rose from the dead      testifies that He has broken the power of death, and that He will some      day raise us also up from the grave, as He promised.            In other words, if this Person, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, in all      this, He should be the cornerstone of the foundation of your life.  For      He said a life built on Him would know forgiveness of sins, His compan-      ionship and help, a joy that no circumstances can ever take away, and a      hope that shineth more and more unto a perfect day.\",\"  If anyone gets the New York Times, the Edit page has a transcript of a VHS from Hams describing their methods of torture and  execution.

Unfortunately this is bound up in the definitions of strong and weak atheism, at least according to the FAQ:  # Atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God. # Some atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former is # often referred to as the \\\"weak atheist\\\" position, and the latter as \\\"strong # atheism\\\". #  # It is important to note the difference between these two positions.  \\\"Weak # atheism\\\" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  \\\"Strong # atheism\\\" is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do not # fall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are \\\"strong atheists\\\".

I guess for DOS users who think multi-tasking is really _neat_ (add puke here) and are overjoyed to  be able to use more than 64K of memory, its a major improvement. For Windows users its more like an upgrade with facilities most Unix users take for  granted. Most of  Windows users only use PCs for text processing or running  3rd-party applications anyway so the operating system features are not even  a real issue. My ideal operating system:   Binary compatible across all plaforms. It should recognize  binaries and configure on the fly, so I don't have to have  bin/Mac bin/DOS bin/Dec bin/Sun bin/HP etc...   Multi-CPU. So I can use the CPUs on my PC and W/S and Mac   and Transputers and DSPs. I don't know a single site which   has gone for a single vendor. I am not going to trade-in   80Mflops per H1 transputer or ultra-fast FFT on DSP chips.  Note NT runs on Symmetric multi-CPU systems.   Built-in portable GUI/Graphics tools. You can call DrawButton   or DrawLine and it does the same thing no matter what platform   or display. It should also translate graphics commands on-the-fly.  so I can use PC graphics S/W on my workstation and X software on    my PC. I think GUIs are not just nice to have but essential.   Configurable front-end. So you can make it look like Unix or DOS  or NT or OS/2, and run shell scripts or command/BAT files.   Object oriented. So I can program easily under it and not have  to re-invent the wheel if the networking is not up to scratch  or my application needs to access source/object code on the fly.  In other words it should have some AI capability. That and a tight, clean kernel so you can actually understand it.

The followup isn't \\\"news\\\" ...\",\" The Centaur that is being built for T4 would be a better bet to integrate  onto the Proton as the T4/Centaur is designed for the Extremely Harsh  envorinment of the T4 launch. It is also closer to 4 m in diameter.   You've hit on the real kicker, however. The Centaur is pressure stabilized.  It cannot hold up its own weight without pressure in the tanks. Additionally,  the pressure difference between the two tanks must be maintained to ~+/- 5 psi.  That is rather tight to be rocking and rolling on the train. The pressure  stabilization is how centaur achieves the performance. On numerous occasions (when I was there 88-91) the AF wanted to see what it would take to make  a non-pressure stabilized centaur. The answer -- a centaur not worth launching.   The Atlas/Centaur does not require on-pad integration, however the T4/Centaur does. I believe the on-pad integration is to a great extent due to the  cleanliness requirements and PFL configuration, so maybe something can be  done there........    The addition of LOX/LH facilities is critical as the centaur tops off as it  lifts off. A LHe facility is also needed. I don't know what the proton uses  for fuel, but since they are derived from ICBM's I would suspect that they  use storable propellants which don't have the ullage problem that cryo's  do. If there is no cryo at the sight at all, the addition of these systems  could be big $$, not to mention the real tech transfer issues involved with  providing centaur GSE to Russia. That issue alone might be enough to kill  this idea.  \",\" the classic references in this area are Jacques Ellul for a liberal/evangelical perspective and Os Guiness for a straight evangelical view.  If you want to look at non-christian sources try Alvin Toffler as the perennial optimist.  His views while blatently non christian explore where technology may be going.   This is regardless of technology.  Be careful to separate the issues of related to speed and dispersion of technology (how far the letter went and how quickly it got there) and the message being passed in the technology (something that seems to be totally wrong.)   When lecturing in this area I challenge my (non-christan/atheistic) class about the impact technology has on life, quality of life and the rights that they consider important.  Depending on how you work out your faith will determine your response to the use of technology.  For example friends of mine are considering IVF due to a life threatening situation the wife is going through; when it is over they will have the baby. (God willing).  In this case the technology is available and my friends have to decide what to do.  In all cases though you must decide if the technology is against God's revealed word.

Here is a simplified way of looking at it: The first session has the directory structure burned at some tracks.  The second session has a newer directory structure, but the first directory still exists, because you cannot change, only add.  So if you put that in a 'normal' drive and it will only look to the first directory and think it has found all data.  Multisession kindof means that the drive will look for the last directory written to the disc, older systems look only for 'the' directory, not taking multiple directories into account.\",\"       Yes, please create the group alt.raytrace soon!!

I never said that these  alternative means of self-protection involved any hardware.  Why are 'good' neighborhoods 'good' ? It isn't because every  person is armed to the teeth. It is because of (1) attitude  and (2) cooperation. In the 'good' neighborhoods, the residents  make themselves aware of their neighbors and notice when  strangers are lurking around. 'Good' neighborhoods form groups  like 'crime-watch' to increase this effect, and the relative  effectiveness of the police. When hostiles are arrested, the  good neighbors step up and say \\\"THAT'S the one officer ! He  was robbing Mr. Jones' house\\\".

The only record of impact comes from the New Testament. I have no guarantee that its books are in the least accurate, and that the recorded \\\"impact\\\" actually happened.

(2)  It seems probable that no one displayed the body of Jesus because no one knew where it was.  I personally believe that the most likely explanation was that the body was stolen (by disciples, or by graverobbers). Don't bother with the point about the guards ... it only appears in one gospel, and seems like exactly the sort of thing early Christians might make up in order to counter the grave-robbing charge.  The New Testament does record that Jews believed the body had been stolen.

So do you also oppose all ideologies?  I don't think your argument is an argument against religion at all, but just points out the weaknesses of human nature.   I would like a reference if you have got one, for this is news to me.   One must approach the Qur'an with intelligence.  Any thinking approach to the Qur'an cannot but interpret the above verse and others like it that women and men are spiritual equals.  I think that the above verse does clearly imply that women have souls.  Does it make any sense for something without a soul to be forgiven?  Or to have a great reward (understood to be in the after-life)?  I think the usual answer would be no -- in which case, the part saying \\\"For them has God prepared forgiveness and a great reward\\\" says they have souls.    (If it makes sense to say that things without souls can be forgiven, then  I have no idea _what_ a soul is.)  As for your saying that the quote above may not be given a high priority in all interpretations, any thinking approach to the Qur'an has to give all verses of the Qur'an equal priority.  That is because, according to Muslim belief, the _whole_ Qur'an is the revelation of God -- in fact, denying the truth of any part of the Qur'an is sufficient to be considered a disbeliever in Islam.   Look, any approach to the Qur'an must be done with intelligence and thought.  It is in this fashion that one can try to understand the Quran's message.  In a book of finite length, it cannot explicitly answer every question you want to put to it, but through its teachings it can guide you.  I think, however, that women are the spiritual equals of men is clearly and unambiguously implied in the above verse, and that since women can clearly be \\\"forgiven\\\" and \\\"rewarded\\\" they _must_ have souls (from the above verse).  Let's try to understand what the Qur'an is trying to teach, rather than try to see how many ways it can be misinterpreted by ignoring this passage or that passage.  The misinterpretations of the Qur'an based on ignoring this verse or that verse are infinite, but the interpretations  fully consistent are more limited.  Let's try to discuss these interpretations consistent with the text rather than how people can ignore this bit or that bit, for that is just showing how people can try to twist Islam for their own ends -- something I do not deny -- but provides no reflection on the true teachings of Islam whatsoever.\",\"As an animal science student, I know that a number of animals transfer immunoglobin to thier young through thier milk.  In fact, a calf _must_ have a sufficient amount of colostrum (early milk) within 12 hours to effectively develop the immune system, since for the first (less than) 24 hours the intestines are \\\"open\\\" to the IG passage.

However, from what I have seen, it is not often presented in this manner. It is usually presented more in the form, \\\"And *besides*, I cannot see... ...nor have I ever been offered a convincing explanation.\\\"  Moreover, it is not unreasonable to ask for an explanation for such phenomena. That theism does not provide a convincing explanation is not an argument in theism's favor. Especially when different theisms offer  different explanations, and even different adherents of what is purportedly the same theism give different explanations...    Not im my experience. In my experience, the most common reason is the lack of evidence in theism's favor.

I have tried to find info on this but I could not get precise answers.  On one hand, we have a Quadra 950 with a 16\\\" monitor, which is capable of 32-bit color. How much VRAM does it have? On the other hand, we have a Quadra 800 with a 16\\\" monitor, which is capable of 8-bit color only, so it must have 512 Ko of VRAM.  I would like to take VRAM SIMMs for the 950 and put them in the 800 so that both machines have 16-bit color capability. Is it possible, and if yes, how many VRAM SIMMs should I take from the 950? From the documentation I have, the Quadra 800 must get 1 Mo VRAM to have 16-bit color, is that correct?  Bonus question: where do VRAM SIMMs hide? From the 950 documentation, they seem to be *behind* the power supply. Do I really have to take off the power supply to access the VRAM SIMMs?   Thanks for your help! \",\" The Fujitsu 2322 uses what is known as an 'SMD' interface (Storage Module Device?).  A lot of older minis used it.  Sun still does on their server models.  There are several different speeds of SMD, and I think that the  Fuji drive you have is rated at about 24 Mb/sec (thats megabits).  There used to be several companies that made couplers for the PC (Interphase in Texas being one), but I think that the market pretty much has dried up. Controllers for this type of drive are readily available for VME buses though.  Rumor has it that there is a SMD to SCSI adapter available, but I think that it was designed for slower SMD devices.  In other words, if you have a PC or Mac, that drive is pretty much dogmeat. Cheers, Corwin \",\"  Say, you bought your Saturn at $13k, with a dealer profit of $2k. If the dealer profit is $1000, then you would only be paying $12k for the same car.  So isn't that saving money?  Moreover, if Saturn really does reduce the dealer profit margin by $1000,  then their cars will be even better deals.  Say, if the price of a Saturn was already $1000 below market average for the class of cars, then after they reduce the dealer profit, it would be $2000 below market average.  It will:  1) Attract even more people to buy Saturns because it would SAVE THEM MONEY.   2) Force the competitors to lower their prices to survive.  Now, not only will Saturn owners benefit from a lower dealer profit, even  the buyers for other cars will pay less.  Isn't that saving money?  \",\" There are definitely quite a few horrible deaths as the result of both atheists AND theists.

I must congratulate your analytical and excellent reportage about  Diana. From  the writings  of tye biographers  you  quoted,  I can  perceive,  maybe chauvinistically,  the  remnants of  her  Armenian genes. Even  though she  is only  1/64th Armenian, she   seems   to   have   many   of   the   strong characteristics  of Armenian  women. Her  Armenian ancestry is  traced to Eliza Kewark  (an Armenian from  India), who  married  the Scottish  merchant Thedore Forbes.  From the union was  born Kathleen Scott  Forbes,  who  married  James  Crombie  from Aberdeen. They  had a  daughter Jane,  who married David  Littlejohn.  Their  daughter  Ruth  married William Gill. Ruth Silvia Gill, the grandmother of Lady  Diana,   married  Lord  Fermoy,   and  their daughter, Frances  Ruth Burke Roache,  married the eight Earl of Spencer, who  was the father of Lady Diana. It is noteworthy  that Eliza Kewark was also referred  to as  Mrs. Forbesian  (a characteristic Armenian  surname  ending).  An  Armenian-Scottish gene mix is dynamite.  Levon K.

Anyway, the Armenians tore apart the Ottoman Empire's eastern provinces, massacred 2.5 million defenseless Turkish women, children and elderly  people, burned thousands of Turkish and Kurdish villages and exterminated  the entire Turkish population of the Armenian dictatorship between  1914-1920. Such outrageous sleight of hand that is still employed today  in Armenia brings a depth and verification to the Turkish genocide  that is hard to match. A hundred years ago Armenians again thought  they could get whatever they wanted through sheer terror like the  Russian anarchists that they accepted as role models. Several Armenian  terror groups like ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle  resorted to the same tactics in the 1980s, butchering scores of innocent Turks and their families in the United States and Europe. It seems that  they are doing it again, at a different scale, in fascist x-Soviet Armenia  today.   Source: Stanford J.

Their hope was their participation in the Russian  success would be rewarded with an independent Armenian state carved out of  Ottoman territories.

No help there. Then, not having anything better to try, I changed Normal IRQ to Delayed IRQ on the disk controller (didn't make any difference) and IOCHRDY_not_ driven to IDE_drive_controls_IOCHRDY (also had no effect).  So I put  everything back to the way it was and re-installed the cards.  I then unplugged the floppy drive cable from the disk controller.  Voila!, the PC booted from power up, although it seemed to take several seconds  before the first access to the hard disk.  Plug the floppy cable back to the controller and the original (non-boot) behavior returns.  O.K., with this additional information, does anyone in netland have any  words of wisdom for what's going on and how I should deal with it?\",\"   Yup. I agree with ya. I think Devils can beat Red Wings easily. SO I think   all those who send in their votes should try all these diffrent teams   before voting.

I'm not sure if its been done and I'm just remembering it unconsiously, but I thought that in dialog boxes and whatever in windowing systems, there should be a way to intuitivly set some things checked or unchecked or filled in a certain way.

It was looking sparse (about 40 people) until the speaker began, whereupon about 120 more people followed the loudspeakers from wherever they had been lost, and filled out the area something proud.  Mike Yacino of GOAL spoke.  One of his best throwaway lines was to remind us that all of us holders of carry permits there had been checked and certified clear of all crimes by the state; while the people in the Statehouse behind us only had to be certified clean of \\\"election fraud\\\" to hold their jobs.  Nancy Snow and Amos Hamburger were busy handing out ID buttons and sheets describing all the bills to be presented at the hearings, and telling people where to find their own representatives (and in too many cases, who they were).  Mike warned us that the committee was going to suspend its rules and discuss a bill that hadn't made it onto the official list.  It seems a delegation of students from Simon's Rock of Bard College (alma mater of Wayne Lo, who shot up the place with an SKS late last year) was being bussed in to testify for a bill to ban all sales of firearms or ammo to anyone who is not a state resident.  The hearings were originally scheduled in the (large) Gardner Auditorium at 10:30, but that had been pre-empted by the Governor's hearings on the Framingham Eight (women in prison for killing abusive husbands, and seeking release).  So we had until 1:30 to buttonhole our representatives, after which we would be squashed into an inadequate hearing room.  One of my representatives' staffers was somewhat offensively smarmy. He said, \\\"Oh, it must be gun hearings day again!  The gun lobby is always so organized every year.\\\"  I got a little pissed, and replied, \\\"I'm not from the gun lobby -- I'm from your district.\\\"  At 12:30, your second reporter arrived in time to notice a demonstration going on in front of the statehouse (where the pro-gunners weren't).  Randy Price from the TV News was there, in his mirror reflective shades, talking to one of the anti-gun types, and several Simon's Rock anti-gun \\\"close-the-loophole\\\" protestors. (Earlier, Randy had covered the GOAL rally.)  The room we had been assigned seated about 50.  Remember, there were about 160 gun owners there, plus another 20-30 students and teachers from Bard.  One of us had already reserved a seat; the other never got closer than the atrium outside -- and there was a crowd behind HIM.  A cop took up station at the entrance and prevented the rest of the crowd from coming in.  Soon after the debate started, a loudspeaker was set up outside in the hall for the benefit of everyone else.  Everyone who was there (inside and outside) got to sign up on a sheet saying what their position was on which bills.  Most of us signed up to \\\"support GOAL's position\\\" on \\\"all bills.\\\"  First, because of their time constraints, public officials got to testify.  And first up was the bill that nobody had seen (the students had some curfew, I guess).    Currently, Massachusetts law allows a non-resident to purchase long guns or ammo from a local dealer provided he complies with the laws of his own state.  Previously, the law was similar, but applied only to non-residents from states adjoining Massachusetts.  The Simon's Rock folks called the current law a \\\"loophole\\\" and wanted it closed.  Two of their reps spoke about Wayne Lo and his \\\"SKS assault rifle.\\\" The second one, Hodgekiss, a co-sponsor, had done his homework so well that he kept confusing Montana (Wayne Lo's home state) with Missouri, and became belligerent when about five gun owners in the gallery corrected him after his second muff.  Carr, from Gloucester, claimed that the new bill would put the law back the way it was, but he was lying: the new bill allows purchases by non-residents of adjoining states ONLY if they have licensing in their own state \\\"as strong as\\\" that in Massachusetts.  Since none of them do, that's that.  Some of the things these two said were really offensive.  \\\"In some of these other states, anyone can buy a gun as long as he's breathing!\\\" (Oooooo!)  \\\"We have some very, very good gun laws in Massachusetts; if only the other states would adopt the same type of laws, we wouldn't be having this situation -- but they won't.\\\"  (Naughty, naughty!)  Next up was Boston city councilman Albert \\\"Dapper\\\" O'Neill.  He was there to testify pro-gun, but in some ways he was a liability.  He's reasonably elderly and tends to wander and repeat himself, plus he's almost a caricature of a law-n-order politician.  He badmouthed the ACLU, said violent criminals should be executed, and that if he were judge, he'd give arrestees their \\\"last rights\\\" (pun intended) on the spot (at which many of the gun owners applauded, which bothered me.) He said that all the proposed gun restrictions were a step in the right direction -- for the criminals.  He said this FOUR times :-(  Two of the bills under consideration would allow police to rescind a CCW or FID, and confiscate all your guns, if someone had filed a restraining order against you.  (Note that the filing of a restraining order requires no warrant, no hearing, no evidence, and no conviction -- just an accusation.)  Senator Barrett of Reading testified in favor of it, and patronized the pro-gunners there several times by saying, \\\"I'm sure all the gun owners here will agree with me that we have to get these weapons out of the hands of people that our courts have convicted.\\\"  I haven't seen such a disgustingly disingenuous performance since Nixon whined that he wasn't a crook.  Barrett also spoke in favor of the bill making the FID card renewable every five years, instead of permanent as it is now.  The stated purpose is to remove FID cards from those who have become ineligible. \\\"Revenue has nothing to do with it.\\\"  (Yeah, right.)  Apparently, some congressmen think we're stupid enough to swallow the argument that it's preferable to process 1.6 million renewals every cycle in the vague hope of catching a recent felon than to simply take the goddamn card away from a criminal at conviction time.  As usual, hassle the law-abiding instead of the crook.  The two co-chairs of the committee were Rep. Caron and Sen. Jujuga. Jujuga didn't say much (he was a co-sponsor of both \\\"restraining order\\\" bills) but Caron struck me as a sharp guy that wouldn't let any bad logic or lies on the part of either side to go unchallenged.  (He  was a co-sponsor of one of the \\\"restraining order\\\" bills as well.)  One of the younger reps on the committee (forgot his name) was vociferously pro-gun, somewhat embarrassingly so.  His heart was in the right place, but his arguments seemed to be confined to, \\\"every year it's the same damn thing, you come in here with this crap...\\\" It's nice to have a friend on the committee, but he could have been more effective.  At about 3:00, it was clear that the hall-jam couldn't continue. Someone came out of another meeting hall and yelled at the cop because the loudspeaker was disturbing their meeting, so the loudspeaker was disconnected.  So they found a bigger hall upstairs.  One of us had to leave to catch his charter bus, and so missed the \\\"public\\\" testimony; the other got a seat this time.  Caron began by talking about how he got his FID 16 years ago, left the state, and then returned without notifying them of his address change. He complained that the state record system was not up-to-date and that his PD back in his city of birth still thought he lived there.  Great quote: \\\"If you purchase a gun today, it will not get into the state computer system until 1999.\\\"  (This was also an argument he used against the renewable FID card.)  Testimony was heard from several \\\"battered women,\\\" one of whom had been attacked by some guy in his 20's who had an FID card because he got it when he was 15 or thereabouts.  They used a lot of emotion and said how they were scared of these men.  A staffer of Attorney General Harshbarger testified in favor of this anti-gun bill, saying how 50,000 restraining orders were granted last year, and how these women needed to be protected.  Caron noted that a restraining order was granted for 10 days, and then a hearing was held to determine whether the order would be extended to a year.  He asked whether she would be satisfied if the FID were revoked at the time of this hearing rather than after the initial issuance of the FID.  She gave some long rambling circumlocution in response.  Then testimony against the bill was heard.  Mike Yacino (who looks something like Einstein) got up and made the point that restraining orders were issued on too little evidence, that judges like to issue restraining orders just to let things cool off no matter who they think is right (man or woman), and that the hearings for restraining orders are lightning sessions with little time to consider facts. Atty. Karen McNutt spoke with him a few times during his testimony.  Other pro-gunners got up to testify.  One said he had had to file a restraining order against a tenant to clear her out, and that she countered by filing one against him!  He noted that this would have allowed the state to confiscate his guns if the new bill became law. One of the junior reps noted that \\\"this is America\\\" and we have to be certain that individual rights are respected.  Senator Jujuga reiterated this, saying that \\\"people who abuse smaller people can go to Hell as far as I care, but we have to be careful about equating conviction with a restraining order.\\\"  (Point and match, Senator.)  Another pro-gunner got up and testified that he didn't know his citizenship \\\"expired every 5 years,\\\" and that a driver's license was a privilege, not a right like the right to keep and bear arms.  A third got up and said the problem was with the criminal justice system, and argued in favor of a death penalty bill and public hangings.  Senator Jujuga said he had himself tried to get a death penalty bill passed, and joking responded that he, too, favored public hangings.  The speaker then responded, \\\"I'll make you a deal.  You get me the rope, and I'll tie the noose.\\\"  Next came public testimony on the Simon's Rock bill.  A teacher testified that she had been the teacher of Wayne Lo, and that \\\"he wouldn't have been able to shoot people inside a building while he was outside\\\" without his evil gun.  She said that the \\\"loophole\\\" should be closed to prevent something like this from \\\"ever happening again\\\".  Four or five other kids testified in favor of this bill, one of spilling tears for the good legislators.  One of the students actually shot by Wayne Lo was also there.  Many of them had T shirts on, saying, \\\"As long as one person can buy a gun in anger, none of us are safe -- support gun control.\\\"  The committee was reluctant to grill or correct the kids, except for Caron, who corrected one student who had claimed that anyone could apply for an FID.  \\\"Only residents can get FID's,\\\" he said.  (How much do you want to bet that this kid had no idea he had been conned into testifying for a bill that would cut out-of-staters completely off?)  Yacino and McNutt spoke again, this time noting that the bill as written would affect both ammo AND ALL guns possessed by out-of-staters.  Karen also noted that hunters in CT, NH, and VT could be put away for a year if they wandered across the MA boundary somewhere in the woods and got challenged by game wardens.  Yacino underscored the fact that Lo COULD have gotten an FID as a resident student -- and, hell, even an CCW, as he had NO criminal or mental record.  One junior rep was upset that it would take MA residents longer to buy a gun than out-of-staters, and thought it was \\\"elitist\\\".  Another (Caron?) said that we need the protection of preventing non-residents from buying without an FID because only two other states in the union had \\\"FID-type\\\" cards, so complying with all the laws of one's home state was \\\"not enough.\\\"  One pro-gun speaker replied that this resembled a mother watching her son in a marching band and exclaiming, \\\"Everyone's out of step but Johnny!\\\"  All the Bard College people were filing out as the pro-gun testimony for this bill was made, and thus only pro-gunners were around when the other bills came under consideration.  The main bills remaining (and GOAL's position) were:  o  H.4375 and four others: Notify police chiefs so they can pull     licenses when a holder is convicted (strongly supported)  o  H.1732: Require trigger locks on all handguns sold (opposed)  o  H.962: Require trigger locks on all loaded firearms (strongly    opposed)  o  H.1350: Allow every municipality to enact their own gun laws     (opposed)  o  H.1731: Fund bullet-proof vests for municipal police (supported)  o  S.1097: State Constitutional Amendment for the RKBA (supported)  o  Several on police discretion in the issuance of FID cards (opposed)  o  Several altering non-resident license conditions (supported)  o  H.1135: Ban damn near all guns everywhere in the state (guess!)  Some of these took only 30 seconds to consider, as the remaining pro-gunners raised hands in unison either for or against them.  Mike Yacino noted that, besides the danger in screwing with a trigger lock on a loaded gun, that bill would make it illegal for a licensee to carry his concealed handgun unless it were locked.  Caron blew right through H.1350 when he saw that we opposed it. Again, he brought up the state's archaic records capability and said, \\\"This would create hundreds of different licensing systems.\\\"  The session ran late -- since it was the last scheduled hearing, it could not be adjourned until everyone who wanted to had testified.  It ended at about 6:30. -- \",\"     Okay... I argued this thoroughly about 3-4 weeks ago.  Men and women are different ... physically, physiologically, and psychologically.  Much recent evidence for this statement is present in the book \\\"Brainsex\\\" by Anne Moir and David Jessel.  I recommend you find a copy and read it. Their book is an overview of recent scientific research on this topic and is well referenced.   Now, if women and men are different in some ways, the law can only adequately take into account their needs in these areas where they are different by also taking into account the ways in which men and women are different.  Maternity leave is an example of this -- it takes into account that women get pregnant.  It does not give women the same rules it would give to men, because to treat women like it treats men in this instance would be unjust.  This is just simply an obvious example of where men and women are intrinsically different!!!!!  Now, people make the _naive_ argument that sexism = oppression. However, maternity leave is sexist because MEN DO NOT GET PREGNANT.  Men do not have the same access to leave that women do (not to the same extent or degree), and therefore IT IS SEXIST.  No matter however much a man _wants_ to get pregnant and have maternity leave, HE NEVER CAN.  And therefore the law IS SEXIST.  No man can have access to maternity leave, NO MATTER HOW HARD HE TRIES TO GET PREGNANT.  I hope this is clear.  Maternity leave is an example where a sexist law is just, because the sexism here just reflects the \\\"sexism\\\" of nature in making men and women different.  There are many other differences between men and women which are far more subtle than pregnancy, and to find out more of these I recommend you have a look at the book \\\"Brainsex\\\".  Your point that perhaps some day men can also be pregnant is fallacious. If men can one day become pregnant it will be by having biologically become women!  To have a womb and the other factors required for pregnancy is usually wrapped up in the definition of what a woman is -- so your argument, when it is examined, is seen to be fallacious.  You are saying that men can have the sexist maternity leave privilege that  women can have if they also become women -- which actually just supports my statement that maternity leave is sexist.   There is no official priesthood in Islam -- much of this function is taken by Islamic scholars.  There are female Islamic scholars and female Islamic scholars have always existed in Islam.  An example from early Islamic history is the Prophet's widow, Aisha, who was recognized in her time and is recognized in our time as an Islamic scholar.   You have no evidence for your blanket statement about all religions, and I dispute it.  I could go on and on about women in Islam, etc., but I recently reposted something here under the heading \\\"Islam and Women\\\" -- if it is still at your news-site I suggest you read it.  It is reposted from soc.religion.islam, so if it has disappeared from alt.atheism it still might be in soc.religion.islam (I forgot what its original title was though).  I will email it to you if you like.    Your statement that \\\"other religions are no different\\\" is, I think, a statement based simply on lack of knowledge about religions other than Christianity and perhaps Judaism.   Aisha, who I mentioned earlier, was not only an Islamic scholar but also was, at one stage, a military leader.   The Prophet's first wife, who died just before the \\\"Hijra\\\" (the Prophet's journey from Mecca to Medina) was a successful businesswoman.  Lucio, you cannot make a strong case for your viewpoint when your viewpoint is based on ignorance about world religions.\",\"THE WHITE HOUSE                      Office of the Press Secretary ______________________________________________________________ For Immediate Release                             April 13, 1993                                    REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT,                SECRETARY OF EDUCATION RICHARD RILEY AND                    SECRETARY OF LABOR ROBERT REICH  IN                  GOALS 2000 SATELLITE TOWN HALL MEETING                             Chamber of Commerce Building                            Washington, D.C.       8:30 P.M. EDT                     SECRETARY RILEY:  Good evening and welcome to all of you  in the thousands of communities around the country that are taking  part in this satellite town meeting for the month of April.              You know, today is April 13th.  In 1743, Thomas  Jefferson was born, 250 years ago.  I think that's appropriate to  mention at the beginning of this meeting because since that time he  has been, of course, a person who has been one that we've all  followed in terms of our democracy and the importance of education  here in this great country.  The success of our democracy according  to Jefferson really depends upon the success of our educational  system.              His philosophy of government, his belief in the  importance of education is also very meaningful to our special guest  here this evening.  Tonight we're so pleased to have with us  President Clinton.  He's come over from the White House to join us in  the Chamber of Commerce studios.                Mr. President, it's good to have you.  We thank you for  taking the time to visit with these communities here on the satellite  network and we welcome you here this evening.              Also we have with us Secretary of Labor Robert Reich.   And, Bob, it's certainly pleasant to have you with us this evening  also.              I have some questions for our two guests, and I'm sure  many of you do, too.  So please call us if there's something that  you'd like to ask.  The number is 1/800/368-5781 or 5782.  In  Washington, D.C. the number is 202/463-3170 or 3171.              I believe the President has a few words that he might  want to share with us.  And, Mr. President, I'll ask you to do that  at this time.  It's great to have you.              THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.              I'm glad to be here with my friends, Dick Riley and Bob  Reich -- also members of my Cabinet -- at the headquarters of the  Chamber of Commerce to support the effort that the Chamber is making,  along with its Center for Work Force Preparation, to help to examine  tonight the whole critical question of how to move our young people  from school to the work place.              I want to compliment the Chamber on all their efforts,  recognizing that without an educated work force we can't grow this  economy or remain competitive, and recognizing that we all have to  work together -- business and government, labor and educators -- to  make things happen.              This satellite town meeting is a good example of that  kind of working together.  And if you'll forgive me a little home  state pride, I want to say a special word of thanks to the Wal-Mart  Corporation, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas, for providing  several hundred of the sites for this town meeting tonight.  I  appreciate that a lot, as well as the sites that are provided for all  the rest of you.              I have tried as hard as I could to move toward  constructive change for this country.  Secretary Riley talked about  this being Thomas Jefferson's 250th birthday.  If Thomas Jefferson  believed in anything, he believed in these three things:  first, in  education; second, in real personal liberty, freedom of religion,  freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of the press; and  third, in the absolute imperative of changing as times change.                If you go to the Jefferson Memorial here in this  beautiful city, which is now bedecked with all of its wonderful  cherry blossoms, you will see Jefferson saying that we have to change  with changing times.              For us here in America, that means reducing our deficit  and increasing our investment and putting our people first so that we  can compete in the world.  We're here to talk about that tonight -- about what we can do to educate and train our people better.  Unless  we do that, none of the efforts that all the rest of us make in  government, even to bring the budget into balance, even to increase  our investment in other things which will grow jobs, will last in the  long run.              We also have to have people who can carry their load.   And in a world where the average young person will change jobs seven  or eight times in a lifetime, that begins with the education system  and continues into the work force where education must go on for a  lifetime.  It's not just important what you know, but what you can  learn.              And if I might, I'd like to close just by emphasizing  we're doing our best to try to have the most innovative partnership  between the Labor Department and the Education Department and the  private sector to build a good school-to-work transition.  And we're  trying to get off to a good start this summer with a program that  would create more than 700,000 new summer jobs, including many  thousands that have a strong education component so our young people  can be learning and working at the same time.              Dick, I think I ought to stop there.  That's a good  place we can begin, I think, the discussion.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you so much, Mr. President.              Each month we get together and talk about ways that all  citizens can work towards reaching the national education goals.  And  tonight, we'll focus on goal five, and how communities such as yours  can prepare students for this world of work.              This week, the Education Department and the Labor  Department are hosting a conference here in Washington, D.C. called  Summer Challenge, a program of work and learning, to America's youth.   The aim is to use some special funds from President Clinton's  proposed economic stimulus package to provide educationally-enriched  jobs and summer school programs for young people in disadvantaged  areas of the country.                Mr. President, let's talk a minute -- you alluded to it  somewhat -- about the  Summer Youth Challenge.  Your program calls  for more educational enrichment in the summer jobs.  And why in your  words is that so important?              THE PRESIDENT:  I think it's important for two reasons.   First of all, a lot of the young people we're trying to reach may  have had trouble adjusting to school and learning.  And while we want  them to have a good experience with a real job, we also want them to  continue to learn during the summer because we know from a lot of  research that a lot of kids that have trouble learning in school may  forget as much as 30 percent of what they learned the previous year  over the summertime.  And that is a very unproductive thing for  schools to have to take up a lot of time teaching what they already  taught before.              Secondly, we want to help these young people progress,  not only in terms of work, but in terms of learning.  We want to  abolish the artificial dividing line between what is work and what is  learning because we think that the best and most productive workers  will have to be lifetime learners.  And we think that this experience  could maybe drive that point home and prepare these young people to  succeed in school, or at work, or in college as they go on.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I think the fact that these are  disadvantaged kids -- that gap, that lag you mentioned as they go  into the next year, is really even greater.                Secretary Reich, of course, you have training programs  throughout the year.  And I wonder is you have any comment about this  educational component of training.              SECRETARY REICH:  Well, what we've learned, Mr.  Secretary, is that for many young people, whether it's for the summer  or for the year, actually on-the-job work experience combined with  education is one of the best ways of learning.  Many young people,  for example, have a lot -- they have a difficult time learning  geometry.  But when they actually are there building something or  working on something, and they can see the exact and direct  application of geometry, they understand what it's used for.  And a  lot of young people -- just that sense of connection between  education and the world of work is terribly, terribly important.   It's important during the summer, but it's important for a lot of  young people even beyond the summer.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you.                Mr. President, you've called for a youth apprenticeship  program, school-to-work transition.  And I wonder if you would tell  us a little bit about your concept of that and how you see it  developing.              THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, let's talk about why  it's important.  Most new jobs that will be created in this decade  will not require a four-year college degree, but most of them will  require some learning and skills that go well beyond what most people  get in a high school diploma.                If you look at the last 10 years, the average salaries  of young people that had at least two years of good post-high school  education was a good salary that went up over the decade.  The young  people who had less than that tended to have lower wages that did not  go up, and in many cases in real terms fell over the decade, because  they weren't productive, they weren't more valuable to their  employers.              So we think America has a big economic interest in  trying to ensure that all the young people who get out of high school  but don't go on to college make a transition to work, which includes  two years of further training either in a community college, a  vocational setting, or perhaps on the job.  And what I have done in  this budget, as you know, is to give you and Secretary Reich some  funds and some incentives to try to work in partnership with states  and with the private sector to build these programs state-by-state in  a way that would be customized essentially by the business community,  based on the needs of the economy in any given area.  It could  revolutionize long-term the quality of the American work force and  the earnings of American workers.              SECRETARY REICH:  I should add, Mr. President -- I think  you know this from your experience in Arkansas -- and many of the  people watching this program -- that the business community and  educators, labor groups are already in many of our communities, many  of our states, building a school-to-work transition program.  In  fact, there's an awful lot of ferment, a lot of excitement.  The  people watching this program probably are the ones who are most  directly involved in that.  And more power to them.  Secretary Riley  and I are going to do everything we can to build on the successes  already out there.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Bob, we're going to be talking tonight  about youth apprenticeship and tech prep, the co-op learning   career academies.  And what features all those programs that deal  with this subject -- what are some of the features that every one of  these school-to-work programs might have that   are important?              SECRETARY REICH:  Well, one thing that we've seen -- and  you and I have been working at this for a long time, and you much  longer than I -- we've seen that active involvement of the business  community is absolutely essential.  And I'm so delighted that we're  doing this in the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce.  The  Chamber of Commerce of the United States is committed to doing these  kinds of programs -- training, education, retraining -- and we've  aimed to work very closely with the Chamber.              The business community is going to be actively engaged  in developing almost an audit of the kind of jobs that are needed and  helping the educators, community colleges, technical institutions  develop curricula that are relevant for the jobs of the future.              Communities have got to come together.  I mean, this is  one of the most important things.  You've got to have all of these  players in a community come together and work together and cooperate  together.  You know, too often we have the educators over here and  the business leaders over here, labor groups over here and everybody  is talking, but they're not really working together in a common  strategy.              And the third and final ingredient I would say, Dick,  would be a commitment to excellence -- a commitment both to academic  excellence and also to skills development excellence.  This is not a  tracking program we're talking about for kids who are not going to  make it.  This is a program that every young person ought to be  eligible for.  If they want to go on beyond that to four-year  college, that's fine.  That ought to be permissible.  But we're  talking about the foundation of learning about jobs, the foundation  skills for on-the-job learning.              And again, those are the critical components.  It's  already being done.              THE PRESIDENT:  I think -- if I might just interject one  point based on my personal experience at home -- the business  community has a critical role to play, not simply in saying here are  the job skills that are needed and here's what ought to be taught,  but also in monitoring that excellence.  If you have the right sort  of partnership there, the people who are paying the taxes and who are  going to then be hiring the workers are not going to permit the  second-rate programs to survive if they have any way to shape and  influence them.  So I think that's very important.              And when we try to, if you will, fill in the blanks at  the federal level, trying to set some standards and provide some  funds, one of the things that we want to be sure and do is to make  sure that the employer has a heavy amount of influence over the  quality of these programs, because that's really what's going to  determine whether the whole thing is worthwhile.              SECRETARY RILEY:  That's great.  We've been talking, of  course, about school-to-work and also the jobs and economic recovery  program for this summer and fall.  But let's talk just a moment about  long-term school reform.  It's something especially close to me.  Mr.  President, I wonder if you would give us some of your ideas for the  communities out here on Goals 2000 legislation that I think will be  coming forth before too long.              THE PRESIDENT:  Well, as you know, back when you and I  were both governors, we spent a lot of time working on our public  schools and we tried to be very candid with our people in saying that  a lot of these things were going to take some time to materialize.                I had a hand in writing the National Education Goals  that the governors drafted, along with representatives of President  Bush's administration back in 1989.  And what we're going to try to  do this year with your leadership is to introduce legislation in  Congress that will actually define the things that the national  government ought to do to try to help the local schools and the  children of this country and the adult learners, too, meet those  goals -- making sure that when -- by 2000, people show up for school  ready to learn; that we get a 90 percent on-time high school  graduation rate; that children at the 4th, 8th, and 12th grades are  confident in the subjects they're supposed to know; that they are  second to none in math and science; that are schools are safe,  disciplined, and drug-free.  And, of course, the fifth goal --I took  them out of line to say this the last -- is that we have a system of  life-long learning in this country.              And each one of those goals there's a national role, a  state role, a school role, school district role, and a private sector  role.  And what you've attempted to do in this bill you're going to  introduce with me in the next few weeks is to define what our job is;  and then to give the rest of America a way of defining what their job  is and seeing whether we're actually meeting the standards of quality  that we need to meet.              It's very exciting.  So far as I know, nothing quite  like it has ever been done in the form of federal legislation before.   Not mandating and telling people what they have to do with their  money, but actually setting up a framework for excellence and  partnerships so that we can do our job.  I'm really excited about it.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I am, too.  And I think really  it will be an entirely new role for the federal government in terms  of its relationship with states, serving as a partner really to  support and facilitate and to help out in these education reform  efforts, all driven by high standards.  That's the point.              Bob, let me ask you one question, and then we'll get to  the telephone calls.  It's about the same subject.  We have, of  course, skills standards that are going to be part of Goals 2000, and  I wonder if you would comment on that.              SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you know, we have 75 percent of  our young people who don't graduate from college.  Very often they  don't have very many alternatives.  They do have a wonderful system  of community colleges and technical institutions, but if we had  national skill standards to which they could aspire and which  employers would understand as a national credential, many of these  young people would actually find that they were much more eligible  for jobs.              Everybody doesn't have to go to college.  Other  countries you have smaller proportions of their population going to  college, but you have a whole level of people who have certain  technical, preprofessional skills.  We can do it in this country.  If  you don't go to four-year college you're not a loser.  And we want to  develop those national skill standards.  We're going to be working  with the states, with the Education Department, with a lot of private  industry in developing those standards.  And I think they will be the  kinds of things that enable our vocational and technical and other  institutions to rally around, as well as our business community.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, that's great.  Why don't we go  ahead and go to the telephone.  We have a call, I see -- Mayor Bruce  Todd of Austin, Texas.              Q   Yes, Mr. President and Mr. Secretary Reich and  Riley, we certainly appreciate the opportunity to join you today.  We  have some dedicated professionals and volunteers here in Austin who  have heard what you have said and are very appreciative.  Let me  simply say, amen to some of the comments made already.  We agree with  much of the tone that the Clinton administration has taken, and are  very supportive.                We have been successful here in Austin of tripling our  summer employment program over the last four years.  We expect to  have over 2,000 employed this year in the summertime; perhaps as much  as 3,500 with the federal assistance.                Much of the question that we had designed you have  answered in your opening comments, so we must be thinking alike.  But  the question essentially involved what initiatives after Labor Day  would be appropriate.  We know summertime is important.  Year-round  is even more important.  And what kind of initiatives at the federal  level might be proposed to meet the needs of the youth on a year- round basis?  And perhaps more importantly, how can families and the  local community be more involved using the federal initiative? That's  something that we believe is very important to success in this  effort.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Mr. President.              THE PRESIDENT:  I think I'll give everybody a chance to  answer the question, Bruce, but let me first thank you for calling,  and thank you for all the great work that you're doing in Austin.   I've seen some of it and I've always been very impressed.                First, with regard to the summer program, we hope we can  structure it in a way that will enable us to continue the summer  program and that will move a lot of these young people back into  schools under circumstances that might allow them to do some work in  the private sector, too.  We hope that -- Secretary Reich is going to  try to set up a system where we create a lot of private sector jobs  to be matched with the public sector jobs this summer.  And we're  working on that.              Secondly, in the program that I have presented to the  Congress over the next five years, what we are attempting to do is to  build in an amount of investment that's quite substantial for job  training programs, for school-to-work programs, all of which give  heavy, heavy weight to local community input -- just the question you  asked -- but do provide some federal investment dollars, which we  hope you can put with local dollars to keep people working and being  trained on a year-round basis.              And I will say again, to echo what Secretary Reich said  a moment ago, to try to break down the barrier between what is seen  as work and what is seen as learning.  An awful lot of young people  actually have quite high IQs, but actually learn so much better when  they're doing than when they're reading or just listening.  So we  hope that the community involvement part of it will be permanent, and  we hope that if the whole budget passes -- and we do have 200 budget  cuts and more than 200, actually, in the budget -- and some revenue  raisers, and some new money for education and training, that we'll be  able to do just what you seem to want based on your question.              Bob, do you want to say anything?              SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you took most of the words out  of my mouth, Mr. President, as usual.  But let me just add one thing,  and that is that one of the most important aspects of post-high  school for a lot of young people who are not going on to college, in  addition to the school-to-work program, simply is the availability of  jobs.  And we've got to get this economy moving again, obviously.   It's terribly important to get this recovery program, to get the  economy back on track.  That's sort of the prerequisite to everything  else.  If we don't get the economy back on track -- we have -- I  think this is the 16th -- correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. President -- I  think is the 16th month we have had seven percent unemployment or  greater.  This is a jobless recovery.  A lot of those kids are going  to be getting out of school in June.  And even if we did everything  right, they would have a very, very hard time getting jobs.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you both.  Of course, Goals 2000  will be a permanent, long-term thing that will certainly reach into  next year.  It will involve, if passed -- and we certainly hope it  will be -- action plans with every state where we can be working  together to reach for the goals in a number of different ways.  And  then the state, with all the various school districts, a very  important part of that will be citizen and parent involvement.  And I  think everybody will see a great energy out there, once we get that  moving.              The next call is Dr. Harry Heinemann, New York.                Doctor?              Q   Good evening, Mr. Secretary.  It is a pleasure to  be on with you this evening.  As you may know, bridging the school  and work has been central to La Guardia's educational program since  its inception in the 1970s, and that includes the college, the two  alternative high schools that operate on our campus, and the linkages  we have forged with the local schools.  We have found this to be an  extremely effective learning strategy.              And over the years, we've come to believe that there are  several principles that are very important in bridging the school and  work.  And these include integrating theory in the classroom with  practice in the workplace, with providing all students early exposure  to careers, as well as providing opportunities for them to reflect  upon these experiences while they strengthen their skills; and  lastly, the critical role of the liberal arts, particularly in the  development of high performance competencies.                My question, then is:  How can the general education  faculty and the academic curriculum be more closely integrated with  transition to work experience?  And what mechanisms and strategies  can you suggest to achieve this integration?              SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, thank you very much.  I think --  and we'll get a response from you all on that, and very interesting  work going on there.  We're going to have three people, our next  guests on the program this evening, that will be some specialists    in that area that you're speaking, and I'll certainly pass that on to  them and we can discuss it later.              You all care to comment -- any comments you might have?              THE PRESIDENT:  I'd just like to say, if I might, one  thing.  I want to reemphasize this and I don't think I'm being as  clear about it as I'd like, although I think at least one of the  people who will be on the second panel will be able to say it more  explicitly than I.  I think this whole concept of applied academics  is very important.  And I think that we have to basically abolish  what I consider to be a very artificial distinction between what is  vocational learning and what is academic learning.              I think we should keep the liberal arts going.  I think  we should have a strong component for people who are in the  vocational program.              SECRETARY REICH:  It seems to me that we also need to  rethink our entire tracking system, because a lot of these school and  work combinations are important for mainstream students.  They're  important for all students.  It's not just a special group of  students that needs them.              Some of the experiments that I've seen around the United  States -- Dick, I'm sure you've seen them as well -- are mainstream  experiments.  They're mainstreaming all the students.  At 11th and  12th grades they're giving them a combined work and school experience  and then a transition program.  And again, the kids can either go on  to college if they want; they can go on to technical community; they  can go on to an entirely -- a large variety of possibilities and  career directions.              But we have to get away from the stigmatizing that often  goes on with young people who simply are doing job-related or work- related work within the classroom, within our schools.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you, very much.  I think that's  going to be the last call that we have time for.  Mr. President, I  think you've got to move on to another matter, and I want to thank  you and Secretary Reich for being here.  We appreciate your time and  your ideas, and it's been a tremendous help to us.  \",\"Hi there,  I am looking for a wide band analog time delay (not phase delay) variable from 200 microseconds to 2 milliseconds.\",\"The r.s.h FAQ sheet never fails to crash my newsreader.

I bought my machine a couple of weeks ago as well and started to experience these problems.  Apple Australia via my dealer said that this problem has a number of potential causes - Faulty applications, faulty third party hardware (modems, memory etc), system software, PRAM corruption and power manager corruption, and the Duo hardware itself.  None of the above are relevant in my case except the last two maybe (no applications were running, the system software was re-installed, I have no additional hardware). I have found that clearing PRAM appears to help for a while at least (hold down command option P and R on startup). Unfortunately the problem returns suggesting that PRAM is being corrupted by something (system software bug ? - I don't have any non-issue inits in my system). Apparently the Power Manager can be reset by \\\"holding the reset and interrupt buttons while powering up\\\" - Apple's advice - but since the Duo does not have an interrupt button I'm not sure what they mean in this case. This may also help if someone can decipher Apple's advice for me.  Beyond this Apple suggest that \\\" you should follow the technical procedures to check the hardware of this Duo\\\". Since so many others appear to be having the same problem it would seem to me that there has been a system software bug introduced somewhere along the line - and quite recently too - since it only seems to be recent Duo 230 purchasers who have this problem.

Save your almost maniacal devotion to the almighty      plus/minus ... it is the most misleading hockey stat available.       Until the NHL publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice      time per game and some measure of its \\\"quality\\\" (i.e., is the player put out      in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game; is he matched up      against the other team's top one or two lines; short-handed, etc), I would      much rather see the +/- disappear altogether instead of having its dubious      merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications.  Thank you for posting this.  As the person who first brought up the fact that Jagr has a much higher +/- than Francis, I can assure you that I brought it up as an example of the absurdity of +/- comparisons, even on the same team.  I never, ever thought that anyone would argue that Jagr's higher +/- actually reflected better two-way play.  In my opinion, Francis's low +/- is purely a result of him being asked to play against opponents top scorers at all times; the fact that he can chip in 100 points while neutralizing the other team's top center is a testament to how valuable he is, even if his +/- suffers.  On the other hand, Jagr, for how big, fast and skilled he is, can't even get 90 points, no matter how inflated his +/- is.  (By the way, don't get me wrong -- I like Jagr.  He may be a lazy floater, but he turns it on at exactly the right times -- like overtime of playoff games). \",\"for SRC  In most languages, the Feast of the Resurrection of Our Lord is known as the PASCH, or PASQUE, or some variation thereof, a word which comes from the Hebrew PESACH, meaning \\\"Passover.\\\" In English, German, and a few related languages, however, it is known as EASTER, or some variation thereof, and questions have been asked about the origin of this term.  One explanation is that given by the Venerable Bede in his DE RATIONE TEMPORUM 1:5, where he derives the word from the name of an Anglo-Saxon goddess of Spring called EASTRE. Bede is a great scholar, and it is natural to take his word for it. But he lived 673-735, and Augustine began preaching in Kent in 597. The use of the word EASTER to describe the Feast would have been well established before the birth of Bede and probably before the birth of anyone he might have discussed the subject with. It seems likely that his derivation is just a guess, based on his awareness that there had been an Anglo-Saxon goddess of Spring bearing that name, and the resemblance of the words. Thus, if the said resemblance (surely it is not surprising that a personification of Spring should have a name similar to the word for Dawn) is not in istelf convincing, the testimony (or rather the conjecture) by Bede does not make it more so.  Assuming that Bede was right, that would not justify saying that the Christian celebration (which, after all, had been going on for some centuries before the name EASTER was applied to it) has pagan roots. It would simply mean that the Anglo-Saxons, upon becoming Christians and beginning to celebrate the Resurrection by a festival every spring, called it by the name that to them meant simply \\\"Spring Festival.\\\"  However, Bede's is not the only theory that has been proposed.  J Knoblech, in \\\"Die Sprach,\\\" ZEITSCHRIFT FUER SPRACHWISSENSCHAFT 5 (Vienna, 1959) 27-45, offers the following derivation:  Among Latin-speaking Christians, the week beginning with the Feast of the Resurrection was known as \\\"hebdomada alba\\\" (white week), since the newly-baptized Christians were accustomed to wear their white baptismal robes throughout that week. Sometimes the week was referred to simply as \\\"albae.\\\" Translaters rendering this into German mistook it for the plural of \\\"alba,\\\" meaning \\\"dawn.\\\" They accordingly rendered it as EOSTARUM, which is Old High German for \\\"dawn.\\\" This gave rise to the form EASTER in English.

I read once that the Babe made $80,000 one year and that was about as good  as it got for him.  Let's assume he made that in 1928 (I'm not sure of the figures, but I know I'm in the ballpark--pun intended). :-)  Today, assuming a 4% yearly inflation rate, which is an understatement if not accurate, his measly $80,000 salary would be worth.  FV = $80,000 x (1+4%)^(1993-1928)    = $80,000 x (1.04)^65    = just over $1,000,000.  Assuming inflation is average of around 5%.  FV = $80,000 x (1+5%)^65    = almost 2,000,000.  (I didn't crunch these numbers beforehand).  These numbers might lead one to believe that today's players are slightly  overpaid.  The Babe appears to have made then what today's average to above average players make now.  Perfectly accurate salary, year of salary, and  average inflation rate would make this analysis more accurate, but I don`t  think I'm off by much.

Going into the 1992/93 season, the numbers of Euros on NHL teams have escalated to the following stats:  Canadians: 400 Americans: 100 Europeans: 100     Please note that these numbers are rounded off, and taken from the top 25 players on each of the 24 teams. My source is the Vancouver Sun.     Here's the point: there are far too many Europeans in the NHL. I am sick of watching a game between an American and a Canadian team (let's say, the Red Wings and the Canucks) and seeing names like \\\"Bure\\\" \\\"Konstantinov\\\" and \\\"Borshevshky\\\". Is this North America or isn't it? Toronto, Detriot, Quebec, and Edmonton are particularly annoying, but the numbers of Euros on other teams is getting worse as well.       I live in Vancouver and if I hear one more word about \\\"Pavel Bure, the Russian Rocket\\\" I will completely throw up. As it is now, every time I see the Canucks play I keep hoping someone will cross-check Bure into the plexiglassso hard they have to carry him out on a stretcher. (By the way, I'm not a Canucks fan to begin with ;-).       Okay, the stretcher remark was a little carried away. But the point is that I resent NHL owners drafting all these Europeans INSTEAD of Canadians (and some Americans). It denies young Canadians the opportunity to play in THEIR NORTH AMERICAN LEAGUE and instead gives it to Europeans, who aren't even better hockey players. It's all hype. This \\\"European mystique\\\" is sickening, but until NHL owners get over it, Canadian and American players will continue to have to fight harder to get drafted into their own league.      With the numbers of Euros in the NHL escalating, the problem is clearly only getting worse.      I'm all for the creation of a European Hockey League, and let the Bures and Selannes of the world play on their own continent.      I just don't want them on mine.       --  Richard J.

A few points need to be clarified:  The Equipment GROUNDING conductor, Green, green with a yellow stripe, bare, or the metal sheath or pipe of SOME wiring methods, is used as a safety ground, to carry fault currents back to the circuit breaker panel, and to limit the voltage on the metal case of utilization equipment or other metal objects.  It should never (except for a few exceptions to be discussed later) carry the normal operating current of a connected load.  Some equipment has filters in the power supply which may cause some slight current flow through the grounding conductor.    Much communications or audio equipment is sensitive to noise or slight voltages on the grounding conductor, and may require special wiring of the grounding conductors to provide reliable operation  (\\\"orange\\\" outlets are often used for this, with insulated grounding conductors wired back to the panel box, and in many cases back to the service.  Anyone installing such a system should read both the section on grounding in the National Electric Code and publications on installing quiet isolated ground systems.  The code requires the insulated grounding conductors (green wires) to run with the current carrying conductors back to the panel box, and, if required, back all the way to the service entrance , where it is bonded to the service ground (water pipe or rod)  Many of these systems are installed illegally or unsafely, where they do not provide a safe ground or a quiet ground or either.   The GROUNDED conductor of a circuit, often called the NEUTRAL, which is referred to in the code as the \\\"identified\\\" conductor and is supposed to be white or natural grey.  This conductor is supposed to be connected to ground in most electrical systems at a single point, generally at the service entrance panel.  This connection is through the Main Bonding Jumper.  (In many household service panels, the main bonding jumper is actually a bonding screw which attaches the neutral busbar to the case of the panel)    The Grounded conductor (neutral) is generally a current carrying conductor.  In the case of a 120 volt circuit it is one of the two conductors completing the circuit from the panel to the load device.    Since the grounded conductor (neutral) is only connected to the grounding conductor (bare or green) at the service entrance, if the load is any distance from the service and draws any significant current, there will be a small but measurable voltage between the grounded and grounding conductors at the load, under normal operating conditions.  If you should (incorrectly) connect the grounded (neutral) conductor to the grounding conductor at the load, some of the neutral current will flow instead through the grounding conductor.  Since there will now be current flowing through the grounding conductor, it will also no longer be quite at ground potential at the load end.  If the load equipment has a metal case, which is connected to the grounding conductor through the \\\"U\\\" ground plug, the metal case is now also no longer quite at ground potential.  The difference (under normal, non short-circuit conditions) may be only a few tenths of a volt, but it could also be a volt or two.  This normally does not present a shock hazard.    HOWEVER, if you let the metal case of the grounded equipment come into contact with an independently grounded object such as a water or gas pipe, a radiator, a metal air conditioning duct or such, part of the neutral current will try to flow through this aalternate ground path.  If the contact is not solid, you will get a significant arc (a low voltage, but possibly moderate current arc) Under the wrong conditions, this arcing could start a fire.  It is possible in some cases that the sneak ground current   could also flow through a wire of inadequate size, causing it to overheat.  With the incorrect non single-point grounding of the neutral, if there is a short circuit from hot to neutral, the high short circuit current which may flow will cause a much higher voltage on the grounding conductor, which increases the possibility for shock or fire.    Also if you incorrectly multiply connect the neutral and ground, the voltage on the ground system is seen as noise bu computer or audio equipment, often causing malfunction.  I have spent some hours tracking down such shorts in technical facilities where they were inducing severe hum into equipment.  The Neutral is usually bonded to the ground at the distribution transformer as well as at the service entrance of each dwelling.  This is done primarily for lightning protection, so that induced lightning currents have a short path back to ground, and also to assure that the currents drawn by shorts to grounded objects like pipes draw enough current to trip circuit breakers or blow fuses quickly.  The bad side of this is that not all the neutral current from the dwelling goes through the neutral wire back to the transformer.  Some of it flows through the grounding electrode (water pipe, etc.) this may cause corrosion in the pipes and possibly in things like underground fuel oil tanks, and it may also cause measurable AC magnetic fields due to the large loop between the \\\"hot\\\" conductors in the service and the neutral current in the water pipe and ground.  There are those who feel these fields may be unhealthy.  (don't flame ME on this, I'm just telling you where the field comes from, not it's health effect, as far as I'm concerned, the jury is still out on this.)  Note that the bonding jumper is only installed at the main panel, NOT at any sub distribution panels.  This is one reason why it is illegal to run service entrance cable with the sheath used as a neutral to a sub panel, you must have a seperate insulated conductor for the neutral.  The sheath can be used in this application only as the groundING conductor.  If the neutral is bonded to the grounding conductor in the sub panel, say by forgetting to remove the bonding screw, all the grounding conductors of the loads on that panel will be above ground, with the possible problems listed above.  The code makes exceptions for ranges and dryers, as well as feeds from one building to another.  In the cases of the range and dryer, the neutral may be used as the equipment ground under certain conditions, instead of a seperate wire.  Every time the code is revised, these exceptions come up for review.  These exceptions were, in fact the first required safety grounds, in the days before U ground outlets and such.  The appliance manufacturers don't want to have to redesign their ranges and driers, and the contractors don't want to have to run four wire cable (with four fairly heavy, expensive wires) in place of three wire to the appliances.  No question it would be safer with seperate neutrals to the stove, but the neutral current is low for most burner settings (since most current is in the 220 volt \\\"hots\\\" except at some low settings, the wires are large gauge, and there are few reported cases of injury or damage.  So far, the exceptions have survived. In the case of feeds between buildings, it's primarily for lightning protection.  People doing wiring should be aware what is and what isn't a legal grounding conductor.  Obviously, the bare wire in \\\"romex\\\" 'with ground' is.  Anywhere there is a green wire installed, such as in a portable cord, that is a good grounding conductor.  The sheath of BX clamped in BX connectors in metal boxes is a legal grounding conductor (in the US). (BX has an aluminum band run under the steel sheath to lower the resistance of the sheath.  You can just cut this aluminum band off at the ends, you don't have to bond it to anything, it does its job by touching every turn of the BX sheath.) Conduit or EMT (thinwall tubing) is generally a legal grounding conductor, but may require a bonding locknut where it enters a box or panel, particularly for larger pipes.    \\\"Greenfield\\\" (looks like big BX, but you pull your own wires in the empty sheath after you run it) is NOT a legal grounding conductor, as it doesn't have the aluminum band to bond it, and the spiral steel has too much resistance and inductance.  You have to run a seperate green grounding conductor inside the greenfield.  \\\"Wiremold\\\" is also not a legal grounding conductor, as the paint on the boxes often prevents good contact, and the \\\"feed\\\" to the wiremold extension is often from a box in the wall that may not be well connected to the first wiremold box.  I have personally discovered cases where the entire run of wiremold and the cases of everything plugged into all the outlets on the run were \\\"hot\\\" with 120 volts (Why do I get a shock every time I touch my computer and the radiator here in the office?) because there was no ground wire in the wiremold and one of the outlets had shorted to the edge of the wiremold box.  You must run a ground wire back in the wiremold from the outlets at least to the first box in the original wiring (conduit, BX, etc.) where you can \\\"bond\\\" the wire to the box with a screw, bnding clip, or whatever.  On another issue, while you should ground the green wire/lug on GCFI outlets when ever there is a place to ground them, it is legal in the NEC to use them without a ground if no ground is available.  It is better to have the protection of the Ground fault interrupter than no protection if you don't install it.  The interrupter doesn't depend on the ground to trip.  It is desirable to connect the ground if available, because if the ground is connected, the interrupter will trip as soon as a faulty device is plugged in, whereas without the ground, it will not trip until someone or something provides a ground path.  For those questioning the legal use of ungrounded GCFI's, read in the NEC, 210-7 (d) exception. (This is the 1990 code, my '93 code is in the city, but I know the rule hasn't changed.  It might be renumbered though.)   We have only touched the surface concerning grounding ;-} , there is much more to this subject, but most of you have fallen asleep by now.

The author is not responsible for any          damage caused by this program.   Important changes since version 1.30:     Fix bugs in file management system (file displaying).     Improve file management system (more user-friendly).     Fix bug in XPM version 3 reading.     Fix bugs in TARGA reading/writng.     Fix bug in GEM/IMG reading.     Add support for PCX and GEM/IMG writing.     Auto-skip macbinary header.   (1) Introduction:   This program can let you READ, WRITE and DISPLAY images with different   formats. It also let you do some special effects(ROTATION, DITHERING ....)   on image. Its main purpose is to let you convert image among different   formts.   Include simple file management system.   Support 'slide show'.   There is NO LIMIT on image size.   Currently this program supports 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display.   If you want to use HiColor or TrueColor, you must have VESA driver.   If you want to modify video driver, please read section (8).   (2) Hardware Requirement:   PC 386 or better. MSDOS 3.3 or higher.   min amount of ram is 4M bytes(Maybe less memory will also work).   (I recommend min 8M bytes for better performance).   Hard disk for swapping(virtual memory).    The following description is borrowed from DJGPP.    Supported Wares:    * Up to 128M of extended memory (expanded under VCPI)   * Up to 128M of disk space used for swapping   * SuperVGA 256-color mode up to 1024x768   * 80387   * XMS & VDISK memory allocation strategies   * VCPI programs, such as QEMM, DESQview, and 386MAX    Unsupported:    * DPMI   * Microsoft Windows    Features: 80387 emulator, 32-bit unix-ish environment, flat memory   model, SVGA graphics.

(7) Detail:     Initialization:       Set default display type to highest display type.       Find allowable screen resolution(for .grn video driver only).     1. When you run this program, you will enter 'read' menu. Whthin this       menu you can press any function key except F5. If you move or copy       files, you will enter 'write' menu. the 'write' menu is much like       'read' menu, but only allow you to change directory. +       The header line in 'read' menu includes \\\"(d:xx,f:xx,t:xx)\\\". +         d : display type. f: number of files. t: number of tagged files.       pressing SPACE in 'read' menu will let you select which format to use         for reading current file.       pressing RETURN in 'read' menu will let you reading current file. This         program will automatically determine which format this file is.         The procedure is: First, check magic number. If fail, check         standard extension. Still fail, report error.       pressing s or S in 'read' menu will do 'Slide Show'.         If delay time is 0, program will wait until you hit a key           (except ESCAPE).         If any error occurs, program will make a beep.         ESCAPE to terminate.       pressing Ins in 'read' menu will change display type.       pressing ALT-X in 'read' menu will quit program without prompting.     2. Once image file is successfully read, you will enter 'screen' menu.       Within this menu F5 is turn on. You can do special effect on image.       pressing RETURN: show image.         in graphic mode, press RETURN, SPACE or ESCAPE to return to text         mode.       pressing TAB: change processing target. This program allows you to do         special effects on 8-bit or 24-bit image.       pressing Left,Right arrow: change display type. 8, 15, 16, 24 bits.       pressing SPACE: save current image to file.         B/W Dither: save as black/white image(1 bit).         Grey Scale: save as grey image(8 bits).         Full Color: save as color image(8 bits).         True Color: save as 24-bit image.          This program will ask you some questions if you want to write image         to file. Some questions are format-dependent. Finally This program         will prompt you a filename. If you want to save file under another         directory other than current directory, please press SPACE. after         pressing SPACE, you will enter 'write2' menu. You can change         directory to what you want. Then,          pressing SPACE: this program will prompt you 'original' filename.         pressing RETURN: this program will prompt you 'selected' filename                       (filename under bar).     3. This program supports 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display.    4. This Program is MEMORY GREEDY. If you don't have enough memory,      the performance is poor.    5. If you want to save 8 bits image :        try GIF then TIFF(LZW) then TARGA then Sun Raster then BMP then ...       If you want to save 24 bits image (lossless):        try TIFF(LZW) or TARGA or ILBM or Sun Raster        (No one is better for true 24bits image)    6. I recommend Jpeg for storing 24 bits images, even 8 bits images.    7. Not all subroutines are fully tested    8. This document is not well written. If you have any PROBLEM, SUGGESTION,      COMMENT about this program,      Please send to u7711501@bicmos.ee.nctu.edu.tw (140.113.11.13).      I need your suggestion to improve this program.

Yes, it is true that he refused to buy a franchise from the NHL for $50M; but at the time the reason was that the established market for teams was much  less than that. He felt that no one would pay $50M for an expansion team, and that he would simply wait to buy an existing franchise for less than that. But the market fooled him, and 5 teams have been created for $50M apiece in the last three years, and even the existing teams can't be moved for less than  $50M and I doubt that he could get one for that little.

Windows will use a swap file larger than the recommended size.  Last summer I went to a Microsoft Windows 3.1 Technical Workshop and they distributed A LOT of information that the general public might not be aware of.  Anyway in the main book they handed out they have a section on \\\"Creating larger than recommended swapfile\\\".  I'll quote the information    If you create a permanent swapfile larger than the recommended size, you   will receive a message telling you that Windows will not use anything   larger than the recommended size.  THIS ERROR MESSAGE IS INCORRECT, we   will allow the use of the larger swapfile, up to four times the amount   of RAM on your machine.  So as you see, Microsoft does know that the information is incorrect.  You probably just ran into some doofball who was new on the job and was only telling you what little he knew.  Be that what it may, I would really suggest to everyone to take the opportunity to go to these Technical Workshops.  They aren't actually incredibly in-depth, but you do get a lot of material about bugs and optimization straight from those in the know.  Besides that they offer you HUGE discounts on software.  If I remember correctly, you could pick up Word 2.0, Excel 4.0, or whatever their presentation program is for $130. That is the full blown version, not an upgrade or educational version.  You could also pick up Microsoft Office for $500 or something like that.  Myself I sprang for Word.  Well, hope that was helpful to someone.

SCSI-1:  7 devices per SCSI controller.  8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}  and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfer base.  16-bit SCSI-1 requires a  SCSI-2 controler chip and can provide only fast SCSI-2 not wide SCSI-2  which are both 16-bit interfaces {see SCSI-2}. SCSI-2: 10 devices per SCSI controller in SCSI-2 mode.  SCSI-2 is fully  SCSI-1 complient and tends to be implimented as a very fast SCSI-1 since it   needs a different controller interface in both hardware {which tends to be   very expendsive} and software.  Transfer speeds are 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst   {8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst  {32-bit/wide and fast}.  SCSI-2 in SCSI-1 mode is limited to 7 devices and  reduced 8-bit or 16-bit {fast only} throughput due to the difference between  SCSI-1 and wide SCSI-2 ports.  IBM HD Interfaces {limited to hard drives by design or lack of development}: [...] IDE:  Integrated Device Electronics   currently the most common standard, and is mainly used for medium sized   drives. Can have more than one hard drive. Asynchronous Transfer: ~5MB/s max.  So at its LOWEST setting SCSI-2 interface in Asynchronous SCSI-1 mode AVERAGES  the through put MAXIMUM of IDE in asynchronous mode.  In full SCSI-2 mode it blows poor IDE out the window, down the street, and into the garbage can. The problem becomes can the drive mechanisim keep up with those through put rates and THAT is where the bottleneck and cost of SCSI-2 comes from.  NOT the interface itself but more and more from drive mechanisims to use the SCSI-2 through put.  The cost of SCSI interface is a self fulliling prophisy: few people buy SCSI because it is so expencive for the PC, which in turn convices makes that mass producing SCSI {which would reduce its cost} is unwarented, and so SCSI is expencive. {That is the effect of the Rule of Scale: the more items sold the less EACH item has to bare the brunt the cost of manufacture and so the less each item has to cost}\",\"As it says, I'm interested in buying one of the little label-makers, and I can't afford a new one.

There is no question about it.    We must be reading different public opinion polls. I agree that the misguided public would like to see assault weapons banned (mainly because they are being lied to by the media about the frequency of their use in violent crime ... ~1%), but if public opinion were so dead-set against the RKBA you can bet that idiots like Metzenbaum and Schumer would be seeing their foolish bills getting passed through Congress a LOT easier than they are. And as governments go broke and can no longer protect their citizens you can bet that the American people will start to really appreciate the usefulness of firearms. Contrary  to what you might think, time is probably on OUR side, not YOURS.    Yeah, right. Don't hold your breath. My condolences on the discovery of uncomfortable resilience in your mammary glands, but this has nothing to do with the issue at hand.  ... ridiculous tripe deleted ...     Yeah, the liberal press doesn't like us much, but you can't really expect coherent thought from them anyway. Their opinions are based more on a desire to appear politically correct than on facts (which are generously provided by the FBI, if they'd bother to put on their Birkenstocks and go to the library to read them). Most of my friends are anti-gun, and without exception NONE of them bases his/her opinions on facts. They would rather believe (despite all evidence to the contrary) that disarming law-abiding citizens would make the world more civilized, when all it really does is make us all sheep. They  would rather wallow in their pitiful liberal white guilt about how society has driven the criminal to rob, rape, and murder. They  support spending millions of public dollars protecting the rights of scum who have already demonstrated that they have no regard for society or its laws. They ignore the fact that areas with the strictest gun control (NYC,DC) have the worst crime and areas with little gun control (VT,NH,ID) have very little crime in comparison. But they have to ignore this because otherwise they would need to confront the fact that law-abiding citizens who own guns are not the ones that are causing most of the trouble in society. Oh no, we certainly can't accept that! But I guess I have faith that when crime starts making significant inroads into their neighborhoods and starts directly hurting them and their families, they will probably whistle a different tune. They just better hope it isn't too late then.    Hmmm. I wasn't expecting company tonight. I might be able to whip up a quick cheese and cracker plate, but they should probably bring their own drinks. Do I have time to vacuum the rug?   I'm glad you ended the posting here.

Baerga's was .486-.424 and .392-.318. Pretty clearly, Alomar got a HUGE boost from his home park.  I'd say you could make a good for them being about equal right now. T&P rated Baerga higher, actually.  Mike\",\" Perhaps instead of this silly argument about what backup lights are for, couldn't we agree that they serve the dual purpose of letting people behind your car know that you have it in reverse and that they can also light up the area behind your car while you're backing up so you can see?  Backup lamps on current models are much brighter than they used to be on older cars. Those on my Taurus Wagon are quite bright enough to illuminate a good area behind the car, and they're  MUCH brighter than those on my earlier cars from the 60s and 70s.   Insofar as Vettes having side backup lights, look at a '92 or '93 model (or perhaps a year or two earlier too) and you'll see red side marker lamps and white side marker lamps both near the car's hindquarters.  Those aren't just white reflectors. \",\"I am coordinating the Space Shuttle Program Office's e-mail traffic to NPO Energia for our on-going Joint Missions.

That being said, I still think Baerga was VERY SLIGHTLY better last year, but I think this is as close to a wash as you're likely to find.  I personally don't care much for Alomar's defense.  I don't think he's nearly as good as people make him out to be, and he can't turn the DP to save his life.  He comes across the bag improperly, and his release is slow.  Considering the high leverage of the DP, this is a shortcoming I can't overlook.  In the long term, I'd move Alomar to another position.  If the Jays could trade a hot Devon White for something, I'll be Alomar could be a hell of a CF.  In the long run, I think I'd rather have Jeff Kent at 2B and Alomar in CF than Alomar/White.    \",\" Just thought I would mention that Sony no longer manufactures the CPD- 1304 because of several manufacturing flaws.

Please feel free to distribute this and my other messages on Clipper.  The name of the encryption algorithm is \\\"Skipjack.\\\"  Martin Hellman had written                  and the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part                 message which will then be encrypted under the system key SK                 producing                       E{ E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number;  SK}  To which I responded:          My understanding is that E[M; K] is not encrypted under SK (called the         \\\"family key\\\") and that the decrypt key corresponding to SK is held by         law enforcement.  Does anyone have first hand knowledge on this?  I was correct in that E[M; K] is not encrypted under SK.  However, Skipjack being a single-key system, there is, of course, not a separate decrypt key for the family key SK.          The unit key, also called the \\\"chip key,\\\" is generated from the         serial number N as follows.  Let N1, N2, and N3 be 64 bit blocks         derived from N, and let S1 and S2 be two 80-bit seeds used as keys.         Compute the 64-bit block                  R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1]          (Note that this is like using the DES in triple encryption mode with         two keys.)  Similarly compute blocks R2 and R3 starting with N2 and N3.         (I'm unlear about whether the keys S1 and S2 change.  The fact that         they're called seeds suggests they might.)  Then R1, R2, and R3 are         concatenated together giving 192 bits.  The first 80 bits  form K1 and         the next 80 bits form K2.  The remaining bits are discarded.  The seeds S1 and S2 do not change.   The whole process is performed on a laptop computer, and S1 and S2 are supplied by two independent people so that no one person knows both.  The same S1 and S2 are used during an entire \\\"programming session\\\" to generate keys for a stream of serial numbers.  Everything is discarded at the end (the computer could be thrown out if desired).  The serial number is 30 bits and the values N1, N2, and N3 are formed by padding the serial number with fixed 34-bit blocks (separate padding for each value).  The resulting keys K1 and K2 are output onto separate floppy disks, paired up with their serial number.  Each pair is stored in a separate file.  The floppy disks are taken away by two separate people on behalf of the two escrow agencies.

Reproduced under open license granted by Audio Books, Inc.  -----------------------------------------------------------------  This is the Dr. Beter AUDIO LETTER(R), 1629 K St. NW, Washington, DC  20006.     Hello, my friends, this is Dr. Beter.  Today is April 30, 1982, and this is my AUDIO LETTER(R) No. 74.    It's now been almost one month since war broke out in the South Atlantic.  On the surface it seems that it's only a dispute between Argentina and Great Britain over the barren, wind-swept Falkland Islands and South Georgia Island.  In reality, it's far more than that.     The so-called Falklands crisis is just the visible tip of a giant military operation.  During this month of April 1982, fierce naval battles have taken place--not only in the South Atlantic but also in the South Pacific.  Up to now most of the hostilities have been kept under wraps by wartime censorship on all sides.  But as I say these words, the naval war in the Southern Hemisphere is about to come to the surface.     Beginning today, April 30, a total naval and air blockade of the Falklands by the Royal Navy has begun.  At the same time a counterblockade has been declared by Argentina in the same area.     To be effective, a blockade must be imposed over a period of time, but the Royal Navy does not have that much time.  Winter is coming on in the South Atlantic, and the British supply lines are overextended.  Having come this far, Her Majesty's navy cannot simply drop the blockade and sail away in a few weeks time without drawing blood from Argentina.  As a result the British will be forced to undertake military operations very soon no matter how risky they may be.     There is also another reason why the Royal Navy now has no choice but to engage the Argentine forces in combat.  That reason, my friends, is that the Royal Navy has already suffered losses in secret combat this month.  Up to this moment there will be no way to explain away the damage which has been sustained by the British fleet.  Only when publicly admitted fighting erupts will the British dare to admit that they have suffered battle losses.  To obtain that cover story, the British have no choice but to sail into combat; but in doing so, they will be risking even heavier losses on top of those already sustained.  In short, my friends, Her Majesty's navy has sailed into a trap.     The events now unfolding in the South Atlantic carry strange, ironic echoes of the past.  For weeks now we've been hearing countless commentators referring to the British task force as an \\\"armada\\\" (quote).  The British of all people ought to be very uneasy with that description.  The original Spanish Armada 400 years ago was renowned as a seemingly invincible fighting force, but it came to grief in a naval disaster so complete that it changed the course of history--and it was none other than the English navy that destroyed the Spanish Armada.     The original Spanish Armada put to sea in 1588 during the reign of England's Queen Elizabeth I.  The Armada was an invasion fleet carrying thousands of crack fighting men to invade England.  They were met by the daring sea dogs of Sir Francis Drake.  Drake and his small, fast ships turned the tables on the Spanish Armada by changing the rules of battle.  The English fleet was equipped with new longer-range guns, and it stayed upwind and out of reach.  From there the English pounded, smashed, and shattered the big ships of the mighty Armada.  When it was all over, barely half the Spanish fleet was left to limp back to port.  Drake's defeat of the Spanish Armada was a shock to the world.  It opened the door for England under Queen Elizabeth I to start its expansion into a truly global empire.     Today, 400 years later, history seems to have come full circle.  Queen Elizabeth II is witnessing the dismantling of the world empire whose heyday began under Queen Elizabeth I, and now the cultures of England and of Spain are once again in confrontation.  Once again a so-called armada is preparing for invasion, but this time the armada is British, not Spanish.  Four hundred years ago Sir Francis Drake was the hero of the day; today, the ghost of Francis Drake is once again on the scene.     The South Atlantic war zone is at the eastern end of the Drake Passage around the southern tip of South America.  The defeat of the Spanish Armada four centuries ago broke the back of Spain's naval supremacy, and now the defeat of the new British armada may well break the back of what remains of the once glorious Royal Navy.     My three special topics for this AUDIO LETTER are:  Topic #1--THE MILITARY SECRET OF SOUTH GEORGIA ISLAND Topic #2--THE SECRET NAVAL WAR OF THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE Topic #3--THE ROCKEFELLER FEAR CAMPAIGN AGAINST NUCLEAR WAR.  Topic #1--When the Falkland Islands crisis began early this month it looked at first like a tempest in a teapot.  For a century and a half since 1833, the Islands have been controlled by Great Britain.  During that entire time, British sovereignty over the Falklands has been disputed by Argentina.  There have been countless threats by Argentina to seize the Islands, which it calls the Malvinas, but the threats have always come to nothing in the past and Britain has never even gotten very worried about them.     The Islands are four times as distant from Argentina as Cuba is from the United States, and they are not much of a prize.  After 150 years of occupancy, the Falklands are home to fewer than 2,000 British settlers and a lot of sheep.  In short, the remote Falkland Islands hardly look like something to fight over, and yet here we are watching another crisis take place.  We are watching as war erupts between Great Britain and Argentina.     The Thatcher government is acting as if it has forgotten all about its usual preoccupation with the Soviet threat at NATO's doorstep.  Instead, Britain is throwing almost everything it's got at Argentina---aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, submarines, assault ships--you name it.  Luxury cruise ships have even been commissioned and turned into troop carriers overnight.  Wave after wave of additional assault troops have been activated and sent to join the fleet even after it sailed.  Ships and submarines have been pulled off station from normal NATO duty and sent to reinforce the task force.  The initial 40-ship force has grown steadily over the past several weeks into an armada numbering over 70.  Over two-thirds of the entire Royal Navy has already been deployed to the South Atlantic off Argentina.     Watching all this, a lot of people are asking: What's this fight really all about?  The most popular answer suggested in the major media is \\\"oil.\\\"  Vast deposits of oil are known to exist under the continental shelf between Argentina and the Falklands, but that has been known for nearly 10 years.  In no way does it explain the timing of the sudden military offensive by Argentina this month, and oil explains even less about the Argentine seizure of South Georgia Island.     South Georgia Island is 800 miles east of the Falklands with no known oil deposits anywhere near it; and compared to South Georgia, the Falklands are an island paradise.  South Georgia Island is covered with rugged mountains, treacherous valleys, glaciers, and semi-permanent snow.  Most of it is uninhabitable.  On top of all that, Argentina has absolutely no legal or historical claim to South Georgia Island.  In that respect it stands in sharp contrast to the Falklands.     In the early 1830s the Falklands were occupied for a while by Argentine colonists.  In 1833 the British expelled them and took over the Island.  For that and other historical reasons, Argentina argues that the Falklands really belong to Argentina, not Britain.     But no such argument is possible for South Georgia Island.  It has always been controlled by Britain, never by Argentina or Spain.  The Argentine seizure of South Georgia Island looks even more unreasonable from a military point of view.  Argentina's leaders are military men and they think in military terms.  They were well aware ahead of time that far-off South Georgia Island could not possibly be held for long.  By seizing it they were setting themselves up to absorb a military defeat, as the Island was retaken by Britain.  So the question is: Why did Argentina's military junta bother with the seemingly worthless South Georgia Island at all?     My friends, the answers to all these questions are military, not political or economic.  South Georgia Island possesses an enormous military secret.  It's a giant underground installation buried under the mountains at the northwest end of the Island.  The real reason for the so-called Falkland crisis is this secret installation, together with two other similar installations which I will describe shortly.     The secret military complexes have been in existence for many years; they are not new.  What is new is the accelerated nuclear war timetable of the American Bolshevik war planners here in Washington.  For the past two months I've been reporting the details of this new war plan to you as quickly as I can obtain and verify them.     The plan calls for NUCLEAR WAR ONE to erupt by September of this year 1982!!  It is this fast-approaching nuclear war threat that caused the so-called Falklands crisis to erupt now.     What is going on now is a coordinated effort to spoil part of the Bolshevik grand strategy for the coming nuclear war.  The mutual enemies of the American Bolsheviks here--namely, the Rockefeller cartel--and Russia's new rulers in the Kremlin are behind the present crisis.  They are trying to ruin Phase #3 of the \\\"PROJECT Z\\\" war plan which I revealed last month.  That phase is to be world domination by the American Bolsheviks after both Russia and the United States have been destroyed in NUCLEAR WAR ONE.  As I mentioned last month, the key to this plan is the existence of secret weapons stockpiles in various places around the world.     The American Bolshevik military planners here in America are working with other Bolshevik agents in key military positions of other countries to set off war.  Having done that, they intend to ride out the nuclear holocaust they have caused, safe and cozy in Government war bunkers!  When the warring nations finally lie smoldering and exhausted, the Bolsheviks will leave the shattered remains of their host countries.  They will rendezvous at the secret weapons installations and bring their weapons into the open.  They will confront the world with the only remaining fresh, up-to-date, powerful military force on earth; and using that military power, they will become the undisputed rulers of the world--that is, they plan to do all this, and they plan to pave the way for world domination very soon by setting off NUCLEAR WAR ONE in a matter of months.  The Rockefeller cartel and Russia's new anti-Bolshevik rulers are working together in a race against time to try to head off the Bolshevik war plan.     Last month I mentioned that the Bolsheviks here are benefitting from war preparations which were started by the Rockefellers long ago.  It has only been about three years since the Rockefellers were dislodged as the prime movers of the United States Government by the Bolsheviks.  Since that time the United States Government has been a house divided, torn by internal power struggles between rival Bolshevik and Rockefeller factions.  But before that, the United States had been dominated for decades both economically and politically by the Four Rockefeller Brothers.     In 1961 the Brothers launched a new long-range plan for world domination.  It was a two-prong strategy, half visible and half secret, which I first described long ago in AUDIO LETTER No. 28.  It was a plan for the United States to arm to the teeth in secret while appearing to disarm gradually.  Without repeating all the details, the basic idea was grandiose yet simple.  By deliberately appearing weak, the Rockefeller-controlled United States would maneuver itself into a nuclear war with Russia.  Then the secret weapons, including superweapons, would be unleashed to smash Russia and take over the world.     When they set the grand plan in motion in 1961, the Rockefeller Brothers were looking ahead to a nuclear war by the late 1970s.  Their military analysts concluded very early that the war being planned would have very different effects on the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.  Both superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, are located well up in the Northern Hemisphere; so are the other full-fledged nuclear powers--Great Britain, France, Red China, and India.  By contrast, the strategic targets for nuclear war in the Southern Hemisphere are relatively few and far between.  In other words, it was expected that the coming nuclear war would be essentially a Northern Hemisphere war.     In an all-out nuclear holocaust it is known that serious radioactive fallout will gradually spread to affect even areas not initially hit by war.  But there are limits to how far the war clouds can spread.  It was discovered long ago that there is very little mixing between the air of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.  In the northern half of our planet, cold air from the North Pole works its way southward towards the equator, then it works its way back to the north as warm air.  A mirror image of this process takes up the southern half of the planet.  Northern and Southern Hemisphere air meet in the equatorial zone, but very little of the air changes places.     The military conclusion, my friends, is this: the coming nuclear war could ruin large areas of the Northern Hemisphere for generations to come; but if the calculations are right, the Southern Hemisphere could escape virtually unaffected by the war.  This was music to the ears of the Four Rockefeller Brothers.  A quick look at the globe of the world shows why.  The Rockefeller cartel has dominated Latin America ever since World War II.  As I discussed in my very first monthly AUDIO LETTER, Nelson Rockefeller solidified the cartel grip on Latin America during the war.  He accomplished this as so-called \\\"Coordinator of Hemispheric Defense\\\" for then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt.  So that takes care of the South American continent and its natural resources.     Then there is the African continent.  There, too, Rockefeller control was already in effect over wide areas of Black Africa, especially south of the equator.  All this was thanks to the efforts of John D. Rockefeller III, as I detailed in AUDIO LETTER No. 36.     Looking around the globe, the most important remaining land masses from the standpoint of world domination are Australia and New Zealand.  Thanks to World War II, both were wide open to the Rockefellers.     The Rockefeller Brothers decided to establish secret military installations in the Southern Hemisphere for use after the coming war.  By this means they expected to become the masters of the surviving southern half of planet Earth after the Northern Hemisphere war.  Then, as the Northern Hemisphere gradually recovered from the nuclear holocaust, the Rockefeller empire would be able to pick up the pieces.  In this way the third generation Rockefeller Brothers expected their family dynasty to inherit the Earth.     In order to control the Southern Hemisphere militarily after the war, some means would have to be available to project military power onto any land mass.  For example, revolts against Rockefeller domination would require troops--not a blast from the beam weapons on the Moon.  The most critical factor for postwar military domination of the world was found to be a navy.  A minimum of two secret naval fleets would be required--one based in the South Atlantic, the other in the South Pacific.  Since the reserve naval fleets were to be kept secret until after the Northern Hemisphere nuclear war, they could not be built in existing shipyards.  New construction facilities had to be built and they had to be hidden.  To hide an entire shipyard is no small task; they take up a lot of space.  On top of that, it was essential that the ships remain hidden after they were built.  The best way to achieve that was to combine the shipyard and naval base into one over-all secret installation.  Finally, the secret naval installation had to be invulnerable to nuclear attack; otherwise if its existence were ever discovered prematurely, the secret navy might be wiped out.     The combined requirements for secrecy, space, and protection against attack were formidable; but one day in 1959, while all these plans were still in the early stages of development, the answer presented itself.  During a so-called banking trip to Sweden, David Rockefeller was given a tour of a unique hidden naval port.  The port is hollowed out from solid granite cliffs which come right down to the water.  The entrance to the port is a gigantic hole in the side of the cliff which can be sealed off with enormous steel doors.  Inside this big doorway on the water a huge cavity has been hollowed out to accommodate ships.     The Rockefeller Brothers and their military adviser decided that a bigger, more secret, better protected version of the Swedish hidden port was just what they wanted.  A survey of candidate sites was then initiated.  The site survey covered coastal areas throughout the Southern Hemisphere.  Many areas were rejected very quickly because the topography was wrong.  Other areas were rejected because they were too close to the equator.  Still others had to be ruled out because there were too many people living nearby, making the desired level of secrecy impossible.  Finally, it was essential that the sites chosen for the secret naval installations be totally secure politically.     At last the sites for the secret naval installations were selected.  In the South Pacific, extreme southern New Zealand was selected.  This is what I was alluding to in AUDIO LETTER No. 71 three months ago when I called attention to New Zealand's extreme importance in the coming war.     In order to obtain the necessary space, the secret New Zealand naval installation had to be divided up into two sites located close together.  One is at the extreme southwest tip of South Island where the mountain range known as the Southern Alps comes down virtually to the water's edge.  The other part of the installation is built into the northwest tip of Stewart Island, which is off the tip of South Island.  The Stewart Island facility is hollowed out within a rise known as Mt. Anglem.     The New Zealand location met all the requirements.  Ever since World War II the government of New Zealand has been tied even closer to the United States than to Great Britain.  The location is far from the equator, and the installations are buried deep under mountains, protected from nuclear attack.  They are also too deep to be reached by particle-beam attacks, and the New Zealand site is well situated to command the entire South Pacific.     In the South Atlantic an even more perfect site was found.  That site, my friends, is South Georgia Island.  It is located perfectly for naval domination of the entire South Atlantic.  The tall, rugged mountains provided a perfect location for the secret installation at the northwest tip of the 100-mile long island.  It is controlled by Great Britain whose government, like that of New Zealand, was willing to cooperate; and South Georgia Island was virtually uninhabited except for a whaling station on the northeast coast.  The whaling station was some 50 miles away from the secret new installation which was being built, but Britain took no chances.  In 1965 the whaling station was closed down.  Since that time there have been no inhabitants on South Georgia Island except for a few dozen alleged Antarctic scientists.     Construction of the secret naval facilities--two in New Zealand, one on South Georgia Island--began in the early 1960's.  The techniques were adapted from those used previously to build other large underground facilities, such as the NORAD installation inside Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado; however these techniques were adapted in radically new ways to achieve construction access directly from the sea instead of overland.  In this way, the sheltering mountain was left undisturbed in appearance both during and after construction.     The cuts in the mountain side which were necessary to let ships in and out were kept as small as possible and were well camouflaged.  Like the Swedish hidden naval port arrangement, the entrances to the secret installations can be sealed up.  When sealed, the entrance is virtually impossible to detect unless you know exactly where it is; and unlike most large construction projects, there are no tailings or piles of leftover rock lying around to attract attention.  The man-made caverns which house the secret naval installations are enormous, but all the rock and debris was disposed of at sea.     Once the secret naval facilities were built, they had to be outfitted for ship construction and docksite storage.  The fake disarmament of the United States during the 1960s contributed greatly to this task.  From 1961 to 1968 one man played a pivotal role in this elaborate Rockefeller scheme.  He was then-Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara.  All through the 60's McNamara presided over the public paring back of America's visible military power.  This included the closing down and dismantling of entire shipyards.  What we were not told was where all that shipyard equipment went afterwards.  Where it went, my friends, was to the new secret installations which were being outfitted in New Zealand and South Georgia Island!     The secret naval installations have been used as duplication facilities to reproduce certain ships and submarines designed and built here in the United States.  As Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger told Congress recently, it is cheaper to build two ships at a time.  That is especially true if the second ship is an exact duplicate of the first.  This has become even more true in recent years through the use of computerized manufacturing techniques.     The secret naval fleets which have been built at the secret installations are made up of duplicates--exact duplicates of certain other ships and submarines.  They are all nuclear powered--nuclear \\\"subs\\\"; nuclear cruisers; nuclear destroyers; and yes, nuclear aircraft carriers, three of them.  A secret twin was built for the U.S.S. Nimitz, for the U.S.S. Eisenhower, and for the newly-launched U.S.S. Carl Vincent.  All have been financed through the gigantic cost overruns, so called, that we constantly hear about in the Defense Department; and all three carriers have been provided with a full complement of aircraft whose manufacture was financed the same way!     The ships of the secret American Bolshevik naval fleets are all duplicates of other nuclear-powered vessels.  Even so, the secret naval ships possess one key difference.     Last month I revealed that the so-called \\\"Stealth Program\\\" has succeeded in developing a kind of electromagnetic invisibility shield.  This technique makes an object invisible from a distance by distorting light waves in its vicinity.     A whole new fleet of Phantom war-planes are now going into crash production that use this principle; and, my friends, all of the secret American Bolshevik navy ships have already been outfitted with similar Stealth-field equipment!  The Stealth principle is actually easier to apply to ships than to airplanes because there is more room for the powerful equipment that generates the field.     After NUCLEAR WAR ONE, the secret Stealth navy of the American Bolsheviks would be light years ahead of any other navy left on earth.  It would be perfect for the intended role of world domination.  The Rockefellers set it all in motion long ago, my friends, but three years ago they lost control of the United States Military.  Now it's the American Bolsheviks who are in control, and they are bent on war.     These secret naval installations have precipitated what is being called the \\\"Falklands crisis.\\\"  Topic #2--In AUDIO LETTER(R) No. 73 last month I described \\\"PROJECT Z\\\", the new Bolshevik three-phase strategy for NUCLEAR WAR ONE.     An elite group of American Bolshevik military planners here are flushing out the plan right now at a secret war-room here in Washington.  It's a plan by which the United States will strike the first nuclear blow, followed by all-out thermonuclear war with Russia.     Having set off the holocaust, the Bolsheviks here and in certain other countries plan to rise it out safe in comfortable war bunkers.  Finally after NUCLEAR WAR ONE fizzles out in stalemate, they plan to leave behind the ashes of the United States and her allies.  Activating Phase #3 of their grand strategy, they plan to unveil their secret weapons, especially their secret naval fleets.  With these they plan to conquer and rule what is left of the world.  The United States as we know it will be dead and gone; but in the eyes of the Bolsheviks themselves, this outcome will constitute victory.     Up to now the nuclear war timetable which I first revealed two months ago is still on track.  They are still shooting for nuclear war to begin by September of this year 1982!  Time is fast running out.     The Bolsheviks here are sprinting as fast as they can toward war; but, my friends, the Bolsheviks are not the only runners in this race.  They have two deadly enemies, both of whom are equally determined to trip up the Bolsheviks.  One enemy of the Bolsheviks here is the Rockefeller cartel; the other enemy is the new anti-Bolshevik ruling clique in Russia; and now these two mutual enemies of the Bolsheviks are pooling their efforts in certain ways.     In AUDIO LETTER No. 71 three months ago I reported that a limited, new anti-Bolshevik coalition was in the works between the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians.  The January 26 meeting between Haig and Gromyko in Geneva, Switzerland, was a turning point in the formation of this coalition.  It is now a reality, and is responsible for the so-called \\\"Falkland crisis\\\" now dominating the headlines.  It should be emphasized that this new relationship between the Rockefeller cartel and Russia falls far short of a true alliance.  They have very major disputes to be settled between them, but for the time being they have called a truce between themselves to deal with their mutual deadly enemy--the Bolsheviks here in America.     The first priority of the Russians and the Rockefellers is to slow down the Bolshevik preparations for imminent nuclear war.  If they can do that, time is on the side of the Rockefeller cartel in certain political movements which I discussed last summer in AUDIO LETTER No. 67.  A slow-down in the nuclear war timetable will also give more breathing space for additional anti-Bolshevik actions to be implemented.     The joint Rockefeller-Russian planners decided by mid-February that military action against the Bolsheviks was essential very quickly.  No other type of action had any hope of taking effect fast enough to prevent nuclear war by the end of this summer.     The exact details of the \\\"PROJECT Z\\\" war plan are not known to either the Rockefellers or the Russians, but the general outlines are known to be as I described last month.     It was decided that military action should be devised that would undermine Phase #3 of the Bolshevik war plan--that is, the Bolshevik-controlled secret naval installations and fleets in the Southern Hemisphere should be attacked and crippled.  By working together, the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians were able to devise an attack plan which neither could have carried out alone.  The Rockefeller group, who built and originally controlled these bases, provided detailed Intelligence about the best way to attack them.  The Russians with their enormous military machine provided the muscle to actually carry out the attack.     It was essential to devise a scheme that would enable both secret fleets in the South Atlantic and South Pacific to be attacked.  Survival intact of either fleet would leave the Bolshevik war plan still workable.     Military analysts concluded very quickly that a direct assault on the New Zealand facilities was out of the question.  There was no combination of commandos, frogmen, or other military force which could possibly keep an attack secret from the outside world.  Any attack on the New Zealand bases would set off the very war which the Rockefellers and Russians want to prevent.     But the situation in the South Atlantic was a different matter.  In a way, the greatest asset of South Georgia Island was also its Achilles' heel.  The extreme isolation which protected the secrecy of the South Georgia base also made a covert military assault feasible.  The key lay with Argentina and her long-standing claims to the Falkland Islands.     As I mentioned in Topic #1, the Rockefeller cartel has dominated all of Latin America for decades.  Cartel operatives were sent to Argentina to work out a deal with the government military junta there.  The historic dispute over the Falkland Islands was to be used to provide a ruse, a military cover, to enable the South Georgia base to be attacked.  The Argentine generals were not told everything about the situation by any means, but they were told enough to make clear what they were to do.     As an inducement to cooperate, the Argentine leaders were promised handsome rewards.  They were guaranteed that after the shooting was over, the Falkland Islands would remain in Argentine hands.  This guarantee included the promise of covert military assistance as needed against the Royal Navy.  And to bolster the troubled Argentine economy, it was promised that the Rockefeller cartel will help develop the immense offshore oil reserves.  With these combined promises of military glory and financial rewards, the Argentine military junta agreed to the plan.     On March 19 Argentina carried out Act #1 in the joint attack plan.  A group of Argentine scrap-metal merchants, of all things, landed at the abandoned old whaling station on South Georgia Island.  Supposedly they were there to dismantle the old buildings and cart them off to sell.  While they were at it they also raised the Argentine flag over the work-site.  The British, always nervous about South Georgia Island, promptly reacted as expected.  The British Antarctic survey ship \\\"Endurance\\\" put 22 Marines ashore.  They drove off the scrap merchants and tore down the Argentine flag.     The incident provided the desired excuse for the Argentine Junta to bring the simmering 150-year-old Falklands dispute to a boil.  From time to time in the past, Argentina has claimed that South Georgia is part of the Falklands because it is administered that way by Britain.  That argument is very flimsy but it now came in very handy.  It was nothing new to hear this from Argentine leaders, so there was no hint of what was really afoot.     During late March, Argentine military forces started assembling for an assault on the Falklands.  \\\"Nothing new\\\", thought the British high command.  Argentina has carried out threatening maneuvers in the past many times.  It was believed that they were about to do it again; but on April 2 Argentine forces did the unexpected.  After many past false alarms, this time they actually invaded and seized the Islands.  All Argentine public statements emphasized the long-standing historical claims to the Falklands themselves; but just for good measure, the next day a small Argentine force also seized far-off South Georgia Island.  The force was so small that it gave the appearance initially that it was just a side show from Argentina's point of view; however, the small contingent of 22 Royal Marines were overpowered and bundled off the Island along with a group of 13 alleged scientists.  That was the moment of payoff in the joint Rockefeller-Russian attack plan.     Thanks to the elaborate distraction staged by the Argentine forces, a special commando team got onto the Island undetected.  Based on the detailed Rockefeller information about the base, the team moved to a location on the mountain directly above the cavernous secret base.  Special high-speed drilling equipment was set up by the Rockefeller members of the team while the Russian members concentrated on military defense.  By late that evening, April 3, the military high command in London finally learned what was really taking place.  The secret South Georgia base was under attack by virtually the only means possible.  The joint Rockefeller-Russian team were drilling a shaft down through the mountain toward the hollowed out cavern inside.  It was only a matter of time until their drill would break through the ceiling of the giant hidden naval base.  Once the hole was made, the next step was obvious.  The Rockefeller-Russian team would put a weapon of some kind through the hole.  The best guess was that it would be a nerve gas.     The shock waves that went through the highest levels of the British government on the evening of April 3 can hardly be described, my friends.  The Thatcher government, like the so-called Reagan Administration here in America, is Bolshevik controlled.  That's why Margaret Thatcher always says, \\\"Me, too\\\" any time the Reagan Administration says or does anything against Russia.  Both governments are party to the secret nuclear war plan in complete betrayal of the people of their respective countries, and on the evening of April 3 they suddenly discovered that their precious war plan was in deep, deep trouble.     Immediately the Thatcher government started assembling a naval armada to sail for the South Atlantic.  Haste was the order of the day.  The drilling on South Georgia Island was proceeding around the clock.  The best estimates were that the drilling would break through into the roof of the naval base in about three weeks, on or about April 24.  If help did not reach South Georgia by then, the secret installation might be doomed.  The forces stationed at the installation itself were unable to defend themselves under the circumstances.  Their mighty naval ships were ships in a bottle.  They did not dare open the bottle to sail out to fight because the Russian commandos were armed with tactical and nuclear weapons.  To open the blast-proof entrance doors would be suicide.     On April 5, just two days after South Georgia Island was seized, some 40 naval ships began moving out of British ports.  The same day Lord Carrington was sacked as Foreign Minister.  He was forced to resign, my friends, because he had assisted the Rockefeller attack plan by downplaying the Argentine attack preparations.     That same day, April 5, New Zealand, the home of the other secret naval fleet, broke diplomatic relations with Argentina.  The two hidden New Zealand facilities had been placed on \\\"Red Alert.\\\"  As a precautionary measure, all submarines at the twin base were ordered to sea.  Several surface ships were already at sea undergoing \\\"sea trials\\\", but that still left seven (7) major ships inside the hidden twin naval base including one of the nuclear aircraft carriers I mentioned earlier.     On that busy day of April 5, Argentina's Foreign Minister, Costa Mendez, was at the United Nations in New York.  He was alarmed by the deployment of such a large part of the Royal Navy.  Costa Mendez hurried here to Washington to seek reassurances from certain officials.  He got them!     For the next two weeks or so the news was filled with stories about the allegedly slow movement of the British fleet while negotiations went on.  That, my friends, was only a cover story.  The Royal Navy was actually joining up and moving as rapidly as possible toward South Georgia Island.  If the task force arrived in time to save the secret base, a major battle was likely.  The official stories about \\\"slow movement\\\" of the British armada were intended to give a cushion of time for that battle.  If need be, the fleet would have several days to retake South Georgia Island, then it could move on to arrive near the Falklands on the announced schedule.  In this way the crucial importance of South Georgia Island would be hidden and the big secret preserved.     It was initially expected that advance elements of the British fleet would reach the vicinity of South Georgia Island within two weeks.  That would have been soon enough to attack the joint Rockefeller-Russian commando team and stop the drilling before it was completed.  But Russian Cosmospheres and submarines made a shambles of the plan.     Key advance elements of the South Georgia attack contingent left Ascension Island early April 14, two days before it was announced officially.  Shortly after they did so, they ran into trouble.  Russian Cosmospheres and attack submarines closed in on a single ship which was critical to the planned counterassault on South Georgia Island.  The Cosmospheres bombarded the bridge and combat information center of the ship with neutron radiation.  In moments the ship was without any command, its communications and radar silenced.  Then a Russian \\\"sub\\\" closed in and quickly finished off this key British ship with torpedoes.  It broke apart with secondary explosions and sank rapidly.  So far as is known, there were no survivors.     This unexpected shock in the mid-Atlantic produced two results, both important:  First, it caused a slowdown in the race toward the South Atlantic by the British armada.  The task force had to be regrouped into a configuration better suited for an enroute defense, but that cost valuable time.  Public announcements from London about the progress of the fleet reflected this slowdown.  The timetable for arrival on battle stations near the Falklands started stretching out longer and longer.  All this bought extra time for the joint commando team on South Georgia Island.  The drilling continued.  The other result of the sinking was equally important.  Word was flashed to the South Pacific Stealth navy to prepare for possible action.  It was obvious that the Russian Navy was getting involved in the Atlantic, which meant that the Royal Navy could be in big trouble.  During the dead of night, early April 15, the seven Stealth ships put to sea from their twin secret bases in southern New Zealand.  They deployed to a secret operational headquarters area in the Antipodes Islands, 450 miles southeast of New Zealand.  Their electromagnetic shields were operating to provide protection from attack.  These shields make it impossible to communicate with the outside world or even to see it, as I explained last month; but once they arrived at the Antipodes, the Stealth ships hooked up to buoys equipped with shielded communication cables to the Island headquarters.  The Antipodes headquarters, in turn, was in constant touch with the South Georgia base by way of a transoceanic cable around the tip of South America.  The deployment of the available ships of the South Pacific Stealth fleet was exactly what the joint Rockefeller-Russian planners had hoped for.  The ships had been flushed out from their essentially invulnerable hiding place in New Zealand!     The British ship's sinking of April 14 was also followed by other events.  On April 15 the Argentine Navy started moving out of port.  The same day, Alexander Haig arrived again in Buenos Aires.  Supposedly he was there as a diplomat, but in reality he was there as a General, dealing with Generals.  Haig is the top Governmental operative of the Rockefeller cartel, as I have revealed in the past.  He was making sure that the Argentines did not get cold feet and back down at that critical moment.  Four days later, April 19, Haig left for Washington.  As he boarded his plane, Haig somberly told reporters, \\\"Time is running out.\\\"  And so it was, my friends, for the secret South Georgia base.     The very next day, April 20, the drill broke through into the hollowed-out cavern of the naval base.  Bolshevik military analysts in London had not expected that it could be completed until at least the following weekend.  The British fleet was still out of range.     The weapon which the commando team inserted down through the long hole was a small, compact Russian neutron bomb.  When it was detonated inside the confines of the huge artificial cave, the effects were devastating.  The intense radiation instantly killed everyone inside the base.  Also the heat and blast effects of the bomb are believed to have damaged all the ships inside sufficiently to badly disable them.     Meanwhile, Russian Cosmospheres and submarines were converging on the Stealth ships which were near the Antipodes Islands awaiting orders.  From a distance, the ships were invisible to the eye due to their protective shields, which also protect against beam-weapon attack; but they were sitting ducks for the tactics which the Russians employed.     Floating overhead, the Cosmospheres located the seven ships using their Psychoenergetic Range-Finding equipment known as PRF.  As I have reported in the past, there is no method known by which PRF can be jammed.  The Cosmospheres radioed the exact locations of the ships to the attack submarines.  The \\\"subs\\\" were armed with special non-homing, non-nuclear torpedoes designed to explode on impact.  More sophisticated torpedoes would have been thrown off course or detonated prematurely by the protective shield of each ship; but these simple torpedoes just cruise right through each invisibility field to strike the ship and explode.  Within 15 minutes after the attack began, all seven Bolshevik Stealth ships were on their way to the bottom, and with them went their Bolshevik Commanders and mercenary crews collected from around the world.     The South Pacific action took place just after sunset local time.  The time here in Washington was around 2:00 P.M. April 23.  That evening Secretary of State Haig was seen briefly in public with the new British Foreign Minister, Francis Pym.  Pym was wearing the artificial pseudo-smile which diplomats are taught always to display in public.  But not Haig.  Haig was grinning from ear to ear, and no wonder.  The joint Rockefeller-Russian military operation had been a brilliant success.  The secret Bolshevik South Atlantic fleet had been virtually wiped out, bottled up inside South Georgia Island; and the South Pacific fleet, while not totally wiped out, had been badly crippled.  By working together, the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians had won the secret naval war of the Southern Hemisphere.  Topic #3--As I say these words, news reports give the impression that war is about to erupt in the South Atlantic, but the real war in the Southern Hemisphere is already over.  What we are watching now is the beginning of its bloody aftermath.  That aftermath is the battle for the Falkland Islands.  They have been promised to Argentina as a reward for her role in the secret war.     At this moment the Bolsheviks here in Washington are pressing for a public announcement that the United States will side with Britain.  As soon as that takes place, military action will heat up fast around the Falklands.  Britain has no choice but to fight.  She has already suffered casualties which cannot be explained without a public battle; but by fighting, the Bolsheviks in Britain are running the risk of a humiliating and tragic defeat for the Royal Navy.     Meanwhile, the Rockefeller strategists here are now concentrating on a fast-building, anti-nuclear-war campaign.  On all sides now we are hearing about the so-called \\\"nuclear freeze movement.\\\"  There are documentaries, articles, publicity of all kinds to sensitize us to the terrors of nuclear war.  In recent months, there have even been referenda popping up on election ballots dealing with the nuclear war issue.  Medical doctors are banding together to warn the public about what would happen if there were a nuclear war.     We are being told that all this is just popping up spontaneously.  We are now 37 years into the nuclear age and nothing like this has ever gained so much momentum before, yet now we are supposed to believe that millions of Americans have spontaneously gotten the same ideas at the same time.  If you believe that, my friends, I give up.  Movements like this never, and I mean never, develop without leadership, organization, and money--and plenty of it.     What we are watching is the Rockefeller public relations machine at work.  As I've explained in the past, the Rockefeller cartel cannot afford to let a nuclear war take place.  If it does, they will lose everything because they are not in a position to control it.  Instead, the deadly enemies of the Rockefeller cartel, the Bolsheviks here, will win out if there is a war; and so the Rockefeller faction is now doing everything in its power to prevent a nuclear war.     The present anti-nuclear-war orientation of the Rockefeller cartel creates certain temporary common interests between them and Russia; but as Russia's new rulers know very well, this does not spring from any great moral perspective on the part of the Rockefeller group.  It's purely a matter of practical necessity right now for the Rockefellers.     The Russians regard the United States as a house divided, and they are exploiting that division by working in careful ways with the Rockefellers.  Their first priority is to rid the world of the deadly Bolshevik menace of all-out, even suicidal, nuclear war; but once that is done, they know that there will be a day of reckoning with the Rockefeller cartel some day.     The Rockefeller group is working toward a definite objective with their new anti-nuclear-war propaganda.  That objective is renewed power--and power that moves them closer to their old dream of WORLD GOVERNMENT.  The Bolsheviks here have unwittingly provided fertile ground for the powerful new Rockefeller antiwar campaign.  Under Bolshevik control, the so-called Reagan Administration has become so hawkish that it's scaring people.  The Rockefeller antiwar campaign is designed to capitalize on that latent fear as a tool of power.     These days the smell of war is in the air.  The Falklands crisis is helping to make that more intense.  The Rockefeller propaganda machine is now paving the way for the argument that surrender of sovereignty is the only way to avoid war.  A new super-United Nations of sorts is now in the works to fill the bill.  It will have teeth!  As presently envisioned, the new organization will be based in Geneva, Switzerland.  The working name, though this may be changed, is the \\\"World Nonproliferation Council.\\\"  The plan is to bring it into being as the outgrowth of nuclear nonproliferation treaties, but its true purpose will be to use fear--the fear of war--to control us all.                         LAST MINUTE SUMMARY     Now it's time for my Last Minute Summary.  In this AUDIO LETTER I have reported on the reasons behind the so-called Falkland Islands crisis.  The crisis erupted because of secret Bolshevik-controlled naval installations in the Southern Hemisphere.  These have been attacked by joint action of the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians in an attempt to slow down the nuclear-war timetable.  The attacks were successful, but the results remain to be seen.  One result, though, is that the Royal Navy has now been drawn into a trap.  Britain's Waterloo at sea may well be at hand.     My friends, two factions are struggling for control over our United States--the Rockefeller cartel and the Bolsheviks.  They differ in style but both seek to control us through fear.  If we are ever to rise above their trickery, it must be through the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, our only hope.  As the Scripture tells us, our Lord \\\"...has not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, of love, and of a sound mind.\\\"  We must learn to wage peace.  As our Lord declared long ago, \\\"Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called sons of God.\\\"\",\"From: payne@crl.dec.com (Andrew Payne) Message-ID: <1993Apr20.004418.11548@crl.dec.com> Organization: DEC Cambridge Research Lab Date: Tue, 20 Apr 1993 00:44:18 GMT   Does anyone know if a source for the TCM3105 modem chips (as used in the Baycom and my PMP modems)?

I  would *not* feel threatened by those only accepting or pursuing  \\\"Islamicization\\\" through peaceful means, nor by Jews advocating the same approach.

Scott --  Scott Snowiss sasst11+@.pitt.edu\",\"The following are my thoughts on a meeting that I, Hugh Kelso, and Bob Lilly had with an aide of Sen. Patty Murrays.  We were there to discuss SSTO, and commercial space.  This is how it went...    After receiving a packet containing a presentation on the benifits of SSTO, I called and tried to schedule a meeting with our local Senator (D) Patty Murray, Washington State.  I started asking for an hour, and when I heard the gasp on the end of the phone, I quickly backed off to 1/2 an hour. Later in that conversation, I learned that a standard appointment is 15 minutes.  We got the standard bozo treatment.  That is, we were called back by an aide, who scheduled a meeting with us, in order to determine that we were not bozos, and to familiarize himself with the material, and to screen it, to  make sure that it was appropriate to take the senators time with that material.  Well, I got allocated 1/2 hour with Sen. Murrays aide, and we ended up talking to him for 45 minutes, with us ending the meeting, and him still listening. We covered a lot of ground, and only a little tiny bit was DCX specific.   Most of it was a single stage reusable vehicle primer.  There was another woman there who took copius quantities of notes on EVERY topic that we brought up.  But, with Murray being new, we wanted to entrench ourselves as non-corporate aligned (I.E. not speaking for boeing) local citizens interentested in space. So, we spent a lot of time covering the benifits of lower cost access to LEO.  Solar power satellites are a big focus here, so we hit them as becoming  feasible with lower cost access, and we hit the environmental stand on that. We hit the tourism angle, and I left a copy of the patric Collins Tourism paper, with side notes being that everyone who goes into space, and sees the atmosphere becomes more of an environmentalist, esp. after SEEING the smog over L.A.  We hit on the benifits of studying bone decalcification (which is  more pronounced in space, and said that that had POTENTIAL to lead to  understanding of, and MAYBE a cure for osteoporosis.  We hit the education  whereby kids get enthused by space, but as they get older and find out that they havent a hop in hell of actually getting there, they go on to other fields, with low cost to orbit, the chances they might get there someday  would provide greater incentive to hit the harder classes needed.  We hit a little of the get nasa out of the operational launch vehicle business angle.  We hit the lower cost of satellite launches, gps navigation, personal communicators, tellecommunications, new services, etc...  Jobs provided in those sectors.  Jobs provided building the thing, balance of trade improvement, etc.. We mentioned that skypix would benifit from lower launch costs.  We left the paper on what technologies needed to be invested in in order to make this even easier to do.  And he asked questions on this point.  We ended by telling her that we wanted her to be aware that efforts are proceeding in this area, and that we want to make sure that the results from these efforts are not lost (much like condor, or majellan), and most importantly, we asked that she help fund further efforts along the lines of lowering the cost to LEO.  In the middle we also gave a little speal about the Lunar Resource Data  Purchase act, and the guy filed it separately, he was VERY interested in it. He asked some questions about it, and seemed like he wanted to jump on it, and contact some of the people involved with it, so something may actually happen immediatly there.  The last two things we did were to make sure that they knew that we knew a lot of people in the space arena here in town, and that they could feel free to call us any time with questions, and if we didn't know the answers, that we would see to it that they questions got to people who really did know the answers.  Then finally, we asked for an appointment with the senator herself.  He said that we would get on the list, and he also said that knowing her, this would be something that she would be very interested in, although they do have a time problem getting her scheduled, since she is only in the state 1 week out of 6 these days.  All in all we felt like we did a pretty good job.\",\"Hi there netters, I have a question I would very much like to see some discussion on: Is there such a thing as a 'justifible' war?   What I would love to see it some basis from scripture for either: \\\"All war   is wrong\\\", or \\\"Some war is justifiable\\\".   To get things started I would like to outline why I am asking the   question. In my high school days I had been quite involved in the the New   Zealand Cadet Forces (This is a bit like ROTC from what I understand of   it, but with a lot more emphasis on fun than military career training).   Through this I became extremely enamoured of flying, have become involved   in the sport of gliding, and have a great interest in military aviation   hardware as the very best a 'real' flyer could ask for. My favourite   computer games are the accurate simulations of military aircraft, both   past and present.   I became a Christian about 10 years ago, and at the time rejected all   military activity as immoral. For me, all war was in complete opposition   to God's commandments to love one another, especially one's enemies.  During the war in Iraq, I found myself with great excitement listening to   the reports of the effectiveness of the the attacks using the aviation   technology I so admire - The F117A 'Stealh' bomber, the F14, F15 and F16   strike aircraft, etc. After the war concluded I began to really enjoy   simulations based around this conflict - Great to go and bomb Saddam's   bio-weapons plants in an F117A on my computer, or shoot down some of his   Mig's in an F16. The simulation of the death of people was a wonderful   game. I imagine the real pilots view the real thing in much the same way.   One only has to look at the language used to see that the personal impact   of war is ignored: A building containing people, or an aircraft flown by a   pilot is simply a 'target'. Dead civilians are 'collateral damage'. These   euphanisms are a way of removing the reality of war from the people whose   support are necessary for the continued waging of war - One only has to   look at Vietnam to see how important public opinion is.  Now we see troops sponsored by the United Nations entering Somalia, and   the prospect of military intervention in the Muslim/Croat/Serb conflict in   the former Yugoslavia. My revulsion in particular to the siege of   Sarajevo, and in the last few days of (sorry 'bout spelling) Sebrenitsa,   has caused me to rethink where I stand on 'justifiable' war.  I will list several wars in the last 50 years I can look at each, and say   - Yes this may have been justifible, this may not. These are simply my gut   reactions to each - In many cases with the benefit of the impartiality   history brings. Let me go through a few and state some of my reasons for   my reaction - I am not a historian, so excuse any historical blunders, I   am working from popular history as it is known in New Zealand.  1. The Second World War  - Murder of Jews - Hitler had to be stopped.  - Massive civilian casualties on both sides    - Dresden, Hiroshima/Nagasaki  - Probably justifiable.  2. Korean war  - Political expansionism by North Korea, basically    communism vs. capitalism.  - Probably not justifiable.  3. Vietnam  - As above, worsened by US involvement.  4. Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia.  - Genocide by Khmer Rouge.  - Probably justifiable.  5. Iraq (Desert Storm)  - Political expansionism, threat to world oil supply  - Other factors such as genocide.  - Not sure, but probably justifiable  6. A future involvement in Bosnia  - Genocide - so called 'Ethnic Cleansing'  - Emotive - much TV coverage of atrocities and civilian casualties.  - Probably justifiable  7. Possible future use of nuclear weapons - tactical or strategic,   somewhere in the world by the US in response to someone else - e.g. Libya   or Israel.  - My feelings in this are simple  - Nuclear war/weapons are abhorrent  - I love the New Zealand government's stand on banning all nuclear    armed or powered warships from NZ port.  - Never justifiable.  These are my own views, I have looked at scripture, and I am confused. I   would appreciate others view, particularly those based on scripture. I   *don't* want a - Naaahh, yer wrong - I think answers 8-).

It is     disingeneous to compare their death to that of athletes in Munich    or any other act of terrorism or mrder.  This exercise is aimed     solely at diverting the issue and is far from the truth.  I agree that the death of three soldiers on a patrol etc... is not terrorism.  That having been said, lets continue.     [snip]    imagine ????  It is NOT a \\\"terrorist camp\\\" as you and the Israelis like     to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer    in the streets, women preparing lunch, men playing cards, etc.....  I would not argue that all or even most of the villages are \\\"terrorist camps\\\".  There are however some which come very close to serving that purpose and that is not to say that other did not function in that way prior to the invasion.      SOME young men, usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members of    the Lebanese resistance.  Even the inhabitants of the village do not     know who these are, they are secretive about it, but most people often    suspect who they are and what they are up to.  These young men are    supported financially by Iran most of the time.  They sneak arms and    ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps    for Israeli patrols.  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured    by these traps, Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages    of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians.  Once they    are back they announce that they bombed a \\\"terrorist  hideout\\\" where    an 8 year old girl just happened to be.  Some of the villages, and yours might well be among them, are as you describe.  Not all are.  There are a large number of groups in the area, backed by various organizations, with a wide range of purposes.  Hizbollah and Amal were two of the larger ones and may still be.  As to retaliation, while mistakes may be made, that is still a far cry from indiscriminate bombing, which would have produced major casualties.     Israel's retalliation policy is cold hearted, but a reality that    we have come to accept and deal with, the Lebanese Resistance    on the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING     ISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw, this is the only real     leverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw.  Well, here we disagree.  I think that Israel would willingly withdraw if the Lebanese gov't was able to field a reliable force in the area to police it and prevent further attacks.     This is the only realistic solution, it is time for Israel to    realize that the concept of a \\\"buffer zone\\\" aimed at protecting    its northern cities has failed.  In fact it has caused much more    Israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel    would have resulted in.    Actually that is not clear at all.  I will agree that the death toll is no longer civilian and now primarily military though.     There seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese    goovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such     circumstances, and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is    capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did    in all other parts of Lebanon.  No, the Syrian gov't is more than happy to have Israel sink into another Lebanese morass.  I could elaborate if necessary.     I agree, only in the case of the Isareli soldiers their killing    CANNOT be qualified as murder, no matter what you say.  No, but it is regretable, as is the whole situation. \",\"Subject says it all :)  I'm looking for the jumper settings for an SMS OMTI 8610 AT-bus ESDI  controller card.

That leaves Germany, Japan and the UK as examples of a country where the right wing government is on the verge of collapse. Oh and of course the USA which just elected a socialist government :-)   Etc, unfortunately you can't pin this on the left or the right, both are to blame. Both sides are equally deep into the corruption scandal. The only  untained party is the northern league which is a bunch of nationalist separatists and the communist party which has collapsed.    Ed should take a look at the budget deficit Regan and Bush created together before he starts to make claims about europe collapsing based on the budget deficits here. None of them are serious on the USA scale.  And here in Europe we have zero interest in Ed-Ipser type freed thank you. We do not want our countries to be run by a narrow elite of rich lawyers for the benefit of the super wealthy. We are quite happy with social  democracy and despite the fuss made in Time and Newsweek there is remarkably little being done to reverse the social welfare reforms brought in by socialism.  The problem with socialism is that it started with the aims of free education and health care and provision of the welfare state. This has been achieved across the whole of Europe, only the USA is struggling to catch up. The problem for socialism is what to do now it has succeeded.    Ed starts to discus LA, presumably he thinks that it is in Europe. On the other hand he most probably hasn't heard of a European city.   Rather the opposite. What is happening in Italy is that the communist party has collapsed. This has meant that the grand coalition between right and left wing parties to keep out the communists has also collapsed. The  magistrates have seized this opportunity to crack down hard on fraud and  corruption and have arrested half the politicians. The fact that the socialists are in charge this week is incidental, the right is into the corruption just as baddly.  What looks likely to happen is the fringe parties are going to do much better in the next election. Most of the parliamentary deputies are going to get replaced and the parties are going to be forced to look to people who are free of any hint of corruption.

The first was made into the title post of a new thread, \\\"Is Dean Kaflowitz terminally irony-impaired?\\\" and the second, more serious one appeared along the thread  \\\"A Chaney Post, and a Challenge, reissued and revised\\\"  both only in talk.abortion, but I am posting its contents into talk.religion.misc as soon as I exit here.  This should be enough for us to thrash out for the next week or so.  The second post really grapples with the main bones of contention between us. The first is more lighthearted and tells about such things as  KaflowitzDebatingPoints [tm], which he continues to rack up on both talk.abortion and talk.religion.misc, while setting follow-ups to  talk.abortion alone.  His lame excuse for the latter policy is that he gets a prompt as to where to set follow-ups, and does not follow talk.religion.misc much; this suggests that he is being hypocritical in not also setting his Newsgroups line to talk.abortion alone.\",\"heat This tops the cold-hearted bastard list!

Now, if a slave is considered # # an intermediate good, then the slave has now been dehumanized and is  # # simply a machine. Not good for the anti-slave (i.e. pro-human rights)  # # argument. So, slaves are humans, and they produce labor.  #  # Sorry.  The question of defining slave \\\"labor\\\" is no \\\"tough(er)\\\" than  # defining the \\\"labor\\\" of a horse, an ox, or any other livestock.  Both # legally and economically in a slave-economy, \\\"slaves are (NOT) humans,\\\"   # they are livestock.  Can you provide some evidence that the slave states regarded slaves as not humans?  They were \\\"outside our society\\\" and similar phrases that basically meant that they didn't have to recognized as having the same rights as a free person, but they were never considered \\\"not human\\\" to my knowledge.  # Like a horse that pulls a plow, a slave's \\\"labor\\\" is the return on the # capital required to purchase and feed him.  The parallel is so obvious # I'm not sure how you missed it.  After all, its was the \\\"liberty\\\" to  # use their \\\"property\\\" as they saw fit that motivated Southern planters # to emphasize the importance of \\\"states' rights.\\\"  If that were the case, the slave states would not have passed so many laws that restricted the freedom of slave owners to do as they wished with their property.

Why do you say that? It sounds like you're suggesting  Bill James had something to do with overhyping the kid to death. Au contraire; he was fairly critical of him after his ROY campaign, noting that he wasn't all-world as a catcher or a hitter. He called him basically average when everyone *else* in the media was predicting the next Johnny Bench or Roy Campanella.      Which reports are those?      I like Hernandez a lot, but if Piazza can catch the ball, you've gotta play him IMHO. He's a much better hitter, although Hernandez isn't a *bad* hitter. Right now, it sounds like Piazza will catch most of the time and Hernandez will be Candiotti's caddy since he can catch the knuckler. As long as they play up to their abilities, the Dodgers could have a very good catching tandem.       I think both are overrated defensively (see Nichols' Law of catcher defense), but that's something that's difficult to prove or disprove from your viewpoint or mine. About the only tangible thing we can look at is opponent's SB%, and that's clouded by how well your pitchers hold runners. Catchers ERA is a possibility, but it's subject to way too many biases.     As for them 'playing on a team that is not so much in need of another big bat', I disagree here too. About the only chink in the Braves' armor is that they're weak offensively at several positions (CF, C, 2B, SS if Belliard plays, 1B unless Bream and Hunter form another super-platoon) and very weak  defensively if Blauser plays. I'd like to see the Braves give at least one of Mel Nieves, Javy Lopez or Chipper Jones a shot, but much like the talent-rich Jays of recent years they'll be conservative and stick with what they have.  I'm not saying that's wrong, just conservative.   \",\"  Was it Pascal, or maybe Descartes, who first used this figure of speech?

From the March 1993 \\\"Aero Vision\\\" (The newsletter for the Employees of McDonnell Douglas Aerospace at Huntington Beach, California).      SPACE CLIPPERS LAUNCHED SUCCESSFULLY      \\\"On Monday, March 15 at noon, Quest Aerospace Education, Inc.   launched two DC-Y Space Clippers in the mall near the cafeteria.   The first rocket was launched by Dr. Bill Gaubatz, director and   SSTO program manager, and the second by Air Force Captain Ed   Spalding, who with Staff Sgt. Don Gisburne represents Air Force   Space Command, which was requested by SDIO to assess the DC-X for   potential military operational use.  Both rocket launches were   successful.  The first floated to the ground between the cafeteria   and Building 11, and the second landed on the roof of the   cafeteria.      Quest's Space Clipper is the first flying model rocket of the   McDonnell Douglas DC-X.  The 1/122nd semi-scale model of the   McDonnell Douglas Delta Clipper has an estimated maximum altitude   of 300 feet.  The Space Clippers can be used in educational   settings to teach mathematics and science, as well as social   studies and other applications.  The Space Clipper is available   either in the $35 Space Clipper outfit, which includes everything   needed for three launches, or as individual rockets for $12 each.   Both are available through hobby shops or by calling 1-800-858-   7302.\\\"    By the way -- this is not an endorsement to buy the product nor is it an advertisement to buy the product.

Advice from a grad student.   I agree with the gentlemen who wrote the comment before me. The important thing is pick what ever interest you the most and  learn as much as possible about it.     In my five years of education in this field, though brief  compare to alot of people, I had to think about this kind of  question a lot.  Did I make the right decision in going into Electrical Engineering as opposed to Computer engineering or CS?  The more I go thru school, the more I believe that this kind of question is irrelevant.      I have come to believe that choosing CS because one  does not like hardware or choosing hardware because one does not like to program is really doing an injustice of building and computer and making it useful for something.  Everything is interwoven and inseparable.  CS, CE, and EE are all a  part of a really great discipline and do depend on each other.   My advice is don't limit yourself, but make a decision based on which major will give you the best opportunities to  learn.  That of course depends on the curriculum at your  persective school.  I would choose a major that allows me to explore as much as possible.  Beside, I don't know why the school would make a student choose a major before her/his sophamore year.                     Hey you may be so interested in this field that you  decided to learn all about the making of computers in which  case, you suffer a little more and go to grad school.   About the money.  Don't look at the averages, if you are good, you are going to earn more money than anyone else.  If you are a superstar programmer, you will earn millions.

EDT                  Q   Why was the 10:00 a.m. postponed?                  MS. MYERS:  Just due to scheduling conflicts.  So as we  put out, the President will meet with the leaders of the national  police organizations at 2:00 p.m. in the Rose Garden, as opposed to  10:00 a.m.  The only other things on his schedule today are:  At  11:00 a.m. he'll meet with General Vessey, who, as you know, is on  his way to Vietnam to continue working on the MIA-POW issue.  At  12:30 p.m. he'll have lunch with the Vice President in the Oval  Office.  And at 2:00 p.m. he'll meet with the police organizations. Then from 3:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. he'll do his weekly photos with the  various groups.              Q   A photo op with Vessey?              MS. MYERS:  There's no coverage on the Vessey meeting.              Q   Why?              MS. MYERS:  Why?  It's a closed meeting.                Q   What about the lunch?              MS. MYERS:  The lunch?  No, there's no coverage.              Q   Is he meeting with any congress people today?              MS. MYERS:  Nothing scheduled.              Q   There are no meetings --              MS. MYERS:  There are no congressional meetings today,  no.              Q   Has the President been given any information by the  Pentagon or reached any conclusion about the validity of this report  from Hanoi?  Any instructions to Vessey on how to deal with the  Vietnamese on that subject?              MS. MYERS:  Well, clearly, the report is the first order  of business.  It's high on the agenda on something that they'll  discuss.  I think the President and General Vessey will discuss the  parameters of his visit to Vietnam today, but the President hasn't  drawn any conclusions about the report yet.  Certainly, it's  something that he wants General Vessey to talk with the Vietnamese  about first.              Q   Did the President talk with any Republican senators  yesterday about the stimulus package?              MS. MYERS:  He spoke with Senator Dole.              Q   How many times?              MS. MYERS:  I believe once during the day and once last  night.              Q   What was the outcome of that?              MS. MYERS:  They're continuing to work toward some kind  of an agreement on a jobs package.              Q   Is it your impression that Senator Dole is in any  way flexible on this?              MS. MYERS:  Well, I think we're hopeful that we're going  to get some kind of jobs package through the Senate, and we'll  continue to work with Senator Dole and others until we reach some  kind of an agreement.              Q   Did they discuss the VAT tax?              MS. MYERS:  I don't know if that came up.              Q   Can you check that?              MS. MYERS:  Sure.        Q   So what are they -- is the President offering to  scale down his program -- is that what he's trying to do, buy it down  to where Dole will sign on?              MS. MYERS:  Well, he's trying to protect as much of it  as he can.  But it's important to him to get some kind of a jobs  package through the Senate and through Congress now.  And as soon as  we reach some conclusions on that, we'll let you know.  But at the  moment, he's continuing to consult with members of Congress  including, obviously, Senator Dole.              Q   Is he talking to anybody else?              MS. MYERS:  I don't believe he talked to any other  Republicans yesterday.              Q   Is he talking to anybody today?              MS. MYERS:  I don't think anything is scheduled, but I  wouldn't rule it out.              Q   We were led to believe that the President called  Mr. Dole on the subject of Russian aid and that Bob Dole brought the  conversation around to stimulus package.  Is that correct?              MS. MYERS:  I think the President has contacted several  people on Russian aid.  I think that it was always expected that the  stimulus package or the jobs package will be part of any conversation  he would have with Senator Dole.  The primary objective of the  conversation was Russian aid.  That was the first order of business,  but it was both.              Q   In the President's mind, are they linked  politically in that if the Republicans continue to reject the  stimulus package, he thinks it will be harder to sell Russian aid to  the American people?  Has he made that argument?              MS. MYERS:  I can't talk about specifically what  arguments he might have made.  The President is obviously committed  to both.  He liked to see a jobs package to the American people  first.  But as you know, we outlined the details of additional  Russian aid last night in Tokyo.              Q   But does the President believe that the stimulus  package will make it more difficult to persuade Americans to vote for  Russian -- to accept a vote for Russian aid?              MS. MYERS:  I think that the President is going to  continue to work to pass the stimulus package, to pass a jobs  package, and we're still hopeful that we'll get some kind of jobs  package through the Congress.              Q   Is it fair to say that the President is negotiating  now with Dole?              MS. MYERS:  He's discussing options with him.              Q   On the stimulus, is it your understanding that over  the break some Democrats, themselves, have left the support that they  had earlier for the package, the stimulus package?              MS. MYERS:  I think we still have wide support in the  Senate for the jobs package.              Q   But specifically, that you've lost Democrats other  than Shelby?              MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so.  There hasn't been a  vote.              Q   What about Kohl?              Q   Kohl and Feingold?              MS. MYERS:  There hasn't been a vote yet.  And we'll  continue to work with senators to try to get a majority to try to  bring the package to a vote, because we believe that a majority of  the members of the United States Senate support the package.              Q   If you're weren't worried about Kohl and Feingold,  why did George mention Milwaukee projects the other day?              MS. MYERS:  I think George pointed out a number of  projects in a number of states that stand to be funded, or to lose  funding if this jobs package doesn't pass.              Q   No Democrats.  (Laughter.)              MS. MYERS:  I'll let you draw your own conclusions.              Q   Does he plan to talk to Dole again today or any  other Republicans again today?              MS. MYERS:  There's nothing specifically scheduled, but  again, I wouldn't rule it out.              Q   Does he plan to put out any more press releases to  any other states today?              MS. MYERS:  What we've done is we're in the process of  breaking down the benefits of the jobs package state by state.  I  think it's entirely feasible that as we sort of are able to sum those  up, we'll send out press releases to the various states that suggest  how their states would benefit from this package.              Q   Will you share those with us?              MS. MYERS:  Sure.  As we did yesterday.              Q   Do you have copies of the ones you sent --              MS. MYERS:  Yes, we made those available yesterday.  And  we certainly can continue to provide them today.              Q   Dee Dee, since yesterday's questions and subsequent  stories about the VAT, what further consideration of this issue has  been given?              MS. MYERS:  Nothing's changed since yesterday.  I think  the President commented on it this morning to say only that it was  something he knew was being considered by the task force and that he  has not made a decision on, and I don't think we have anything to add  to that.              Q   But he also said that business and labor groups are  telling him they support it.  Can you tell us --              MS. MYERS:  I think that there has been -- I'm not going  to speculate on who supports it.  I think the President said that  there has been some support among business and labor groups.  I don't  think he said he was directly contacted by them.              Q   Are we to take that to mean that the administration  has sounded out business and labor groups on this --              MS. MYERS:  I think there's been plenty of public  discourse on this over the years and even recently, but I don't think  I want to add to that.              Q   In February, though, the President said that this  was something to be considered 10 or 15 years down the road.  What  has happened between then and now to cause this administration to  change its mind?              MS. MYERS:  I think as we said yesterday, it is  something that the working groups are looking at.  They're  considering a wide variety of options on everything from funding to  specific options that will be covered by the President's health care  plan.  The President has not taken it up yet, has not made a decision  on it.  And beyond that, I don't have anything to add.              Q   You haven't answered the question.  It wasn't being  considered by anyone in the White House after the President's  comments in February, and George reaffirmed that in a briefing.              Q   And then suddenly --              Q   What happened?        MS. MYERS:  The working groups, as we have said  throughout, we instructed to consider a wide variety of options  across-the-board.  And one of the things that has been talked about  and that they are clearly considering is some kind of a value-added  tax.        Q   But the President himself took this off the table,  Dee Dee, and suddenly it reappears.  And this goes to the credibility  of this administration in a way.  What has happened in the meantime?        MS. MYERS:  The President has not looked at this, it  hasn't been presented to him, again, yet.  The working groups are  looking at it, as they're looking at a wide variety of options, and  no decisions have been made.        Q   And it raises the question of how independently the  task force is working.        MS. MYERS:  The task force was instructed to consider  all options, and they've taken that mandate seriously and they're  considering all options.        Q   But that's not the impression that the President  left in February.  The impression he left was that this was something  that was long-range, to be looked at 10, 15 years down the road.  The  clear implication of his remarks was that this was something that was  not on the table, not an option.         Q   \\\"If it changes I'll tell you.\\\"              Q   Bring him on.        Q   And you repeatedly referred to the President's  remarks, telling us that those were still in operation.              MS. MYERS:  It's changed, and we told you.  (Laughter.)              Q   But that's what Alice Rivlin's comments and Donna  Shalala comments were about.  I mean, that seemed like an  orchestrated effort because you have two independent Cabinet officers  --        MS. MYERS:  I wouldn't -- no, Alice Rivlin's not a  Cabinet member, first of all.  Second of all, it was not  orchestrated, but clearly, they both said yesterday and in the last  couple of days that it's something that's being looked at.  We  confirmed that yesterday.  And I don't have anything to add to that.        Q   Is it because he has very few options?        Q   Is this something that it will be incumbent upon  the task force to convince the President about?  In other words, has  the President himself personally ruled it out and it's now up to the  task force to convince him to put it back on the table?  Or is it, in  fact, back on the table, having been placed there by discussions with  the President?          MS. MYERS:  It is not the working group's mission at  this point to convince the President of anything.  It is their  mission to put before him his options and to explain the benefits and  the costs and the basic pros and cons of each of those options.  I  think that they will certainly present the VAT to him in that  context, and at this point he's not -- that presentation has not been  made, but it's something that he will hear and he has not made a  decision on.        Q   They will present it to him as one of his options,  though he specifically ruled it out?        MS. MYERS:  Correct.        Q   Dee Dee, is this more than a trial balloon?  Is  this a serious consideration that the working groups are giving to  this form of taxation?        MS. MYERS:  It's simply a statement of fact.  The  working groups are considering a wide variety of options on a number  of issues relating to health care reform.  One of the options that  they're looking at is the VAT.         Q   Dee Dee, when the working groups were examining  this possibility, was this on the table during the same time period  that you were telling us that it was not?        MS. MYERS:  I don't know what the specific timing of  their drafting of options is.  I don't know.        Q   Who was telling you that it was not under  consideration?        MS. MYERS:  I was referring back to the President's  comments.        Q   Have they discovered that the sin taxes won't raise  enough money to fund the core benefit package?        MS. MYERS:  No, there's no decisions that have been made  on how to pay for the health care plan.              Q   I'm asking whether the projections --              MS. MYERS:  There's a number of options depending on how  the plan is structured.  You can't decide how much the plan is going  to cost until you decide what the plan is going to look like.  And so  you can't discuss what financing options have been ruled in our out  until you know.        Q   Dee Dee, we've been told that they have a computer  models on a number of possible packages.        MS. MYERS:  Correct.          Q   The question is whether they have now determined  whether sin taxes would not produce enough money for even the barest  minimum package.  That is not a very difficult computation.        MS. MYERS:  It is a question that you know that we're  not going to answer until -- there's a number of options being  considered.  It depends on how the package is structured.  The exact  details of the package and the financing mechanisms used to pay for  them are all among the decisions that have yet to be made.                Q   And when the President has been meeting with health  care -- his health care advisors, which we are told he has been doing  --              MS. MYERS:  Correct.              Q      they have never once said to him, these are your  funding options, including the VAT?  He has never heard the word VAT  in his --              MS. MYERS:    I am not going to comment on the specific  nature of the daily -- they're not daily, but the quasi-regular  briefings.              Q   Well, you have.              MS. MYERS:  I have not, other than to say that he's not  considered the VAT.  And I think that is a true statement.              Q   No, but you said that it has not been presented to  him as an option.              MS. MYERS:  Correct.              Q   That doesn't mean he hasn't heard about it.              MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to get into the details of  what's discussed.  I think that statement stands for itself.              Q      specific, Dee Dee.  When you say he hasn't  looked at it, do you mean that he hasn't looked at it in terms of  paying for medical coverage, or hasn't looked at it in general?   Because back in Chilicothe he was very specific in defining how it  works, what the advantages are, the whole thing.  It sounds like --              MS. MYERS:  But that was -- I think in Chilicothe, if  you go back to his remarks there, it was a broader philosophical  discussion of the tax structure.  And I think the comments were  generally in reference to the overall economic plan.  But clearly,  it's something that he's thought about in the broad context.  I mean,  that was clear in Chilicothe.  What I'm saying is that in the process  of the working groups it's something that he hasn't considered yet.   It's something that the working groups will present to him among the  number of options, and that no decisions have been made.  And I'm not  going to comment any further on the details of the meetings where  health care issues are being discussed.              Q   It's your statement from this podium that no  discussion of this has taken place.  You say that no option -- that  the option has not been presented to him.              MS. MYERS:  That is correct.              Q   Do you stand by -- does the White House still stand  by George's statement in March that this will not be in the proposal?              MS. MYERS:  No decisions have been made.  We have  nothing to add to what's already been said.              Q   Let me follow up here.  Do you stand by what Rivlin  said yesterday, that if any kind of VAT were to be used or  considered, that other changes to the tax code would have to be made  so that it would be less regressive?              MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to comment any further on what  might happen if.              Q   But do you stand by the previous conversations in  February that if there were to be a VAT, I think the President said  you'd exclude food and energy --              MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to comment on the specific  structure of a decision that hasn't been made.              Q   Was the President aware prior to Donna Shalala's  comments yesterday that this was under consideration by the working  groups?              MS. MYERS:  I don't know specifically what --              Q   Could you check for us, because that's a real  important credibility question?              MS. MYERS:  Sure.              Q   Since the task force was brought together this  issue has been discussed, at the beginning and throughout, as one  fairly painless way to raise a lot of money.  Were you all kept in  the dark?  Was the Press Office kept in the dark over the past month  and a half when you've been denying that a VAT tax would be  considered that it was actually on the table over there as an option?              MS. MYERS:  I think we've said all that we have to say.   It is something the working groups are looking at.  The President has  not made a decision about it yet.  And beyond that, I have nothing to  add.              Q   Well, sorry, Dee Dee, there are still a couple of  questions that we are going to have to ask because we have a problem  with credibility here -- yours primarily.  What we're asking is, if  you all were not told at all that this thing was being considered  while you were coming out here and telling us that it was not, or if  it's a case that you were coming out here and deliberately misleading  us.              MS. MYERS:  I don't believe that anyone has ever come  out here and deliberately misled you from this podium -- ever --ever.              Q   Has anyone tried to shade it a little bit to  indicate something -- has anybody told anybody to come out --              MS. MYERS:  We're not trying to shade answers or  deliberately mislead anybody.  I've said what I have to say about  this issue.              Q   All we were trying to find out --              MS. MYERS:  I understand what you're trying to find out  and I've given you the answers, Helen.              Q   We're trying to find out what changed -- what made  it an option again.  That's the --              MS. MYERS:  The working groups were given a broad  mandate to investigate all options, and they are doing that.                Q   Yes, but it wasn't an option before.  How can you  investigate it if the President has taken it off the table?              MS. MYERS:  It is something that they're obviously  considering and the President has not made a decision on.              Q   Yes, but he took it off the table in February.              MS. MYERS:  Working groups are considering it.  They'll  present it to the President at some point and he'll make a decision.              Q   Why would they consider it if he has taken it off  the table?              MS. MYERS:  It's clearly on the table.               Q   Yes, but he took it off the table.  Did he change  his mind?              MS. MYERS:  It's back on the table, Bill.              Q   Did he change his mind?              MS. MYERS:  He said this morning that he hasn't made a  decision about it.  He obviously knows that it's on the table.  It's  something that he will look at at some and when we have a decision on  this we'll let you know.              Q   So he must have changed his mind, right?              MS. MYERS:  At some point it will be looked at.  I mean,  --              Q   Dee Dee, there's like two options -- either he  changed his mind or the working groups think they're authority  exceeds the President's.              MS. MYERS:  The working groups were given a broad  mandate to look at all options; they've done that.              Q   Are you going to put out his income tax?              MS. MYERS:  Yes, there will be something available on  his income tax probably later this afternoon.  His return will be  available.               Q   Will there be any kind of briefing to go through  it?              MS. MYERS:  No, nothing's planned.  I think someone will  be available, probably not in a briefing setting, but to walk you  through the questions.              Q   We're used to be walked line-by-line through the  presidential tax forms.              MS. MYERS:  I've seen those briefings.  (Laughter.)              Q   Could we have one?              MS. MYERS:   No, I don't think there will be any kind of  a formal briefing, but there will be somebody available to answer  your questions about it.              Q   Did they file a joint form?              MS. MYERS:  Yes.              Q   When did he file it?              MS. MYERS:  I believe it's being filed today.              Q   Dee Dee, is there going to be a backgrounder for  Miyazawa?              MS. MYERS:  No, there will be a readout after the  meeting.              Q   No backgrounder today?              MS. MYERS:  No backgrounder today.              Q   This is complicated stuff.  We need help.   (Laughter.)              MS. MYERS:  We can't give you taxes and Miyazawa all in  one day, it's too confusing.  (Laughter.)              Q   Vance and Owen have opened the doors on the use of  force in Bosnia.   They've both said that, A, they never ruled it  out, and B, it might be necessary now.  Does that influence your  thinking on whether or not to change your approach?              MS. MYERS:  There's been no change in our policy towards  Bosnia.  We have always said that we'd consider --              Q   But does that impact upon your decision?  Are they  people whose opinions would carry weight with you?              MS. MYERS:  They're people whose opinions carry weight  certainly.  I mean, the President supports the process that they've  initiated.  But there's been no change in our policy for Bosnia,  although we're considering a number of options right now.  If the  Serbs don't come back to the negotiating table, if they don't sign on  to some kind of an agreement, we will consider additional options,  which we've been saying regularly.              Q   One follow-up question then?  We cannot get a  straight answer from anyone in the administration.  Why do you not  set a deadline for the Serbs?  Can you tell us the strategic or  tactical reasons for not giving them a deadline to come to the table?              MS. MYERS:  We're continuing to put pressure on them  every day.              Q   Which doesn't work so --              MS. MYERS:  Well, we think it is having some effect.   We're going to continue to tighten sanctions.  As you know, we  support the omnibus resolution.  We expect that to come to a vote on  the 26th.                Q   You say it's having an effect -- can you give us  any documentation?              MS. MYERS:  I'd be happy to provide somebody to talk to  you about the impact of the sanctions and things like that.              Q   There's been no -- you have not been able to  provide anybody who can tell us that the sanctions have had any  effect in Bosnia.  Serbia, yes; in Bosnia, no.              MS. MYERS:  I think that they've had effect in Serbia  and we think they've had some effect in Bosnia.  And again, I'll be  happy to provide somebody to walk you through the details of that, if  you'd like.              Q   We would like to hear from someone who can show us  what the effect has been in Bosnia.  We had the briefing on all of  the terrible things that are happening in Belgrade, but we haven't  seen anything that indicates an impact on the fighting.  Can you  provide something along those lines?              MS. MYERS:  I will see what I can get you.              Q   On the extra Russian aid that Christopher announced  this morning -- where is that money coming from?              MS. MYERS:  We'll have to work with Congress on the  details of that package.              Q   So that would be new money that you would hope to  get?              MS. MYERS:    Yes, that's new money, in addition to the  $1.6 billion announced in Vancouver.  So I assume that you all have  seen the $1.8-billion package that was announced this morning in  Tokyo by Secretary Christopher.              Q   Isn't there a concern, though, about offering  something which you have to get in Congress?  I mean, that was the  concern with Vancouver; you didn't want to do that.              MS. MYERS:  The concern with Vancouver was to do  something immediately, which required money that was already approved  in the Fiscal '93 budget.  What we're looking at now is a little bit  longer-term plan to build on top of the $1.6 billion that we  announced in Vancouver.  This clearly will require congressional  approval, or some of it will anyway, and we're going to continue to  work with Congress to make that happen.              Q   To what extent has that been vetted or agreed to by  Congress?              MS. MYERS:  The President has had a number of  conversations with members and will continue to work with them as  this process moves forward.              Q   Was Christopher able to put this package out with a  fair degree of understanding that you will be able to get it through  Congress?              MS. MYERS:  It was created in consultation with  Congress.              Q   In meeting with the law enforcement officials, is  that -- does that have a set speech and a goal?  A direction?              MS. MYERS:  Yes, the President will talk about -- and  the law enforcement organizations are endorsing the President's jobs  package.  They believe particularly the summer jobs package will help  give kids something to do.              Q   Who are they?              MS. MYERS:  It's members or leadership from three  organizations:  NAPO, which is the National Association of Police  Organizations; IBPO, which is the International Brotherhood of Police  Organizations, I believe; and IUPA, which is the International Union  of Police Associations.              Q   Will the FBI chief be there?              MS. MYERS:  The FBI chief?  No.              Q   Or any other federal law enforcement officials?              MS. MYERS:  No, it will be the President and these  national law enforcement organization leaders.              Q   Does the $1.8 billion announced today include the  $400 million that's in the FY '94 budget for disarmament?              MS. MYERS:  No.  The Nunn-Lugar money is separate.              Q   So this would be the $700 million that's in the  budget already, plus another $1.1 billion?              MS. MYERS:  I believe all of this is on top of the $700  million already in the budget.              Q   Is this going to be part of the supplemental or  Fiscal '94 --              MS. MYERS:  We'll work with Congress on the exact  funding mechanism -- on exactly how this will be paid for.              Q   This $1.8 billion on top of --              MS. MYERS:  On top of $700 million -- on top of the $400  million Nunn-Lugar money we announced earlier.              Q   And this is what prompted the President to call Bob  Dole -- it was on this tranche, not on the previous money he was  calling Bob Dole?              MS. MYERS:  Correct.              Q   Is there a briefing on Miyazawa?              MS. MYERS:  There will be a readout after the meeting  with Miyazawa.  Tomorrow.              Q   Dee Dee, on a totally unrelated matter, some  Republicans who are active in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are  complaining about this new cozy relationship between the White House  and the Chamber of Commerce.  There are -- the town hall meeting the  other night, the satellite and all of this relationship. Does the White House feel that you're getting too close to these  Chambers of Commerce?              MS. MYERS:  That's an interesting charge.  (Laughter.)   After how many years of Democrats being accused of not paying any  attention to the Chambers, now there are those who would accuse us of  being too close.  I think that's interesting.  But no, we're thrilled  by the support we've received from the national Chamber and local  Chambers across the country and we'll continue to work with them on  this and other initiatives.              Q   What's the status of the President thinking about  going to this Democratic retreat?              MS. MYERS:  It's on his calendar.  I think he'll almost  certainly go.              Q   All three days?              MS. MYERS:  We haven't figured out exactly when he'll be  there yet.                Q   Is it open to coverage?              MS. MYERS:  No, I believe the whole thing is closed.              Q   Is he going to have any kind of address, statement,  anything at all on the gay rights march on the 25th?              MS. MYERS:  We're still looking at that.  We haven't  made a final decision about how we'll -- who will make a statement or  what --              Q   Any meetings scheduled with any of the leaders?              MS. MYERS:  Nothing is scheduled, but I wouldn't rule it  out.              Q   What about an AIDS czar?              MS. MYERS:  It's coming.              Q   Anything on the weekend?              Q   There's been a suggestion that he's going to this  retreat to avoid having to participate in the gay rights -- or appear  or have any involvement in the gay rights march.              MS. MYERS:  No, I think this is something he's been  discussing for a long time -- appearing at the Senate Democratic  retreat.              Q   The weekend?              MS. MYERS:  Weekend?  Don't know -- the only thing on  right now is the radio address on Saturday.              Q   Any travel plans?              MS. MYERS:  If it changes -- none right now.              Q   He's not going to be off campaigning for his  stimulus package?              MS. MYERS:  No specific plans right now.              Q   What about mid-week?  Anything likely?              MS. MYERS:  It's possible.  Yes, I think it's likely  that we'll travel next week -- certainly the weekend.              Q   Has he called Thurmond about his daughter?              MS. MYERS:  I don't know.  I'll check.              Q   Going to name a drug czar this weekend?              MS. MYERS:  This weekend?  I don't believe so.              Q   And the radio address on Saturday -- is that going  to be focused on the stimulus package?              MS. MYERS:  I'm sure it will.

Some Christian churches claimed to be located at the final resting places of Peter, Mark, and other saints, but no one ever claimed to possess the body of Mary, the greatest of the saints. Why? Because everyone knew that she had been taken up into heaven.  Although there is no definitive scriptural proof for the assumption of Mary, some passages seem suggestive, like the passage in Revelation that describes a woman giving birth to a Son and later being crowned in the heavens. Of course, the woman in this passage has other interpretations; she can also be taken a symbol for the Church.  The assumption of Mary makes sense because of her relationship to Christ.  Jesus, perfect God and perfect man, fulfilled the requirements of the law perfectly.  Under the law God gave to us, we are to honor our mother and father, and Christ's act of taking his mother into heaven is part of his fulfillment of that law. Also, he took his flesh from her, so it seems appropriate that he decide not to allow her flesh to rot in the grave.  One last point: an ex-Catholic attempted to explain Catholic doctrine on the assumption by asserting it is connected to a belief that Mary did not die. This is not a correct summary of what Catholics believe. The dogma of the assumption was carefully phrased to avoid saying whether Mary did or did not die. In fact, the consensus among Catholic theologians seems to be that Mary in fact did die. This would make sense: Christ died, and his Mother, who waited at the foot of the cross, would want to share in his death.\",\"  Sigh.

First is that the way the sun was shining in Miami, it had a summer atmosphere in early spring for baseball.

I will admit I am a football fan first but I still enjoy baseball. It was interesting because most of these fans are only accustomed to the Miami Dolphins.  The way they were cheering, I thought it was the AFC playoffs.

Madness.  /* Written  4:34 pm  Apr 16, 1993 by cpr@igc.apc.org in igc:mideast.forum */ /* ---------- \\\"From Israeli press. Madness.\\\" ---------- */ FROM THE ISRAELI PRESS.  Paper: Zman Tel Aviv (Tel Aviv's time). Friday local Tel Aviv's paper, affiliated with Maariv.  Date: 19 February 1993  Journalist: Guy Ehrlich  Subject: Interview with soldiers who served in the Duvdevan (Cherry) units, which disguise themselves as Arabs and operate within the occupied territories.  Excerpts from the article:  \\\"A lot has been written about the units who disguise themselves as Arabs, things good and bad, some of the falsehoods. But the most important problem of those units has been hardly dealt with. It is that everyone who serves in the Cherry, after a time goes in one way or another insane\\\".  A man who said this, who will here be called Danny (his full name is known to the editors) served in the Cherry. After his discharge from the army he works as delivery boy. His pal, who will here be called Dudu was also serving in the Cherry, and is now about to depart for a round-the-world tour. They both look no different from average Israeli youngsters freshly discharged from conscript service. But in their souls, one can notice something completely different....It was not easy for them to come out with disclosures about what happened to them. And they think that to most of their fellows from the Cherry it woundn't be easy either. Yet after they began to talk, it was nearly impossible to make them stop talking. The following article will contain all the horror stories recounted with an appalling openness.  (...) A short time ago I was in command of a veteran team, in which some of the fellows applied for release from the Cherry. We called such soldiers H.I. 'Hit by the Intifada'. Under my command was a soldier who talked to himself non-stop, which is a common phenomenon in the Cherry. I sent him to a psychiatrist. But why I should talk about others when I myself feel quite insane ? On Fridays, when I come home, my parents know I cannot be talked to until I go to the beach, surf a little, calm down and return. The keys of my father's car must be ready for in advance, so that I can go there. I they dare talk to me before, or whenever I don't want them to talk to me, I just grab a chair and smash it instantly. I know it is my nerve:  Smashing chairs all the time and then running away from home, to the car and to the beach. Only there I become normal.(...)  (...) Another friday I was eating a lunch prepared by my mother. It was an omelette of sorts. She took the risk of sitting next to me and talking to me. I then told my mother about an event which was still fresh in my mind. I told her how I shot an Arab, and how exactly his wound looked like when I went to inspect it. She began to laugh hysterically. I wanted her to cry, and she dared laugh straight in my face instead ! So I told her how my pal had made a mincemeat of the two Arabs who were preparing the Molotov cocktails. He shot them down, hitting them beautifully, exactly as they deserved. One bullet had set a Molotov cocktail on fire, with the effect that the Arab was burning all over, just beautifully. I was delighted to see it.  My pal fired three bullets, two at the Arab with the Molotov cocktail, and the third at his chum. It hit him straight in his ass. We both felt that we'd pulled off something.  Next I told my mother how another pal of mine split open the guts in the belly of another Arab and how all of us ran toward that spot to take a look. I reached the spot first. And then that Arab, blood gushing forth from his body, spits at me. I yelled: 'Shut up' and he dared talk back to me in Hebrew! So I just laughed straight in his face. I am usually laughing when I stare at something convulsing right before my eyes. Then I told him: 'All right, wait a moment'. I left him in order to take a look at another wounded Arab. I asked a soldier if that Arab could be saved, if the bleeding from his artery could be stopped with the help of a stone of something else like that. I keep telling all this to my mother, with details, and she keeps laughing straight into my face. This infuriated me. I got very angry, because I felt I was becoming mad. So I stopped eating, seized the plate with he omelette and some trimmings still on, and at once threw it over her head. Only then she stopped laughing. At first she didn't know what to say.  (...) But I must tell you of a still other madness which falls upon us frequently. I went with a friend to practice shooting on a field. A gull appeared right in the middle of the field. My friend shot it at once. Then we noticed four deer standing high up on the hill above us. My friend at once aimed at one of them and shot it. We enjoyed the sight of it falling down the rock. We shot down two deer more and went to take a look. When we climbed the rocks we saw a young deer, badly wounded by our bullet, but still trying to such some milk from its already dead mother. We carefully inspected two paths, covered by blood and chunks of torn flesh of the two deer we had hit. We were just delighted by that sight. We had hit'em so good ! Then we decided to kill the young deer too, so as spare it further suffering. I approached, took out my revolver and shot him in the head several times from a very short distance. When you shoot straight at the head you actually see the bullets sinking in.  But my fifth bullet made its brains fall outside onto the ground, with the effect of splattering lots of blood straight on us. This made us feel cured of the spurt of our madness. Standing there soaked with blood, we felt we were like beasts of prey. We couldn't explain what had happened to us. We were almost in tears while walking down from that hill, and we felt the whole day very badly.  (...) We always go back to places we carried out assignments in. This is why we can see them. When you see a guy you disabled, may be for the rest of his life, you feel you got power. You feel Godlike of sorts.\\\"  (...) Both Danny and Dudu contemplate at least at this moment studying the acting. Dudu is not willing to work in any security-linked occupation. Danny feels the exact opposite. 'Why shouldn't I take advantage of the skills I have mastered so well ? Why shouldn't I earn $3.000 for each chopped head I would deliver while being a mercenary in South Africa ?

We can just call them house Jews, fools, or anti-Semites from Jewish families.

Regarding the verses relevant to nature, I prefer to use Dr. Maurice Bucaille's translations (in his book, \\\"The Bible, the Qur'an and Science\\\") for in general his translations are more literal.   Maurice Bucaille translates the portion of the verse you are addressing as   \\\"...Each one is travelling with an orbit in its own motion.\\\"  (Also note that \\\"the celestial bodies\\\" in the first translation quoted by you above is the translator's interpolation -- it is not existent in the original Arabic, which is why it is included in brackets.)    You're right, what the verses _do_ contain isn't all that remarkable.  However, Dr. Bucaille (a surgeon, that's how he's a \\\"Dr.\\\") thinks it is significant that the above verse contains no geocentric ideas, even though geocentrism was all the rage up until the 17th century (?) or so.

The initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.  For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.  Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.  A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" has been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new, relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today.  This new technology will help companies protect proprietary information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals.   A \\\"key-escrow\\\" system will be established to ensure that the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique                                   2   \\\"keys,\\\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately in two \\\"key-escrow\\\" data bases that will be established by the Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap.  The \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans.  To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings.  The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield criminals and terrorists.  We need the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" and other approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system), the President has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:       --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to           employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;       --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone           calls and data, under proper court or other legal           order, when necessary to protect our citizens;       --   the effective and timely use of the most modern           technology to build the National Information           Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and           the competitiveness of American industry in the global           marketplace; and        --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export           high technology products.  The President has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.                                    3  The Administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a National Information Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks (\\\"information superhighways\\\") will transmit video, images, HDTV programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone system transmits voice.  Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law.  Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet.  The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available.

A:   No.  \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with      no new authorities to access the content of the private      conversations of Americans.  Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on      a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation      encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to      decipher the message?  A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a      court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They      would then present documentation of this authorization to      the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and      obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug      smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are      stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key      escrow system.  Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?  A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent      entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the      Administration have yet to determine which agencies will      oversee the key-escrow data banks.  Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure      how strong the security is?    A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption      systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will      remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow      system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of      cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all      potential users that there are no unrecognized      vulnerabilities.  Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?  A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the      Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in      this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the      President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet      officials.  Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?  A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on      encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify      as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have      briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the      decisions related to this initiative.  Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?  A:   The government designed and developed the key access      encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the      microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product      manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip      manufacturer that produces them.  Q:   Who provides the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\"?  A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,      California, and will sell the chip to encryption device      manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed      to other vendors in the future.  Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices?   A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating      the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" into their devices.       Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological      solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be      willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more      powerful encryption devices?  A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be      considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow      mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product      that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive      than others readily available today, but it is just one      piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to      encryption technology, which the Administration is      developing.       The Administration is not saying, \\\"since encryption      threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,      we will prohibit it outright\\\" (as some countries have      effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \\\"every      American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an      unbreakable commercial encryption product.\\\"  There is a      false \\\"tension\\\" created in the assessment that this issue is      an \\\"either-or\\\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,      and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,      balanced approach such as is proposed with the \\\"Clipper      Chip\\\" and similar encryption techniques.  Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton      Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from      that of the Bush Administration?    A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption      technology in telecommunications and computing and are      committed to working with industry and public-interest      groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'      privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law      enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime      and terrorism.  Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use      the government hardware?  A:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control      requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is      required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The      same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the      attractions of this technology is the protection it can give      to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this      in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a      case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these      devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan      to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability      of these products.         \",\" You're closer than you might imagine.

Neto):  This all sounds suspiciously like my company might have something to do with this.  Background first: Megatek has a series of framebuffers designed as X accelerators. For the most part these are designed for Sun SBUS and Sun (and other vendor's) VME systems.  That said, Megatek products support multi-screen and/or multi-display on a sigle workstation. Most of our cards have a keyboard/mouse port which can be used to provide additional displays. For example, say you hade a Sparcstation with an Sbus expansion chassis. You could put in six frambuffers, allowing a total of six screens in the system. You could then attach from 1 to 6 keyboard/mice, allowing you to mix and match any combination of screens and displays. You could have 1 6-screen display, 3 2-screen displays, 6 1-screen displays, or 1 2-screen display and 1 4-screen display. Basically any combination.  Because of this, we at Megatek try to be very careful about the use of the words multi-screen and multi-display. They are quite different in meaning, and (at least in X) have exact definitions.  The reason I ramble like this is the mention of an upper limit if 12 screens in a display. As it so happens, there's a define in the server that determines the most screens supported (server/include/misc.h, MAXSCREENS). As released my MIT, this is 3. As released by Megatek, this is 12.  As such, the most screens supported by a single Megatek display (i.e. X server) is 12. If someone construed this to be a limitation of X I'm sorry, but clearly (as pointed out so well by Mr. Neto) this is not the case.  We just did it here because nobody has ever asked us for more. Of course, I could say \\\"Buy all you want, we'll support more.\\\" -- \",\"These word processing utilities all include complete printed manuals and registration cards.

It was pointed out that XtAppInitialize() should never be called more than once.  This helped.  However, I am still having some problems.  Below is a new little test program that more closely models my real program.  In the actual program, I am writing a library, callable from any other program.

It gives police the power to put innocent people in jail because they (the police) find something they don't understand.  Most police don't know what the return key does, never mind the difference between a core file and classified military secrets.  There are plenty of scenarios where the user would have no idea what something is either.  It could be uninitialized junk.  The burden of proof is on the user to show that it's something a normal upstanding citizen should have.  No one should ever be put in that situation, especially in America.  What's disgusting about this is how easily most people go along with it, to provide a bargaining chip against some hypothetical *alleged* child molester or drug dealer, or whatever bad thing is in style at the time.  Basically most people don't have a clear distinction between criminals and suspects.  As an analogy, it's like they find a loose screw in your house, and they insist that you're building a bomb or machine gun.  They ask you where it came from (like you'd know), and ask you to prove your claim.  When you explain it in such simple terms, people may start to get the idea.  As a matter of fact, i do keep random files on my disk.  The reason is, without special-purpose hardware, it takes a long time to generate good random bits.  I have programs that crank out a couple bits per minute, which is pretty conservative, but over time that's more than i need.  If you think about it, there's no point in actually encrypting random data, because it just gives you different random data.  If you want some data to look like an encrypted file, you just put an appropriate header on it.  If enough people do this, some of them will be put in jail.  When you get arrested and the police ask for your keys, you can tell them it's just random junk, although of course they won't believe you.  While you're sitting in jail, you can take consolation in the fact that the government will burn a few CPU-years trying to find something that's not there. \",\" Don't worry about leaks.

The idea of resurrection is one which can be found in a host of different forms in the religions of antiquity.  The problem was not the resurrection which was a mediorce issue for a tiny fragment of the Jewish population  (the Saducees) but was a non issues for everyone else.  The real problem was that Christians were pacifist and preached there was only one god.  When the state operates by a system of divinitation of the emperor -  monotheism  becomes a capital offense.  The Jews were able to get exemption from this, and were also not evangelistic.  Christians were far more vocal, and gentile, and hence dangerous and were therefore targets of persecution.  Also since Christians were a relatively powerless group, they made good scapegoats as is seen by Nero's blaming them for the burning of Rome.

It was created to meet to the daily research needs of scientists  conducting climate investigations using satellite data and remote sensing techniques.        Intuitive Graphic Interface   Sphinx features an interactive interface with pop-up menus and  point-and-click dialog boxes which makes image processing and analysis simple and fast.  This accessible menuing enables you to build attractive image  layouts quickly while also providing you the flexibility of returning to the main menu to conduct other image analysis and processing operations.        Image Format Compatibility   Using smart read/write functions, Sphinx allows you to easily open and save image files in a variety of formats using bit, integer or real data values.  Sphinx also reads and writes the common TIFF and GIF formats as well as compresses and decompresses image formats to save disk space.        Image Analysis & Processing   For image and pixel analysis, the Sphinx package includes an assortment of processing tools that perform useful statistical and  mathematical filtering operations, such as Fourier transforms, convolution  product or principal component analyses. An interactive interpreter for both algebraic equations and images allows the user to manipulate and combine individual data channels interactively. Standard FORTRAN notation is used for formula entry and for trig onometric and transcendental functions.        Satellite Spectra & Orbit Analysis   Sphinx possesses functions to simulate satellite signal sensitivity for various meteorological satellites (e.g., GOES, METEOSAT, NOAA, Spot etc.). The simulations are conducted for a selection of standard atmospheric and surface conditions and instrument spectral bands. A geometry model computes the solar zenith angles, warping, orbit simulation, and 3-D image projection.        Easy External Program Interfacing   Sphinx allows users the flexibility to integrate externally developed software algorithms for processing and converting satellite observations.  Sphinx exports and imports image files and image parameters to external programs using special interface functions.        Quick Quality Presentation   Sphinx rapidly displays, manipulates, and enhances high-resolution multispectral images and color tables.  Using six 8-bit 1024x1024 image planes and one graphics plane, the package conveniently combines color images, graphics and text to generate sharp digital images for articles and reports. Sphinx's 2-D and 3-D graphics editor provides complete flexibility for modifying and integrating vector graphics and analysis plots with images, such as  histograms and radial graphs.  The package supplies color and gray scale output for standard inkjet and laser printers.  Other Capabilities Sphinx also performs image animation, external  graphics importing, mosaic fitting... what else?        Software Support & Development    Sphinx was developed at the Laboratoire d'Optique Atmospherique (LOA)  of the Universite de Lille, France. The package has received critical feedback and support from scientists at the French national laboratory, Centre National de Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), and the French space agency, Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES). At LOA, Sphinx undergoes continued refinement and development to meet changing research needs and advances in computer technology.  The package, which features on-line help, is supported by an Internet address   sphinx@loasil.citilille.fr through which questions can be answered and  version updates provided without delay.        Performance Tested    CNES has selected Sphinx to analyze and process the satellite data  collected during the upcoming ADEOS/POLDER satellite mission.  Today, the Sphinx package is in use at the NASA - Goddard Space Flight Center and is widely used in many French laboratories, including the Centre de Recherche en Physique de l'Environnement, Ecole Normale Superieure , Laboratoire d' Etudes et de Recherches en Teledetection Spatiale,  Laboratoire  de Meteorologie Dynamique.      A TEST VERSION OF SPHINX IS AVAILABLE AT loasil.citilille.fr    (134.206.50.4) anonymous (bin : cd SPHINX : get ALL_SPHINX.tar.Z)     IN THE TEST VERSION THE OUTPUT FILES ARE DISABLE.

Bourke also directed the NT  translation in the New American Bible.  He noted \\\"...certain practices have  been introduced into the Mass in such a manner that an atmosphere of banality,  and sometimes of hilarity, has trivialized the liturgy.\\\"  I note that at my  parents' parish on Easter, helium filled balloons were distributed at the  offertory, apparently to aid in understanding the word \\\"risen\\\".

In some environments (entry level R3000 Indigo w/ 4.0.5) all windows are getting properly connected to their designated color maps, but on others (an IRIS 4D 240/GTX; also a different entry level Indigo) the color mapping is unreliable and changes behavior when I compile at different times.  The most common problem is that all non-top-level windows fail to be displayed according to their colormap.  My application starts out by creating three top-level windows; in some cases all but the first of these also fail to be displayed by their colormap.  This is spectacularly aggravating.

Please let me know if you know any other tools, or if you have information or opinions on these ones, and I will update this FAQ.  I am especially interested in getting reviews of these products from people who have evaluated them or are using them.

TYPING MANAGEMENT TOOLS: these aim to help you manage your keyboard use, by warning you to take a break every so often.  The better ones also include advice on exercises, posture and workstation setup.  Some use sound hardware to   warn of a break, others use beeps or screen messages.  Often, RSI appears only after many years of typing, and the pain has a delayed action in the short term too: frequently you can be typing all day with little problem and the pain gets worse in the evening. These tools act as an early warning system: by listening to their warnings and taking breaks with exercises, you don't have to wait for your  body to give you a more serious and painful warning - that is, getting RSI.        Tool: At Your Service (commercial software)     Available from:  Bright Star  Tel: +1 (206) 451 3697     Platforms: Mac (System 6.0.4), Windows     Description:  Provides calendar, keyboard watch, email watch, and system info.   Warns when to take a break (configurable).  Has a few recommendations  on posture, and exercises.  Sound-oriented, will probably work best   with sound card (PC) or with microphone (Mac).  Should be possible  to record your own messages to warn of break.       Tool: AudioPort (sound card and software)     Available from:  Media Vision  Tel: +1 (510) 226 2563     Platforms: PC     Description:  A sound card to plug into your PC parallel port.

El Camino Real  Suite 109  Mailstop 403  Sunnyvale, CA  Tel: +1 (408) 730 8410     Platforms: DOS     Description:  Aimed at preventing RSI, this program warns you to take  breaks after a configurable interval, based on clock time, or  after a set number of keystrokes -- whichever is earlier.  It gives you 3 exercises to do each time, randomly selected from  a set of 70.  Exercises are apparently tuned to the type of work  you do - data entry, word processing, information processing.  Exercises are illustrated and include quite a lot of text on  how to do the exercise and on what exactly the exercise does.   CHB includes hypertext information on RSI that you can use   to learn more about RSI and how to prevent it.  Other information  on non-RSI topics can be plugged into this hypertext viewer.  A full glossary of medical terms and jargon is included.   CHB can be run in a DOS box under Windows, but does not then  warn you when to take a break; it does not therefore appear  useful when used with Windows.   Cost: $79.95; quantity discounts, site licenses.      Comments:  The keystroke-counting approach looks good: it seems better  to measure the activity that is causing you problems than to  measure clock time or even typing time.  The marketing stuff  is very good and includes some summaries of research papers,  as well as lots of arguments you can use to get your company   to pay up for RSI management tools.        Tool: EyerCise (commercial software)     Available from:  RAN Enterprises  One Woodland Park Dr.  Haverhill, MA  01830, US  Tel: 800-451-4487 (US only)     Platforms: Windows (3.0/3.1), OS/2 PM (1.3/2.0) [Not DOS]     Description:  Aimed at preventing RSI and eye strain, this program warns you to take  breaks after a configurable interval (or at fixed times). Optionally  displays descriptions and pictures of exercises - pictures are  animated and program beeps you to help you do exercises at the  correct rate.  Includes 19 stretches and 4 visual training   exercises, can configure which are included and how many repetitions  you do - breaks last from 3 to 7 minutes.  Also includes online help   on workplace ergonomics.     Quote from their literature:   \\\"EyerCise is a Windows program that breaks up your day with periodic  sets of stretches and visual training exercises.  The stretches work  all parts of your body, relieving tension and helping to prevent  Repetitive Strain Injury.  The visual training exercises will improve  your peripheral vision and help to relieve eye strain.  Together these  help you to become more relaxed and productive.\\\"    \\\"The package includes the book _Computers & Visual Stress_ by Edward C.  Godnig, O.D. and John S. Hacunda, which describes the ergonomic setup  for a computer workstation and provides procedures and exercises to  promote healthy and efficient computer use.     Cost: $69.95 including shipping and handling, quantity discounts  for resellers.  Free demo ($5 outside US).       Comments:  I have a copy of this, and it works as advertised: I would say  it is better for RSI prevention than RSI management, because it  does not allow breaks at periods less than 30 minutes.  Also, it  interrupts you based on clock time rather than typing time, which  is not so helpful unless you use the keyboard all day.  Worked OK on  Windows 3.0 though it did occasionally crash with a UAE - not sure  why. Also refused to work with the space bar on one PC, and has  one window without window controls.  Very usable though, and does not  require any sound hardware.      Tool: Lifeguard (commercial software)     Available from:  Visionary Software  P.O.

Price: $59;  quantity discounts and site licenses.  The DOS product is  bought in from another company, apparently; not sure how  equivalent this is to the Mac version.    The Mac version got a good review in Desktop Publisher   Magazine (Feb 1991).  Good marketing stuff with useful   2-page summaries of RSI problems and solutions, with   references.

Anon FTP:   ftp.cica.indiana.edu (and mirroring sites)      Platforms: Windows (3.0/3.1) (Mac and DOS versions underway)     Description:  Aimed at preventing RSI, this program warns you to take  breaks after a configurable interval (or at fixed times).   Displays descriptions and pictures of exercises - pictures are  animated and program paces you to help you do exercises at the  correct rate.  Quite a few exercises, can configure which ones  are included to some extent.  Online help.   Version 2.0 is out soon, Mac and DOS versions will be based  on this.   Cost: $29.95 if support via CompuServe or Internet, otherwise $39.95.                 Site license for 3 or more copies is $20.00 each.        (NOTE: prices may have gone up for V2.0).       Comments:  I have had a play with this, and it works OK.  Its user interface  design is much better in 2.0, though still a bit unusual.  expensive tool around and it does the job.  It is also the only  tool with a redistributable demo, so if you do get the demo, post it  on your local bulletin boards, FTP servers and Bitnet servers!  Does not include general info on RSI and ergonomics, but it does   have the ability to step backward in the exercise sequence,  which is good for repeating the most helpful exercises.      Tool: Typewatch (freeware), version 3.8 (October 1992)     Available from:  Email to richardd@hoskyns.co.uk  Anonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/typewatch.shar     Platforms: UNIX (tested on SCO, SunOS, Mach; character and X Window mode)     Description:  This is a shell script that runs in the background and warns you  to stop typing, based on how long you have been continuously  typing.  It does not provide exercises, but it does check  that you really do take a break, and tells you when you  can start typing again.     Typewatch now tells you how many minutes you have been typing  today, each time it warns you, which is useful so you  know how much you *really* type.  It also logs information  to a file that you can analyse or simply print out.     The warning message appears on your screen (in character mode),  in a pop-up window (for X Windows), or as a Zephyr message  (for those with Athena stuff).   Tim Freeman <tsf@cs.cmu.edu>   has put in a lot of bug fixes, extra features and support for   X, Zephyr and Mach.   Not formally supported, but email richardd@hoskyns.co.uk  (for SCO, SunOS, character mode) or tsf@cs.cmu.edu (for Mach,  X Window mode, Zephyr) if you have problems or want to give   feedback.      Tool: Various calendar / batch queue programs     Available from:  Various sources     Platforms: Various     Description:  Any calendar/reminder program that warns you of an upcoming  appointment can be turned into an ad hoc RSI management tool.  Or, any batch queue submission program that lets you submit  a program to run at a specific time to display a message to  the screen.   Using Windows as an example: create a Calendar file, and  include this filename in your WIN.INI's 'load=' line so  you get it on every startup of Windows.  Suppose you  want to have breaks every 30 minutes, starting from 9 am.  Press F7 (Special Time...) to enter an appointment, enter  9:30, hit Enter, and type some text in saying what the break  is for.  Then press F5 to set an alarm on this entry, and repeat   for the next appointment.   By using Windows Recorder, you can record the keystrokes  that set up breaks throughout a day in a .REC file.  Put this  file on your 'run=' line, as above, and you will then, with  a single keypress, be able to set up your daily appointments  with RSI exercises.   The above method should be adaptable to most calendar programs.   An example using batch jobs would be to submit a simple job  that runs at 9:30 am and warns you to take a break; this will  depend a lot on your operating system.   While these approaches are not ideal, they are a good way of forcing   yourself to take a break if you can't get hold of a suitable RSI   management tool.  If you are techie enough you might want to  write a version of Typewatch (see above) for your operating  system, using batch jobs or whatever fits best.      Tool: Digital watches with count-down timers     Available from:  Various sources, e.g. Casio BP-100.     Description:  Many digital watches have timers that count down from a settable  number of minutes; they usually reset easily to that number, either  manually or automatically.     While these are a very basic tool, they are very useful if you  are writing, reading, driving, or doing anything away from  a computer which can still cause or aggravate RSI.  The great  advantage is that they remind you to break from whatever you  are doing.       Comments:  My own experience was that cutting down a lot on my typing led to  my writing a lot more, and still reading as much as ever, which  actually aggravated the RSI in my right arm though the left  arm improved.  Getting a count-down timer watch has been  very useful on some occasions where I write a lot in a day.   I have tried an old fashioned hour-glass type egg timer, but  these are not much good because they do not give an audible  warning of the end of the time period!   KEYBOARD REMAPPING TOOLS: these enable you to change your keyboard mapping so you can type one-handedly or with a different two-handed layout.   One-handed typing tools may help, but be VERY careful about how  you use them -- if you keep the same overall typing workload you are simply doubling your hand use for the hand that you use for typing, and may therefore make matters worse.      Tool: hsh (public domain)     Available from:  Anonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/hsh.shar     Platforms: UNIX (don't know which ones)     Description:  Allows one-handed typing and other general keyboard remappings.  Only works through tty's (so, you can use it with a terminal or  an xterm, but not most X programs).      Tool: Dvorak keyboard tools (various)     Available from:  Anonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/xdvorak.c  Also built into Windows 3.x.      Description:  The Dvorak keyboard apparently uses a more rational layout  that involves more balanced hand use.   It *may* help prevent  RSI a bit, but you can also use it if you have RSI, since   it will slow down your typing a *lot* :-)   \",\"Excerpts from netnews.comp.sys.mac.misc: 5-Apr-93 Re: HELP INSTALL RAM ON CEN.. by Jason Harvey Titus@farad     oh boy am i confused, I thought the entire point of the 72 pin simms was that you could use diffrent size simms so you could avoid having to use sets.  all horror stories not withstanding.\",\"  I think you'd have to do some massive data compression just to fit a bit of key information on each primary particle of the known universe.

He has batted in the 340's for a season, drove in 100 and more runs   many times in a row before his injury. Consistently hit at or near 300   while knocking in 35 home runs. Have you even LOOKED at Dave Winfield's   slugging percentage for three or 4 of his best seasons. I still think that   dave was one of the BETTER of all time, but obviously not the best. He was   one of the best athletes evr to play baseball. He hit line drives that hit   the scoreboard in left-center field, a feat np one has done in the new   Stadium. Heck, only 2 or 3 other people have hit it over that green fence   since it has been remodeled. He could field, had a bullet arm, and his   hitting was comparable in many seasons to gary sheffields, and barry bonds   of last season. He is older now, and slowing down, takes more of an   uppercut to lift the ball out of the park, but he will always be my hero,   and my idol. There is nothing that could make me happier than George   inviting Dave back to the Bronx to play his last year of ball with the   Yankees. Of course, he will most likely refuse the offer, but who knows?   For 3 million dollars, he'll play. Heck they are giving gallego 2.5   million this year, having Dave as their DH, while leaving him time to play   the field when Tartabull is injured, or Nokes and mass are traded, should   give the Yanks the inspiration and leadership that will sweep in a new age   of Yankee domination. \",\"  There was a news article a little while ago reporting a type of car (was it a Volvo?) was found to stall if you used a certain brand/model of cellular phone in it.

Now, we no longer live in the days of big filing cabinets. We live in the electronic age. I asked myself, how big could the escrow database get? How hard might it be to steal the whole thing, particularly were I an NSA official operating with the tacit permission of the escrow houses? (We can pretend that such will not happen, but thats naive.)  Well, lets see. Ten bytes of each escrow half. Lets asume ten bytes of serial number -- in fact, I believe the serial number is smaller, but this is an order of magnitude calculation. We assume 250*10^6 as the population, and that each person has a key. I get five gigabytes for each of the two escrow databases. Fits conveniently on a single very valuable Exabyte tape. This can only get easier with time, but who cares -- I can already hold all the clipper keys in the country in my pocket on two 8mm tapes.  Admittely, they will think of safeguards. They won't put the whole database on one disk, prehaps. Maybe they will throw stumbling blocks in the way. This changes nothing -- they keys will be needed every day by hundreds if not thousands of law enforcement types, so convenience will dictate that the system permit quick electronic retrieval. At some point, with or without collusion by the agencies, those exabyte tapes are going to get cut. Dorothy Denning and David Sternlight will doubtless claim this can't happen -- but we know that \\\"can't\\\" is a prayer, not a word that in this instance connotes realism.  With two exabyte tapes in your pocket, you would hold the keys for every person's conversations in the country in your hands. Yeah, you need the \\\"master key\\\" two -- but thats just ten bytes of information that have to be stored an awful lot of places.  Come to think of it, even if the NSA getting a copy of the database isn't a threat to you because unlike me you have no contraversial political views, consider foreign intelligence services. You know, the ones that David Sternlight wants to protect us from because of the evil industrial espionage that they do. The French apparently do have a big spying operation in friendly countries to get industrial secrets, so he isn't being completely irrational here (although why our companies couldn't use cryptosystems without back doors is left unexplained by those that point out this threat.)   Presumably, foreign intelligence services can get moles into the NSA and other agencies. We have proof by example of this: its happened many times. Presumably, someday they will get their hands on some fraction of the keys. You can't avoid that sort of thing.  Don't pretend that no one unauthorized will ever get their hands on the escrow databases.  We crypto types are all taught something very important at the beginning of intro to cryptography -- security must depend on the easily changed key that you pick to run your system, and not on a secret. The escrow databases aren't the sorts of secrets that our teachers told us about, but they are the sort of big secrets they would lump into this category. Imagine trying to replace 100 million Clipper chips.  I cannot believe that the NSA or whomever it is thats doing this doesn't realize all this already. They are too smart. There are too many of them who have made their bones in the real world. I suspect that they know precisely what they are doing -- and that what they are doing is giving us the appearance of safety so that they can continue to surveil in spite of the growth of strong cryptography. I suspect that they realize that they can't put things off forever, but they can try to delay things as long as possible.  Who knows. Maybe even some of the higher ups, the inevitable bureaucratic types that rise in any organization, really do believe that this scheme might give people some security, even as their subordinates in Fort Meade wring their hands over the foolishness of it all.  -- Perry Metzger  pmetzger@shearson.com\",\"Recently the following problem has arrisen.

But, most applications that require a NuBus card (like full-motion video capture) shouldn't be done on an LC/LCII/LCIII anyway.\",\" You might visit some congregations of Christians, who happen to be homosexuals, that are spirit-filled believers, not MCC'rs; before you go lumping us all together with Troy Perry.

There is only one way of determin- ing \\\"best\\\" in baseball.  And that is by looking at the  scoreboard  at the  end  of  the game.  Each game determines which *team* is the best that day.  At the end of the season, the team that was  the  best  the most  often  is  the best in the division.  The playoffs determine the best of the best.  But the point is that the only decision making pro- cess  used to determine the \\\"best\\\" is the score of the game and it re- lates to the *teams*.  Not the individual players.  There is no method inherent  in  baseball of comparing individual performances.  And that is how it should be, because, after all, baseball is a team game.  To say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab- solutely  that  player A's team would have played better with player B in their lineup.  Sheer speculation.  Impossible to ascertain.  If you want to select a group of statistics and claim that Clemens has done  better  with those statistics as a criteria, then fine.  But you have  to  be  able  to  prove  that  those  statistics   measure   the individual's  contribution  to  winning  the WS - because  that is the only measure of \\\"best\\\" that has any meaning in the  context  of  base- ball.   So  until you can prove that Clemens contributes to a WS cham- pionship more than Morris your evaluation of  Clemens is totally  sub- jective  and  is  mere opinion.  I have yet to see that any of you can predict a WS winner with any greater accuracy than Jeanne Dixon.   Exactly.  The Jays won with Morris pitching.   And  Boston  wins  with Clemens pitching.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens. I am saying that individual comparisons between  players  are  totally meaningless  and  that anyone claiming that Clemens is better based on his ERA has missed the point of what baseball is all about.   You don't have to be rude.   For you to say that means that you have either missed the entire point of  my  argument, or you yourself have committed a fallacy - Ignoratio Elenchi.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens   because he   has  more   rings   (although  I  have,  tongue in cheek, claimed that in the past).  I am saying that it is impossible to  isolate   an individual's  performance   from that of his team's for the purpose of comparing that individual's performance with another individual's per- formance.  The stats are a nice hobby and  that's  about  it.  There  is  no  new knowledge being produced.  So when a poster claims that Morris is better than Clemens because he has more rings, the poster is no more nor less  incorrect than the rest of you baying hounds.  -- \",\"Generally, an organization has influence in proportion to:   The narrowness of its objectives  The number of members  The strength of belief of its members  This is why the pro- and anti-abortion groups are so strong: narrow objectives, lots of interested members who are real passionate.

Several people responded with good information, but I don't think I communicated  exactly what I am looking for.  I'm working on a custom I/O device that will communicate with a host via RS-232.  My custom circuitry will use an 80C186EB or EC CPU and require about 64K of RAM (preferably FLASH RAM).  In looking around, I see that lots of people have engineered UART-CPU-ROM-RAM subsystems that are ready to be interfaced to your custom I/O devices.  It's been done so much, that it  would be best if I can avoid reinventing a system.  It just needs to use an 80C186 (or 188) CPU, and be able to load a program from the host then  transfer control to that program.  Well, there's one other thing the ROM needs to know how to do.  It should have routines to send and receive bytes to/from the host, that utilize the hardware control lines (DTR,RTS,DTS,CTS). Everything I've seen is in the $200.00 and up range.  That's too much for this application.  I need something around $100.00.  The CPU has the UART built-in, so you're only looking at a few chips.

Certainly the people who use the population for cover are *also* to blaim for dragging the innocent civilians into harm's way.  Are you suggesting that, when guerillas use the population for cover, Israel should totally back down? So...the easiest way to get away with attacking another is to use an innocent as a shield and hope that the other respects innocent lives?   Your damn right Israel insists on some sort of \\\"demilitarized\\\" or \\\"buffer\\\" zone. Its had to put up with too many years of attacks from the territory of Arab states and watched as the states did nothing. It is not exactly surprizing that Israel decided that the only way to stop such actions is to  do it themselves.   What? So the whole bit about attacks on Israel from neighboring Arab states  can start all over again? While I also hope for this to happen, it will only occur WHEN Arab states show that they are *prepared* to take on the  responsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attacks on Israel from their  soil. They have to Prove it (or provide some \\\"guaratees\\\"), there is no way Israel is going to accept their \\\"word\\\"- not with their past attitude of  tolerance towards \\\"anti-Israel guerillas in-residence\\\".  Good lord, Brad. What in the world goves you the idea that UN troops stop anything? They are ONLY stationed in a country because that country allows them in. It can ask them to leave *at any time*; as Nasser did in '56 and '67. Somehow, with that \\\"limitation\\\" on the troops \\\"powers\\\" I don't think that Israel is going to be any more comfortable. Without a *genuine* commitment to peace from the Arab states, and concrete (not intellectual or political exercises in jargon) \\\"guarantees\\\" by other parties, the UN is worthless to Israel (but, perhaps useful as a \\\"ruse\\\"?).   Perhaps you are aware that, to most communities of people, there is the feeling that it is better that \\\"many of us die fighting against those who attack us than for few to die while we silently  accept our fate.\\\" If,however, you call on Israel to see the sense of  suffering fewer casualties, I suggest you apply the same to Palestinian, Arab and Islamic groups.   From Israel's perspective, \\\"concessions\\\" gets it NOTHING...except the  realization that it has given \\\"something\\\" up and now *can only  hope* that the other side decides to do likewise. Words *can be taken back* by merely doing so; to \\\"take back\\\" tangible items (land, control of land) requires the sort of action you say Israel should stay away from.   Israel put up with attacks from Arab state territories for decades  before essentially putting a stop to it through its invasion of Lebanon. The entire basis of that reality was exactly as you state above: 1) Israel  would express outrage at these attacks and protest to the Arab state  involved, 2) that state promptly ignored the entire matter, secure  in the knowledge that IT could not be held responsible for the acts  committed by \\\"private groups\\\", 3) Israel would prepare for the next  round of attacks. What would Israel want to return to those days (and don't be so idiotic as to suggest \\\"trust\\\" for the motivations of present-day Arab states)?  Ah, ok...what is \\\"different\\\" about the present situation that tells us that the Arab states will *not* pursue their past antagonistic  policies towards Israel? Now, don't talk about vague \\\"political factors\\\" but about those \\\"tangible\\\" (just like that which Israel gave up) factors that \\\"guarantee\\\" the responsibility of those states. Your assessment of \\\"difference\\\" here is based on a whole lot of assumptions, and most states don't feel confortable basing their existence on that sort of thing.   It has not. Without the support, and active involvement, of Syria, Lebanon would not have been able to accomplish all that has occurred. Once Syria leaves who is to say that Lebanon will be able to retain  control? If Syria stays thay may be even more dangerous for Israel.

Their cheer quickly turned into a roar, and finally, the sellout crowd of 17,816 rose as one to rock the old barn at 5700 Oakland Avenue in a salute to the playoff-bound Blues.  The scoreboard had just flashed the news from Detroit -- Red Wings 5, Stars 3. With the North Stars' loss, the Blues officially clinched fourth place and the final playoff spot in the Norris Division. Good thing, because the Blues quit playing.  They held a 5-1 lead over Tampa Bay when the Detroit-Minnesota final appeared with 3 minutes 52 remaining in the second period. They promptly went to sleep and barely held on for a 6-5 victory that nearly slipped away at the buzzer. Tampa's Bob Beers tipped in a pass from Shawn Chambers, but officiating supervisor John D'Amico and video goal judge Rich Schweigler ruled that the shot had gone into the net after time had expired.  ``I'm glad I didn't see it go in at the end,\\\" Blues coach Bob Berry said.  If the goal had counted, he'd have been more upset than he was by the Blues' disappearance in the final 24 minutes. Holding on for the victory and making the playoffs tempered Berry's anger.  ``It wasn't pretty at the end,\\\" he said. ``We played 36, 37 great minutes, as good as we played all year. It slipped away at the end. It shouldn't have, but it did.\\\"  Still, the Blues won, prompting another ovation from the crowd at game's end. Despite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil this season, the Blues still made the playoffs. They'll meet the Chicago Blackhawks in a best-of-seven Norris Division semifinal, beginning at noon Sunday at Chicago Stadium.  The Blues finished the regular-season with a record of 37-36-11 for 85 points, their fourth consecutive plus-.500 season. Minnesota finished three points behind in fifth place, with a record of 36-38- 10 for 82 points. Tampa Bay, which played spoiler last week by tying the Blues 2-2 at Tampa, ended its first season with a record of 23-54-7 for 53 points.  The poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyous Blues locker room. Instead, the mood was one of relief and some disappointment.  ``It's a shame we let down,\\\" said Kevin Miller, one of three Blues to score two goals. Brendan Shanahan and Bob Bassen were the others. ``There was no need for a letdown. If we'd have kept working, it would have ended 6-2 and everyone would be happy.\\\"  Instead, a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs. ``We won, and that's all that matters,\\\" said Brett Hull, scoreless and minus-3 for the night. ``Once we got up 4-0, it was really tough to play.\\\"  Some players didn't have a problem.  ``Just because the score was announced, our line didn't quit,\\\" said Rich Sutter, who played with Bassen and Miller. ``We still had a game to play. You can't allow five goals like we did, that's not right.  ``It was disappointing to see what was going on.\\\"  Bassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the Blues' effort. Somehow, he missed the announcement of Minnesota's loss.  ``I didn't know it was final,\\\" he said. ``I was kind of looking around on the bench. I didn't realize it was a final for some reason. We're in the playoffs, and that's great, but it's a little disappointing to play like we did at the end.\\\"  The letdown was precisely the reason that Berry had instructed the scoreboard operators to keep the Minnesota-Detroit score off of the board. The score showed 0-0 until it first popped up with Detroit leading 4-2 in the third period. The Blues already led 4-0 at the time.  ``I told them I didn't want to see the score, I didn't want to know the score,\\\" Berry said. ``I felt we had to win the game, and that's the approach we took.\\\"  If Minnesota took a lead, Berry feared, the pressure of having to win might bother the Blues. If Detroit led, he worried, the Blues might quit.  Until the announcement, the Blues played splendidly. Shanahan got the crowd going at 10:44 of the first period, scoring his 50th of the season. Then, Miller and Bassen took charge late in the period.  With the teams playing four on four, Miller broke in on left wing, deked defenseman Roman Hamrlik and beat former Blues goalie Pat Jablonski with the rebound of his own shot with 21.6 seconds remaining in the period.  Then, just 10.5 seconds later, Bassen rifled a long slap shot past Jablonski after defenseman Rick Zombo intercepted a Tampa pass in the neutral zone.  Bassen made it 4-0 just 14 seconds into the second period, scoring on the  rebound of Bret Hedican's shot. The goal gave him his first two-goal game of the season and reminded him of a special friend.  Last year, Bassen befriended young Oliver Mulvihill, who died of a rare form of cancer at age 6 on Feb. 23.  ``I was thinking of my buddy Oliver,\\\" Bassen said. ``He's in heaven now, and I know he was watching. I know he's happy.\\\"  Miller increased the Blues lead to 5-0 on a break-away goal set up by Zombo at 11:09. Then, Steve Maltais broke Curtis Joseph's shutout just 18 seconds later, making it 5-1.  Less than a minute after the North Stars' final was announced, Tim Bergland scored and cut the lead to 5-2. But Shanahan scored his 51st, converting a pass from Nelson Emerson with 21.3 seconds remaining in the  second period.  Then, it was all Lightning. Adam Creighton scored 40 seconds into the third period, prompting Berry to rest the overworked Joseph. Guy Hebert allowed goals to Shawn Chambers and Danton Cole in a span of 1:21 midway through the third period.  The goals by Chambers and Cole made Shanahan's second goal stand up as the winner. ``We were in there,\\\" Shanahan said. ``The game was over. We were in.\\\"\",\" Recommended for what, DOS?

The estimated population  of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were  Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem.  Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third  of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the   Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan  uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians  as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,  however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the  guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000  inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character   notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian   Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the   southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.\\\"   (See also Map 1.

Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They   found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border   into Turkey. The rest were killed.

Did you know about that?  near teh Radio telescope  observatory in West virginia, they have a 90?????? mile EMCON zone.  Theoretically they can prevent you from running light AC motors, like air conditioners and Vacuums. In practice, they use it mostly to  control  large radio users.\",\"In <lsjc8cINNmc1@saltillo.cs.utexas.edu> turpin@cs.utexas.edu (Russell Turpin)   I regard love as no more or less \\\"benign\\\" than any other Christian does. You are merely expressing \\\"approval\\\" of the consequences I find therein. Which says more about our politics and cultural trappings than about my (or any) religion.  \\\"Love\\\" is a highly ambiguous word, of which Christians can write both the \\\"gentle\\\" words Paul uses of it in 1 Corinthians -- in a passage that even the \\\"conservatives\\\" will quote at you :-) -- and the words of T. S. Eliot in his Pentacost Hymn, \\\"Love is the unfamiliar Name that wove the intolerable shirt of flame ...\\\"  This is in any case rather to the side of what I was attempting to raise in my note, as will become more evident below.   blechhh.  I think you are misreading me, rather seriously.  Though, given my principle that one CANNOT force one's own notion of \\\"sin\\\" on another, and my unshakeable \\\"disestablishmentarianism\\\", Russel Turpin and others (believers and unbelievers alike) are under no threat of my legislating my own understanding of Christian love.   You misread.  I can do (and have repeatedly done) a complete bill of accusation against the Inquisition by exhibiting in as thorough a form as anyone might want a demonstration of the harm it has done to human beings (in the first place) and to respect for (let alone love of) \\\"God\\\" in near succession.  Please go back to my quoted words above:  The \\\"possibility that always exists\\\" is that I (or, to revert to proper time sequence, my predecessors over the last several centuries) could persuade \\\"Christian B\\\" of my case that the Inquisition *does* indeed constitute an egregious violation of the Law of Love.  I must also note that the majority of Christians HAVE been so persuaded.  By Christian argumentation, as well as by secular [both Christian and non-Christian] prohibitions.  What Mr. Turpin alludes to is a trickier point:   A.  I demonstrate the human pain and violation of love involved      in the Inquisition.   B.  The Inquisitor responds that Mother Church must, however      painful this *seems*, \\\"discipline\\\" her children for their      own good -- in this case the salvation of their souls (or      if the tortured heretic will not recant, than by bad example      \\\"deterring\\\" others from the same loss-of-soul.)   A.  I point out that this \\\"justification\\\" of a failure in love      depends on a highly speculative construal of texts and of      philosophical assertions that are quite undemonstrable.   B.  Burns me at the stake.  My rhetoric has failed, but the point I am making is sustained.  What is going on here has a *lot* to do with \\\"cultural baggage.\\\"  In this case, the baggage includes a (nearly universal, and absolutely secular) belief that an accused person must prove innocence and that testimony is most believable if taken under torture.  The elimination of Inqisitorial practice (in those places where it *has* been eliminated, or at least greatly reduced) has very little, if anything, to do with the discussion of sin in the exchange between A and B.  Mr. Turpin is pointing out that, if I am A versus the Grand Inquisitor's B, then my persuasion is not very likely to work.  I know this; and in what- ever personal agony, I consign the issue to God and my ghostly defense attorney.  So, \\\"one possibility\\\" fails in this case -- as it will fail in may others.  At the other extreme, the \\\"persuasion\\\" will succeed when it properly SHOULD not, if it entails mistaken assumptions I share with the Inquisitor.  And that is potentially an even more troubling case, in that many of the victims of Inquisition will have \\\"accepted\\\" that they were in fact sinful (in such random cases as they may actually have been guilty of charges brought against them.)  The point is that the \\\"persuasion\\\" breaks down when the parties do NOT share enough to agree on all the cultural baggage -- and given the main thrust of the Inquisition, against \\\"heresy\\\", it is *bound* to break down in precisely the \\\"worst\\\" cases.  The \\\"conservative\\\" (I don't think that is the right word, BTW) will take refuge in what I attribute to B above, that he is \\\"justified\\\" in causing harm because he *thinks* that works to a \\\"greater good.\\\"  But this is a violent and extravagant REFUSAL to follow the gospel, as if one's theories about \\\"sin\\\" entitled one to cast aside Jesus' words on dealing with sinners (cf. Matthew 5:39ff).  I am a \\\"radical\\\" Christian *only* in that I take the gospel seriously.   Well, the whole *point* of making these the \\\"base\\\" commandments is that they *aren't* reducible to rules.  A set of rules is a moral code or a law code or an algorithm for acting.  Such things can be very helpful to individuals or societies -- but not if they are used *instead* of a personal involvement in and responsibility for one's actions.  The Great Commandment is, more than anything else, a call to act *as if you were God and accepting ultimate responsibility* in your every action.  A demand that I, like most, would rather *not* hear, but it keeps popping up nonetheless (along with the reassurance that it is more important that I be open to trying this, than succeeding at it).  \\\"Conservatives\\\" may twist this \\\"act as if you were God\\\" to mean \\\"lay down rules for other people and be as nasty to them as possible if they don't keep YOUR rules.\\\" They are so insistent (and obvious) about this that they have convinced a lot of people (who rightly reject the whole concept!) that such idiocy IS how God acts.  That, after all, is the standard accusation \\\"against God\\\" by the atheists here and elsewhere.  That the \\\"conservatives\\\" have confused THEIR manipulative, hoop-jumping notions of coercing other people with the Nature of God is almost the entire content of standard American atheism -- and I quite agree with it on this point.   And different bodies of Christians have, from the beginning, urged *different* \\\"ethical systems\\\" (or in some cases, none).  As a result, it is bizarre to identify any one of these systems, however popular (or infamous) with Christianity.  Christianity DOES NOT HAVE A TORAH. It does not have a QU'RAN.  Specifically Christian scripture has very little, if anything, in the way of \\\"commandments\\\" -- so little that the \\\"Christians\\\" who desperately *want* commandments go \\\"mining\\\" for them with almost no support (and thus almost no obvious limitation :-)) for their efforts.  The one, single, thing in the gospels which Jesus specifically \\\"gives\\\" as \\\"a commandment\\\" to us is \\\"love one another.\\\"   [I will be expanding on this point in a reply to Paul Hudson   that I hope to get to in a day or so -- it is quite true that   SOME Christians infer LOTS of commandments from the NT; I'll   point out what has to be going on in these inferences, and why   there is a huge amount of \\\"cultural baggage\\\" involved.]  You are quite right that this is \\\"goo\\\" if one is looking for an ethical system.  But why should anyone BE looking for an ethical system, since our society is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do?  It may be that we need a principle for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems -- in which case I will profer the _agapate allelou_ once again.   I think you are begging the question. Why don't I and the (myriads of) other Christians like me tell you something about Christianity? [Nor is this very new in Christianity -- you might want to look up the origins and fundamental doctrines of the Quakers, from the 17th century onwards, and they are not at all the first to understand the gospel in a manner that is congenial to my case.]\",\" Sounds a lot more like an Opel GT to me.

Apologies to regular t.a folks.    You must be using 'values' to mean something different from the way I see it used normally.  And you are certainly using 'Science' like that if you equate it to \\\"the real world\\\".  Science is the recognition of patterns in our perceptions of the Universe and the making of qualitative and quantitative predictions concerning those perceptions.  It has nothing to do with values as far as I can see. Values are ... well they are what I value. They are what I would have rather than not have - what I would experience rather than not, and so on.  Objective values are a set of values which the proposer believes are applicable to everyone.   I don't agree. Science is useful insofar as it the predictions mentioned above are accurate.  That is insofar as what I think *will be* the effect on my perceptions of a time lapse (with or without my input to the Universe) versus what my perceptions actually turn out to be.  But values are about whether I like (in the loosest sense of the word) the  perceptions :-)   I don't see why. 'Usefulness' in science is synonomous with 'accuracy' - period. Tarot predictions are not useful because they are not accurate - or can't be shown to be accurate. Science is useful because it is apparently accurate.  Values - objective or otherwise - are beside the point.  No?\",\"Has anyone here dealt with Tangent?  I'm looking at an 486 system  they have that has an EISA backplane with a VESA slot for video.

We have demands from the Armenians. With the Government of x-Soviet Armenia, we would sit down, go over all our outstanding issues, whether it's land or reparations or recognition, whatever it is. We'd like to sit down and ask for it. By all means, lands and properties were taken away from us and they should be returned to the rightful owners, the Turkish and Kurdish  people, who were there 3,000 years, long before the Armenians ever showed up in that area. Entire population of the region was subjected  to genocide beyond belief; genocide which was planned to exterminate  the whole Turkish people of the region to the last man, woman and child.  Armenians tortured and massacred millions of defenseless civilians. To  assemble innocent civilians in the mosques and burn them in the buildings  was one of their methods. Even today the traveler in that region is seldom  free from the evidence of these Armenian crimes.

Strictly, a 1 of 4 decoder need only take two lines in and make one output change state, according to the inputs.  A demux, on the other hand, uses two control inputs to determine which of four outputs will reflect the state of the input signal. So there are three inputs required.  A decoder can be used as a demux if it is equipped with an output enable input, since this can be used as the data input (e.g. when high, all outputs are high; when low, only the selected (by control inputs) output will be low).  An eight way decoder is created by using the high order bit (bit 2) to select which of two four way demuxes is enabled. Thus you achieve your aim of having only one output of eight reflecting the input bits. Note that this method cannot be used to create a true eight way demux, since you have no data input (the enable line on a four way decoder) left once you commit the enable lines to their intended purpose.  A sixteen way decoder obviously requires four, four-way decoders, plus a mechanism to enable only one of the four at a time. Therefore, use the fifth decoder, attached to the two high order bits, to provide the four enable lines.  Of course, the two low order bits must be connected in parallel to the four final stage decoders.  Please give me the credit when you submit your homework.

For example, Why couldn't Magellan just be told to go into a \\\"safe\\\" mode and stay bobbing about Venus in a low-power-use mode and if maybe in a few years if funding gets restored after the economy gets better (hopefully), it could be turned on again.    For that matter, why exactly were the Apollo lunar experiments \\\"turned off\\\" rather than just \\\"safed\\\".  Was it political (i.e. as along as they could be used, someone would keep bugging congress for funds)?  Turning them off keeps them pesky scientists out of the bureaucrat's hair....    I've heard the argument that an active but \\\"uncontrolled\\\" spacecraft causes \\\"radio noise.\\\"  I find that hard to believe that this could be a problem in a properly designed \\\"safe\\\" mode. This safe mode could be a program routine which causes the spacecraft to go to least fuel using orientation, and once a (week, month, year, whatever) attempts a signal lock on Earth. At that time, if funding has been restored, the mission can continue.  If no signal is recieved, the spacecraft goes back to the safe mode for another time period. As we would know when the spacecraft is going to try to contact Earth, we could be prepared if necessary.    As another a spacecraft could do at the attempted contact is beam stored data towards Earth.  If someone can receive it, great, if not, so it's lost and no big deal. By making the time and signal location generally known, perhaps someone in the world might be able and willing to intercept the data even if they're not willing to contact the spacecraft.  I see this as being particularly useful for spacecraft which could have an otherwise long life and are in or are going to places which are otherwise unaccessible (Jupiter/Saturn Orbit, exiting the solar system, etc).     Perhaps those designing future spacecraft (Cassini, Pluto Flyby, etc) should consider designing in a \\\"pause\\\" mode in case their spacecraft gets the ax sometime in the future after completion of the primary mission. Perhaps Mars Observer and Galilleo could have some kind of routine written in for the post mission \\\"drift\\\" phase.  So any holes in all this? \",\"Recently while looking around in Traders Sporting Goods store, a very well stocked firearms store, I discovered a printed document that was being  distributed by the good folks who work there.

The newspapers have now decided to censor gun ads - which is why you no longer see the ads that Traders, San Leandro, has run for many years.  These ads were run for the law-abiding honest citizens who own firearms for sporting use or self-protection.  They certainly have the right to do so, under the Second Amendment Right to Bear Arms.

EDT              Q   Mr. President, what do you think of Jesse Jackson's  protest today?              THE PRESIDENT:  I think it's an informational protest.   I think it's fine.  The owners put out a statement few days ago,  which they say was the first step in, you know, efforts to increase  minority ownership and minority increases in management.  I think we  should.  I'm encouraged by Don Baylor's appointment out in Colorado.   And I think it's time to make a move on that front.  So, I think it's  a legitimate issue, and I think it's -- like I said, it's an  informational picket and not an attempt to get people not to go to  the game.  So, I think it's good.              Q   Do you think they're moving fast enough?              THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think that it was a good first  step.  And I think you'll see some movement now.  And I think it's an  issue that deserves some attention, and they're obviously going to  give it some.  And I think that Reverend Jackson being out there will  highlight the issue.  So I think it's fine.              Q   Mr. President, how about the logjam in the Senate  on the economic stimulus plan?  Do you think they'll be able to break  that and get cloture?              THE PRESIDENT:  I don't know, we're working at it.  I  mean, it's a classic -- there was an article in the paper today, one  of the papers I saw, which pretty well summed it up.  They said, you  know, this is a -- it's just a political power play.  In the Senate  the majority does not rule.  It's not like the country.  It's not  like the -- it's not like the House.  If the minority chooses, they  can stop majority rule.  And that's what they're doing.  There are a  lot of Republican senators who have told people that they might vote  for the stimulus program but there's enormous partisan political  pressure not to do it.                And, of course, what it means is that in this time when  no new jobs are being created, even though there seems to be an  economic recovery, it means that for political purposes they're  willing to deny jobs to places like Baltimore and Dallas and Houston  and Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and Portland and Seattle.  It's very  sad.  I mean, the block grant program was designed to create jobs in  a hurry based on local priorities, and it's one that the Republicans  had always championed.  Just about the only Democrat champions of the  program were people like me who were out there at the grassroots  level, governors and senators.  I just think it's real sad that they  have chosen to exert the minority muscle in a way that will keep  Americans out of work.  I think it's a mistake.

H. Welbon)]         For many atheists, the lack of belief in gods is secondary to an epistemological consideration:  what do we accept as a reliable way of knowing?  There are no known valid logical arguments for the existence of gods, nor is there any empirical evidence that they exist.  Most philosophers and theologians agree that the idea of a god is one that must be accepted on faith.  Faith is belief without a sound logical basis or empirical evidence.  It is a reliable way of knowing?   There is probably nothing else most people would accept in the absence of any possibility of proof.  Even when we agree to take someone elses word \\\"on faith\\\", we just mean that having found this person to be reliable in the past, we judge him likely to be a reliable source now. If we find faith less reliable than logic and empirical evidence everywhere else, why assume it will provide reliable knowledge about gods?   The difference between the atheist and the theist is fundamentally then one of whether or not faith is held to be a reliable way of knowing, rather than, as some agnostic posters would have it, whether ones faith is in gods or no gods.  The theist believes that faith is an acceptable basis for a belief in gods, even if he rejects faith as reliable at other times, for example in his work as a scientist.  The atheist believes that only logic and empirical evidence lead to reliable knowledge.  Agnosticism seems to me a less defensible position than theism or atheism, unless one is a sceptic in regards to all other knowledge.  Without evidence, why should we believe in gods rather than Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny?   I would also like to point out as others have that the atheist doesn't require absolute knowledge of the lack of gods.  I don't believe that there is any such thing as absolute knowledge.  Atheism is the best and simplest theory to fit the (lack of) facts and so should be held until contrary evidence is found.\",\"I was wondering if anyone types in the box scores each day.

The husband is usually physically  stronger than his wife but is not permitted to use this to dominate her.   He must honor her as his sister in Christ.  This would therefore be an  example of a specific sin that blocks prayer.  This verse also makes me think of the kind of husband who decides what  is God's will for his family without consulting his wife.  God reveals  His will to both the husband and the wife.  There needs to be some  degree of mutuality in decision making.  Even those whose understanding  of the Bible leads to a belief in an authoritarian headship of the  husband need to incorporate this in order to have a functional family.   One way to look at it is that God speaks to the wife through the husband  and to the husband through the wife. \",\" Probably because everyone (that is, everyone who has cable) can watch every Braves game.

I was wondering: although a DX-50 is faster because of the path to it's external cache, shouldn't the choice be the DX2-50 as that one can be made to work properly with a local-bus? I mean, cache speed is one thing, but all your speed will be blocked during video I/O, so just get that faster...  I'm willing to speculate that the DX2-50 with local-bus will be 2-4 times  as fast as the DX-50 and probably as expensive (or cheap ;-)!\",\"there is a file out there (look for it with archie) that is called 'theref22.zip' which has lots of info on various PC things, amongst which is also a detailed description of all Floppy controller commands, I think hard drive controller commands are not there.  it is possible to read an entire track including all gaps, sector headers etc.   by setting sector size to something very large (like 8K).\",\"I'm in the market for a laser printer. Used printers are fine, non-apple printers are fine, but whatever printer I get must fit the following:  Required features:  - PostScript  - 300 dpi  - emough memory to download fonts  - The cheaper, the better.  I'd prefer under $1000.   Nice things:  - anything over 4 pages per minute  - scsi output for a font disk  - smallish footprint    Don't Care About:  - PostScript Level II  - networking (its just for me, and always will be)  - color   I know about Freedom of Press, but I've also heard that its painfully slow. I can tolerate about 4 ppm, but anything slower than that and I'm not going to consider the price savings worth it.  I'd be curious to hear people's experience with it, tho.   I also infinitely prefer laser over ink; I used to use HP deskjets in my last job and wasn't impressed with the quality.  I'm a laser bigot and the first to admit it. :)   I'll be using the printer to layout pages of a book I'm writing.  The page will include multiple fonts, PS graphics, scanned line art and maybe greyscale pictures (not sure yet).  The quality doesn't need to be spectacular, but it needs to be clear and readable.   Printers I've been looking at:   - used LaserWriters: The plus, the NT, the NTR.  Its my understanding that   only the NTR has a SCSI out for a disk. True?  - Personal LaserWriter (LS and NTR).  I have access to the Apple Employee   discount (I work for one of Apple's spinoffs), so I can get these reasonably   cheaply.  I've heard bad things about the LS; comments?  I'm leaning   towards the Personal NTR, cause it has a nice small footprint.  - LaserWriter Select 300.  I hear it doesn't have PostScript, but I haven't   seen anything for sure.  I heard mumbles once about a \\\"postscript upgrade.\\\"   ??  - Used HP LaserJets.  I've worked with the II and IIP on another platform, and   they were *painfully* slow.  Are they that bad on the mac?  - I've seen ads for an Epson PS laserprinter that is running quite cheap.   Any comments on this printer?  I hate the styling (too many ouput trays),   but if its a decent printer I'll consider it.

Juan Carlos Leon    \",\"   The word that is missing in this whole discourse is not the \\\"B\\\" word, or the \\\"H\\\" word, or even the \\\"N\\\" or \\\"W\\\" words. It is the \\\"L\\\" word - LOSER !!   That's right. When we boil all the crap out of this argument, it is all about WINNING and LOSING, and nothing else. Let me explain.   Remember the eighties ? No excuses. Nobody who can handle a mail buffer can claim they are \\\"too young\\\" to remember Ronald Reagan - yet. The eighties were about \\\"How America Learned to Win Once Again\\\". Then (wouldn't you know), we won so well that there was nothing left to win. No Cold War to endure. No nuclear holocaust. No more worlds to conquer (We forgot about outer space long ago). The kind of overwhelming, no holds barred success that killed Alexander the Great. Yes, there were a few \\\"little\\\" problems along the way - stock market meltdown here, an S&L bailout there, a few revolts and crazy Middle Eastern dictators to contend with, but as Tacitus would tell ya', the God Augustus never had it so good.    In the meantime, there is guilt for winning, maybe a fear that one doesn't deserve one's bounty - or success. So there is a \\\"kinder and gentler type of politician these days, Bill Clinton, affirmative action, and lots of discourse about people who \\\"don't get it\\\". For those of us in the winning business, this kind of talk is mildly irritating, but there is still no  suggestion of losing.   But what do we find now ? To put it mildy, the stereotype of our  \\\"white male\\\" non-winner is Woody Hayes in the Rose Bowl, punching out  photojournalists when those California fruits and nuts steal another one with a \\\"Hail Mary\\\" pass in the Fourth Quarter. (The whole idea behind 'three yards and a cloud of dust' is to wear your opponent down until he collapses in the final period) But Woody just used his fists - Uzzies seem to be the  weapon of choice these days.     Who is D-FENS, anyway ? The answer is as plain as the horn rims on  your face. The guy is MICHAEL DOUGLAS, posing as a LOSER. This  is known as controversial casting. But that baggy short-sleeved white shirt  sure does look natural on Mike doesn't it. Gordon Gekko will never look the  same. (Though Woody always dressed that way.) Did we really expect Gekko to  take it easy and enjoy that kind of wardrobe, without putting up a fuss ?   What we are starting to lose sight of is, that bashing D-FENS is  the same game as bashing that poor African American slug that Clint Eastwood used to blow away all the time. As that arch-WASP (male gender) George C. Scott declaimed, \\\"Americans traditionally LOVE TO WIN. They love a winner, and will  not tolerate a loser.\\\" And so on.    The political implications are simple. If, as many socialists - and Democrats - do, you consider society a finite pie to a apportioned in some  \\\"equitable\\\" way, then you have to worry about who is a winner and who is a  loser to tell whose side you are on. That could be black women today, Asian homosexuals tommorrow, and yes indeed, white men some yet to be determined day when the balance of the pie has finally swung against that (39%)  minority.   Or you can just blow the whole thing off and say - as do most conservatives and all the libertarians - and act is if you didn't care who's winning and who's losing. In some cases, you might say something about make sure the game is fair (equality of opportunity, not of condition). In the latter case, you might be able to identify yourself as a  \\\"neoconservative\\\" or a \\\"neoliberal\\\" depending on how much you want to limit the pot.   Either way you go, the way of the Winner is no longer the way to be popular - at least after you graduate from High School (but you'll still be popular at High School reunions). But it beats being a Nerd, as I  would imagine Michael Douglas would now agree, and in the long run, it is the only way to go. (Even in Hollywood, which treats Losers worse than any other place in America except for New York and Washington, D.C. - and even in Columbus, Ohio, which produced Alex Keaton, but no champion football teams in the eighties and the first quarter of the nineties) I'd like to  see more Winners in this society, regardless of race, gender, religious  preference, and sexual orientation. Maybe we should even let a few more of  them be white men !!

Basically, stupidity will get you hurt/killed a lot faster on a motorcycle than in a car.  But with care, it is not unreasonably dangerous.  Also, buying good protective clothing is helpful, that way if something does go wrong, you are likely to be less severely injured.  First thing, if possible take a (MSF) driver training course, this will get you started on the right foot -- they teach control of the vehicle and safe riding practices.  Second, buy protective gear.  At minimum a good helmet and a pair of leather gloves are a must.  A good sturdy  piece of footgear is also very helpful, though leather hiking boots, a pair of old army boots, or something similar works fine for this purpose as long as you make sure the laces stay  tied.  After those, a leather jacket and leather pants or chaps are nice as well; but these are also expensive items.  For the pants, many people consider a good pair of jeans to be reasonable, preferably recent and of a fairly heavy weight.  Similarly for a jacket, a good jean jacket is a reasonable compromise, though more people tend to have leather jackets around than pants.  Another thing to do is drop in on garage sales looking for a second-hand leather jacket.  Look for a fairly thick leather in these items.  Third don't do anything stupid -- don't ride after  drinking, even one drink can noticeably affect you judgement and balance; don't ride in the snow, or when conditions are such that black ice is likely; be very careful riding in the rain -- slow way down, take corners gingerly,  brake early and gently;  try not to ride if you are sick, tired, taking any medication with drowsiness warnings, or otherwise not in average shape.  With care, you should be ok.   I would suggest mid to late 80's japanese mid-sized standard. Something in 400-650 cc range would probably be reasonable.  If you are shorter/lighter than average, you might want to go as low as a 300-400 cc bike.  Possible models:  The Suzuki GS### series (eg. GS500, GS650, etc.).  These are generally inline 4 bikes, generally dependable except for a tendency to  weakness in the charging system.  (Stator and/or Regulator/Rectifier  problems.)  My first bike was a (about '82) GS650, it server me well.  The Honda Nighthawk series (this may also be known as the CB### series I think).  eg. Honda CB450, CB650, etc.  This is another series of standard motorcycles.  Also fairly dependable.  Kawasaki and Yamaha probably have similar bikes, but I don't know them as well.  For mid to late '80s models of the above, you should be able to buy the bike for under $2000, leaving you money for protective  clothing and insurance and licensing costs.\",\"-| I just installed a Motorola XC68882RC50 FPU in an Amiga A2630 board (25 MHz -| 68030 + 68882 with capability to clock the FPU separately).

A:  In the US, currently Virgina and the District of Columbia prohibit     all usage of radar detectors.  New York prohibits their use in     large trucks.  In Canada, they are illegal in Manitoba, Ontario,     Quebec, Newfoundland and PEI (Prince Edward Island).  They     are apparently are illegal through most, if not all, of Europe.     Legislation which would make them illegal is pending in many other     jurisdictions; chances of such legislation passing varies a great deal.  Q:  Where are Radar Detector Detectors used?  Do they really work?  A:  Usage is spreading rapidly; initially they were used only in Canada,     but now they are appearing in New York and Virginia.  It is unsafe     to assume that they are not in use in Connecticut and D.C.     They work by detecting a certain frequency radiated by many currently     available super Het radar detectors; some brands of detector radiate     more strongly than others, and are thus more likely to be spotted.     New radar detectors are becoming available which may not be detected     by the current generation of detector detectors.  Note that a     detector may only be spotted by one of these devices if it is turned     on.  Q:  What is VASCAR?  Is it some kind of Radar?  A:  VASCAR is nothing more than a fancy stopwatch and time-speed-distance     computer.  It depends on the operator pressing buttons as the target     vehicle passes landmarks.  No radar signals are emitted by a VASCAR     system.  Q:  What is Ka band radar?  Where is it used?  Should a radar detector be     able to handle it?   A:  Ka band has recently been made available by the FCC for use in the US     in so-called photo-radar installations.  In these installations, a     low-powered beam is aimed across the road at a 45 degree angle to the     direction of traffic, and a picture is taken of vehicles which the     radar unit determines to have been in violation of the speed limit.     Tickets are mailed to the owner of the vehicle.  Because of the low     power and the 45 degree angle, many people believe that a radar     detector cannot give reasonable warning of a Ka band radar unit,     although some manufacturers of radar detectors have added such     capability anyway.  The number of locales where photo-radar is in use     is limited, and some question the legality of such units.  Best advice:     learn what photo radar units look like, and keep track of where they     are used (or else, don't speed.)  Q:  Do radar jammers work?  Are they legal?  A:  Quick answer:  No, and Not in the USA.     Detailed answer:  Cheap radar jammers do not work well at all.     Jammers that work are expensive and usually the property of the     military.  Jammers are a major violation of the regulations of the     Federal Communications Commission of the USA.  Driving technique and Vehicle Dynamics Questions:  Q:  What are understeer and oversteer?  A:  Understeer and oversteer are terms describing the behaviour of a     car while cornering near the `limit' (limit of adhesion, that is.)     Most drivers do not normally drive hard enough for these terms to     be descriptive of the situations they encounter.  Simply put, they     tell whether the car wants to go straight in a corner (steer `less',     or `understeer') or it wants to turn more in a corner (`oversteer'.)     Understeer is commonly designed into most production cars so that     untrained drivers, inadvertantly traveling too fast, won't get into     trouble.  Understeer may also be induced by using too much throttle     in a corner.  Oversteer is designed into some more performance     oriented cars; it may be induced by lifting on the throttle (Trailing     throttle oversteer, or TTO).  In extreme cases, lifting on the throttle     may induce so much oversteer that the car reacts by fishtailing or     spinning.      Some technical details:  in a corner at speed, the tires on the car     will develop what are called `slip angles'; the slip angle is the     angular difference between the direction that the car is traveling     and the direction that the steering wheel is directing the car to     travel.  In understeer, the front wheels have a greater slip angle     than the rear wheels.  In oversteer, the rear wheels have a greater     slip angle than the front wheels.  Q: What is a rev-matched downshift?  A: When downshifting, the engine must be rotating faster in the lower gear    than it was in the higher gear.  However, during a downshift, normally    you declutch and lift your foot from the throttle, so the revs drop    rather than increase.  In rev-matched downshift, you blip the throttle    before re-engaging the clutch so that the engine will already be up to    the new speed.  This results in a much smoother and faster downshift.  Q: What does heel-and-toe mean?  A: Heel-and-toe is a technique used to do a rev-matched downshift while    braking.  This is normally challenging, because you need the right foot    for both the brake and throttle.  It is called heel-and-toe because you    use one end of the foot on the brake, and the other on the throttle to    match revs for the downshift.  In many modern cars this is a misnomer;    often you must use the ball of the foot on the brake and the right side    on the throttle.     Note that some race car drivers will skip the clutch, and just use the    left foot on the brake and the right foot on the throttle, accomplishing    the same thing.  Q: What is double-clutch downshifting?  A: While your right foot is doing the above, your left foot can do one of    three things:  nothing, declutch once, or declutch twice.  The reason for    declutching twice is to match the speeds of the two shafts in the    transmission to the speed of the engine.  This is usually coupled with    rev-matching, so that while the engine is in neutral and the clutch    engaged, the throttle is blipped and both shafts of the transmission    speed up.     The procedure is as follows:    (0) declutch    (1) move gearshift lever to neutral    (2) engage clutch    (3) match revs    (4) declutch    (5) move gearshift lever to next lower gear    (6) engage clutch     This sounds like a lot of work, but with practice it becomes natural.    The problem that double-clutching solves is normally the function of the    synchronizers within the gearbox.  In transmissions without synchros or    with very worn synchros, double-clutching makes it much easier to shift.    Basically, if you double-clutch well, you are not using the synchros at    all.  This is generally unnecessary on street cars with synchros in good    condition.  Q: What do the numbers for acceleration from 0-60, 1/4 mile, skidpad, and    slalom times in the Auto Magazines really mean?  May they be compared?  A: In short, 1) not as much as the magazines want you to believe, and    2) almost never.     In more detail:  the acceleration numbers (0-60mph and 1/4 mile times    in the US) may be vaguely compared as long as they all come from the    same source.  Testing procedures vary so much from magazine to magazine    that comparing a Road & Track number to a Car & Driver number is quite    pointless.  Keep in mind, too, that the same variation applies from    driver to driver on the street; the driver is a major (often *the*    major) part of the equation.     Skidpads vary, and even if they didn't, skidpad figures are really    only tests of the stickiness of the stock tires; they change radically    when tire compounds change.  DO NOT make any assumptions about the    comparative handling of, say, two sports sedans based on skidpad numbers.    This is not to suggest that skidpads are without value, however. Skidpads    are an excellent educational tool at driving schools.  They are simply    of limited value in the comparison of anything except tires.     Slalom times are slightly more useful; they test some small parts of the    automobile's transient response.  However, they are also heavily influenced    by the stock rubber on the car, and they do not test many corners of the    car's envelope.  They DO NOT tell you all you need to know before making    a buying decision.  For example, they don't tell you what the rear end    of the car will do on a road which suddenly goes off-camber.  When a car    has an adjustable suspension, these tests are usually done in the `sport'    setting, which may be quite unsuitable for daily driving.  The list of    caveats could go on for page after page.  Q: My buddy claims that wide tires don't make any difference, according    to his freshman physics textbook, and that you can't ever accelerate    or corner at more than 1.0G.  Does he know what he's talking about?  A: 1) in short:  he hasn't got a clue.     2) in more detail: the equations for friction used in freshman physics    textbooks presume that the surfaces are smooth,  dry and non-deformable,    none of which properly apply to tire traction except in the case of a    stone cold tire on dry pavement which is far below its proper operating    temperature.     Pavement is _never_ smooth; it is always irregular to a greater or lesser    extent.  Tires, which are not really dry and solid (as rubber is a    substance which in its natural form is liquid, and which has only been    coerced into a semblance of solidity by chemical magic), deform to match    the surface of the pavement which a vehicle is traveling over.  In a tire    at operating temperature, grip is actually generated by shear stresses    inside the deformed rubber, and not by anything even remotely resembling    friction in the freshman physics sense of the term.  The colder a tire    is relative to its operating temperature, the closer its behaviour will    be to the traditional concept of friction; if much hotter than the its    proper operating temperature, the more likely the possibility of some    part of the tire actually ``reverting'' to liquid, which is mostly like    to happen deep in the tread, causing characteristic blisters and chunking.    (This latter, though, is almost completely unlikely to happen in normal    street driving, so unless you're a competition driver or do a lot of    high speed track driving, don't worry about it.)     Because tire traction is completely out of the domain of simple friction,    it does not obey the freshman physics equation at all; thus dragsters    accelerate at more than 1.0G and race cars corner and brake at more than    1.0G.  Because simple friction does not apply, it is actually possible    for different sized contact patches to generate differing amounts of    grip.  An actual analysis of tire behavior would require techniques    such as Finite Element Analysis, due to the complexity of the mechanism.  Misc. Questions:  Q:  What does <name or acronym> stand for?

In particular, NEVER     ask in rec.humor if you want a useful result.      Saab:   Svenska Aeroplan A.

A:  No.  Porsche is a publicly held company, controlled by the Porsche and     Piech families.  Porsche has extensive business dealings with VW/Audi,     which causes some confusion.  Since currently Porsche is in some     financial difficulty, there is a possibility that Mercedes or VW may     be interested in purchasing the company in the near future, but this     is only speculation at this time.\",\"     The Olds Supreme Convertible got high marks in C/D's recent test, if you can get by the stupid body moldings and stuff.

Nazi Armenians were of service  to Germans in Arab countries as well. As Uzun put it, one well-known  case which received a lot of media-coverage involved two Nazi Armenian  agents which were dropped over Syria by Italian war planes. The mission  of the agents was to mingle among the Armenian population in Syria and  to acquire relevant information for the German Wehrmacht on the allied  forces in the area.[1] Nazi Armenians also helped German propaganda  efforts in Arab countries designed to promote pro-Nazi sentiments among  the French- and British-ruled Arab populations. Beirut had traditionally been strong-hold of the Nazi Armenians and until very recently it was the center of international Armenian terrorism.   In Russia General Dro (the Butcher), the architect of the Turkish genocide in WWI, was working closely with the German Secret  Service. He entered the war zone with his own men and acquired important intelligence about the Soviets. His experience with the Turkish genocide in x-Soviet Armenia made him an invaluable  source for the Germans.[2]  [1] Meyer, Berkian, ibid., p. 150.

Dec. 1989  Leading Israeli author and cultural commentator, A.B. Yehoshua, launched a ferocious attack on diaspora Jewry at a Zionist Youth Council meeting in North London, last week.  The diaspora, he claimed, \\\"was the cancer connected to the main tissue of the Jewish people\\\". He was scathing about its failure to act before the Holocaust.  He said the diaspora's religious and secular leadership had ignored the warning signs in the 1920s, and had fiercely opposed Zionism. Consequently, he considered the Holocaust, \\\"the failure of Judaism\\\".  His talk, entitled \\\"Diaspora: A Neurotic Solution\\\", covered 5,000 years of Jewish history.  Mr. Yehoshua's other targets included Soviet Jews who were, he said \\\"not staying [in Israel], but running [away]\\\", and all Jews outside Israel \\\"who were using other people's countries like hotels\\\".  The only conclusion he could draw was that the diaspora was immoral, because it looked to Israel for its identity but lived elsewhere.  Worse, it threatened Israel itself, creating a distraction for her citizens, who were leaving by the thousands.  Mr. Yehoshua, who described himself as \\\"a soldier for aliyah\\\", ended by calling for the creation of a new \\\"total Jew\\\", living in Israel.  Earlier, speaking at a meeting of Jewish students on the difficulties of forging a national identity in Israeli literature, Mr. Yehoshua claimed that Israeli writers were paralyzed by the country's political situation.  He said Israel's wars had once provided writers with a vital source of inspiration.  Today, Israeli writers avoided writing directly about the Arab-Israeli conflict. No major work had been produced about the intifada.  Instead, writers were tackling themes such as Jewish identity, emigration from Israel and personal and family issues.  Mr. Yehoshua admitted he also felt unable to write about the Israeli political situation. He could no longer step into an Israeli Arab's shoes and portray him as a real \\\"flesh and blood character\\\".  He claimed that after 40 years of statehood, the problem of Israeli identity had not been solved. He said Jews remained too pre-occupied with the borders of identity between Jew and non-Jew, and were not concerned with the nature of that identity.  Jewish values in Israel embraced every aspect of daily life, unlike in the diaspora, where Jews had no responsibility for the country they lived in, he said.  He warned that modern Hebrew, a unifying force for the Jewish people, would have to struggle for its future, especially in literary circles. It faced fierce competition from the English language. \",\" From the limited details released so far, It seems that the clipper chip  system must employ some sort of public key cryptography. Otherwise, the key  management problems inherent to symetric ciphers would make the system  unworkable. It probably has some sort of public key exchange that takes place at the start of each call. Thats how they would identify the private key in  their data base?  This means that either the NSA has developed some non RSA public key  algorythm or the feds have decided to subsidize PKP & RSADSI. The former is  rather an exciting posibility since keeping the algorythm secret while making chip implimentations widely avalibe will be exceptionally hard. If the feds are forced to make it avalible in order to gain public acceptance than that  could break RSA's stranglehold on public key crypto in the U.S.     As for my impressions of the whole scheme It seems that instead of trying to ban strong crypto, they are trying to co-opt it. Their contention that they  need to keep the algorythm secret to protect the security of the key registration suggests possible inherent weakness to the algorythm. More likely is that they dont want anyone constructing black market devices which dont  have the keys registered. Anyone else notice that in their Q&A session, they talk about releasing the keys only to people with proper autiorization but carefully dance around stating that the keys will simply have to be supeonaed. They seem to be trying to keep open the posibility of obtaining keys without  court order even though tapping a phone line requires one. Also pick up on  their implicit threat of eithe accept this or we'll ban strong crypto outright? I dont trust this plan at all and plan to oppose it in all (legal) ways possible.\",\"Well now that the hawks have won the division the road is a little easier for the playoffs.

Please  include: Name, Organization, Address and Telephone Number.       (6)  We would benefit from knowing why users that know about NASA remote  sensing data do not use the data.  Is it because they do not have ties to NASA investigators, or high cost, lack of accessibility, incompatible data formats, poor area of interest coverage, inadequate spatial or spectral resolution, ...?        \",\"   It's about time.  Why do atheists spend so much time paying attention to the bible, anyway?  Face it, there are better things to do with your life!  I used to chuckle and snort over the silliness in that book and the absurdity of people believing in it as truth, etc.  Why do we spend so little time on the Mayan religion, or the Native Americans?  Heck, the Native Americans have signifigantly more interesting myths.  Also, what about the Egyptians.  I think we pay so much attention to Christianity because we accept it as a _religion_ and not a mythology, which I find more accurate.   I try to be tolerant.  It gets very hard when someone places a book under my nose and tells me it's special.  It's not.\",\": I was posting to Alt.locksmithing about the best methods for securing  : a motorcycle.  I got several responses referring to the Cobra Lock : (described below).  Has anyone come across a store carrying this lock : in the Chicago area? :  : Any other feedback from someone who has used this?  What about the new Yamaha \\\"Cyclelok\\\" ? From the photo in Motorcyclist, it looks the same hardened steel as a  Kryptonite U lock, except it folds in five places. It seems to extend out far enough to lock the rear tire to the tube of a parking sign or similar.  Anyone had any experience with them, how easy is it to attack the lock at the jointed sections ?\",\"In <1993Apr15.143320.8618@desire.wright.edu>, demon@desire.wright.edu sez:  There's this minor thing called \\\"interest of finality/repose\\\".  What it means is that parties aren't dragged into court over and over again because the losing side \\\"discovers\\\" some \\\"new\\\" evidence.  I don't know about you, Brett, but I suspect GM had the resources to find just about as many expert and fact witnesses as it wanted before the trial started.  Letting them re-open the case now is practically an invitation to every civil litigant on earth to keep an ace in the hole in case the verdict goes against him.  BTW, in federal criminal cases, Rule 33 does permit a motion for a new trial \\\"based on . . . *newly discovered* evidence\\\" if made within 2 years of the verdict.  (Emphasis mine.)  If you're trying to make a backhanded point about criminal justice in a discussion that has little to do with criminal trials -- as the estimable David Brock did in his amusing WSJ piece last week -- save your breath.     Yup.  Which is why they shoulda been brought around the first time through.     Unless there's some reason to believe that this supposed bias predated the trial (as opposed to being a product of it), and that GM was unfairly prevented from discovering it (by venireman concealment or otherwise), why should GM be allowed to complain? \",\" ------------ Part 6 of 14 ------------ MAZ)75U=7R!1KP\\\"5A8=F>`7;UG)\\\\&V0&>*YZ>*W5&$'Z]M;T0AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX=7HLAL(;7(5U\\\\,MEIH@$H^,#\\\",4*&?8%'U#6#,-V`W!H>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'A[0E9:0E97PM8]8M9#MH M6CNL]%&'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AUL4SU=7Z/*V&U<2X!!:6M3BYK7L:.Q-TZ#Q M[/%#\\\\>SL[.R'AX>'A\\\\!$%$-:U`Q7S]1_S\\\\BB%!2B5Q2'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'A\\\\\\\"@ M`B'Q(DCQ[$H=L;FGO;5:X(>'AX>J\\\"<]75\\\\B`P;Z@,-\\\"X@^&?S%$<JPV?-P;K MH9\\\\WS!=@-XQ<AX>'AS'$9@L+I4=Z>BJ[P#9U)5L4`LA75P);V6$KGJEXE5-3 M[>V+BXN+BXN+BXN+BXLT-,7%-#0T-#0T-#0T-#0TBXN+[>WM4[\\\"PSU?/@$H, M5\\\\]-(8AH:(#!0]QH:&S30QVQ:$,0L;&([/%'1T='W]_?W]_?W]^I=3:F:JQ2 M`2NTOJYN#N`0:.SP99LI])0GGV!1%X&,]\\\"0M<(>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AS'$9F8+I:5'1Z6E M\\\"V;$,3$QQ,3$9F8+\\\"PNEI0L+9L0Q,3$Q,3$Q,3'$Q&9F9@L+\\\"PL+\\\"PMF\\\"PL+ M\\\"PL+9L3$Q#$QAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX=4 M5%22DI*2DI*2DI*2DI*2DI*2DI*2DI*2DI*2DI*2DI*2DI*2DI*2DI*2DI*2 MDI*2DI*2DI*2DI*2DI*25%145%145%145%145%14%A86%A86%LG)R<G)R<G) MR<G)R<G)R<G)R<G)R<G)R<G)R<F)B8F)B8F)B8F)B8F)B8G)R<G)R<G)B8F) MB8F)B8F)B8F)3$Q,3$P/9\\\\4T-(OM[>U3L!D9<3T]F0,#7KN[*BHJ*GIZ>M_?

Are the Moslem fanatics who strap bombs to their backs and driving into Jewish embassies dying for the truth (hint: they think they are)? Were the NAZI soldiers in WWII dying for the truth?   People die for lies all the time.    Was Hitler a liar? How about Napoleon, Mussolini, Ronald Reagan? We spend millions of dollars a year trying to find techniques to detect lying? So the answer is no, they wouldn't be able to tell if he was a liar if he only lied about some things.   Why do you think he healed people, because the Bible says so? But if God doesn't exist (the other possibility) then the Bible is not divinely inspired and one can't use it as a piece of evidence, as it was written by unbiased observers.   Were Hitler or Mussolini lunatics? How about Genghis Khan, Jim Jones... there are thousands of examples through history of people being drawn to lunatics.   So we obviously cannot rule out liar or lunatic not to mention all the other possibilities not given in this triad.   Possibly self-fulfilling prophecy (ie he was aware what he should do in order to fulfil these prophecies), possibly selective diting on behalf of those keepers of the holy bible for a thousand years or so before the general; public had access. possibly also that the text is written in such riddles (like Nostradamus) that anything that happens can be twisted to fit the words of raving fictional 'prophecy'.

This past summer I upgraded (increased) the memory in a powerbook and a ci.   When I called to place the order for the PB RAM, I was told by the sales person that they would give me a $50 rebate if I would return the original RAM (which was also TechWorks RAM.)  I followed the instructions for returning the old RAM, expecting to see a credit on my VISA within a few weeks.  Well, months went by, and no credit.  After many calls (almost none of which were ever returned - arghhh) I finally found someone who told me \\\"Why we never received your old chips.\\\"  I then explained I the procedure that I had followed to return them, to which the person replied \\\"You mean you sent them US Mail?\\\" (which I had, per the original sales person's instructions.)  I was told that they their loss of US mail shipments is not uncommon (come on) and that I should have sent the stuff via FedEx, etc.  I reasoned that I had done exactly what I had been told to, but they would not budge, the people I spoke with were absolutely no help.  I sent letters, copies of the original receipts, attempted to trace the package through the US mail, made *many* more phone calls to TechWorks, all to no avail (I wouldn't give-up because I was so disgusted.) Sales/support people, supervisors, there was nothing I could do to pursuade them to \\\"make it right.\\\"  I finally (in total disgust) wrote a letter to my credit card company, asking them to investigate the problem.   Three weeks later, the credit miraculously appeared on my statement.  I have not (in recent memory) been so disgusted with the service that I received from a company.  In all fairness, they had no way of knowing that was not trying to rip them off, but I went to *such* great lengths to prove to them that this really happened.  Oh well, c'est la vie.

Box 605  Amherst, NY 14226-0605       COMPUTING CRATER DIAMETERS FROM EARTH-IMPACTING ASTEROIDS      Astrogeologist Gene Shoemaker proposes the following formula, based on     studies of cratering caused by nuclear tests.         (1/3.4)     D = S  S  c  K  W     : crater diameter in km   g  p  f  n          (1/6)     S = (g /g )      : gravity correction factor for bodies other than      g   e  t        Earth, where g = 9.8 m/s^2 and g is the surface          e        t          gravity of the target body. This scaling is          cited for lunar craters and may hold true for          other bodies.    (1/3.4)     S = (p / p )     : correction factor for target density p  ,      p   a   t           t          p  = 1.8 g/cm^3 for alluvium at the Jangle U           a          crater site, p = 2.6 g/cm^3 for average          rock on the continental shields.      C       : crater collapse factor, 1 for craters <= 3 km          in diameter, 1.3 for larger craters (on Earth).             (1/3.4)     K       : .074 km / (kT TNT equivalent)      n         empirically determined from the Jangle U          nuclear test crater.         3     2         19     W = pi * d * delta * V  / (12 * 4.185 * 10  )        : projectile kinetic energy in kT TNT equivalent          given diameter d, velocity v, and projectile          density delta in CGS units. delta of around 3          g/cm^3 is fairly good for an asteroid.      An RMS velocity of V = 20 km/sec may be used for Earth-crossing     asteroids.      Under these assumptions, the body which created the Barringer Meteor     Crater in Arizona (1.13 km diameter) would have been about 40 meters in     diameter.      More generally, one can use (after Gehrels, 1985):      Asteroid     Number of objects  Impact probability  Impact energy     diameter (km)         (impacts/year)    (* 5*10^20 ergs)       10       10       10^-8  10^9       1    1 000       10^-6  10^6       0.1        100 000       10^-4  10^3      assuming simple scaling laws.

The latter was written with     simplicity of exposition and suitability of digital computation in mind     (spherical trig formulae also appear, as do digitally-plotted examples).      More than you ever cared to know about map projections is in John     Snyder's USGS publication \\\"Map Projections--A Working Manual\\\", USGS     Professional Paper 1395. This contains detailed descriptions of 32     projections, with history, features, projection formulas (for both     spherical earth and ellipsoidal earth), and numerical test cases. It's a     neat book, all 382 pages worth. This one's $20.      You might also want the companion volume, by Snyder and Philip Voxland,     \\\"An Album of Map Projections\\\", USGS Professional Paper 1453. This     contains less detail on about 130 projections and variants. Formulas are     in the back, example plots in the front. $14, 250 pages.      You can order these 2 ways. The cheap, slow way is direct from USGS:     Earth Science Information Center, US Geological Survey, 507 National     Center, Reston, VA 22092. (800)-USA-MAPS. They can quote you a price and     tell you where to send your money. Expect a 6-8 week turnaround time.      A much faster way (about 1 week) is through Timely Discount Topos,     (303)-469-5022, 9769 W. 119th Drive, Suite 9, Broomfield, CO 80021. Call     them and tell them what you want. They'll quote a price, you send a     check, and then they go to USGS Customer Service Counter and pick it up     for you. Add about a $3-4 service charge, plus shipping.      A (perhaps more accessible) mapping article is:   R. Miller and F. Reddy, \\\"Mapping the World in Pascal\\\",  Byte V12 #14, December 1987   Contains Turbo Pascal procedures for five common map projections.

Any answer will be highly appreciated. Thanks in advance.  Regards,\",\"  The company was probably \\\"Public Missiles, Inc\\\" of Michigan.   Yup.   Nope, it's not illegal. It is, however, closely regulated. In order to  purchase and use the big rocket motors required, it is necessary to be one of the following: a) An employee of a government agency. b) An employee or student at a university doing research involving rockets. c) A member or representative of an educational organization involved in research or other uses of rockets. There are two such organizations:  The Tripoli Rocketry Association and the National Association of Rocketry. Members of either organization must demonstrate proficiency in construction and flight before they are allowed to purchase large motors on their own.  The FAA will issue a waiver of its regulations, upon request, to any  organization which can persuade them it has taken adequate precautions  to avoid conflicts with aircraft. The usual stipulations are: - Only operation up to a specified ceiling is allowed. Depending on the location, this ceiling may be from 5000 to 50000 feet AGL.  - The operator of the rocket is responsible for avoiding any aircraft within the operating radius around the launch site. - Flight into clouds or beyond visual range in haze is expressly prohibited. - The FAA will provide a NOTAM informing other users of the airspace that unmanned rocket operations are taking place at the specified place and time.  Most of the launches that are held (and there are dozens of them every year) are held in areas where air traffic is relatively light, such as over the western deserts (the Black Rock Desert north of Reno is particularly popular since it is 25 x 150 miles of *nothing to hit* on the ground).  The two rocketry associations test and approve motors for their members' use, to insure safety. Depending on motor size, the launcher setback is from 50 to 500 or more feet.   By the way, rockets under 1 lb and powered by an \\\"F\\\" motor are exempt from most Federal regulations on unmanned rockets anyway. See FAR 101, Subpart C, for details.  As for recovery...although the higher altitude rockets can reach up to 50,000 feet, most of them only get to 2,000 to 5,000 feet. The typical rocket is 2 to 6 inches in diameter, and carries a 3 to 6 foot parachute, or multiple parachutes, depending on the payload. Many rockets also carry either a small transmitter or an audio sounder--particularly at launches in the eastern US, where there are more obstructions.  Camera, telemetry transmitter, and video payloads are becoming quite common.   Why not? It's a lot of fun...check out the traffic on rec.models.rockets for information about the model (3 lb and under) and high power (everything bigger) rocket hobbies. As with all dangerous activities, the key is to practice safety. I've been flying consumer rockets ranging up to 4-5 lbs takeoff weight for 27 years, and still have all my extremities intact.   That's another thing. NO EXPLOSIVE WARHEADS OF ANY KIND ARE ALLOWED ON THESE ROCKETS. NONE! Please forgive me for shouting, but that's one of the biggest misconceptions people have about our hobby.   True. But it will not be related to the rocket hobby, unless I get  hit while crossing a road with a rocket in my hand. \",\"  Never said you didn't publish, merely that there is data you don't publish,  and that no-one scoriates you for those cases.

There is an issue also of measurement against a rule.  Thus the words that are spoken need to be compared against the rule/canon but not added to the canon.  Is new revelation necessary?  Topical, current, personal revelation I'd say is necessary.  New revelation for all people for all times is not necessary as we have that in Scripture.  You also seem to confuse canon with scripture.  Scripture may speak of itself being open - ie God speaking today.  It would speak that it is closed in the sense that the canon is unchangeable.  (Though the concept of canon is later historically.)   I agree with the problem of confusion.  If prophecy is meant to encourage, exhort or correct then is an overlap with scripture.  If prophecy is meant to bring a `word' of the form \\\"the man you live with is not your husband\\\" then that is knowledge.  Yet the exact words their are scripture. I would expect the difference to be the motive and means for delivery. The reading of scripture itself can be a powerful force.

AA and other 12-step abuse- recovery programs are acknowledged as being among the most effective.  Unfortunately, as evidence for God, this can be dismissed by stating that the same defect of personality makes substance abusers as makes  people 'religious', and the debunker could perhaps acknowledge that being religious is a better crutch than being a drug addict, but still maintain that both are escapism.  (And I suspect that there are some atheists who would find the substance abuse preferable to Christianity.)

Certainly this was mentioned on comp.sys.sgi on more than one occasion as being likely.  If our sales folks were saying otherwise, they were either confused, or less than honest/ethical, or somebody further up the chain inside SGI was misleading them.   There were 4 versions (20, 25, 30, 35), although admittedly the 30 came out at the same time as the 35, over a period of 2 1/2 years.  The chassis simply couldn't be pushed any further.  I'd say 4 years was a pretty good lifespan, myself, for a system design in this day and age.  Getting the 35 to work caused a lot of gray hairs in both the hardware and product design groups; we would have been out of our minds to push it further, and I *know* that was made clear, almost from the day the 35 started shipping.  We had one last kicker in the form of the Elan graphics, which made 3 graphics versions over its lifespan, which I also think is pretty good.   Please, by all means send a complaint letter through SGI support or sales on your concerns.  There should be no reason for sales folks to misrepresent future upgrades to customers (sure, sometimes there will be confusion for a while, over whether an upgrade will be available, but that shouldn't last too long, and doesn't seem to be what you are referring to).  Yes, the sales folks *do* get bonus's at the end of some (all?) quarters, but that is pretty common industry wide, and sometimes that can result in good deals for customers (sometimes it probably pushes folks into systems that aren't what they need, I'm sure, but nobody is *forcing* you to buy at end of quarter, after all...)   They don't get all that long a lead time either; although certainly they get presentations on possible new products, and their opinions may well influence the end product, but that also is life in the industry.  We can't design systems that meet just their needs, or we won't sell too many systems, after all (which is not to say that we don't have some niche products, like Reality Engine).   But surely you don't expect a system you buy now for a five year period to be constantly upgradable over that entire five year period?  That's a rather unreasonable expectation, in my experience (with workstations/microcomputers).  Supported, and parts available, yes, but certainly not upgradable to the latest and greatest!

He called a total of 4 penalties on the Habs and one on the Nordiques. The Nords' penalty came in O.T.  Stewart, being an ex-Nordique himself, was looking to call penalties on the Habs while letting the Nords get away with murder...WE WAS ROBBED!!!!  It was an excellent game with plenty of end-to-end rushes and tremendous goalkeeping.  The Nords tied it with over 1 minute to go while Lebeau was serving a penalty.  I don't mind Stewart calling a penalty in the last 5 min. of the game, but AT LEAST BE FAIR ABOUT IT.  The Nords were caught with their hand in the cookie jar more than once.  Stewart turned the other cheek...BASTARD!  Patrick Roy collapsed after letting in the tieing goal. He was shaky and on his knees for the rest of the night.  The winning goal shouldn't have gone in.

[From Chapter XX of _The Prince_, by N. Macchiavelli, as translated by Daniel Donno.]   In order to keep their lands secure, some princes have disarmed their subjects; others have prompted division within the cities they have subjugated.  Some have nurtured animosities against themselves; others have sought to win the approval of those they initially distrusted.  Some have erected fortresses; others have destroyed them.  Now, although it is impossible to set down definite judgements on all of these measures without considering the particular circumstances of the states where they may be employed, I shall nevertheless discuss them in such broad terms as the subject itself will allow.   To begin with, there has never been a case of a new prince disarming his subjects.  Indeed, whenever he found them disarmed, he proceeded to arm them.  For by arming your subjects, you make their arms your own.  Those among them who are suspicious become loyal, while those who are already loyal remain so, and from subjects they are transformed into partisans.  Though you cannot arm them all, nonetheless you increase your safety among those you leave unarmed by extending privileges to those you arm.  Your different treatment of the two categories will make the latter feel obligated to you, while the former will consider it proper thoat those who assume added duties and dangers should receive advantages.     When you disarm your subjects, however, you offend them, by showing that, either from cowardliness or from lack of faith, you distrust them; and either conclusion will induce them to hate you. Moreover, since it is impossible for you to remain unarmed, you would have to resort to mercenaries, whose limitations have already been discussed. Even if such troops were good, however, they could never be good enough to defend you from powerful enemies, and doubtful subjects.  Therefore, as I have said, a new prince in a newly acquired state has always taken measures to arm his subjects, and history is full of examples proving that this is so.   But when a prince takes posession of a new state which he annexes as an addition to his original domain, then he must disarm all the subjects of the new state except those who helped him to acquire it; and these, as time and occasion permit, he must seek to render soft and weak.  He must arrange matters in such a way that the arms of the entire state will be in the hands of soldiers who are native to his original domain.   ...\",\"Help!

I've got a problem that  I need as many people's help from as possible.  Before I go in to the details of this, let me go ahead and tell you that (though it may sound it) this is not one of those boy meets girl problem...at least not totally like that to me....Anyway...  OK, I am a 19 year old Sophmore at NCSU. About 10 years ago, my family and I were vacationing at the coast in a cottage we rented. Across the street, was ths girl who would whistle at me whenever she saw me... her name in Erin. Well, we became friends that week at the beach and have been writing each other for about 10 years....there was a period of about 2 years we lost contact..but that was a while ago.   By the way...Erin lives in Kansas and me in NC.  OK, last year in one of her letters, she says that she is coming back to NC to see some of her family who are gonna be there. So I drove about 4 hours to see her. This is where it begins....I spent the whole day with Erin....one of the best days of my life. Even though we had been writing each other, we still had to get used to being in person....she has got to be the most incredible woman I ever met. (She's one year older than me BTW). I mean, no person in the world could ask for a better person. Not only was she incredibly beautiful (not to  mention WAY out of my league...although I'm  not unattractive mind you), but she had a great personality and a great sence of humor. Her family is one of those families who goes to church but that is about the extent of their Christianity...you know the kind of people. But she knows I am a Christian.   Well, you get the idea of what I think of her. If there is ever such a thing as love at first sight....I found it. That was last year...I kid you not when I say that I have thought about her EVERY day since then.  In out letters, Erin and I always kid each other about not finding dates..(which is true for me, but I know it can't be for her). She has had some problems at home, her folks split up and she ended up leaving school....Now we are at the present...  Let me give you part of the letter I got from her last week....   \\\"Okay, now I'm going to try to explain my life to you. I'm not going to KU anymore because something just isn't right.

Apple can't deliver that right now because the 040 saps too much power, radiates far too much heat, and is too large for a notebook. How does one get around that without designing a new chipset? Use existing PowerBook technology to your best advantage. The Duo Dock gives Apple a unique ability to give users that 040 power in a \\\"Semi-Portable\\\" fashion. By plunking the 040 into the Dock, you've got \\\"quadra\\\" power at your desk. On the road, that 33mhz 68030 should be able to handle most of your needs. Okay, not the BEST solution, but its an answer to a no-win situation. :-) So, does this mean one will be able to use the PowerBook's processor in parallel to the dock's processor?

I see...  :-)   You can believe that if you wish.  It is undeniable, however, that people  have left the compound unharmed and alive earier in the standoff.  And since their leader was preaching that they would have an apocalypse, you  can not say undeniably that there wouldn't have been a mass suicide if the  FBI had simply stayed outside and waited another 51 days.   I am the heartless bleeding heart?  You are not making sense. You seem to have no concern that someone would keep children inside this  compound when they had 51 days to let them out.  That sounds pretty heartless  to me.  I just heard on the news that some of the survivors regret they hadn't  stayed in the inferno to prove their loyalty to Koresh.  This makes me  sad and sick.   Have you ever heard of Jonestown? The sad thing is the people inside the compound were the authority  worshipers and their only authority was Koresh/Howell.   If these  people were able to think for themselves, there would likely be a lot  more survivors today.  Koresh preached a fiery apocalypse as early as  last year.   By all means, the FBI should be investigated, too.

Here is a reply to one of the letters.  Seems to me that atheist do not like the doctrine of hell!]    Your using 20th century concepts to interprete 1st century writers.  Of course, in your termonology, God could not \\\"cease to exist.\\\"  However, that is not what death ever means in the Scriptures.  If you will study the word, you will see that it signifies \\\"separation.\\\"  Death is separation, not ceastation.  This is the reason for the agony of the cross.  For the first time in eternity, one member of the Godhead was separated from the other two.    I once met a young lady that was as beautiful as any model that ever lived.  She was as personable as any saint ever imagined.  She was to become my \\\"girlfriend\\\" for several years.  However, having been drafted, we were separated by distance.  To me that was a form of death.  Later, she decided that she couldn't wait for me to come home and bid me adue.  That to me was death.  It was separation from that which had made me whole.  Death is separation and eternal death is eternal separation from His fellowship, not because He chose to send you into outer darkness, but because you chose to go there.      When I rebelled against my earthly father, he spanked me.  I found no wisdom in that until I had grown older and especially until I had my own children.  He was trying to guide me away from hurt that would enter my life if I continued on my suicidal course.  He did it in love though I interpreted it as harsh and unloving.  If God warns of impending danger, that is love.  If choose to let us do as we please, and then at the end tell us the rules, that would be harsh.  You have a conscience, no matter how calused or fallen it is, that witnesses to you that a thing is wrong and that there is cause for fear.     This may give light to the error of your understanding.  One must have correct knowledge in order to have correct faith.  Faith and knowledge are inseparable.  Jesus most certainly felt the \\\"pinpricks\\\" of life.  As the Scripture say:  Heb. 4:15 For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all things as we are, yet without sin.  The kenosis passage of Phil 2 states that He gave up His Godhead attributes when He took upon Himself humanity.  It has been a favorite meditation of mine to think about this.  It was to be my PhD thesis.  \\\"The Consciousness of Christ.\\\"  I have talked at length with a great many people about this interesting study, including clh.    It is my conclussion that as Jesus, the 2nd member of the Trinity, actually suffered as we do.  He became part of the human race and experienced it as we do.  He \\\"grew in knowledge.\\\"  He chose not to grasp His omniscience, but chose to be taught.  It is my understanding that He was \\\"led of the Spirit\\\" to such an extent that sometimes it is hard to distinquish between Jesus the man and Jesus as God.  But in Jn 8 where the adulterous women was thrown before Him, the tenses are quite clear in that the whole situation took Him by surprise.  That is, He was not aware that this event was to take place in time.  He was living sequential history as you or I.    Maybe some other time we can discuss this, but it is a very lengthy discussion and one that causes the curcuit breakers of the brain to pop more often than not.   I was once a member of that club.  THe \\\"free thinker\\\" is a glorious ideal.  By contrast, of course, you believe that the believer is the unforunate repository of everything that is dogmatic, inhibited, reactionary and repressive.  I find such a stance to be as amusing as it is absurd.   If the liberal humanist wishes to criticize a Christian or a Buddhist or a Marxist, that is his right.  But what he must not pretend is that he was led to this solely by his \\\"rational doubt\\\" when in fact he was led to it by his \\\"faith\\\".  He must acknowledge that while it is rational doubt for him as a \\\"free thinker\\\" to criticize the Christian, it might equally be a rational doubt for the Christian to criticize him as a humanist.  If there is no faith, there can be no dout.  There is no faith which cannot choose to cast doubt on some other faith.  Pascal pointed out that \\\"sceptical arguments allow the positive to be positive.  Few. . .speak dubiously of scepticism.\\\"  The fact that skeptics are not skeptical about skepticism is further evidence that to doubt anything we must believe in something else!  THe person who is skeptical toward one faith or even most faiths, will be the devoted adherent of another.  In fact, it is a measure of his poverty both that he is unaware of it and that he can define himself only in negative terms, hence the term \\\"a\\\"-theist.  Some people claim otherwise and argue vociferously for complete skepticism.  In my campus ministry I ran across this more times than I care to remember.  However, they disproved their own argument with every thought, every word, every point of logic that they used.  Every moment of shared communication speaks against their total skepticism.  Their very insistence of trying to make sense is eloquent testimony to assumptions that are powerful though silent.  That is to say, that complete skepticism is impossible and limited skepticism is arbitrary.  Next time you're in a room of skeptics, yell out \\\"Look, your fly is undone!\\\"  Each person chooses what he is skeptical about and what he believes without skepticism.  To stress this is to belabor the obvious, but it underlines the point that no one can know exhaustively how he knows what he knows.  Pure objectivism is a myth and complete skepticism an impossiblity.  The answer to this impasse lies in  a 3rd way of knowing, one which is based on presuppositions.  But if knowledge proceeds on what must be presupposed before it is proved, the cover is blown on the pretentions of critical doubt, and critical doubt depends on the idea that human knowledge is totally objective and neutral.  In other words, another myth.    Presuppositions my friend.  It is impossible to doubt anything unless there is something we do not doubt -our own assumptions/presuppostions.  Even these can be criticezed only upon the basis of other assumptions.  Presuppostitons are our silent partners in thought but their silence must not be mistaken for absence.   Of course that is hardly an original statement.  Milton coined it but it had been in use for millenia.  It was even used in the first \\\"Highlander\\\" movie.  But again, your presuption is based on a faulty knowledge of the character of God.  You are operating off of a presuppositional premise of humanistic theology, not what He has revealed of Himself through history, through His prophets, through His Word, and lastly, but most of all, thru His Son.  If you are to reject God's annointed savior, then reject Him from a correct understanding of Himself.\",\"Can anyone tell me where to find a MPEG viewer (either DOS or Windows).

In practice I suspect most people do what you describe.   If you don't slide the tyre, you have no way of knowing whether you've achieved maximum braking or not. I'm not suggesting that you should always aim to brake as hard as you possibly can - but if you want to find the limits of the machine, you have to go beyond them. \",\"  This sounds like a VERY good thing to do.

I have a record that shows a IIsi with and without a 64KB cache. It's small enough that I will attach it.  I have also measured some real programs with and without the 64 KB cache.  The speedup varies a lot from app to app, ranging from 0% to 40%.  I think an average of 20%-25% is about right.  The subjective difference is not great, but is sometimes noticable.  A simple cache card certainly does not transform a IIsi into something enormously better.  I do not have an FPU.  The conventional wisdom says that cache cards from all of the makers offer about the same speedup and that there is not much difference between 32K and 64K caches.

Haldeman from his 1991 book _Homosexuality_  THERAPY INEFFECTIVE  Recently the founders of yet another prominent \\\"ex-gay\\\" ministry, Exodus International, denounced their conversion therapy procedures as ineffective. Michael Busse and Gary Cooper, cofounders of Exodus International and lovers for 13 years, were involved with the organization from 1976 to 1979.  The program was described by these men as \\\"ineffective . . . not one person was healed.\\\"  They stated that the program often exacerbated already prominent feelings of guilt and personal failure among the counselees; many were driven to suicidal thoughts as a result of the failed \\\"reparative therapy.\\\"  The previous article quoted in the last posting is from THE ADVOCATE, June 30, 1992 called \\\"The Ex-Ex-Gay\\\" by Robert Pela.  Some personal thoughts:  It is of no great astonishment that there is a concerted effort by a major portion of the Church to control and mandate change of a minority among its ranks.  This was the momentum behind the Spanish Inquisition, only all they required was a confession of faith (after much torture) and then, to save their souls they would dispatch them to heaven through death.  Even later, the Bible was used vigorously to defend slavery, oppression and segragation of African-Americans, even to the justification of lynchings. Today's scholars are just a bit more slick in their approach.  The tool is still coersion, but now it is mostly by means of brainwashing and mind control, convincing people that they should see themselves as less than God sees them, then maintaining a cultic hold on them until it is felt thier mind-conditioning is complete.  Sure, no one is \\\"physically\\\" forced to stay in this \\\"reparative therapy\\\" but sheer social pressure is enough for many to keep themselves in this new found bondage of self-hate.  As an abolitionist I advocate the abolishment of oppression and persecution against gays in all facets of civil life.  A person should be judged by the contibution, or non-contribution to the society in which they live, not by some high-brow standard of conformity imposed by those who haven';t a clue what is in their heart.  For those who seek more information about Gays and groups that accept them please contact your nearest chapter of PFLAG (Parents & Friends of Lesbians And Gays) who will be more than happy to assist you.  This is a group of people comprised of Gays, Lesbians and Bisexuals, their parents and friends who have formed a support group for help and understanding.  Try talking to a parent of a gay son or daughter and learn some \\\"first-hand\\\" real life and loving understanding.  God's love and understanding for Gay people is no less abundant.\",\"   [chop]  Could you please post it to the net too please, as I, and I'm sure many others would like to know.  Thanks!

In comparison, in  the United States, reported cases of gonorrhea in 1992 continued an overall  decreasing trend (1). This report summarizes an analysis of the increase in  gonorrhea in Colorado in 1992 and characterizes trends in the occurrence of  this disease from 1985 through 1992.       In 1992, 4679 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the Colorado Department  of Health (CDH) compared with 3901 cases reported in 1991. During 1992,  reported cases increased 22.7% and 17.5% among females and males, respectively  (Table 1). Similar increases occurred among blacks, whites, and Hispanics  (15.6%, 15.1%, and 15.9%, respectively); however, the number of reported cases  with race not specified increased 88% from 1991 to 1992 and constituted 9.7%  of all reported cases in 1992. Although the largest proportional increases by  age groups occurred among persons aged 35-44 years (80.4%) and greater than or  equal to 45 years (87.7%), these age groups accounted for only 11.0% of all  reported cases in 1992. Persons in the 15-19-year age group accounted for the  largest number of reported cases of gonorrhea during 1992 and the highest age  group-specific rate (639 per 100,000).       Reported cases of gonorrhea increased 32.9% in the five-county Denver  metropolitan area (1990 population: 1,629,466) but decreased elsewhere in the  state (Table 1). Half the cases of gonorrhea in the Denver metropolitan area  occurred in 8.4% (34) of the census tracts; these represent neighborhoods  considered by sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)/acquired immunodeficiency  syndrome (AIDS) field staff to be the focus of gang and drug activity.       When compared with 1991, the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed among  men in the Denver Metro Health Clinic (DMHC, the primary public STD clinic in  the Denver metropolitan area) increased 33% in 1992, and the number of visits  by males to the clinic increased 2.4%. Concurrently, the number of cases  diagnosed among women increased by 1%. Among self-identified heterosexual men,  the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed at DMHC increased 33% and comprised  94% of all cases diagnosed in males, while the number of cases diagnosed among  self-identified homosexual men remained low (71 and 74 in 1991 and 1992,  respectively).       Four selected laboratories in the metropolitan Denver area (i.e., HMO,  university hospital, nonprofit family planning, and commercial) were contacted  to determine whether gonorrhea culture-positivity rates increased. Gonorrhea  culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories contacted increased  23%-33% from 1991 to 1992, while the rate was virtually unchanged in the  fourth (i.e., nonprofit family planning).       From 1985 through 1991, reported cases of gonorrhea among whites and  Hispanics in Colorado decreased; in comparison, reported cases among blacks   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 14 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  increased since 1988 (Figure 1). During 1988-1992, the population in Colorado  increased 9.9% for blacks, 9.8% for Hispanics, and 4.5% for whites. In 1992,  the gonorrhea rate for blacks (1935 per 100,000 persons) was 57 times that for  whites (34 per 100,000) and 12 times that for Hispanics (156 per 100,000)  (Table 1). Among black females, reported cases of gonorrhea increased from  1988 through 1992 in the 15-19-year age group; among black males, cases  increased from 1989 through 1992 in both the 15-19-and 20-24-year age groups.   Reported by: KA Gershman, MD, JM Finn, NE Spencer, MSPH, STD/AIDS Program; RE  Hoffman, MD, State Epidemiologist, Colorado Dept of Health. JM Douglas, MD,  Denver Dept of Health and Hospitals. Surveillance and Information Systems Br,  Div of Sexually Transmitted Diseases and HIV Prevention, National Center for  Prevention Svcs, CDC.   Editorial Note: The increase in reported gonorrhea cases in Colorado in 1992  may represent an overall increase in the occurrence of this disease or more  complete reporting stimulated by visitations to laboratories by CDH  surveillance staff during 1991-1992. The increases in confirmed gonorrhea  cases at DMHC and in culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories  suggest a real increase in gonorrhea rather than a reporting artifact.  However, the stable culture-positivity rate in the nonprofit family planning  laboratory (which serves a network of clinics statewide) indicates that the  gonorrhea increase did not uniformly affect all segments of the population.       One possible explanation for the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in  Colorado may be gang- and drug-related sexual behavior, as implicated in a  recent outbreak of drug-resistant gonorrhea and other STDs in Colorado Springs  (2). Although the high morbidity census tracts in the Denver metropolitan area  coincide with areas of gang and drug activity, this hypothesis requires  further assessment. To examine the possible role of drug use -- implicated  previously as a factor contributing to the national increase in syphilis (3-6)  -- the CDH STD/AIDS program is collecting information from all persons in whom  gonorrhea is diagnosed regarding drug use, exchange of sex for money or drugs,  and gang affiliation.       The gonorrhea rate for blacks in Colorado substantially exceeds the  national health objective for the year 2000 (1300 per 100,000) (objective  19.1a) (7). Race is likely a risk marker rather than a risk factor for  gonorrhea and other STDs. Risk markers may be useful for identifying groups at  greatest risk for STDs and for targeting prevention efforts. Moreover, race- specific variation in STD rates may reflect differences in factors such as  socioeconomic status, access to medical care, and high-risk behaviors.       In response to the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in Colorado,  interventions initiated by the CDH STD/AIDS program include 1) targeting  partner notification in the Denver metropolitan area to persons in groups at  increased risk (e.g., 15-19-year-old black females and 20-24-year-old black  males); 2) implementing a media campaign (e.g., public service radio   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 15 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  announcements, signs on city buses, newspaper advertisements, and posters in  schools and clinics) to promote awareness of STD risk and prevention targeted  primarily at high-risk groups, and 3) developing teams of peer educators to  perform educational outreach in high-risk neighborhoods. The educational  interventions are being developed and implemented with the assistance of  members of the target groups and with input from a forum of community leaders  and health-care providers.

Child safety seats and safety  belts can substantially reduce this loss (2). From 1977 through 1985, all 50  states passed legislation requiring the use of child safety seats or safety  belts for children. Although these laws reduce injuries to young children by  an estimated 8%-59% (3,4), motor-vehicle crash-related injuries remain a major  cause of disability and death among U.S. children (1), while the use of  occupant restraints among children decreases inversely with age (84% usage for  those aged 0-4 years; 57%, aged 5-11 years; and 29%, aged 12-18 years) (5). In  addition, parents who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to  use restraints for their children (6). To characterize the association between  adult safety-belt use and adult-reported consistent use of occupant restraints  for the youngest child aged less than 11 years within a household, CDC  analyzed data obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System  (BRFSS) during 1988 and 1989. This report summarizes the findings from this  study.       Data were available for 20,905 respondents aged greater than or equal to  18 years in 11 states * that participated in BRFSS -- a population-based,  random-digit-dialed telephone survey -- and administered a standard Injury  Control and Child Safety Module developed by CDC. Of these respondents, 5499  (26%) had a child aged less than 11 years in their household. Each respondent  was asked to specify the child's age and the frequency of restraint use for  that child. The two categories of child restraint and adult safety-belt use in  this analysis were 1) consistent use (i.e., always buckle up) and 2) less than  consistent use (i.e., almost always, sometimes, rarely, or never buckle up).  Data were weighted to provide estimates representative of each state. Software  for Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) (7) was used to calculate point estimates  and confidence intervals. Statistically significant differences were defined  by p values of less than 0.05.       Each of the 11 states had some type of child restraint law. Of these, six  (Arizona, Kentucky, Maine, Nebraska, Rhode Island, and West Virginia) had no  law requiring adults to use safety belts; four (Idaho, Maryland, Pennsylvania,  and Washington) had a secondary enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., a  vehicle had to be stopped for a traffic violation before a citation for nonuse  of safety belts could be issued); and one state (New York) had a primary  enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., vehicles could be stopped for a  safety-belt law violation alone). In nine states, child-passenger protection   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 17 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  laws included all children aged less than 5 years, but the other two states  used both age and size of the child as criteria for mandatory restraint use.  The analysis in this report subgrouped states into 1) those having a law  requiring adult safety-belt use (law states), and 2) those without such a law  (no-law states).       Overall, 21% of children aged less than 11 years reportedly were not  consistently restrained during automobile travel. Both child restraint use and  adult restraint use were significantly higher (p less than 0.05, chi-square  test) in law states than in no-law states (81.1% versus 74.3% and 58.7% versus  43.2%, respectively).       High rates of restraint use for children aged less than or equal to 1  year were reported by both adults indicating consistent and less than  consistent safety-belt use (Figure 1). Adults with consistent use reported  high rates of child-occupant restraint use regardless of the child's age  (range: 95.5% for 1-year-olds to 84.7% for 10-year-olds). In comparison, for  adults reporting less than consistent safety-belt use, the rate of child- occupant restraint use declined sharply by the age of the child (range: 93.1%  for 1-year-olds to 28.8% for 10-year-olds). When comparing children of  consistent adult safety-belt users with children of less than consistent adult  safety-belt users, 95% confidence intervals overlap for the two youngest age  groups (i.e., aged less than 1 and 1 year).       Reported child-occupant restraint use in law states generally exceeded  that in no-law states, regardless of age of child (Table 1). In addition,  higher adult educational attainment was significantly associated with  increased restraint use for children, a factor that has also been associated  with increased adult safety-belt use (8).   Reported by: National Center for Injury Prevention and Control; National  Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC.   Editorial Note: The findings in this report are consistent with others  indicating that adults who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely  to employ occupant restraints for their children (6,9). Because these  nonbelted adults are at increased risk of crashing and more likely to exhibit  other risk-taking behaviors, children traveling with them may be at greater  risk for motor-vehicle injury (10).       Educational attainment of adult respondents was inversely associated with  child restraint use in this report. Accordingly, occupant-protection programs  should be promoted among parents with low educational attainment. Because low  educational attainment is often associated with low socioeconomic status, such  programs should be offered to adults through health-care facilities that serve  low-income communities or through federal programs (i.e., Head Start) that are  directed at parents with young children.       Injury-prevention programs emphasize restraining young children. In  addition, however, efforts must be intensified to protect child occupants as   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 18 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  they become older. Parents, especially those with low educational attainment,  those who do not consistently wear safety belts, and those from states that do  not have mandatory safety-belt use laws, should be encouraged to wear safety  belts and to protect their children by using approved child safety seats and  safety belts. Finally, the increased use of restraints among children may  increase their likelihood of using safety belts when they become teenagers --  the age group characterized by the lowest rate of safety-belt use and the  highest rate of fatal crashes (5).

SURVEILLANCE FOR AND COMPARISON OF BIRTH DEFECT PREVALENCES                                IN TWO GEOGRAPHIC                          AREAS -- UNITED STATES, 1983-88        Problem/Condition: CDC and some states have developed surveillance  systems to monitor the birth prevalence of major defects.       Reporting Period Covered: This report covers birth defects surveillance  in metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia, and selected jurisdictions in California for  the years 1983-1988.       Description of System: The California Birth Defects Monitoring Program  and the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program are two population- based surveillance systems that employ similar data collection methods. The  prevalence estimates for 44 diagnostic categories were based on data for 1983- 1988 for 639,837 births in California and 152,970 births in metropolitan  Atlanta. The prevalences in the two areas were compared, adjusting for race,  sex, and maternal age by using Poisson regression.       Results: Regional differences in the prevalence of aortic stenosis, fetal  alcohol syndrome, hip dislocation/dysplasia, microcephalus, obstruction of the  kidney/ureter, and scoliosis/lordosis may be attributable to general  diagnostic variability. However, differences in the prevalences of arm/hand  limb reduction, encephalocele, spina bifida, or trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) are  probably not attributable to differences in ascertainment, because these  defects are relatively easy to diagnose.       Interpretation: Regional differences in prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy  termination may affect prevalences of trisomy 21 and spina bifida. However,  the reason for differences in arm/hand reduction is unknown, but may be  related to variability in environmental exposure, heterogeneity in the gene  pool, or random variation.       Actions Taken: Because of the similarities of these data bases, several  collaborative studies are being implemented. In particular, the differences in  the birth prevalence of spina bifida and Down syndrome will focus attention on  the impact of prenatal diagnosis.

INFLUENZA -- UNITED STATES, 1988-89       Problem/Condition: CDC monitors the emergence and spread of new influenza  virus variants and the impact of influenza on morbidity and mortality annually  from October through May.       Reporting Period Covered: This report covers U.S. influenza surveillance  conducted from October 1988 through May 1989.       Description of System: Weekly reports from the vital statistics offices  of 121 cities provided an index of influenza's impact on mortality; 58 WHO  collaborating laboratories reported weekly identification of influenza  viruses; weekly morbidity reports were received both from the state and  territorial epidemiologists and from 153 sentinel family practice physicians.  Nonsystematic reports of outbreaks and unusual illnesses were received  throughout the year.       Results: During the 1988-89 influenza season, influenza A(H1N1) and B  viruses were identified in the United States with essentially equal frequency  overall, although both regional and temporal patterns of predominance shifted  over the course of the season. Throughout the season increases in the indices  of influenza morbidity in regions where influenza A(H1N1) predominated were  similar to increases in regions where influenza B predominated. Only 7% of  identified viruses were influenza A(H3N2), but isolations of this subtype  increased as the season waned, and it subsequently predominated during the  1989-90 season. During the 1988-89 season outbreaks in nursing homes were  reported in association with influenza B and A(H3N2) but not influenza  A(H1N1).       Interpretation: The alternating temporal and geographic predominance of  influenza strains A(H1N1) and B during the 1988-89 season emphasizes the  importance of continual attention to regional viral strain surveillance, since  amantadine is effective only for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A.       Actions Taken: Weekly interim analyses of surveillance data produced  throughout the season allow physicians and public health officials to make  informed choices regarding appropriate use of amantadine. CDC's annual  surveillance allows the observed viral variants to be assessed as candidates  for inclusion as components in vaccines used in subsequent influenza seasons.  Authors: Louisa E.

Copyright 1993, The University of Arizona                   High Tech Assisted Reproductive Technologies  Following the birth of the first in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF- ET) baby in 1978, a host of assisted reproductive technologies have been  developed that include IVF-ET, gamete intrafallopian tube transfer (GIFT),  embryo cryopreservation (freezing) and gamete micromanipulation. Together,  these technologies are referred to as the high-tech assisted reproductive  technology (ART) procedures.   Ovulation induction, sperm insemination and surgery for tubal disease and/or  pathology still are the mainstays of the therapies available for infertility  management. However, when these fail, it almost always is appropriate to  proceed with one of the ART procedures.   Therefore, in addition to a comprehensive basic and general infertility  service at The University of Arizona Center for Reproductive Endocrinology and  Infertility, there is a program of Assisted Reproduction that specializes in  ART procedures. This program serves as a tertiary provider for those patients  in the state of Arizona whose infertility problems cannot be resolved by the  traditional therapies.   The following article (on back) describes the ART procedures available in our  Center, clarifies appropriate applications for each, and considers the  realistic expectations for their success. Procedures included are:   o in vitro  o fertilization - embryo transfer (IVF-ET),  gamete intrafallopian tube    transfer  o (GIFT),  cryopreservation of human embryos and  gamete micromanipulation.  This article also considers ongoing research in our program that is directed  towards improved success of these technologies.

This technology involves biopsying the preimplantation human embryo and then  subjecting the biopsied cells to genetic analysis using either DNA  amplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization.   There are recent reports of the successful application of DNA amplification by  other centers, for example, for diagnosis of the genes for cystic fibrosis and  hemophilia. We hope to apply and further focus fluorescent in situ  hybridization technology for probing the X chromosome, the identification of  which will provide a scientific basis for counselling patients who exhibit  sex-linked disorders.   The considerable clinical application of such technology lies in the fact that  it circumvents the need for prenatal diagnosis, in addition to the possibility  of a subsequent termination of affected fetuses, in order to avoid the birth  of affected children.

In Vitro Fertilization - Embryo Transfer is the core ART procedure of our  Assisted Reproduction Program.  This procedure involves retrieval of  unfertilized eggs from the ovary, their insemination in vitro in a dish, and  the culture of resultant embryos for 1 or 2 days, before they are transferred  to the patient's uterus. All cultures are maintained in an incubator under  strictly controlled atmospheric and temperature conditions. Before being  processed for use in insemination, semen samples are evaluated in our  andrology laboratory using both subjective light microscopy and computer-  HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 25 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  assisted semen analyses. To ensure an adequate number of eggs with which to  perform IVF-ET, or indeed, GIFT, follicular development is typically  stimulated, with gonadotropins (perganol, metrodin), gonadotropin releasing  hormone (GnRH, Factrel, lutrepulse) and/or GnRH analogues (lupron, Depo  lupron, synarel). Occasionally, however, IVF-ET is accomplished with eggs  obtained in non-stimulated cycles. While some programs utilize laparoscopic  egg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia,  we undertake the less costly approach of ultrasound-guided retrieval in our  Infertility Unit, with the patient sedated.        Couples who resort to IVF-ET exhibit such pathologies as tubal  deficiencies, ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, and/or mild forms of male  factor infertility.  According to the United States IVF Registry, the overall  success rate for IVF-ET nationwide has stabilized at about 14 percent per  cycle. Results from our program, involving 86 patients who have undergone 173  IVF-ET cycles, reflect a comparable success rate.       Nevertheless, the overall incidence of success with this procedure is  disconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiological  factors that limit achievement of a higher percentage of pregnancies.  Well  recognized predictors of outcome include patient age, response to exogenous  ovarian stimulation, quality of sperm and number of repeated IVF-ET cycle  attempts. However, among these, age is the single most significant determinant  of conception. Therefore, it is critical that such patients are referred to an  Assisted Reproduction Program at the earliest opportunity following failure of  traditional therapies.       The underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has not  been clearly delineated beyond recognition that: 1) the number of eggs  available for retrieval declines markedly with age; 2) fertilization rates  significantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over 40 years;  and 3) provided the appropriate hormonal background is present, age is  unrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy. Ongoing research in our  Center, therefore, is investigating physiological changes in the egg that may  be impacted by age. We have determined that more than 50 percent of eggs that  fail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal, and that a significant  proportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age. Currently,  the only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from a donor. Our  program has initiated recruitment of volunteer egg donors to satisfy the needs  of a list of recipients interested in this form of therapy.        GIFT - This high-tech ART procedure is performed in the operating room,  usually with the use of a laparoscope and, in contrast to IVF-ET, involves  introducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the Fallopian  tube (an average of 3 eggs/tube). Under these circumstances, fertilization  occurs in vivo and, if excess eggs are retrieved, the remainder undergo IVF,  with subsequent options for embryo transfer in that cycle, or freezing for  transfer in a subsequent cycle. This ART procedure is applied to cases in   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 26 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  which there is at least one patent Fallopian tube but the couple has such  pathologies as ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, male factor infertility  and/or idiopathic infertility.          The data reported in the United States IVF Registry for 1985 through 1990  indicate that the overall success rate with GIFT is higher than that obtained  with the IVF-ET technique (range of clinical pregnancies for GIFT is 24 to 36  percent and for IVF-ET 14 to 18 percent). In view of this fact, one might  expect more patients to be treated with GIFT than IVF-ET. However, in our  program we have taken into account three basic concerns which, while  substantially reducing the number of GIFT cycles performed, benefit the  patient. These concerns are: 1) the increased costs associated with performing  a procedure in the operating room; 2) the risks, albeit minimal, of undergoing  general anesthesia; and 3) the considerable benefits to be accrued from  obtaining direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the eggs,  and the developmental competency of resultant embryos.       The increased success with GIFT undoubtedly reflects the artificial  environment provided by the laboratory in the IVF-ET procedure. Between  January 1, 1991, and December 31, 1992, we have performed a total of 12 GIFT  cycles, with an overall success rate of 20 percent.       Embryo cryopreservation, or freezing, is applied in our program when  embryos result from residual GIFT eggs or from non-transferred IVF embryos.  This procedure not only provides patients with a subsequent opportunity for  success at much reduced costs, but also circumvents the legal and ethical  issues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos. Therefore, as stipulated  by the American Fertility Society ethical guidelines for ART programs, from  both a practical and an ethical standpoint, all Assisted Reproduction programs  should have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys.       Gamete Micromanipulation - This ART procedure, which is still very new,  is applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen but  who have severe male factor infertility (less than 10 million sperm/ml in  combination with fewer than 20 perccent motile sperm, and/or less than 10  percent sperm with normal morphology). We are currently developing the  procedure of sub-zonal insertion (SZI), which entails injecting sperm under  the coating around the egg, the barrier normally penetrated by the sperm  through enzymatic digestion.       Available data from SZI programs world-wide indicate that only 5 to 10  percent of SZI cycles result in a pregnancy. This statistic undoubtedly  relates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the sperm.  Therefore, we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniques  for the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation. Such  efforts are unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that this technology  offers the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patients to  establish conception.

In the San Jose area we have a population of 800,000 and that population is served by 2 ice arenas.  In contrast, Kamloops, British Columbia has a population of about 50,000 and has 5 rinks!  There are also myriad ponds, pools, etc that freeze in the winter.  Down here it's hard to find a kid without a bicycle; up there it's hard to find a kid without a pair of skates.  And before you say \\\"what does he know? He's from California.\\\" let me say that I was born and raised in Trail, British Columbia, a town of about 8,000 with lots of ice in the winter.  My father did radio play by play for the local team, the Trail Smokeaters, who by  the way, were the last Canadian team to win the World Championship (back in 1961).  I was on skates almost as soon as I could walk, and have been playing recreational hockey for about 35 years.    Lack of ice is a big factor, but costs is a bigger factor.  Both my kids play for the Santa Clara Valley Hockey Association and this season, which just ended, cost me $75 per kid for membership in Hockey USA, plus $750 per kid for club dues.  The Hockey USA fees cover excess medical insurance, and the club dues cover ice time, officials, trophies, etc.  Other areas have similar fees, unless the city government subsidises some of the costs, as Stockton does.  By the way; most ice arenas are located in what could be called the \\\"inner city\\\" areas.  Eastridge and Vallco are exceptions ... Redwood City's rink is in an industrial area on Bay Rd, near 101, Berkeley's is near Ashby and Martin Luther King, Stockton's is in Oak Park, Sacramento's is in an older section of downtown (I forget the name of the street), Fresno's is out on the edge of town, just west of 99.  Santa Rosa's is a nice rink, but it's in an older section of town. Dublin's is outside of town, off 580.  Most of the rinks are old, and expensive to run, with huge electric bills and insurance premiums.  If you want to buy ice time expect to pay around $100 per hour at any of these rinks.  Some of them give you a 60 minute hour for your money; others give you a 50 minute hour and include the resurfacing time in the fee.  \",\"Another fish to check out is Richard Rast -- he works for Lockheed Missiles, but is on-site at NASA Johnson.

We paid for it in human casualties and crippled fates--the price was too great! Now, after the Sumgait tragedy, we, the victims, divide our lives into \\\"before\\\" and ''after.\\\" We talk like that: that was before the war. Like the people who went through World War II and considered it a whole epoch, a fate. No matter how many years go by, no matter how long we live, it will never be forgotten. On the contrary, some of the moments become even  sharper: in our rage, in our sorrow, we saw everything differently, but now . . . They say that you can see more with distance, and we can see those inhuman events with more clarity now . . . we more acutely perceive our losses and everything that happened.  Nineteen eighty-eight was a leap year. Everyone fears a leap year and wants it to pass as quickly as possible. Yet we never thought that that leap year would be such a black one for every Sumgait Armenian: those who lost someone and  those who didn't.  That second to last day of winter was ordinary for our family, although you  could already smell danger in the air. But we didn't think that the danger was near and possible, so we didn't take any steps to save ourselves. At least, as my parents say, at least we should have done something to save the children.  My parents themselves are not that old, 52 and 53 years. But then they thought that they had already lived enough, and did everything they could to save us.  In our apartment the tragedy started on February 28, around five in the afternoon. I call it a tragedy, and I repeat: it was a tragedy even though all our family survived. When I recall how they broke down our door my skin crawls; even now, among Armenians, among people who wish me only well, I feel like it's all starting over again. I remember how that mob broke into our  apartment . . . My parents were standing in the hall. My father had an axe in  his hands and had immediately locked both of the doors. Our door was rarely  locked since friends and neighbors often dropped by. We're known as a  hospitable family, and we just never really thought about whether the people  who were coming to see us were Azerbaijanis, Jews, or Russians. We had friends of many nationalities, even a Turkmen woman.  My parents were in the hall, my father with an axe. I remember him telling my  mother, \\\"Run to the kitchen for a knife.\\\" But Mother was detached, pale, as  though she had decided to sell her life a bit dearer. To be honest I never  expected it of her, she's afraid of getting shot and afraid of the dark. A  girlfriend was at the house that day, a Russian girl, Lyuda, and Mamma said,  \\\"No matter what happens, no matter what they do to us, you're not to come out  of the bedroom. We're going to tell them that we're alone in the apartment.\\\"  We went into the bedroom. There were four of us. Marina and the Russian girl  crawled under the bed, and we covered them up with a rug, boxes of dishes, and Karina and I are standing there and looking at one another. The idea that  perhaps we were seeing each other for the last time flashed somewhere inside  me. I'm an emotional person and I express my emotions immediately. I wanted to embrace her and kiss her, as though it were the last second. And maybe Karina  was thinking the same thing, but she's quite reserved. We didn't have time to  say anything to each other because we immediately heard Mamma raise a shout.  There was so much noise from the tramping of feet, from the shouting, and from excited voices. I couldn't figure what was going on out there because the door to the bedroom was only open a crack. But when Mamma shouted the second time Karina ran out of the bedroom. I ran after her, I had wanted to hold her back, but when she opened the door and ran out into the hall they saw us  immediately. The only thing I managed to do was close the door behind me, at  least so as to save Marina and her friend. The mob was shouting, all of their  eyes were shining, all red, like from insomnia. At first about 40 people burst in, but later I was standing with my back to the door and couldn't see. They  came into the hall, into the kitchen, and dragged my father into the other  room. He didn't utter a word, he just raised the axe to hit them, but Mamma  snatched the axe from behind and said, \\\"Tell them not to touch the children.  Tell them they can do as they want with us, but not to harm the children.\\\" She said this to Father in Armenian.  There were Azerbaijanis from Armenia among the mob who broke in. They  understood Armenian perfectly. The local Azerbaijanis don't know Armenian,  they don't need to speak it. And one of them responded in Armenian: \\\"You and  your children both . . . we're going to do the same thing to you and your  children that you Armenians did in Kafan. They killed our women, our girls,  our mothers, they cut their breasts off, and burned our houses . . . ,\\\" and  so on and so forth, \\\"and we came to do the same thing to you.\\\" This whole time some of them are destroying the house and the others are shouting at us. They  were mostly young people, under 30. At first there weren't any older people  among them. And all of their faces were unfamiliar. Sumgait is a small town,  all the same, and we know a lot of people by their faces, especially me, I'm  a teacher.  So they dragged my father into the other room. They twisted his arms and took  him in there, no they didn't take him in there, they dragged him in there, because he was already unable to walk. They closed the door to that room all  but a crack. We couldn't see what was happening to Father, what they were  doing to him. Then a young man, about 26 years old, started to tear off  Mamma's sarafan, and Mamma shouted at him in Azerbaijani: \\\"I'm old enough to  be your mother! What are you doing?!\\\" He struck her. Now he's being held,  Mamma identified him. I hope he's convicted. Then they went after Karina,  who's been talking to them like a Komsomol leader, as though she were trying  to lead them down a different path, as they say, to influence their  consciousness. She told them that what they were doing was wrong, that they  mustn't do it. She said, \\\"Come on, let's straighten this out, without  emotions. What do you want? Who are you? Why did you come here? What did we  ever do to you?\\\" Someone tried to explain who they were and why they had come  into our home, but then the ones in the back--more of them kept coming and  coming--said, \\\"What are you talking to, them for. You should kill them. We  came here to kill them.\\\"  They pushed Karina, struck her, and she fell down. They beat her, but she  didn't cry out. Even when they tore her clothes off, she kept repeating, \\\"What did we do to you? What did we do to you?\\\" And even later, when she came to,  she said, \\\"Mamma, what did we do to them? Why did they do that to us?\\\"  That group was prepared, I know this because I noticed that some of them only  broke up furniture, and others only dealt with us. I remember that when they  were beating me, when they were tearing my clothes off, I felt neither pain  nor shame because my entire attention was riveted to Karina. All I could do  was watch how much they beat her and how painful it was for her, and what they did to her. That's why I felt no pain. Later, when they carried Karina off,  they beat her savagely . . . It's really amazing that she not only lived, but  didn't lose her mind . She is very beautiful and they did everything they  could to destroy her beauty. Mostly they beat her face, with their fists,  kicking her, using anything they could find.  Mamma, Karina, and I were all in one room. And again I didn't feel any pain,  just didn't feel any, no matter how much they beat me, no matter what they  did. Then one of those creeps said that there wasn't enough room in the apartment. They broke up the beds and the desk and moved everything into the  corners so there would be more room. Then someone suggested, \\\"Let's take her  outside.\\\"  Those beasts were in Heaven. They did what they would do every day if they  weren't afraid of the authorities. Those were their true colors. At the time  I thought that in fact they would always behave that way if they weren't  afraid of what would happen to them.  When they carried Karina out and beat Mamma-her face was completely covered  with blood--that's when I started to feel the pain. I blacked out several  times from the pain, but each moment that I had my eyes open it was as though  I were recording it all on film. I think I'm a kind person by nature, but I'm  vengeful, especially if someone is mean to me, and I don't deserve it. I hold  a grudge a long time if someone intentionally causes me pain. And every time  I would come to and see one of those animals on top of me, I'd remember them,  and I'll remember them for the rest of my life, even though people tell me  \\\"forget,\\\" you have to forget, you have to go on living.  At some point I remember that they stood me up and told me something, and  despite the fact that I hurt all over--I had been beaten terribly--I found the strength in myself to interfere with their tortures. I realized that I had to do something: resist them or just let them kill me to bring my suffering  to an end. I pushed one of them away, he was a real horse. I remember now that he's being held, too. As though they were all waiting for it, they seized me and took me out onto the balcony. I had long hair, and it was stuck all over me. One of the veranda shutters to the balcony was open, and I realized that they planned to throw me out the window, because they had already picked me up with their hands, I was up in the air. As though for the last time I took a  really deep breath and closed my eyes, and somehow braced myself inside, I  suddenly became cold, as though my heart had sunk into my feet. And suddenly  I felt myself flying. I couldn't figure out if I was really flying or if I  just imagined it. When I came to I thought now I'm going to smash on the  ground. And when it didn't happen I opened my eyes and realized that I was  still lying on the floor. And since I didn't scream, didn't beg them at all, they became all the more wild, like wolves. They started to trample me with their feet. Shoes with heels on them, and iron horseshoes, like they had spe- cially put them on. Then I lost consciousness.  I came to a couple of times and waited for death, summoned it, beseeched it.  Some people ask for good health, life, happiness, but at that moment I didn't  need any of those things. I was sure that none of us would survive, and I had  even forgotten about Marina; and if none of us was alive, it wasn't worth  living.  There was a moment when the pain was especially great. I withstood inhuman  pain, and realized that they were going to torment me for a long time to come  because I had showed myself to be so tenacious. I started to strangle myself,  and when I started to wheeze they realized that with my death I was going to put an end to their pleasures, and they pulled my hands from my throat. The  person who injured and insulted me most painfully I remember him very well,  because he was the oldest in the group. He looked around 48. I know that he  has four children and that he considers himself an ideal father and person,  one who would never do such a thing. Something came over him then, you see,  even during the investigation he almost called me \\\"daughter,\\\" he apologized,  although, of course, he knew that I'd never forgive him. Something like that  I can never forgive. I have never injured anyone with my behavior, with my  words, or with my deeds, I have always put myself in the other person's shoes, but then, in a matter of hours, they trampled me entirely. I shall never  forget it.  I wanted to do myself in then, because I had nothing to lose, because no one  could protect me. My father, who tried to do something against that hoard of  beasts by himself, could do nothing and wouldn't be able to do anything. I knew that I was even sure that he was no longer alive.  And Ira Melkumian, my acquaintance I knew her and had been to see her family a couple of times--her brother tried to save her and couldn't, so he tried to  kill her, his very own sister. He threw an axe at her to kill her and put an  end to her suffering. When they stripped her clothes off and carried her into  the other room, her brother knew what awaited her. I don't know which one it  was, Edik or Igor. Both of them were in the room from which the axe was  thrown. But the axe hit one of the people carrying her and so they killed her  and made her death even more excruciating, maybe the most excruciating of all  the deaths of those days in Sumgait. I heard about it all from the neighbor  from the Melkumians' landing. His name is Makhaddin, he knows my family a  little. He came to see how we had gotten settled in the new apartment in Baku, how we were feeling, and if we needed anything. He's a good person. He said,  \\\"You should praise God that you all survived. But what I saw with my own eyes, I, a man, who has seen so many people die, who has lived a whole life, I,\\\" he says, \\\"nearly lost my mind that day. I had never seen the likes of it and  think I never shall again.\\\" The door to his apartment was open and he saw  everything. One of the brothers threw the axe, because they had already taken  the father and mother out of the apartment. Igor, Edik, and Ira remained. He  saw Ira, naked, being carried into the other room in the hands of six or seven people. He told us about it and said he would never forget it. He heard the  brothers shouting something, inarticulate from pain, rage, and the fact that  they were powerless to do anything. But all the same they tried to  do something. The guy who got hit with the axe lived.                                                                           I     I  After I had been unsuccessful at killing myself I saw them taking Marina and  Lyuda out of the bedroom. I was in such a state that I couldn't even  remember my sister's name. I wanted to cry \\\"Marina!\\\" out to her, but could not. I looked at her and knew that it was a familiar, dear face, but couldn't for the life of me remember what her name was and who she was. And thus I saved her, because when they were taking her out, she, as it turns out, had told them that she had just been visiting and that she and Lyuda were both there by chance, that they weren't Armenians. Lyuda's a Russian, you can tell  right away, and Marina speaks Azerbaijani wonderfully and she told them that she was an Azerbaijani. And I almost gave her away and doomed her. I'm glad  that at least Marina came out of this all in good physical health . . .  although her spirit was murdered . . .  At some point I came to and saw Igor, Igor Agayev, my acquaintance, in that  mob. He lives in the neighboring building. For some reason I remembered his  name, maybe I sensed my defense in him. I called out to him in Russian, \\\"Igor, help!\\\" But he turned away and went into the bedroom. Just then they were  taking Marina and Lyuda out of the bedroom. Igor said he knew Marina and  Lyuda, that Marina in fact was Azerbaijani, and he took both of them to the  neighbors.  And the idea stole through me that maybe Igor had led them to our apartment,  something like that, but if he was my friend, he was supposed to save me.   Then they were striking me very hard--we have an Indian vase, a metal one,  they were hitting me on the back with it and I blacked out--they took me out  onto the balcony a second time to throw me out the window. They were already  sure that I was dead because I didn't react at all to the new blows. Someone  said, \\\"She's already dead, let's throw her out.\\\" When they carried me out onto the balcony for the second time, when I was about to die the second time, I  heard someone say in Azerbaijani: \\\"Don't kill her, I know her, she's a  teacher.\\\" I can still hear that voice ringing in my ears, but I can't remember whose voice it was. It wasn't Igor, because he speaks Azerbaijani with an  accent: his mother is Russian and they speak Russian at home. He speaks Azerbaijani worse than our Marina does. I remember when they carried me in and threw me on the bed he came up to me, that person, and  I having opened my  eyes, saw and recognized that person, but immediately passed out cold. I had  been beaten so much that I didn't have the strength to remember him. I only  remember that this person was older and he had a high position. Unfortunately  I can't remember anything more.  What should I say about Igor? He didn't treat me badly. I had heard a lot  about him, that he wasn't that good a person, that he sometimes drank too much. Once he boasted to me that he had served in Afghanistan. He knew that  women usually like bravery in a man. Especially if a man was in Afghanistan, if he was wounded, then it's about eighty percent sure that he will be treated very sympathetically, with respect. Later I found out that he had served in  Ufa, and was injured, but that's not in Afghanistan, of course. I found that  all out later.  Among the people who were in our apartment, my Karina also saw the Secretary  of the Party organization. I don't know his last name, his first name is  Najaf, he is an Armenian-born Azerbaijani. But later Karina wasn't so sure, she was no longer a hundred percent sure that it was he she saw, and she  didn't want to endanger him. She said, \\\"He was there,\\\" and a little while  later, \\\"Maybe they beat me so much that I am confusing him with someone else.  No, it seems like it was he.\\\" I am sure it was he because when he came to see  us the first time he said one thing, and the next time he said something  entirely different. The investigators haven't summoned him yet. He came to see us in the Khimik boarding house where we were living at the time. He brought  groceries and flowers, this was right before March 8th; he almost started  crying, he was so upset to see our condition. I don't know if he was putting  us on or not, but later, after we had told the investigator and they summoned  him to the Procuracy, he said that he had been in Baku, he wasn't in Sumgait.  The fact that he changed his testimony leads me to believe that Karina is  right, that in fact it was he who was in our apartment. I don't know how the  investigators are now treating him. At one point I wondered and asked, and was told that he had an alibi and was not in our apartment. Couldn't he have gone  to Baku and arranged an alibi? I'm not ruling out that possibility.  Ill now return to our apartment. Mamma had come to. You could say that she  bought them off with the gold Father gave her when they were married: her  wedding band and her watch were gold. She bought her own and her husband's  lives with them. She gave the gold to a 14-year old boy. Vadim Vorobyev. A  Russian boy, he speaks Azerbaijani perfectly. He's an orphan who was raised by his grandfather and who lives in Sumgait on Nizami Street. He goes to a  special school, one for mentally handicapped children. But I'll say this--I'm  a teacher all the same and in a matter of minutes I can form an opinion--that boy is not at all mentally handicapped. He's healthy, he can think just fine,  and analyze, too . . . policemen should be so lucky. And he's cunning, too.  After that he went home and tore all of the pictures out of his photo album.  He beat Mamma and demanded gold, saying, \\\"Lady, if you give us all the gold  and money in your apartment we'll let you live.\\\" And Mamma told them where  the gold was. He brought in the bag and opened it, shook out the contents, and  everyone who was in the apartment jumped on it, started knocking each other  over and taking the gold from one another. I'm surprised they didn't kill one  another right then.  Mamma was still in control of herself. She had been beaten up, her face was black and blue from the blows, and her eyes were filled with blood, and she  ran into the other room. Father was lying there, tied up, with a gag in his mouth and a pillow over his face. There was a broken table on top of the pil- low. Mamma grabbed Father and he couldn't walk; like me, he was half dead,  halfway into the other world. He couldn't comprehend anything, couldn't see,  and was covered with black and blue. Mamma pulled the gag out of his mouth,  it was some sort of cloth, I think it was a slipcover from an armchair.  The bandits were still in our apartment, even in the room Mamma pulled Father  out of, led him out of, carried him out of. We had two armchairs in that room, a small magazine table, a couch, a television, and a screen. Three people  were standing next to that screen, and into their shirts, their pants,  everywhere imaginable, they were shoving shot glasses and cups from the coffee service--Mamma saw them out of the corner of her eye. She said, \\\"I was afraid  to turn around, I just seized Father and started pulling him, but at the  threshold I couldn't hold him up, he fell down, and I picked him up again and  dragged him down the stairs to the neighbors'.\\\" Mamma remembered one of the  criminals, the one who had watched her with his face half-turned toward her,  out of one eye. She says, \\\"I realized that my death would come from that  person. I looked him in the eyes and he recoiled from fear and went stealing.\\\" Later they caught that scoundrel. Meanwhile, Mamma grabbed Father and left.  I was alone. Igor had taken Marina away, Mamma and Father were gone, Karina  was already outside, I didn't know what they were doing to her. I was left all alone, and at that moment . . . I became someone else, do you understand? Even though I knew that neither Mother and Father in the other room, nor Marina and Lyuda under the bed could save me, all the same I somehow managed to hold out. I went on fighting them, I bit someone, I remember, and I scratched another.  But when I was left alone I realized what kind of people they were, the ones  I had observed, the ones who beat Karina, what kind of people they were, the  ones who beat me, that it was all unnecessary, that I was about to die and  that all of that would die with me.  At some point I took heart when I saw the young man from the next building. I  didn't know his name, but we would greet one another when we met, we knew that we were from the same microdistrict. When I saw him I said, \\\"Neighbor, is that you?\\\" In so doing I placed myself in great danger. He realized that if I lived I would remember him. That's when he grabbed the axe. The axe that had been  taken from my father. I automatically fell to my knees and raised my hands to  take the blow of the axe, although at the time it would have been better if he had struck me in the head with the axe and put me out of my misery. When he  started getting ready to wind back for the blow, someone came into the room.  The newcomer had such an impact on everyone that my neighbor's axe froze in  the air. Everyone stood at attention for this guy, like soldiers in the  presence of a general. Everyone waited for his word: continue the atrocities  or not. He said, \\\"Enough, let's go to the third entryway.\\\" In the third  entryway they killed Uncle Shurik, Aleksandr Gambarian. This confirms once  again that they had prepared in advance. Almost all of them left with him, as  they went picking up pillows, blankets, whatever they needed, whatever they  found, all the way up to worn out slippers and one boot, someone else had  already taken the other.  Four people remained in the room, soldiers who didn't obey their general. They had to have come recently, because other faces had flashed in front of me over those 2 to 3 hours, but I had never seen those three. One of them, Kuliyev (I  identified him later), a native of the Sisian District of Armenia, an  Azerbaijani, had moved to Azerbaijan a year before. He told me in Armenian: \\\"Sister, don't be afraid, I'll drive those three Azerbaijanis out of here.\\\" That's just what he said, \\\"those Azerbaijanis,\\\" as though he himself were not  Azerbaijani, but some other nationality, he said with such hatred, \\\"I'll drive them out of here now, and you put your clothes on, and find a hammer and nails and nail the door shut, because they'll be coming back from Apartment 41.\\\"  That's when I found out that they had gone to Apartment 41. Before that, the  person in the Eskimo dogskin coat, the one who came in and whom they listened  to, the \\\"general,\\\" said that they were going to the third entryway.  Kuliyev helped me get some clothes on, because l couldn't do it by myself.  Marina's old fur coat was lying on the floor. He threw it over my shoulders, I was racked with shivers, and he asked where he could find nails and a hammer.  He wanted to give them to me so that when he left I could nail the door shut.  But the door was lying on the floor in the hall.  I went out onto the balcony. There were broken windows, and flowers and dirt  from flowerpots were scattered on the floor. It was impossible to find  anything. He told me, \\\"Well, fine, I won't leave you here. Would any of the  neighbors let you in? They'll be back, they won't calm down, they know you're  alive.\\\" He told me all this in Armenian.  Then he returned to the others and said, \\\"What are you waiting for? Leave!\\\"  They said, \\\"Ah, you just want to chase us out of here and do it with her  yourself. No, we want to do it to.\\\" He urged them on, but gently, not  coarsely, because he was alone against them, although they were still just boys, not old enough to be drafted. He led them out of the room, and went down to the third floor with them himself, and said, \\\"Leave. What's the mat- ter, aren't you men? Go fight with the men. What do you want of her?\\\" And he came back upstairs. They wanted to come up after him and he realized that  he couldn't hold them off forever. Then he asked me where he could hide me. I  told him at the neighbors' on the fourth floor, Apartment 10, we were on really good terms with them.  We knocked on the door, and he explained in Azerbaijani. The neighbor woman  opened the door and immediately said, \\\"I'm an Azerbaijani.\\\" He said, \\\"I know.  Let her sit at your place a while. Don't open the door to anyone, no one knows about this, I won't tell anyone. Let her stay at your place.\\\" She says, \\\"Fine, have her come in.\\\" I went in. She cried a bit and gave me some stockings, I  had gone entirely numb and was racked with nervous shudders. I burst into  tears. Even though I was wearing Marina's old fur coat, it's a short one, a  half-length, I was cold all the same. I asked, \\\"Do you know where my family  is, what happened to them?\\\" She says, \\\"No, I don't know anything. I'm afraid  to go out of the apartment, now they're so wild that they don't look to see  who's Azerbaijani and who's Armenian.\\\" Kuliyev left. Ten minutes later my  neighbor says, \\\"You know, Lyuda, I don't want to lose my life because of you,  or my son and his wife. Go stay with someone else.\\\" During the butchery in our apartment one of the scum, a sadist, took my earring in his mouth--I had pearl earrings on--and ripped it out, tearing the earlobe. The other earring was  still there. When I'm nervous I fix my hair constantly, and then, when I  touched my ear, I noticed that I had one earring on. I took it out and gave it to her. She took the earring, but she led me out of the apartment.  I went out and didn't know where to go. I heard someone going upstairs. I  don't know who it was but assumed it was them. With tremendous difficulty I  end up to our apartment, I wanted to die in my own home. I go into the  apartment and hear that they are coming up to our place, to the fifth floor.  I had to do something. I went into the bedroom where Marina and Lyuda had  hidden and saw that the bed was overturned. Instead of hiding I squatted near  some broken Christmas ornaments, found an unbroken one, and started sobbing.  Then they came in. Someone said that there were still some things to take. I  think that someone pushed me under the bed. I lay on the floor, and there were broken ornaments on it, under my head and legs. I got all cut up, but I lay  there without moving. My heart was beating so hard it seemed the whole town  could hear it. There were no lights on. Maybe that's what saved me. They were  burning matches, and toward the end they brought in a candle. They started picking out the clothes that could still be worn. They took Father's sport  jacket and a bedspread, the end of which was under my head. They pulled on the one end, and it felt like they were pulling my hair out. I almost cried out.  And again I realized I wasn't getting out of there alive, and I started to  strangle myself again. I took my throat in one hand, and pressed the other on  my mouth, so as not to wheeze, so that I would die and they would only find me afterward. They were throwing the burned matches under the bed, and I got  burned, but I withstood it. Something inside of me held on, someone's hand was protecting me to the end. I knew that I was going to die, but I didn't know  how. I knew that if I survived I would walk out of that apartment, but if  I found out that one of my family had died, I would die for sure, because I  had never been so close to death and couldn't imagine how you could go on  living without your mother or father, or without your sister. Marina, I  thought, was still alive: she went to Lyuda's place or someone is hiding her.  I tried to think that Igor wouldn't let them be killed. He served in  Afghanistan, he should protect her.  While I was strangling myself I said my good-byes to everyone. And then I thought, how could Marina survive alone. If they killed all of us, how would  she live all by herself? There were six people in the room. They talked among  themselves and smoked. One talked about his daughter, saying that there was no children's footwear in our apartment that he could take for his daughter.  Another said that he liked the apartment--recently we had done a really good  job fixing everything up--and that he would live there after everything was  all over. They started to argue. A third one says, \\\"How come you get it? I  have four children, and there are three rooms here, that's just what I need.  All these years I've been living in God-awful places.\\\" Another one says,  \\\"Neither of you gets it. We'll set fire to it and leave.\\\" Then someone said  that Azerbaijanis live right next door, the fire could move over to their place. And they, to my good fortune, didn't set fire to the apartment, and left.  Oh, yes, I just remembered. While they were raping me they repeated quite  frequently, \\\"Let the Armenian women have babies for us, Muslim babies, let  them bear Azerbaijanis for the struggle against the Armenians.\\\" Then they  said, \\\"Those Muslims can carry on our holy cause. Heroes!\\\" They repeated it  very often.         - - - reference for #008 - - -  [1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,     Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by     Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

To me, an absolute is something that is constant across time, culture, situations, etc.  True in every instance possible.  Do you agree with this definition?  I think you do:   A simple example:  In the New Testament (sorry I don't have a Bible at work, and can't provide a reference), women are instructed to be silent and cover their heads in church.  Now, this is scripture.  By your definition,  this is truth and therefore absolute.    Do women in your church speak?  Do they cover their heads?  If all  scripture is absolute truth, it seems to me that women speaking in and  coming to church with bare heads should be intolerable to evangelicals.   Yet, clearly, women do speak in evangelical churches and come with bare  heads.  (At least this was the case in the evangelical churches I grew  up in.)  Evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture  to be absolute truth.  (And there are plenty of other examples.) Can you reconcile this?   I don't claim that there are *no* absolutes.  I think there are very few, though, and determining absolutes is difficult.    But you are claiming that all of Scripture is absolute.  How can you determine absolutes derived from Scripture when you can't agree how to interpret the Scripture?    It's very difficult to see how you can claim something which is based  on your own *interpretation* is absolute.  Do you deny that your own background, education, prejudices, etc. come into play when you read the  Bible, and determine how to interpret a passsage?  Do you deny that  you in fact interpret?\",\" > > :has 2^80 possible keys.  > >  > > We don't yet know if all 80 bits count.  >  > That doesn't worry me at all; they're not going to cheat at something  >they can get caught at.

I agree that Arab news sources are also inherently biased. But I believe the statement I was reacting to was that since the american accounts of events are not fully like the Israeli accounts, the Americans are biased. I just thought that the Israelis had more motivation for bias.  The UN has tried many times to condemn Israel for its gross violation of human rights. However the US has vetoed most such attempts. It is interesting to note that the U.S. is often the only country opposing such condemnation (well the U.S. and Israel).

Before you can buy a handgun, you have to be an active member of a gun club. Well, how active can you be without a gun, chief?  Most gun owners feel a check of criminal records for crimes and mental disorders would be a very good thing -- IF it couldn't be abused by the government.  But every time this is proposed, there is always some trapdoor by which the government can deny your purchase EVEN IF you are perfectly qualified to own a gun.  And we oppose this.   Since the fatal accident rate for licensed automobile drivers in the US  is around 50 times the fatal accident rate of largely unlicensed gun owners, I'd think twice before using this analogy.  Besides, the problem is criminal use of guns, not accidents.  (There are about 500,000 criminal uses of guns in the US every year -- but only 1,400 accidents.)  I don't think it's necessary to spend a lot of energy making sure a criminal CAN shoot a gun before he gets one.  Just like the check, most gun owners feel positively about requiring safety courses -- IF they couldn't be abused by the government.  But  they already have!  One state doesn't hold the courses, another doesn't  fund them, a third holds them only once a year with limited attendence  to those with political connections.  Is this fair?   And how many of them acquire these guns from legal retail outlets? How many are borrowed, stolen, smuggled, bought on the black market?   Some states allow ONLY open carry.  Some allow ONLY concealed carry. Some allow both.  Some allow both, but require licenses for concealed  carry.  All you can say is if one of these modes has a clear advantage over another in terms of reducing crime or any other public good, then state legislators SOMEPLACE are doing exactly the wrong thing. Which means that they really don't have any objective reasons for  these laws other than their preferences -- a bad way to govern.   (\\\"Hot-livered.\\\"  I LOVE that expression.  Here, we say \\\"hot-headed.\\\")   Typically, the only criminals who can affect the rights of ALL the other people are criminals in government offices.  The rest of our criminals affect the rights of only one or a few people at a time, and they do this during the commission of a crime.  POSSESSION of a gun by someone hurts NO ONE else.  It is when they do something violent with that gun that the crime occurs.  Of course, it is a crime for a felon or ex-felon to possess a gun, but we don't feel it is right to treat common citizens who have lived good lives as if they were just \\\"pre-felons\\\" waiting to commit crimes.   I don't understand this sentence.   Life isn't fair.  I shouldn't need a fire extinguisher either, or flood and theft insurance, or to lock the doors of my house and car. But pining for a better world won't do anything to address what I have to do to live in this one.   None of ours, I'm sure.   Frankly, I'm not sure I know what good a driver's license does anyone, either.  The people who drive safely never use it, and the people who  drive drunk, drive without it!  However, a car is a good tool, but not one that protects my right to life. I rank the right to life somewhere north of the right to travel freely.   The question is not whether or not you want to own guns personally.  It's whether or not you think that ALL people should be forced to do as you do. I don't have any problem with someone who says they would never own a gun. I do have a problem with someone who says I should be prevented from owning one, too. -- \",\"  Wow, you're quicker to point out heresy than the Church in the Middle ages.

Let me give you an excert from a recent FDA hearing:             ``There is no evidence orally consumed glutamate has any effect on the brain,'' said Dr. Richard Wurtman of Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The anecdotal experiences of individuals is ``superstition, not science,'' he said. ``I don't think glutamate has made them sick.''  And Dr. Robert Kenney of George Washington University conducted an double blind test in 1980 showing that the 35 people who reacted to MSG also had similar reaction when they thought they had MSG but actually not.  Although there are many contradicting personal stories told in this group, some of them might have been due to other causes. But because the anti MSG emotion runs so high, that some blame it for anything and everything.   My purpose is to present a balance view on the issue, although I am probably 20-1 outnumbered.\",\" First of all, I'm not your buddy!  Second, read what I wrote.

Covey\\\" <covey+@andrew.cmu.edu> Subject: Gun Stats & Mortal Risks Date: Mon, 15 Feb 1993 18:35:05 -0500 (EST)   Folks,  Hail from the nether world.  On February 4th, the Wall Street Journal carried a front-page article by Erik Larson entitled \\\"Armed Force.\\\"  I felt a reply was in order to his citation of the notorious scare stat that \\\"A Gun is 43 times more likely to kill than to protect.\\\"  I sent the following to the WSJ.  -----  Gun Stats & Mortal Risks  Preston K. Covey    Erik Larson~s even-handed article on Paxton Quigley (~Armed Force,~ 2/4/93, WSJ) cites the world~s most notorious ~statistic~ regarding guns in the home:  ~A pioneering study of residential gunshot deaths in King County, Washington, found that a gun in the home was 43 times more likely to be used to kill its owner, spouse, a friend or child than to kill an intruder.~  The ~43 times~ stat is everywhere these days;  it has grown in media lore like the proverbial urban myth: it was inflated by one pugilistic talk-show pundit to ~93.~  Given the shock value of the finding, the conclusion of the 1986 New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) study is remarkably understated:  ~The advisability of keeping firearms in the home for protection must be questioned.~     Responsible people should indeed question the risks and benefits of bringing a firearm into their home.   But what we need to know is this:  What exactly are the risks and benefits?  The NEJM testimony is neither the whole truth about the benefits nor nothing but the truth about the risks.  Further, as with motor vehicles, we want to know:  What control do we have over the risks and benefits?  And, as with the risks of cancer or heart disease or auto accidents:  How can we minimize the risks?  Like raw highway death tolls, the NEJM stat is not very helpful here.    The NEJM finding purports to inform us, but it is framed to warn us off.  It is widely promulgated in the media as a ~scare stat,~ a misleading half-truth whose very formulation is calculated to prejudice and terrify.  The frightful statistic screams for itself:  The risks far outweigh the benefits, yes?   What fool would run these risks?   If your car were 43 times more likely to kill you, a loved one, a dear friend or an innocent child than to get you to your destination,  should you not take the bus?     Uncritical citation puts the good name of statistics in the bad company of lies and damned lies.   Surely, we can do better where lives are at stake.   Let~s take a closer look at this risky business:   The ~43 times~ stat of the NEJM study is the product of dividing the number of home intruders/aggressors justifiably killed in self-defense (the divisor) into the number of family members or acquaintances  killed by a gun in the home (the dividend).  The divisor of this risk equation is 9: in the study~s five-year sample there were 2 intruders and 7 other cases of self-defense.  The dividend is 387:  in the study there were 12 accidental deaths, 42 criminal homicides, and 333 suicides.  387 divided by 9 yields 43.  There were a total of 743 gun-related deaths in King County between 1978 and 1983,  so the study leaves 347 deaths outside of homes unaccounted.   The NEJM~s notorious ~43 times~ statistic is seriously misleading on six counts:   1.  The dividend is misleadingly characterized in the media:  the ~or acquaintances~ of the study (who include your friendly drug dealers and neighborhood gang members) is equated to ~friends.~  The implication is that the offending guns target and kill only beloved family members, dear friends, and innocent children.  Deaths may all be equally tragic, but the character and circumstance of both victims and killers are relevant to the risk.  These crucial risk factors are masked by the calculated impression that the death toll is generated by witless Waltons shooting dear friends and friendly neighbors.  This is criminological hogwash.   2.   The study itself does not distinguish households or environs populated by people with violent, criminal, or substance-abuse histories -- where the risk of death is very high -- versus households inhabited by more civil folk (for example, people who avoid high-risk activities like drug dealing, gang banging and wife beating) -- where the risk is very low indeed.  In actuality, negligent adults allow fatal but avoidable accidents; and homicides are perpetrated mostly by people with histories of violence or abuse, people who are identifiably and certifiably at ~high risk~ for misadventure.  To ignore these obvious risk factors in firearm accidents and homicides is as misleading as ignoring the role of alcohol in vehicular deaths: by tautology, neither gun deaths nor vehicular deaths would occur without firearms or vehicles; but the person and circumstance of the gun owner or driver crucially affect the risk.    3.  One misleading implication of the way the NEJM stat is framed is that the mere presence of a gun in the home is much more likely to kill than to protect, and this obscures -- indeed, disregards -- the role of personal responsibility.  The typical quotation of this study (unlike Larson~s) attributes fatal agency to the gun:  ~A gun in the home is 43 times as likely to kill . . . .~  (The Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, a major promulgator of the NEJM statistic, uses this particular formulation.)  We can dispense with the silly debate about whether it~s people or guns that accomplish the killing:  again, by tautology, gun  deaths would not occur without the guns.  The question begged is how many deaths would occur anyway, without the guns.  In any case, people are the death-dealing agents, the guns are their lethal instruments.  The moral core of the personal  risk factors in gun deaths are personal responsibility and choice.  Due care and responsibility obviate gun accidents; human choice mediates homicide and suicide (by gun or otherwise).  The choice to own a gun need not condemn a person to NEJM~s high-risk pool.  The gun does not create this risk by itself.  People have a lot to say about what risk they run with guns in their homes.  For example, graduates of Paxton Quigley~s personal protection course do not run the touted ~43 times~ risk any more than skilled and sober drivers run the same risks of causing or suffering vehicular death as do reckless or drunk drivers.  Undiscriminating actuarials disregard and obscure the role of personal responsibility and choice, just as they disregard and obscure the role of socio-economic, criminological and other risk-relevant factors in firearm-related death.  This is why we resent insurance premiums and actuarial consigment to risk pools whose norms disregard our individualities.  Fortunately, nothing can consign us to the NEJM risk pool but our own lack of choice or responsibility in the matter.   4.  Suicide accounts for 84% of the deaths by gun in the home in the NEJM study.  As against the total deaths by gun in King County, including those outside the home, in-house suicides are 44% of the total death toll, which is closer to the roughly 50% proportion found by other studies.  Suicide is a social problem of a very different order from homicide or accidents.  The implication of the NEJM study is that these suicides might not occur without readily available guns.  It is true that attempted suicide by gun is likely to succeed.  It is not obviously true that the absence of a gun would prevent any or all of these suicides.  This is widely assumed or alleged, but the preponderance of research on guns and suicide actually shows otherwise, that this is wishful thinking in all but a few truly impulsive cases.  (See:  Bruce L. Danto et al., The Human Side of Homicide,  Columbia University Press, 1982;  Charles Rich et al.,  ~Guns and Suicide,~  American Journal of Psychiatry,  March 1990.)  If suicides were removed from the dividend of the NEJM study~s risk equation, the ~43 times~ stat would deflate to ~six.~  The inclusion of suicides in the NEJM risk equation -- like the causes, durability, or interdiction of suicidal intent itself -- is a profoundly debatable matter.  Quotations of the NEJM study totally disregard this issue.   5.  Citations of the NEJM study also mislead regarding the estimable rate of justifiable and excusable homicide.  Most measures, like the NEJM homicide rate, are based on the immediate disposition of cases.  But many homicides initially ruled criminal are appealed and later ruled self-defense.  In the literature on battered women, immediate case dispositions are notorious for under-representing the rate of justifiable or excusable homicide. Time~s January 18, 1993, cover story on women ~Fighting Back~ reported one study~s finding that 40% of women who appeal have their murder convictions thrown out.  Time~s July 17, 1989, cover story on a week of gun deaths reported 51% of the domestic cases as shootings by abuse victims; but only 3% of the homicides were reported as self-defense.  In a May 14, 1990, update, Time  reported that 12% of the homicides had eventually been ruled self-defense. In Time~s sample, the originally reported rate of self-defense was in error by a factor of four.  The possibility of such error is not acknowledged by promulgators of the NEJM statistic.    6.  While both the dividend and the product of the NEJM risk equation are arguably inflated, the divisor is unconscionably misleading.  The divisor of this equation counts only aggressors who are killed,  not aggressors who are successfully thwarted without being killed or even shot at.   The utility of armed self-defense is the other side of the coin from the harms done with guns in homes.  What kind of moral idiocy is it to measure this utility only in terms of killings ?  Do we measure the utility of our police solely in terms of felons killed  -- as opposed to the many many more who are otherwise foiled, apprehended, or deterred?  Should we not celebrate (let alone count ) those cases where no human life is lost as successful armed defenses?  The question posed to media that cite the NEJM scare stat is this:  Why neglect the compendious research on successful armed defense, notably by criminologist Gary Kleck (Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America , Aldine de Gruyter, 1992)?  Kleck~s estimations of the rate and risk of defensive firearm use are based on victimization surveys as well as other studies:  the rate is high (about one million a year) and the risk is good (gun defenders fare better than anyone, either those who resort to other forms of resistance or those who do not resist).  Dividing one million gun defenses a year by 30,000 annual gun deaths (from self-defense, homicides, suicides, and accidents) yields 33.  Thus, we can construct a much more favorable statistic than the NEJM scare stat:    A gun is 33 times more likely to be used to defend against assault or other crime than to kill anybody.      Of course, Kleck~s critics belittle the dividend of this calculation; what is good news for gun defenders is bad news for gun control.  We should indeed question the basis and method of Kleck~s high estimation of defensive firearm use, as I have questioned the NEJM statistic.  Clearly, the issue of how to manage mortal risks is not settled by uncritical citation of statistics.   One thing troubles me still:  we can hardly escape the unquestioned NEJM scare stat in our media,  but we hardly ever find Kleck~s good work mentioned,  even critically. \",\"     For discussion purposes, I will ignore dynamic effects like pulses in the exhaust pipe, and try to paint a useful mental picture.  1.  Unless an engine is supercharged, the pressure available to force air into the intake tract is _atmospheric_.  At the time the intake valve is opened, the pressure differential available to move air is only the difference between the combustion chamber pressure (left over after the exhaust stroke) and atmospheric.  As the piston decends on the intake stroke, combustion chamber pressure is decreased, allowing atmospheric pressure to move more air into the intake tract.  At no time does the pressure ever become \\\"negative\\\", or even approach a good vacuum.  2.  At the time of the exhaust valve closing, the pressure in the combustion chamber is essentially the pressure of the exhaust system up to the first major flow restriction (the muffler).  Note that the volume of gas that must flow through the exhaust is much larger than the volume that must flow through the intake, because of the temperature difference and the products of combustion.  3.  In the last 6-8 years, the Japanese manufacturers have started paying attention to exhaust and intake tuning, in pursuit of almighty horsepower.  At this point in time, on high-performance bikes, substitution of an aftermarket free-flow air filter will have almost zero affect on performance, because the stock intake system flows very well anyway.  Substitution of an aftermarket exhaust system will make very little difference, unless (in general) the new exhaust system is _much_ louder than the stocker.  4.  On older bikes,  exhaust back-pressure was the dominating factor. If free-flowing air filters were substituted, very little difference was noted, unless a free-flowing exhaust system was installed as well.  5.  In general, an engine can be visualized as an air pump.  At any given RPM, anything that will cause the engine to pump more air, be it on the intake or exhaust side, will cause it to produce more horsepower. Pumping more air will require recalibration (rejetting) of the carburetor.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\",\"thus  Curiously, in modern PostScript, the point in a polygon problem can be solved even more easily.

The worst part about it is that it does not crash consistently: ie I   can't reproduce crashes, and they are not always GPF's in the same   application. Sometimes I can recover by simply closing the application   that caused an error, but other times, windows acts very strange, and I   need to re-boot.  Some background:  I have a Leading Edge 486sx25 with Phoenix BIOS.  When I   first got it it had 4Mg of memory.  It ran windows fine (not too many   GPF's).  Then, a couple of weekends ago, I installed Lotus 123 for windows   (with ATM), a game card and an additional 4  1Mg SIMMS.  The Leading edge   machine is kind of strange, in that it has the IDE controler built into   the motherboard, the CPU is actually on a sparate board that plugs into   the motherboard and the SIMMS it uses are Macintosh SIMMS! Apparently I   was told that the Leading Edge had the parity bit built into the mother   board.  The original 4Mg 80ns SIMMS where of the 2 chip variety from   SAMSUNG, and the ones I installed are 8 chip SIMMS. They are recognized   fine by the BIOS RAM check. The game card is a generic $20 gamecard.  The reason why I mention the hardware like this is that sometimes   rebooting the machine using the reset button or ctl-alt-del still leaves   the machine kind of flaky, but turning it on and off doesn't.   I haven't tried taking out the RAM or the game card, because as I said   these GPF are not reproducible at will.  I have gone through and entire   day using the computer with no problems and then I might get 5 or so GPF's   in the sppace of 20 minutes?  What can I do.  This situation is most annoying... Are there any good   diagnostic tools for hardware? Do you think that this might be a software   problem (ie EMM386 etc.)?

But they have been systematically            IGNORING or SUPPRESSING an excellent one for 30 years!                  The late Physicist Dewey B. Larson's comprehensive            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he            calls the \\\"Reciprocal System\\\", is built on two fundamental            postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of            space and time:                      (1) \\\"The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE            component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE            UNITS, and in two RECIPROCAL forms, SPACE and TIME.\\\"                      (2) \\\"The physical universe conforms to the relations of            ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its magnitudes are            ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN.\\\"                      From these two postulates, Larson developed a COMPLETE            Theoretical Universe, using various combinations of            translational, vibrational, rotational, and vibrational-           rotational MOTIONS, the concepts of IN-ward and OUT-ward            SCALAR MOTIONS, and speeds in relation to the Speed of Light            (which Larson called \\\"UNIT VELOCITY\\\" and \\\"THE NATURAL            DATUM\\\").                        At each step in the development, Larson was able to            MATCH objects in his Theoretical Universe with objects in the            REAL physical universe, (photons, sub-atomic particles            [INCOMPLETE ATOMS], charges, atoms, molecules, globular star            clusters, galaxies, binary star systems, solar systems, white            dwarf stars, pulsars, quasars, ETC.), even objects NOT YET            DISCOVERED THEN (such as EXPLODING GALAXIES, and GAMMA-RAY            BURSTS).                            And applying his Theory to his NEW model of the atom,            Larson was able to precisely and accurately CALCULATE inter-           atomic distances in crystals and molecules, compressibility            and thermal expansion of solids, and other properties of            matter.

Some of the early            books are out of print now, but still available through            inter-library loan.                      \\\"The Structure of the Physical Universe\\\" (1959)                      \\\"The Case AGAINST the Nuclear Atom\\\" (1963)                     \\\"Beyond Newton\\\" (1964)                      \\\"New Light on Space and Time\\\" (1965)                      \\\"Quasars and Pulsars\\\" (1971)                      \\\"NOTHING BUT MOTION\\\" (1979)                      [A $9.50 SUBSTITUTE for the $8.3 BILLION \\\"Super                                                              Collider\\\".]                      [The last four chapters EXPLAIN chemical bonding.]                 \\\"The Neglected Facts of Science\\\" (1982)                       \\\"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\\\" (1984)                     [FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL astrophysical                                                             mysteries.]                        \\\"BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER\\\" (1988)                 All but the last of these books were published by North            Pacific Publishers, P.O. Box 13255, Portland, OR  97213, and            should be available via inter-library loan if your local            university or public library doesn't have each of them.                  Several of them, INCLUDING the last one, are available            from: The International Society of Unified Science (ISUS),            1680 E. Atkin Ave., Salt Lake City, Utah  84106.  This is the            organization that was started to promote Larson's Theory.             They have other related publications, including the quarterly            journal \\\"RECIPROCITY\\\".                         Physicist Dewey B. Larson's Background                     Physicist Dewey B. Larson was a retired Engineer            (Chemical or Electrical).  He was about 91 years old when he            died in May 1989.  He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in            Engineering Science from Oregon State University.  He            developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE            chemical properties based only on the elements used.                      Larson's lack of a fancy \\\"PH.D.\\\" degree might be one            reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is            NOT A VALID REASON.  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider            to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES.  At the same            time, it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX            physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer,            well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC            ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, ETC..                       Larson did NOT have the funds, etc. to experimentally            test his Theory.  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so.             He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER            researchers' experimental and observational data.  And in            many cases, HIS explanation FIT BETTER.                      A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX            physicists and astronomers have!  They CLAIM to be looking            for a \\\"unified field theory\\\" that works, but have been            IGNORING one for over 30 years now!                      \\\"Modern physics\\\" does NOT explain the physical universe            so well.  Some parts of some of Larson's books are FULL of            quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who            agree.  And remember that \\\"epicycles\\\", \\\"crystal spheres\\\",            \\\"geocentricity\\\", \\\"flat earth theory\\\", etc., ALSO once SEEMED            to explain it well, but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG.                           Prof. Frank H. Meyer, Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior,            was/is a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson's Theory, and was (or            still is) President of Larson's organization, \\\"THE            INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE\\\", and Editor of            their quarterly Journal \\\"RECIPROCITY\\\".  He moved to            Minneapolis after retiring.                   \\\"Super Collider\\\" BOONDOGGLE!                           I am AGAINST contruction of the \\\"Superconducting Super            Collider\\\", in Texas or anywhere else.  It would be a GROSS            WASTE of money, and contribute almost NOTHING of \\\"scientific\\\"            value.                      Most physicists don't realize it, but, according to the            comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist            Dewey B. Larson, as described in his books, the strange GOOFY            particles (\\\"mesons\\\", \\\"hyperons\\\", ALLEGED \\\"quarks\\\", etc.)            which they are finding in EXISTING colliders (Fermi Lab,            Cern, etc.) are really just ATOMS of ANTI-MATTER, which are            CREATED by the high-energy colliding beams, and which quickly            disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible            with their environment.                      A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a            few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not            seen there before, and the physicists will be EVEN MORE            CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW!                      Are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $8.3            BILLION cost?!!  Don't we have much more important uses for            this WASTED money?!                            Another thing to consider is that the primary proposed            location in Texas has a serious and growing problem with some            kind of \\\"fire ants\\\" eating the insulation off underground            cables.  How much POISONING of the ground and ground water            with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of            the \\\"Supercollider\\\"?!                                 Naming the \\\"Super Collider\\\" after Ronald Reagon, as            proposed, is TOTALLY ABSURD!  If it is built, it should be            named after a leading particle PHYSICIST.                     LARSONIAN Anti-Matter                           In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe, anti-matter is NOT a simple case of            opposite charges of the same types of particles.  It has more            to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the            photons of which they are made, in relation to the            vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light,            which Larson calls \\\"Unit Velocity\\\" and the \\\"Natural Datum\\\".                       In Larson's Theory, a positron is actually a particle of            MATTER, NOT anti-matter.  When a positron and electron meet,            the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their            respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each            other.                        In Larson's Theory, the ANTI-MATTER half of the physical            universe has THREE dimensions of TIME, and ONLY ONE dimension            of space, and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our            MATERIAL half.                      LARSONIAN Relativity                           The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury            has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the            rate of 574 seconds of arc per century.  531 seconds of this            advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational            perturbations from the other planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter,            etc.).  The remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to            help \\\"prove\\\" Einstein's \\\"General Theory of Relativity\\\".                      But the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieved results            CLOSER to the 43 seconds than \\\"General Relativity\\\" can, by            INSTEAD using \\\"SPECIAL Relativity\\\".  In one or more of his            books, he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH            ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury.                      Larson TOTALLY REJECTED \\\"General Relativity\\\" as another            MATHEMATICAL FANTASY.  He also REJECTED most of \\\"Special            Relativity\\\", including the parts about \\\"mass increases\\\" near            the speed of light, and the use of the Lorentz Transform on            doppler shifts, (Those quasars with red-shifts greater than            1.000 REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT,            although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME.).                       In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe, there are THREE dimensions of time instead            of only one.  But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured            from our material half of the physical universe.  The one            dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time.  At low            relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are            NEGLIGIBLE; but at high speeds, they become significant, and            the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR.            [Larson often used the term \\\"COORDINATE TIME\\\" when writing            about this.]                            In regard to \\\"mass increases\\\", it has been PROVEN in            atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near            the speed of light.  But the formula for acceleration is            ACCELERATION = FORCE / MASS, (a = F/m).  Orthodox physicists            are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR: FORCE.  In Larson's Theory,            mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero.  FORCE is            actually a MOTION, or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS, or RELATIONS            BETWEEN MOTIONS, including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS.             The expansion of the universe, for example, is an OUTward            SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of            the so-called \\\"Big Bang\\\" (which is yet another MATHEMATICAL            FANTASY).                                                                 THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION                 I wish to recommend to EVERYONE the book \\\"THE UNIVERSE            OF MOTION\\\", by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North Pacific            Publishers, (P.O. Box 13255, Portland, Oregon  97213), 456            pages, indexed, hardcover.                      It contains the Astrophysical portions of a GENERAL            UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by that            author, an UNrecognized GENIUS, more than thirty years ago.                      It contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL Astrophysical            mysteries, including the FORMATION of galaxies, binary and            multiple star systems, and solar systems, the TRUE ORIGIN of            the \\\"3-degree\\\" background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma-           ray bursts, and the TRUE NATURE of quasars, pulsars, white            dwarfs, exploding galaxies, etc..                      It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL            looking for, if they are ready to seriously consider it with            OPEN MINDS!                      The following is an example of his Theory's success:            In his first book in 1959, \\\"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL            UNIVERSE\\\", Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING            GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding            them.  They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson's            comprehensive Theory.  And when QUASARS were discovered, he            had an immediate related explanation for them also.                    GAMMA-RAY BURSTS                 Astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching            their heads about the mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS.  They were            originally thought to originate from \\\"neutron stars\\\" in the            disc of our galaxy.  But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in            Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions            uniformly, and their source locations in space do NOT            correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of            directional coincidence).                      Gamma-ray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by            the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson.  According to page 386 of            his book \\\"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\\\", published in 1984, the            gamma-ray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the            ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls            the \\\"Cosmic Sector\\\".  Because of the relationship between the            anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and            the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can            pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at            random.  (This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do            not correspond with known objects, and come from all            directions uniformly.)                      I wonder how close to us in space a source location            would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most            life on Earth!  There would be NO WAY to predict one, NOR to            stop it!                      Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past, which            are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were            actually caused by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS!                   LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation                           About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the            vicinity of the sun are binary or double.  But orthodox            astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory            theory about how they form or why there are so many of them.                      But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY            CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of            the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey            B. Larson.                      I will try to summarize Larsons explanation, which is            detailed in Chapter 7 of his book \\\"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\\\"            and in some of his other books.                      First of all, according to Larson, stars do NOT generate            energy by \\\"fusion\\\".  A small fraction comes from slow            gravitational collapse.  The rest results from the COMPLETE            ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements (heavier than IRON).  Each            element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT.  The heavier the            element is, the lower is this limit.  A star's internal            temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and            absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually            reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and            lighter elements.                      When the internal temperature of the star reaches the            destructive temperature limit of IRON, there is a Type I            SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION!  This is because there is SO MUCH iron            present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms            and the atom building process, which Larson explains in some            of his books [better than I can].                      When the star explodes, the lighter material on the            outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less            than the speed of light.  The heavier material in the center            portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to            the speed of light, because of the high temperature.  The            explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light, and            it expands OUTWARD IN TIME, which is equivalent to INWARD IN            SPACE, and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while.                      Over long periods of time, both masses start to fall            back gravitationally.  The material that had been blown            outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star.  The            material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a            WHITE DWARF star.  BOTH stars then start moving back toward            the \\\"MAIN SEQUENCE\\\" from opposite directions on the H-R            Diagram.                      The chances of the two masses falling back into the            exact same location in space, making a single lone star            again, are near zero.  They will instead form a BINARY            system, orbiting each other.                       According to Larson, a white dwarf star has an INVERSE            DENSITY GRADIENT (is densest at its SURFACE), because the            material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown            outward) in time.   This ELIMINATES the need to resort to            MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about \\\"degenerate matter\\\", \\\"neutron            stars\\\", \\\"black holes\\\", etc..                   LARSONIAN Solar System Formation                 If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the            exploding star is relatively SMALL, then, instead of a single            white dwarf star, there will be SEVERAL \\\"mini\\\" white dwarf            stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably            still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affected            by its heat, etc.).  These will become PLANETS!                        In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, Larson used all            this information, and other principles of his comprehensive            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, to derive            his own version of Bode's Law.                         \\\"Black Hole\\\" FANTASY!                 I heard that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently            completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO \\\"black            holes\\\" merging together into a SINGLE \\\"black hole\\\", and            concluded that the new \\\"black hole\\\" would have MORE MASS than            the sum of the two original \\\"black holes\\\".                      Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED            FLAG, causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of \\\"black            holes\\\", etc.!                      After reading Physicist Dewey B. Larson's books about            his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe, especially his book \\\"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\\\", it is            clear to me that \\\"black holes\\\" are NOTHING more than            MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES!  The strange object at Cygnus X-1 is            just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR, NOT the \\\"black            hole\\\" that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want            to \\\"prove\\\" their theory.                           By the way, I do NOT understand why so much publicity is            being given to physicist Stephen Hawking.  The physicists and            astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawking's severe physical            problem somehow makes him \\\"wiser\\\".  It does NOT!                      I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist            Dewey B. Larson while he was still alive.  Widespread            publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson's            Theory, books, and organization (The International Society of            Unified Science).                                             ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION                 I heard of that concept many years ago, in connection            with UFO's and unorthodox inventors, but I never was able to            find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed.                      I found a possible clue about why they might work on            pages 112-113 of the book \\\"BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER\\\", by            the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson, which describes part of            Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe.  I quote one paragraph:                      \\\"As indicated in the preceding chapter, the development            of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally            different concept of the nature of electrical resistance.             The electrons, we find, are derived from the environment.  It            was brought out in Volume I [Larson's book \\\"NOTHING BUT            MOTION\\\"] that there are physical processes in operation which            produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that,            although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in            many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities            for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are            limited.  It follows that there is always a large excess of            free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the            universe, most of which are uncharged.  In this uncharged            state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension            space, because they are inherently rotating units of space,            and the relation of space to space is not motion.  In open            space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently            in the same location with respect to the natural reference            system, in the manner of a photon.  In the context of the            stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron,            like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by            the progression of the natural reference system.  All            material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons            similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation.             Meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later,            whereby electrons are returned to the environment.  The            electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth            therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level.\\\"                            Note that in Larson's Theory, UNcharged electrons are            also massLESS, and are basically photons of light of a            particular frequency (above the \\\"unit\\\" frequency) spinning            around one axis at a particular rate (below the \\\"unit\\\" rate).             (\\\"Unit velocity\\\" is the speed of light, and there are            vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light,            according to Larson's Theory.)  [I might have the \\\"above\\\" and            \\\"below\\\" labels mixed up.]                      Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass-           LESS UN-charged electrons flying around at the speed of            light!                      If this is true, then the ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION            fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these            electrons, or other particles in space, perhaps GIVING them a            charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to            achieve propulsion. (In Larson's Theory, an electrical charge            is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular            frequency (above the \\\"unit\\\" frequency) superimposed on the            rotation of the particle.)                        The paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to            confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is            generated in clouds.               SUPPRESSION of LARSONIAN Physics                 The comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson has            been available for more than 30 YEARS, published in 1959 in            his first book \\\"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE\\\".

Larson's Theory has excellent explanations for many            things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers, such            as gamma-ray bursts and the nature of quasars.                      Larson's Theory deserves to be HONESTLY and OPENLY            discussed in the physics, chemistry, and astronomy journals,            in the U.S. and elsewhere.  And at least the basic principles            of Larson's Theory should be included in all related courses            at UW-EC, UW-Madison, Cambridge, Cornell University, and            elsewhere, so that students are not kept in the dark about a            worthy alternative to the DOGMA they are being fed.

When you use a different definition it is your thing, but until it is commonly accepted you would have to say the way I define god is ... and that does not exist, it is existence itself, so I say it does not exist.   Interestingly, there are those who say that \\\"existence exists\\\" is one of the indubitable statements possible.

Oak Park also has an illegal handgun ban as well, but does allow those with a \\\"collectors FFL\\\" to possess (\\\"collectible?\\\") handguns.   Probably a fine in practical terms.   It wouldn't impede your defense at all. There was an actual incident in Oak Park where a gas station owner engaged in a shootout with a handgun; the grand jury decided not to presecute. On the other hand, a black man used an illegally owned handgun in Oak Park to defend himself, and the Village tried to make an example out of him. An NRA Director who lived there made a stink about this, and it was decided not to charge the guy. Of course, pissing off anti-gun police thugs has it's own drawbacks, like when the Oak Park Police Chief came to his house, and told him: \\\"this is stepping over the line; this could get dangerous for you.\\\" Whereupon the few black Oak Park police officers watched over his house to ensure that the white anti-gun police chief and his anti-gun cronies wouldn't f*ck with him, his home or family.

Presumably the protocol can be recovered (if by nothing else, differential analysis).  Postulate if you will, a chip (or logic) sitting between the clipper chip and its communications channel.  The purpose of this chip is twofold:       1) Transmit Channel       The spoof chip XORs the 30 bit encrypted serial number with      a secondary keying variable.  This renders the serial number      unrecoverable with just the system key   2) Recieve Channel       The spoof chip XORs the incoming encrypted serial number      with a secondary keying variable (assuming the serial number      is necessary for local operation).  This has the net result of hiding the serial number.  This gets more interesting when the number of serial numbers issued becomes large, making it difficult to distinguish between valid serial numbers and a spoofed serial number.  Without knowing the system key, you could lie about the serial number, but risk detection of the lie.  IF you had the system key and the encryption algorithm you could successfully lie with a lower probability of detection by emulating the format of your own serial number.\",\"All you have to do is turn it in to the police like you would an accident, get a report and send it in to your insurance company and they will contact the other guys insurance company and they will have to pay just as they would in an accident they caused.

The SK theater. They were showing an Argentinian film, \\\"The Abyss.\\\"  Before the film we noticed about 60 to 70 people standing near the podium at  the City Party Committee, but they were silent, there's no conversation  whatsoever, and we couldn't figure out what was going on. That is, we knew it  was about Karabagh, but what it was exactly, what they were talking about, if  someone gave a speech or not, we didn't know. We bought our tickets. There  were 30 or 40 people in the theater. This was a very small number for that  large movie theater. The film started. About 30 minutes later they stopped the film. A crowd burst in. About 60 people. They came up onto the stage. Well  mostly they were young people, from 16 to 23 years old. They demanded that an  Armenian woman come up onto the stage. They used foul language and said that  they were going to show what Azerbaijanis were capable of, what they could do  to Armenian girls. I thought that's what they meant because they had demanded  a girl specifically. Marina and I were sitting together. I told her to move  over, there were some Russian girls sitting nearby. So that if someone  recognized me or if something happened, they would take me, and not Marina.  It got quiet, 2 or 3 girls jumped up to run out, but the door was closed--it's only opened at the end of the   show--and they returned to their seats.  Everyone in the theater was looking at one another, Russians, Azerbaijanis,  people of various nationalities. But no one reacted at all, no one in the  auditorium made a sound. They were silent, looking at one another, and  gradually started to leave. Some guy, a really fat one, says, \\\"OK, we've  scared them enough, let's leave.\\\" They leave slowly, pompously. It seemed to  me that those people were not themselves. Either they had smoked a bunch of  \\\"anasha\\\", or had taken something else, because they all looked beastly, like  they were ready to tear anyone apart. Then it was all over, as though nothing  had happened at all. The film started up again, it was one of those cheerful  films which should have only brought pleasure, made you happy to be alive. We  could barely sit to the end. So it had started at seven it was over by nine,  and it was dark . . .  Marina and I were walking home, Lenin Street, that's the center of town. Lenin Street was packed, just packed with young people. They were shouting,  something about Karabagh and something about Armenians. We weren't especially  listening, because the way we were feeling we didn't know if we were going to  make it home or not, and just what had happened anyway? Public transportation  wasn't running. Incidentally, when we came out of the theater we saw police,  policemen standing there. The director of the movie theater was looking at the doors, because when they were leaving they had broken the glass, the doors  there are basically all glass. Everything was broken. He stood there grief- stricken, but looking as though nothing really big had happened, like some  naughty boys had just broken them quite by accident, with a slingshot. Well,  since he looked more or less calm I decided that, nothing all that super  serious had happened. We went out very slowly; we wanted to catch a bus, we  live literally one stop away. We didn't want to go on foot, not because it was dark, but because something might happen. We flagged down a cab, but the  driver didn't want to take us. We told him we live near the bus station, and  he said he'd take us to the bus station and not a yard farther. I said, well,  OK . . .  So we got into the cab and managed to get there. Something incredible was  happening at the bus station. There was a traffic jam. Public transportation  was at a standstill and everyone was shouting \\\"Ka-ra-bagh,\\\" they're not going  to give up Karabagh. I go home and tell my family what's going on, and there's immediate panic in the house. Mamma says, what should we do? Like the end had  come, they were going to come, kill us, that's it . . . Somehow we managed to  cheer ourselves up: Nothing that bad could happen. Where are we living anyway, just what kind of social order do we have? Somehow we manage to calm Mamma  down. And we went to bed. But no one could sleep. Everyone made as though  nothing had happened.  That was on Saturday. In short, the day went by. We didn't go anywhere and  didn't call our relatives. No one did anything. Because . . . life goes on. That day I realized something was approaching, but what exactly, I couldn't guess.  On the 28th everything was like it was supposed to be, we lived like we always had. There were five of us at home: Mamma, Papa and us, three sisters: Lyuda,  Marina, and I. My sister Lyuda was in Yerevan at the time. We sat at home and  no one went out. Later we learned that a demonstration had started that  morning. It all started . . . They were smashing up stores. We were sitting at home and didn't know anything about it. Then a girlfriend of mine, Lyuda  Zimogliad, came by at around three o'clock I think. We worked together, we did our apprenticeships together, she's a Russian girl. She said that something awful was happening in town. I asked, \\\"Don't they want Armenians? Well what  are they after, if they're already in that state?\\\" She says, no, nothing like  that, it's just a demonstration, but it's awful to watch it. Somehow, it feels like a war has broken out. Public transportation has been stopped . . . The  cabs, the buses, well it's just a nightmare.  Then Papa decides to go to the drugstore, my mother was having allergy  problems at the time . . . He left the house and our neighbor, Aunt Vera, asked him, \\\"Where are you going? Stop! There are such terrible things going on in the courtyard; aren't you afraid to go out?\\\" Papa didn't know what she was talking about. She simply pushed him back into the entryway. He came home  and told Mamma. Mamma said, \\\"Well, if Aunt Vera was talking like that it means that something is really going on.\\\" But we didn't go see her, she's a Russian, she lives across from us. I had to see my friend out. Around five o'clock I  tell Lyuda, \\\"Ok, look, it's time for you to go, it's late already, I'll see  you out.\\\" Mamma says, \\\"You don't need to go, it's too late already, you can  see what the situation in town is.\\\" So we decided to stay home. Dinner was  ready. Mamma says, \\\"Let her eat with us, then she can go.\\\" We sat down at the  table. But no one was hungry, no one was in the mood, we just put everything  out on the table to calm ourselves down, and make it appear that we're eating. We turned on the television, and the show \\\"In Fairy-Tale Land\\\" was coming on.  We cleared the table.  We hear some noise out in the courtyard. I go out on the balcony, but I can't  see what's going on, because the noise is coming from the direction of the bus station, and there is a 9-story building in the way. There is mob of people  . . . I can't figure out what's happening. They're shouting something, looking somewhere, I can't make out what is going on. I go down to a neighbor, she's  an Azerbaijani; we've been friends of her family for about 25 years. I go down to look from their place. I see people shouting, looking at the 5-and 9-story  buildings near the bus station. Just then soldiers set upon them, about 20  people, with clubs. The mob runs off in different directions. I even see  several people from our building. They are looking and laughing . . . I decide that means it's not all that bad if they are laughing: it means they're not  killing anyone. But now the crowd suddenly dashes toward the soldiers. One of  the soldiers cannot manage to get away, they start stomping on him with their  feet, everyone's kicking him . . . I become ill and go home, and explain in  general terms that horrible things are going on out there . . .  can't speak . . . Well, they've probably killed that soldier, the way that crowd is . . . If each of them kicked him just once . . . They took his club away from him and started to beat him with it. But it was far away and I couldn't see if he got up and left or not.  I become terrified and go home and say, \\\"Lyuda, don't go anywhere, stay at our place, because if you go out they could kill you or . . . \\\" Then the crowd  runs over closer toward our building and stands at the 12-story building and  starts shouting something. We go out onto the balcony. All of our neighbors  are also out on theirs, too. Everyone is standing, staring. The mob is  shouting and about 5 minutes later comes running toward our building. As it  turns out, at the 12-story building the Azerbaijani neighbors went down and  kept them from coming in. There's only one entryway there, they could stop  them.  They all run up to our building. Mamma immediately starts closing the windows, afraid that they might throw stones. They have stones and they break the  windows, all of them. There are very many people. We have a large courtyard,  and it's packed with people. They spill up to the first floor so they don't  crush each other. They crawl up on trees, posts, and garages. It's just a huge cloud of people. They break and burn the motorcycle of the Armenian Sergey  Sargisian, from our building. We close the windows and immediately hear  tramping in our entryway. They come up to our fifth floor with a tremendous  din and roar. It's incomprehensible. Mamma told me later that they were  shouting Father's name, \\\"Grisha, open the door, we've come to kill you!,\\\" or something like that. I don't remember that, I was spaced out, kind of. Mamma  says, \\\"Into the bedroom, quickly!\\\" In the bedroom we have two tall beds, part  of our dowry; Mamma says, \\\"Hide there, they probably won't come in there,  they'll ask something, say something, and leave.\\\" She says, \\\"We'll tell them  that we live alone here.\\\" I can't imagine that my parents will stand out in  the hall alone talking with some sort of beasts . . . I go to them and say  that I'll stand together with them, I'll talk with them if they come, maybe I  can find a common language with them, all the more so if they know me: I speak  Azerbaijani more or less, and I can find out what they want. I told Marina and Lyuda to hide under the bed, and my sister Lyuda, I can't remember if I told  her anything or not.  Then . . . they open the door: it's like they blew on it and it broke and fell right into the hall. The crows bursts in and starts to shout: Get out of here, leave, vacate the apartment and go back to your Armenia; things like that. I tell them, \\\"What has happened, speak calmly. One of you, tell me, calmly, what has happened.\\\" In Azerbaijani, they say, \\\"Get out of the apartment, leave.\\\" I  say, \\\"OK. Go downstairs. We'll gather everything we need and leave the  apartment.\\\" I realize that it is senseless to discuss any sort of rights with them, these are animals. They must be stopped. The ones standing in the doorway, the young guys, say, \\\"There are old people and one girl with them. Too bad!\\\" They take two or three steps back. It seems as though I have pacified them with our exchange. Then someone in the courtyard shouts,  commanding them: \\\"Don't you understand what you are saying? Kill them?\\\"  And that was it! That was all it took. They grab Papa, carry him into one room, and Mamma and me into another. They put Mamma on the bed and start  undressing her, beating her legs. They start tearing my clothes, right there,  in front of Mamma. I don't remember where they went, what they did, or how  much time passed. I had the feeling that they beat me on the head, on my body, and tore my clothes, all at the same time, I don't even know what I said. The  atrocities started. I was savagely raped in that room. They argued among  themselves who would go first.  Later, I remember, I came to. I don't know if I'm dead or alive. Someone comes in, someone tall, I think, clean-shaven, in an Eskimo dogskin coat, balding.  He looks around at what's happening. At that instant everything stops. It  seems to me that he is either their commander or . . . that somehow everything depends on him. He looks and says, \\\"Well, we're done here.\\\" They are beating Mamma on the head. They break up the chairs and beat her with the chair legs  . . . She loses consciousness, and they decide that she's dead. Papa . . . was out cold. They want to throw Lyuda off the balcony, but they can't get the  window open. Apparently the window frames are stuck after the rain and the  windows can't be opened. They leave her next to the window. She was thinking  about being thrown out the window and passed out. She's not a real strong  person anyway . . . He looks at me and sees that I'm saying something, that I'm still twitching. Well, I start saying the opposite of what I should be,  which is humbling myself and pleading. I start shouting, cursing . . . they  don't get any entreaty out of me. I  already know that I'm dead, why would I  humble myself before anyone? And he says that if that's what I think, since my tongue is so long . . . maybe he thinks that I still look quite appealing  . . . In short, he commands that I be taken outside.  I no longer saw or remembered what was happening to Marina and Lyuda, I don't  know if they are alive or not. They take me outside. They are dragging me by  my arms, by my legs. They are hitting me against the wall, the railings,  something metal . . . While they are carrying me someone is biting me, someone else is pinching me . . .I don't even know. I think, my God, when will death  come? If only it were sooner . . . Then . . . they carry me out, throw me near the entryway . . . and start kicking me. I lose consciousness . . . What  happened after that, how many people there were, I don't remember.   I come to after a while, I don't remember how long. A neighbor is bringing me  clothing. I'm entirely covered with blood, she puts a dress on me. I remember  that I said the same words over and over again: \\\"Mamma, what happened, Mamma,  what have they done to us, where are we, whose house are we at?\\\" I can't make  sense out of anything. There is a guy standing over me, I sort of know him, he served in Afghanistan, his name is Igor, he brought me indoors. When they all  went to the third entryway and killed a person there, Igor gathered his  courage, took me into his arms, and brought me to the neighbors', even though  he's small-minded, he put himself at risk. Igor Agayev is Azerbaijani; he  served in Afghanistan. There are three brothers. The older brother also served there, I think; now he's stationed here, on the border, in Armenia. Igor  brought me to the neighbors', and then helped me come to my senses, saying,  \\\"Karina, I know you, calm down, I'm not one of them.\\\" How do I know who's who  and what's what? I come to, and they clean me up. I was covered in blood. Then Papa . . . I saw Papa, I saw Mamma. And Marina, too . . . Igor was there when  they dragged Marina and Lyuda out from under the bed . . . Marina . . . Lyuda  said that she was Russian, they said, we'll let you go, we aren't touching the Russians, go. And while they are dragging Marina out she decides she's going  to tell them she's Azerbaijani. Igor immediately grabs Marina's and Lyuda's  hands, because he knows Marina, and knows that she is Armenian and is our  sister, and takes her to the second floor to a neighbor's and starts pounding  on the door so she will open up. She opens the door and Igor pushes them in  there. So they survived.  My sister Lyuda lost consciousness after the bandits started stealing things. While they were going downstairs, taking things downstairs, then coming back  up again, Lyuda seized the opportunity and crawled under the bed and stayed  there. Then, when she was herself again, she found a torn night shirt and put  it on, and some sort of robe and went to a neighbor's on the fourth floor, the one whose apartment I had watched the crowd from, the friend of ours, and  knocked on the door. The neighbor opened and said, \\\"I'm not going to let you  in the apartment because I'm afraid of them. But I'll give you some stockings  and we'll leave the building.\\\" Lyuda says, \\\"I'll stay at your place because of what's going on, they keep going up and down the stairs.\\\" It was just for a  moment, just a moment in life, but the neighbor wouldn't consent. Lyuda came  back to our place and lay under the bed . . .  I came to. Mother was there. I can't remember my supervisor's telephone  number, but something had to be done. Somehow I remembered and called, and he  came to get us. He didn't have any idea what was going on. He thought we were  simply afraid, he didn't know that they were killing us and that we had passed between life and death. He came and got us and took us to the police precinct. There they looked us over. I was having trouble walking, my lungs hurt badly,  it was hard to breathe . . .  My supervisor's name is Urshan Feyruzovich Mamedov. He's the head of our  administration. They took us there. When we were leaving, I saw a great number of buses full of soldiers at the entrance to town. The buses were ordinary  passenger buses. There were very many soldiers. We left around eleven, right  after eleven. If these people could stop what was happening they could save a  great many lives . . . Because the crowd was moving on, toward the school, and what was going on there . . . I think everyone know not only in Sumgait, not  only in Yerevan. Because there they murdered them all one after the next,  without stopping. After us.  I think 14 people died in Microdistrict No. 3, and 10 to 12 of them were from Buildings 4, 5, and 6. In our building one person died, and one old woman died from Building 16, that's the building in front of ours. There young  Azerbaijani men stopped the mob and wouldn't let it into their building.  Incidentally, when we were at the neighbors', Marina called our relatives to warn them, so they would all know what was happening. I called a aunt in  Microdistrict No. 5. They have three neighbors who are Armenians. I said, \\\"Run quickly, I can't explain what's going on; hide, do what you can, just stay alive. Hide at Azerbaijanis', ones who won't give you away.\\\" At that moment  three people came in, policemen. I think they were Azerbaijanis. I was in such awful condition, my face was completely distorted my lips were puffed up,  there was blood, my eye was swollen, no one thought I would ever see anything  out of that eye again . . . my forehead was badly cut, and one-half of my face was pushed out forward. No one would have thought that I would survive, get my normal appearance back, and be able to grasp anything at all. I started to  scream at those people, why did you come, who sent you here, no one wants you  here, haven't you killed people people yet, what are you doing here? One of  the soldiers said, \\\"Don't scream at us. We're Muslims, but we're not from the  Sumgait police. They called in from Daghestan.\\\" So at that point the  Daghestan police were there.  When we got to the police precinct there were an awful lot of police there, there were soldiers, police with dogs, ambulances, firemen . . . I don't know, maybe they were waiting for people to bring them the goners and the seriously  injured to treat them there in the police precinct. I don't know what they  were there for. There were also doctors from Baku there. They examined Lyuda  and me and said, \\\"These women need to go to the Maternity Home, but we don't  know what to do with the rest.\\\"  So they took us, and I lost contact with my parents, my boss, everyone. My  boss said, \\\"Don't worry, I'll find you, no matter where you are, no matter what happens.\\\" We went to the hospital. There we were examined by a department head from the Sumgait Maternity Home, Pashayeva, I think her name was. She  examined us. The ambulance was from Baku; I figured out that the Sumgait  ambulances hadn't done anything, they didn't respond to any calls. People  called and neither the police nor the ambulances showed any sign of life.  That doctor looked me over and I could tell from her behavior that something very good had happened, for she became quite glad. I even thought to myself,  \\\"God, can it be that nothing all that bad is wrong?\\\" She looks me over and  says, \\\"Now why are you suffering so? You don't know what your people have been doing, your people did even worse things.\\\" And I think, great, I have to deal  with her . . . And I felt so bad, I thought, why don't I just die so as not to have to hear more stuff like this from people like her? Here I am in this  condition and being told about something that our people did. I just didn't  have the energy to say, \\\"How could our people possibly be smart enough to  think of something that yours haven't already done?\\\" I stayed there. Then they brought in another woman, Ira B., she was married, and she was raped in her  own apartment, too. There were three of us, Ira, Lyuda, and 1. The next  morning they took Lyuda and Ira away. They didn't do anything to help us. This was in the old Maternity Home, in the combined block. They didn't do anything  more than examine me, that was it. I didn't want any shots or tranquilizer,  nothing. What shots could have calmed me down? I didn't even want to look at  them.  I lay in the ward. Either it just worked out that way or they did it on pur- pose, but I was alone. I was alone even though the wards were packed. That same evening a woman came by and asked me what was wrong with me, that my face was disfigured. She asked what had happened to me, and I said, \\\"Better to ask  your brother what happened, there's no point in asking me, your brother can  better explain what happened.\\\" She fell into a faint. All the doctors threw  themselves at her, and the doctor categorically forbade anyone to come into my ward.  Then people from work came to see me, my boss, his daughter; they brought me  clothing, because I was literally naked. The only thing I had on was a dress,  but the woman who gave it to me was very short, and the dress was way up  above my knees, and the woman orderly said, \\\"I can't believe you put on such a short dress, who are you showing off your legs to here?\\\" I went back to my  ward thinking, just one more thing from something. People from work came and  brought me something in a sack, apples, I think, three or four pounds, but I  couldn't take them. I had become so weak that it was just embarrassing. I said that I couldn't take the apples, and really didn't have any appetite. No one  had to bring me anything. Some woman took the sack . . . And, oh yes! . . .  Then I heard that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history should  be hidden or torn up completely so that no one would know that I was an  Armenian, maybe they wouldn't figure it out from looking at me. So they must  have been thinking that there would be some kind of attack, that something  else would happen. That it would be worse. Or, perhaps, someone was outside on the street, I don't know. In any case, I didn't sleep a wink that night.  The next morning they picked me up, a whole police detail, put me in a bus,  and off we went. I didn't even know where they were taking me. They took me to the club where the troops were, the very one I was in that ill-fated evening. I got off the bus. Near the City Party Committee there were a great many  troops, tanks, armored personnel carriers; the whole scene was terrible. I saw  a few people I knew there, and that calmed me a little. I had already thought  that I was the only one left. So there were five or six of us left in Sumgait  after that night. I still didn't know what happened to my parents, they didn't  come to see me in the hospital, and my boss told me that everything was fine.  I didn't know whether to believe him or not. Maybe he was just trying to calm  me down, maybe something happened on the way. Then I went to the club and saw  a lot of people I knew. They all knew one another, they were all kissing each  other and asking, \\\"What happened, what went on?\\\" Two days later they came to  see me from work. They were there all the time. Each day they came, showed  interest, and were constantly bringing me money. They did everything they  could. Of course I'm most thankful to my boss, the only one of my colleagues  who didn't lose his presence of mind and who didn't change his opinions,  neither before, nor after, nor in the heat of the moment, no matter what  happened. He constantly took an interest. A sincere interest, from the heart  . . . Then, about two days later, the secretary of the Party Committee came,  not from our Party organization, but from the First Trust, which ours is part  of, Comrade Kerimov, a very important figure in our town. He made arrangements with the emergency medical personnel to take me away, because if I sat down by myself I couldn't get up or lie down again. There was something wrong with my lungs, it was hard to breathe. They examined me there several times, there I  lay were several doctors, they all thought that . . . that it must just be  from all the blows, I don't know. They didn't diagnose anything in particular. When I was in the Maternity Home I even asked . . . I made it a point of  insisting that they take me to the trauma section because I felt so awful.  There was no way something inside wasn't broken, my ribs . . . Well they took  me there and took x-rays and said that everything was fine. There were  emergency medical workers on duty in the club. The mother of one of Marina's  friends was there. She was the head doctor at the Sumgait Children's Clinic.  They had every kind of antifever agent in the world, which was exactly what I needed at that moment, I thought. I said that I was having great difficulty breathing, I couldn't seem to get enough air, something was wrong with me. They put tight bandages around my chest and waist. Later I overheard some people saying that I had been cut all over. I think they just saw me being all bandaged up and decided that my breasts and face had been cut . . . But I wasn't cut.  They took us to the Khimik boarding house. We lived there a long time. Soon  appeared representatives . . . They were agitating. At first people would not  talk to them, and drove them off. One of the Armenian women shouted, \\\"We  demand that Seidov come!\\\" The response was, \\\"It's Seidov who sent us.\\\" Seidov  is the Chairman of the Azerbaijani Council of Ministers. The woman said,  \\\"We'll only see Seidov's daughter, have her come here, we'll do the same  things to her that they did to our daughters, and then we'll deal with you  agitators.\\\" And so on. More of them said, \\\"Have Seidov himself come.\\\" This  went on day in, day out. The agitators kept coming and coming, this drove us  out of our wits. Then people gradually started departing for Yerevan because  they realized it was senseless to stay. Everything got on our nerves: The  smell, the small children. There were children at the SK club, children who  had literally just come out of the Maternity Home. What were they doing in a  club that didn't even have running water all the time? At first we had to pay  to eat there. They even overcharged us, as it turned out. On the second day  someone told us that they would bring us food for free. The children were ill. Everything stank there. Well imagine about 3,000 people in a small movie  theater with seating for no more than 500. You couldn't sit or lie down, it  was impossible to even move. The stench was awful. Even the smallest infants  took ill overnight there. I heard that they were arriving seriously ill in  Yerevan, the infants. They have to be washed, they have to be bathed, not to  mention that we, the adults, were ill and needed care. People were fainting  right and left. I just don't know, everyone was crying, everyone . . . Only  the young people, the men, somehow managed to keep it together. But the women  were in a constant state of panic. It seemed to everyone that they would come  any minute and kill and stab. It seemed clear that we had been gathered  together purposely, like during the war, so that they could burn the movie  theater and there wouldn't be a single Armenian left. Then people went up to  the attic. I didn't see them, I only heard them, because I was lying down and  couldn't get up. I lay right on the stage, we had some room there. Apparently  they caught two people with either oil or gas. I think they wanted to burn the theater. Maybe someone saw them, I didn't. I was in no condition to open my  eyes.  Everyone was suspicious of everyone else. They would ask, \\\"Aren't you an  Azerbaijani? I think I saw you somewhere, I think you're an Azerbaijani.\\\" They led out all the men and started letting them back in by checking their passports, relatives might be covering for each other. Half of the people did not have any documents. There were people who had run out of their homes in  nothing but a pair of pants and slippers, or wearing just a shirt, not like they should have, with their IDs.  So on the 28th, on Sunday, I think, the police did nothing to help us. On Monday everything resumed where it had left off on Block 41A. They didn't  spare a soul there: not children, not pregnant women, nobody. They killed, they burned, they hacked with axes, just everything possible. They murdered  the Melkumian family whom I knew, my mother worked with them. Their daughter- in-law went to school with my older sister. They were brutally murdered. Only  the two daughters-in-law survived. By a miracle one was able to save herself,  she ran away, the neighbors wouldn't take her in, so she ran about the  building until she found refuge. She was pregnant and had two small children.  This all continued on Monday in Block 41A, on the 29th, when the troops were  already in the city.  They murdered people, they overturned automobiles, and they burned entire  families. They say they didn't even know for sure if the people were Armenians or not. I heard that the Lezgins suffered, too. I'm not sure myself, I didn't  see any Lezgins who had been injured. They burned cars so it's very difficult  now to say exactly who died and who didn't. It was very difficult to identify  the corpses, or rather, what remained of the corpses after they were doused in gasoline and burned . . . it's all very hard to imagine, of course I heard  that many people disappeared without a trace, from the BTZ plant two people,  including a woman who worked the night shift, Aunt Razmella, who also lived in Microdistrict 3.  They were stopping buses between Baku and Sumgait. In the evening people who  had been visiting Baku were returning to Sumgait, and people from Baku were  going home from Sumgait, and there were students, too. They were simply  savagely murdered. They were stopping the buses, the drivers immediately did  what they were told because there was just no other way to deal with that  hoard of brutally minded people. They stopped the buses, dragged the Armenians out and killed them on the spot. I didn't see it myself, but I heard that they put them all in a pile so as to burn them. Later it was hard to discern from  the corpses, well you can't call them corpses, you had to figure out from the  ashes who it was. l heard that two fellows saved two women, one a student, Ira G., if I'm not mistaken. She was in the hospital a long time after that, and  she still can't figure out who saved her. She was also brutally raped and  beaten and thrown onto a pile of corpses. The fellow pulled her out of that  whole pile of corpses, put his coat on her, took her into his arms, and  carried her to the city. I still can't imagine how he managed to do that.  I heard that from Engels Grigorian. He knows her, apparently. Well a lot of  people went to that hospital anyway. She was in the hospital and singing a  song in Armenian, and they wrote the words down, and, I think he still has  that piece of paper, because he says that a lot of people now have that song,  the one she sang in the hospital where she lay in such bad shape. They  couldn't find the guy who saved her. He left her in someone's apartment and called the ambulance, she was in such awful shape that, probably, like me, she couldn't remember anyone's face.  I think that I knew one of the people who broke into our house, maybe I had  talked with him once. But I received so many blows everything was just knocked out of my head. I can't remember to this day who he was. Then, it seems, I saw the Secretary of the Directorate's Party organization, where Marina works. She goes to school and works, she goes to night school at AZI, and works by day at the Khimzashchita Construction and Installation Administration. I'm the  Secretary of the Komsomol organization at our administration and often met  with the secretaries of Party and Komsomol organizations. We had joint  meetings. I know them all, I've even talked with them, and he, I know, is from Armenia. An Azerbaijani, but from Armenia. It became obvious that many of  those people were Azerbaijanis born in Armenia.  They took me to various police stations, to the police precinct, and to the Procuracy, because the USSR Procuracy got involved in the case, and I iden- tified the photographs of people who I could more or less recognize. They showed me the people who were in our apartment, they're working on our case, but I can't even recognize them, although it was proved that they were the ones, they're processing it somehow. They tell me that they know that someone held me by the arm and someone else held me by the leg when they were  dragging me. There was someone else in our apartment who did not even touch  me, he just stole a blanket and an earring or something like that. All these  people, all of them, as much as I've heard about them and seen them, they were all from Kafan.  The Secretary of the Party organization is named Najaf, Najaf Rzayev. He was  there when everything started. It must have been him because I didn't  recognize anyone else in the crowd whom I knew besides him. All the more since I told him, \\\"Listen, you do something, because you know me.\\\" He turned away  and went toward the bedroom, where Marina was. Well you couldn't see Marina  anyway. There was such a noisy confusion of people that you couldn't make out  anyone. All of it flew right out of my head, and then gradually I became  myself again, at the City Party Committee . . . There were military people  there. I told them what went on, and they wrote it all down. I told them his  name. On March 8 the Secretary of our First Trust Party organization, the one  we're part of, came to see us, his name is Najaf Rzayev. I tell Mamma, \\\"If he's here despite the fact that I gave his name, it means that either his  alibi has been confirmed or, probably, that they think I'm crazy, not  responsible for my words.\\\" He said, \\\"What did they do to you, how awful,  myself, I hid an Armenian family.\\\" Then after some time goes by he comes back  again and says something entirely different: \\\"I wasn't at home, my family and  I went to Baku.\\\" I said, \\\"Marina, what is he saying? He said something totally different before.\\\" After that I didn't go to see our Procurator, our case is  being handled by a procurator from Voronezh, Fedorov by name. Fedorov told me  that Rzayev's case had just gotten to him, and there were so names involved.  What are they doing with Rzayev? Did he prove his alibi or not? They just think that since I was hit in the  head I can't say anything for sure, whether it was him or not. It will be an  insult if he was in our apartment and doesn't have to pay for it, but at the  same time  I'm afraid to say I'm a hundred percent sure that it was he. Because no mat- ter who I name, they tell me, no, you're wrong, he didn't do that, that one wasn't there. All the faces have gotten mixed up in my mind. Who did what exactly I can't say.                                                       When they took me outside there was a whole crowd there, but I didn't see it,  because I had my eyes closed all the time. It seemed to me that I always got it because of my eyes, people were always hassling me, for some reason it  always seemed to me that my eyes are responsible. When they were beating my  face I thought they were trying to put my eyes out. So I had my eyes closed,  they took me outside and started to beat me. A young guy, 22, held my arms, he works at the BTZ plant. And right nearby, across the road from us, Block 41,  is where all this was going on. Right across the road from us. The BTZ  dormitory is over there, that's where he lives. Now he's in custody, they even have proved, as far as I know, that it was he who killed Shurik Gambarian, the clarinet player from the third entryway of our building. One person in our  building was killed, it was that man.  A guy comes by who shared a room with the guy who was holding me. He saw that he was holding me by the arms and that he was beating me, but he didn't come  over, he just looked and then went into the dormitory. A while after it was  all over, people started making announcements in town saying that  investigators had been summoned. That guy went and told them everything. Now  they've caught him, everything's been proved. Now, evidently, they've been beating him, I don't know what they're doing with them over there, but he  himself said that he was working the night shift at the plant. Some young guy  came to the plant and said, \\\"Everyone who wants to kill Armenians come to the  bus station on Saturday at ten.\\\" That was it. He said, the ones who wanted to, went. This was at the BTZ plant, during the night shift, probably, late Friday night. It was at night, they were at the sauna together. And he said, what do  you mean, do you understand what you are saying? The others were silent,  probably, in their hearts they were thinking, I'm going to go. But they didn't say anything to one another. He said that he thought it important to to go,  because he had heard a lot about what had happened in Kafan, that they had  killed their Azerbaijani sisters, their mothers, burned villages, and all of  that. That guy was also born in Kafan. That is certain. And Marina says that  the Secretary of the Party organization is from Armenia, too.                                                             from  I've participated in the investigation a couple of times. I'm satisfied with them thus far. They summoned us and asked about what happened, and every word  I said was recorded. I met some guy there . . . By the way, he was an  Armenian. I said that he was in our apartment, but what he did, I don't know.  His last name was Grigorian, Eduard Grigorian. He s from Sumgait, from  Microdistrict 1. He was sentenced I think, to five years, not his first time.  His mother is Russian. I met with him at the KGB in Baku, at the Azerbaijani  KGB. They took us there and showed me photographs. There were so many  photographs, I think they even photographed those people who were caught at  curfew, and I've got them all confused. I say, the face was about like this,  the guy in the white coat with the red clasps. But he could take that coat off and burn it somewhere, and it would be like looking for a needle in a  haystack. Well. This guy, Grigorian, I said, he was in our apartment, but he  is so light-complected that he looks like a Lezgin. I don't know what he did,  I can't remember. Maybe he beat me or raped me. But he was in our apartment.  At the KGB he started asking me, pleading with me, there's no need for this,  all this stuff, look me in the eyes, you're like a sister to me. I took a look at him and thought, \\\"My God, Heaven forbid that I should have a brother like  you.\\\" But they were satisfied with my responses, because I said everything  without great certainty. I was there with Mamma. Then Lyuda came in, but when  she came in she got sick immediately. She wanted to kill him, she crawled over the table at him. She recognized him. When she came to, Lyuda was lying on the balcony, the mob threw her there and all of them ran into the bedroom. We had  all kinds of boxes with dishes in them, the dowries for all three sisters.  They stole everything in the apartment, leaving only small things. At that  moment Lyuda came to and started remembering everything. Well, seeing the  faces, hearing the voices . . . Two people were saying they could burn the  apartment. Another says, why burn the apartment when I've got three kids and  no place to live. So this guy was in temporary housing, he didn't have  anywhere to live, he was from Sumgait. They were sure that they would get the  apartment. Besides, the neighbors were Azerbaijani. Why should they burn the  apartment, they might burn Azerbaijanis. That's what they said. How did they  know there were Azerbaijanis there, if they just picked a place, thinking that Armenians lived there? We have a list of the residents for our part of the  building, our name is in there, but how could they know that Azerbaijanis  lived on the other side of the wall from us? So they didn't set fire to our  apartment.  I don't know, I was in such bad shape that if all of it had come to a halt  when I was outside, if someone had asked me what was happening, I would have said that a civil war was going on. Well, maybe not civil . . . but probably civil, because when they were beating me I opened my eyes and saw that all the neighbors were standing on their balconies and watching, like at a free horror film. So a civil war was going on, and only the Armenians were being fought. If it were a world war or something like that, they would have been fighting everyone. But they only fought us. Then I met some women from  our building, some Azerbaijanis. They are crying, they tell me, \\\"Karina, we  saw all of it, how could it happen?\\\" They're asking me! Well I just don't know what to call it if a normal girl can stand there and watch what happened to  me. I think that if it were the other way around either I wouldn't have been  able to take it, or I would have tried to avert it, like that one Azerbaijani  woman did in front of our building. A woman lives there, an awful, dissipated  woman, if you can call her a woman, the dissipated life she leads. Two  Armenian families live there, in her part of the building. She came out on the balcony and saw what was happening to me and started to scream and curse. She  came down to the entryway and said, \\\"You'll come in this entryway over my dead body.\\\" So not one of them took it in his head to go in that entryway. Some  folks were saying that those people were so out of control that they didn't  even know what they were doing. I don't think that's true. They knew very well what they were doing if they didn't even lift a hand against that woman. They  couldn't have cared less about her, but the fact that she was an Azerbaijani  stopped them.  They were just beasts, they had smoked so much. When they came to our place  they were all chewing something. I noticed: Everyone who came into the  apartment was chewing something. I think, my God, maybe I just think that?  Maybe I'm losing my mind? But no, they're all chewing something. Maybe it is  some kind of drug, it must be, because . . . At first glance they all seemed  to be such normal people, young, clean-shaven, looking exactly as if they had  come to some sort of celebration. But they were shouting something. They didn't talk, they shouted, as though there were deaf people there. They  screamed and screamed: \\\"Yeah, killing, killing, we're killing the Armenians!\\\"  Only they didn't shout \\\"kill,\\\" they shouted \\\"gurun ermianlary.\\\" Gurun  literally means \\\"kill,\\\" or \\\"destroy.\\\"  That's how it was! I'll continue. We hid in a captain's apartment, he's an Azerbaijani, his wife is a Tatar. We were sitting in their apartment, their  kids were out in the yard. Their kids knew a whole lot. This was in our part  of the building, on the third floor. When Mamma came to and couldn't find Lyuda she took Papa's hand, this was while the looters were stealing things, but they didn't pay attention because they were stealing things. Apparently they had already ceased killing and switched to stealing. Mamma found the courage to . . .  A boy said to my mother \\\"Where's the gold?\\\" Mamma said he must have been 12  to 14 years old. He even looked Russian, he was so fair-skinned. But the  Azerbaijanis from Armenia are fair-skinned. I noticed they were all on the  fair side. He shouted, they were all smashing things, and he asks Mamma where  the gold is. We kept our gold in the wardrobe with our important papers. In a  little black bag, we kept everything in there. Mamma doesn't really like to  wear gold. She probably never even wore those things from the time they were  bought for her. They took everything that was lying on the cheval glass. Mamma thinks that the gold saved us. Because they threw themselves at the gold, and  Mamma grabbed Papa, who was trying to breathe. They had closed his mouth,  bound his hands, and put a pillow and a chair on his face . . . They had  shoved something into his mouth so he would suffocate. Mamma grabbed him and  tore all that stuff off . . . He had something in his mouth, he was having  trouble breathing, his nose was filled with blood. Mamma grabbed him and  started running from the fifth down to the first floor because no one wanted  to open their doors to them. Mamma said that by accident, completely by  accident that person opened his door, he was sleeping, and said, half-awake,  \\\"What's happened?\\\" He sees that they are bloody. Mamma said, \\\"At least go and  find out what's happening to my daughters, even if they've burned them or  murdered them, at least bring the corpses.\\\" He went looking for us. At that  moment Lyuda was under the bed. She says that after they left it seemed that  someone was calling her name. When he quietly called her she couldn't get out  from under the bed. She wanted to get out and was calling softly. She thought  she was shouting, but in fact she was either silent or was only talking to  herself, it just seemed to her that she was shouting. When she got out from  under the bed everyone was gone. And again . . . She thought that she had lost her mind. I'll never leave here, never! To hell with it! It just seems that  way to me, I'll come to eventually. But then, when everything had settled  down, stopped, that mall brought Lyuda down, and Igor carried me in from outside. Or first I was brought in, then Lyuda, I don't remember what order it happened in.  And Mamma said, \\\"Listen, they're all running around down there, shouting  something or other, and running toward the other building.\\\" It had more or  less calmed down where we were. Who's dead, who's alive, we don't know. I  tried to call my girlfriend. I had basically come to. Mamma says, \\\"Listen; let's go upstairs, at least get a mattress or something. We don't know how  long we'll be here. Maybe they didn't burn everything.\\\" I don't get it, all women have that feeling, they want to get something from their homes, maybe  not everything was taken? I tell Mamma, \\\"Mamma, what do you need any of that  for? To hell with it! We're alive, forget the rest of it, all of it!\\\" She says, \\\"No, let's go get at least something. Maybe we'll leave here, spend the  night at someone else's.\\\" Mamma went upstairs, and their little boy, their son Alik, was standing on the lookout. lIe was standing there to see if they were  coming. They only managed to run up there and grab something one time. He  shouts, \\\"Come back, they're coming!\\\" They didn't have enough time to get a  lot, mattresses from one apartment, a blanket from another . . . Mamma got my  knitting . . . Someone managed to grab our old things, the ones we never wore, out of the hall . . . Someone took Father's old coveralls. The neighbor, his  wife, Mamma and Papa . . . Marina went with them. I was in no condition to  leave. Neither was Lyuda. We just sat. They ran out and we closed the door and just then we hear that the mob is on its way toward our place upstairs,  they're dragging something again. They were going toward the other building,  maybe over by the school, or . . . There was an unfinished building over there, people said they were going toward the basement or the unfinished  building, they could gradually carry everything over there. Then things more  or less calmed down. I tried to call my boss.  Later there was more noise. We were on the third floor, in a one-bedroom apartment, and a woman lives in the one-bedroom place on the second floor, Asya Dallakian. She's an old woman, retired. She wasn't at home, at that time she was usually in the country, she has a married daughter there, and her grandson is in the army. She is only very rarely in town; she gets her retirement money and the apartment is essentially vacant. They started pounding on her door and broke it down. She had two or three beds in there,  something like that, she's a 60-to 70-year-old woman who really does not even  live there. Probably she had some pots, a couple of metal bed frames and  mattresses, and a television. When her grandson came she bought a television.  They started wrecking everything. I started getting sick again. I think, \\\"My  God, what is going on around here? When will this end?\\\" We turned off the  lights and sat. As it turns out the people who weren't afraid, the ones who  knew what was going on, knew not to turn off the lights. We didn't know, but  they didn't come to where we were all the same. They all knew very well that  he was a captain. He went out and closed the door, and we sat in his  apartment. His last name was Kasumov. He's an exserviceman, retired, works up  at the fire station at some plant or other. He went out and stood at his door. They tell him, \\\"Comrade Captain, don't worry, we won't harm you, you're one of us.\\\" He went upstairs, and they say, \\\"Aren't you taking anything from this  apartment?\\\" He says, \\\"I don't need anything.\\\" And the women who were standing  in the yard . . . we have a basement, full of water . . . the women who were  standing in the yard saw. Those guys, they left everything they stole on the  first floor and ran upstairs again. The women threw everything they had time  to into the basement, to save our property. Some things were left: dirty  pillows, two or three other things and a rug. A guy came downstairs, really  mad, and he says, \\\"Where's the rug? I just put it right here!\\\" They tell him,  \\\"Some guy came and took it and went off toward the school.\\\" He ran off in that direction.  Oh! I forgot the most important point. When Igor picked me up in his arms,  there were women standing there who saw everything that was going on. They  just didn't tell me about it for a long time. The wife of that military man,  she didn't want to kill my spirit, I was already dead enough. Later she told  me, that after they murdered Uncle Shurik in the third entryway one of them,  the ringleader, apparently a young man, said, \\\"Where's the girl who was here?\\\" And he became furious. The woman tells him, \\\"She came to . . . \\\" She didn't know what to say: Think something up? Someone carried her off? Then they would comb the whole house and find me and our whole family. So the woman says, \\\"She came to and went to the basement.\\\" Now, our basement is full of water. So the  whole mob dashes off to the basement to look for me or my corpse. They took  flashlights; they were up to their waists in water, water which had been  standing there for years, and soot, and fuel oil. They climbed down in there  to get me. Then one of them said, \\\"There's so much water down there, she  probably walked and walked and then passed out and died. She met her death in  the basement. That's it, we can leave, no problem!\\\" I didn't know that, and  when I was told, I felt worse. Two times worse. A lot worse! So they didn't  just want to pound me flat, something more awful was awaiting me . . .  After that we of course didn't want to live in Sumgait any longer. We really  didn't want to go back to our apartment. When we moved, I went up there and  started to quiver and shake all over, because I started remembering it all.  Although the neighbors all sobbed, it was all . . . so cheap . . . The people  who sat in their apartments and didn't help us at a time like that. I think  that they could have helped! I don't think that they were obligated to, but  they could have helped us! Because that one woman was able to stop that whole  brutal crowd by herself. That means they could have, too. It would have been enough foe one man or women to say, What do you think you're doing?\\\" That's  all! That would have done it. There were 60 apartments in our building. Not  one person said it! When I was lying on the ground and all those people were  standing on their balconies I didn't hear anyone's voice, no one said what are you doing, leave her alone . . . Mamma even told one of the neighbor women  that if it had been an Azerbaijani woman in my place they would have dropped a bomb if it would have killed even one Armenian. They would have stood up for  one of their own. True, they say that our neighbor from the fourth entryway,  an old/ sick woman tried to stop the pogrom. The Azerbaijanis have a custom:  if a woman takes her scarf and throws it on the ground, the men are supposed  to stop immediately. The old woman from the fourth entryway did that, but they stomped her scarf into the ground, pushed her off to the side, and said, \\\"If you want to go on living, you'll disappear into your apartment.\\\" So she left. That trick didn't work on them.  Even the neighbors who helped us move told me, OK, fine, calm down, forget  that it happened. I said I'd only forget it if I told them right then that it had happened to their daughter--and if that didn't have any effect on them,  then I would forget everything, too. Imagine that it happened to your sister.  And no one did anything. Anything.

I used to pray earnestly in the courthouse bathroom before the ceremonies, mostly asking that the couples would come to appreciate and fulfill the true holiness and divine purpose in marriage--couples who obviously didn't realize that marriage is God's institution, not the state's.  Gradually, however, I came to conclude that because I was acting in a strictly secular, public capacity, established as such by both the state and the expectations of the couples involved, I was really conducting a purely secular, legal civil event, with no greater moral or religious implications than if I had been conducting a civil trial (the couple who told me, mid-ceremony, to \\\"please hurry it up\\\" may have helped me to this conclusion).        I thought I had neatly rationalized a clear and sharp distinction between marriage before God, and \\\"marriage\\\" before the state, until I had to deal with my own divorce.  Keeping Matthew 19:6 in mind, I felt that the state had no business dissolving my marriage established before God, but of course it assumed jurisdiction nonetheless.

The region has escaped the ethnic warfare of neighboring Nagorno-Karabakh, Abkhazia and Ossetia, but Lezhgis could become the next minority in the former Soviet Union to fight for independence.  Lezghis, who are Muslim descendents of nomadic shepherds, are angry about the conscription of their young men to fight in Azerbaijan's 5-year-old undeclared war with Armenia.  They also want to unite the Lezghi regions of Azerbaijan and Russia, which were effectively one until the breakup of the Soviet Union created national borders that had been only lines on a map.  A rally of more than 3,000 Lezghis in March to protest conscription and demand a separate \\\"Lezghistan\\\" alarmed the Azerbaijani government.  Officials in Baku, the capital, deny rumors that police shot six demonstrators to death. But the government announced strict security measures and began cooperating with Russian authorities to control the movement of Lezhgis living across the border in the Dagestan region of Russia.  Visitors to Gussar, the center of Lezhgi life, found the town quiet soon after the protest. Children played outdoors in the crisp mountain air.  At the Sunday bazaar, men in heavy coats and dark fur hats gathered to discuss grievances ranging from high customs duties at the Russian border to a war they say is not theirs.  \\\"I have been drafted, but I won't go,\\\" said Shamil Kadimov, gold teeth glinting in the sun. \\\"Why must I fight a war for the Azerbaijanis? I have nothing to do with Armenia.\\\"  More than 3,000 people have died in the war, which centers on the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, about 150 miles to the southeast.  Malik Kerimov, an official in the mayor's office, said only 11 of 300 locals drafted in 1992 had served.  \\\"The police don't force people to go,\\\" he said. \\\"They are afraid of an uprising that could be backed by Lezghis in Dagestan.\\\"  All the men agreed that police had not fired at the demonstrators, but disagreed on how the protest came about.  Some said it occurred spontaneously when rumors spread that Azerbaijan was about to draft 1,500 men from the Gussar region, where 75,000 Lezghis live.  Others said the rally was ordered by Gen. Muhieddin Kahramanov, leader of the Lezhgi underground separatist movement, Sadval, based in Dagestan.  \\\"We organized the demonstration when families came to us distraught about draft orders,\\\" said Kerim Babayev, a mathematics teacher who belongs to Sadval.  \\\"We hope to reunite peacefully, by approaching everyone -- the Azerbaijanis,  the Russians.\\\"  In the early 18th century, the Lezhgis formed two khanates, or sovereignties, in what are now Azerbaijan and Dagestan. They roamed freely with their sheep over the green hills and mountains between the two khanates.  By 1812, the Lezghi areas were joined to czarist Russia. After 1917, they came under Soviet rule. With the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the  600,000 Lezghis were faced for the first time with strict borders.  About half remained in Dagestan and half in newly independent Azerbaijan.  \\\"We have to pay customs on all this, on cars, on wine,\\\" complained Mais Talibov, a small trader. His goods, laid out on the ground at the bazaar, included brandy, stomach medication and plastic shoes from Dagestan.  \\\"We want our own country,\\\" he said. \\\"We want to be able to move about easily. But Baku won't listen to us.\\\"  Physically, it is hard for outsiders to distinguish Lezhgis from other Azerbaijanis. In many villages, they live side by side, working at the same  jobs and intermarrying to some degree.  But the Lezhgis have a distinctive language, a mixture of Arabic, Turkish and Persian with strong guttural vowels.  Azerbaijan officially supports the cultural preservation of its 10 largest ethnic minorities. The Lezghis have weekly newspapers and some elementary  school classes in their language.  Autonomy is a different question. If the Lezghis succeeded in separating from Azerbaijan, they would set a precedent for other minorities, such as the  Talish in the south, the Tats in the nearby mountains and the Avars of eastern Azerbaijan.    \",\"      There are some issues which come to mind when one considers the law enforcement aspects of the use of the Big Brother (Clipper) chip.      The drug dealers and terrorists aren't going to let themselves be caught by using this type of encryption.  In 1985 the New York Times reported that government investigators broke up a narcotics ring that was operating highly sophisticated equipment capable of allowing the leaders of the ring to eavesdrop on the law-enforcement agents who were trying to arrest them.      A Mr. Deely, an NSA official, said \\\"There are a lot of medium-sized countries that would have been proud to have the signals intelligence operation of this group.\\\"      For every John Gotti there are probably many more people who have the sophistication to know what the risks of unsecure communications are.  The press given to the Big Brother chip will only increase their numbers.      Even if there is some benefit to law-enforcement through the use of Big Brother, it must be weighed against the constitutional and civil liberties questions involved.      For example, in some areas of the world torture is used as an investigative tool by the local \\\"law-enforcement\\\" people.  I suspect it is an effective means of obtaining information and shortening many investigations.  It probably also helps keep the conviction rate high.      The fact that the torture tool is not used in this country (even with a court order obtained by showing \\\"probable cause\\\") is because we have rightly balanced the questions of expediency and what is ethically and morally right.      I think that the same question of expediency versus morality should come into play when considering the use of Big Brother.  I vote for morality.      I am quite disturbed by what I interpret as a veiled threat to prohibit the use of all encryption if this Big Brother chip is not put into wide spread use.  After a quick reading of the White House press release I came away with that impression.      To most of the American public, the word \\\"hacker\\\" has rightly or wrongly come to mean \\\"high tech adolescent vandal\\\". It has struck me that most of the people posting to sci.crypt regarding this issue are intelligent, thoughtful individuals who have genuine concerns about the privacy and constitutional issues surrounding Big Brother.  I hope that the use of Big Brother does not become mandatory and other encryption become illegal.  I would hate to see this become some kind of high tech Volstead Act.      The high speed digital communications revolution is coming at us with the speed of an SST.  The times they are a changing, and just as IBM is learning that they can't do business the same way they have done it for the past 40 years, maybe NSA should evaluate another approach.      EFF, who have correctly questioned the cryptographic strength of Big Brother, may need to send a stronger message out regarding the constitutional issues involved.      Al Gore may want to think this one through a little more.

One approach is simply to try and move political opinion and hope a new more libertarian consensus lasts for a while.  Another approach is to try and amend the constitution.  The original constitution restrained the U.S. government from economic intervention for 100 to 150 years, depending on just how one wants to count it. The First Amendment, though weakened in many ways, still restrains government (particularly state and local), even though on many particular issues the majority is in favor of censorship.  I think libertarians would be happy with another 100 years of restraint via an amendment or two (not that I think that's likely to happen).  Not necessarily Mr. Hendricks, but other posters seem to see this as a problem with libertarianism, that it cannot be stable.  That might be true, but it is not an objection to libertarianism per se.  If a libertarian political consensus forms for a decade or two and then falls apart again, we would just be back where we are now.  This is unlike the case for socialism where a socialist consensus that held for a while and then fell apart would not leave us where we are now, but instead with lots of bureaucracy that would be hard to get rid of, if not tyranny as the end condition of a strong socialist consensus.\",\"    Try putting one of the IRQs for your COM ports onto IRQ2. The hardware will automagically wrap IRQ2 to IRQ9 on AT class machines (eg, anything with high IRQs). This is what I'm doing on my set up right now.     I've got COM2 on IRQ2 (really IRQ9 - address it this way in software), COM1 on IRQ3, SoundBlaster on IRQ5, LPT1 on IRQ7, and my ATI BusMouse port on one of the interrupts in between. Works just great.    If you need even more, there's a text file floating around somewhere that details how to hack up any serial card (and probably any others) to work on the higher IRQs. It basically involves cutting the trace to the low IRQ and running a wire over the a high IRQ pin on the 16bit expansion bus.    It will be best to put the modem's COM port onto IRQ2/9. This will be the   first IRQ serviced by the system, giving the modem a better response --  especially handy under multitaskers like OS/2 -- which I'm running with no problems.

(Sorry all HP fans, but I have a hard time being convinced that their scopes match the rest of their (excellent) gear).  One of the principal functions I look for when considering a DSO is whether you can turn interpolation off. The other important feature is to disable repetitive waveform acquisition i.e. being able to lock the instrument into real time capture mode.   I agree with you here. The only consolation is that manufacturers are _beginning_ to pay attention to ergonomics when designing the menus. However, to be fair, it seems that first time scope users (our students) seem to adjust to menus easier than navigating around the twenty or more knobs required of a \\\"real\\\" scope :-)   This is one area that newer DSOs are addressing. I recently evaluated the latest box from Tek - their TDS320 - which seems to be a worthy alternative to a standard 100MHz analogue CRO. This instrument has a 100MHz, 500Ms/s spec, meaning that it is _always_ in real time capture mode. The pricing also matches equivalent analogue scopes in the range. The downer is that the instrument uses menus again, but at least they appear to be logically laid out.  One more thing about the new, \\\"simpler\\\", front panels. These instruments tend to use digital rotary encoders as knobs now. This is a vast improvement over the old oak switch. The single most common cause of failure in our scopes (other than students blowing up inputs!) is mechanical wear on these switches. I look at the new panels as a great step toward increasing the longevity of the instruments.

I think the support droid was malfunctioning and confused the disk space limit with the virtual address space limit.  As far as the disk is concerned, you are limited only by the amount of contiguous free space. The limit that causes the message, \\\"Windows will only use ...,\\\" is the amount of virtual address space that the Virtual Memory Manager will create, and this is a function of the amount of free memory that you have when Windows starts.  In the [386enh] section of SYSTEM.INI, you can specify a parameter:   PageOverCommit=multiplier  The following description is from the Windows Resource Kit:   This entry specifies the multiplier what determines the amount of  linear address space the VMM will create for the system, which is  computed by rounding up the amount of available physical memory to  the nearest 4 MB and then multiplying that value by the value  specified for PageOverCommit=.  Increasing this value increases the  amount of available linear address space, causing the size of data  structures to increase.  This also increases paging activity  proportionately and can slow down the system.  You can specify a  value between 1 and 20.  The default is 4.  To change this entry,  you must edit SYSTEM.INI. \",\"  No, just a little anger.

Overacker writes, responding to Simon:     I may be interesting to see some brief selections posted to the    net.  My understanding is that SSPX does not consider ITSELF in    schism or legitimately excommunicated.  But that's really beside    the point.  What does the Roman Catholic church say?    Excommunication can be real apart from formal excommunication, as    provided for in canon law.  Here's some of the theology involved for the interested.  There is confusion over this issue of the SSPX's \\\"schism\\\"; often the basic problem is lack of an ability to distinguish between:  - true obedience - false obedience - disobedience - schism  Take the various classifications of obedience first.  There are 2 important elements involved here for my purposes:  1) a command 2) the response made to the command  As far as the command goes, commands can be LEGITIMATE, such as the Pope ordering Catholics to not eat meat on Fridays.  Or they can be ILLEGITIMATE, such as the Pope ordering Catholics to worship the god Dagon when every other full moon comes around.  As far as the response to a command goes, it can be to REFUSE to do what is commanded, or to COMPLY.  Making a table, there are thus 4 possibilites:  command         response            name ----------------------------------------------------- LEGITIMATE      COMPLY              true obedience ILLEGITIMATE    REFUSE              true obedience LEGITIMATE      REFUSE              disobedience ILLEGITIMATE    COMPLY              false obedience  So now you see where my 3 classifications of obedience come from.  Obedience is not solely a matter of compliance/refusal.  The nature of the commands must also be taken into account; it is not enough to consider someone's compliance or refusal and then say whether they are \\\"obedient\\\" or \\\"disobedient\\\".  You also have to take into consideration whether the commands are good or bad.  In my example, if the Pope commands all Catholics to worship the god Dagon, and they all refuse, they aren't being disobedient at all!  As far as the Society of Saint Pius X goes, they are certainly refusing to comply with certain things the Pope desires.  But that alone is insufficient to allow one to label them \\\"disobedient\\\".  You also have to consider the nature of the Papal desires.  And there's the rub: SSPX says the Popes since Vatican II have been commanding certain very bad things for the Church.  The Popes have of course disagreed.  So where are we?  Are we in another Arian heresy, complete with weak Popes?  Or are the SSPX priests modern Martin Luthers?  Well, the only way to answer that is to examine who is saying what, and what the traditional teaching of the Church is.  The problem here is that very few Catholics have much of an idea of what is really going on, and what the issues are.  The religion of American Catholics is especially defective in intellectual depth.  You will never read about the issues being discussed in the Catholic press in this country.  (On the other hand, one Italian Catholic magazine I get -- 30 Days -- has had interviews with the Superior General of the Society of Saint Pius X.)  Many Catholics will decide to side with the Pope.  There is some soundness in this, because the Papacy is infallible, so eventually some Pope *will* straighten all this out.  But, on the other hand, there is also unsoundness in this, in that, in the short term, the Popes may indeed be wrong, and such Catholics are doing nothing to help the situation by obeying them where they're wrong.  In fact, if the situation is grave enough, they sin in obeying him.  At the very least, they're wasting a great opportunity, because they are failing to love Christ in a heroic way at the very time that He needs this badly.  Schism... let's move on to schism.  What is it?  Schism is a superset of disobedience (refusal to obey a legitimate command).  All schismatics are disobedient.  But it's a superset, so it doesn't work the other way around: not all disobeyers are schismatics.  The mere fact that the SSPX priests don't comply with the Holy Father's desires doesn't make them schismatics.  So what is it that must be added to disobedience to constitute a schism?  Maybe this something else makes the SSPX priests schismatics.  You must add this: the rejection of the right to command.  Look in any decent reference on Catholic theology, and that's what you'll find: the distinguishing criterion of schism is rejection of the right to command.  Here's what the Catholic Encyclopedia says, for example:      ... not every disobedience is a schism; in order to possess this     character it must include besides the trangression of the commands     of superiors, denial of their Divine right to command.     (from the CE article \\\"Schism\\\")  Is the Society of Saint Pius X then schismatic?  The answer is a clear no: they say that the Pope is their boss.  They pray for him every day.  And that's all that matters as far as schism goes.  What all this boils down to is this: if we leave aside the consideration of the exact nature of their objections, their position is a legitimate one, as far as the Catholic theology of obedience and schism goes.  They are resisting certain Papal policies because they think that they are clearly contrary to the traditional teaching of the Papacy, and the best interests of the Church.  (In fact, someone who finds himself in this situation has a *duty* to resist.)  Now, what is the stance of Rome on all this?  Well, if you read the Holy Father's motu proprio \\\"Ecclesia Dei\\\", you can find out.  It's the definitive document on the subject.  A motu proprio is a specifically Papal act.  It's not the product of a Roman congregation, a letter that the Pope has possibly never even read.  It's from the Pope himself.  His boss is God... there's no one else to complain to.  In this document, the Holy Father says, among other things:  1) The episcopal consecrations performed by Archbishop Lefebvre constituted a schismatic act.  2) Archbishop Lefebvre's problem was a misunderstanding of the nature of Tradtion.  Both are confusing: I fail to see the logic of the Pope's points.  As far as the episcopal consecrations go, I read an interesting article in a translation of the Italian magazine \\\"Si Si No No\\\".  It all gets back to the question of jurisdiction.  If episcopal consecrations imply rejection of the Pope's jurisdiction, then they would truly constitute a schismatic act, justifying excommunication under the current code of canon law.  But my problem with this is this: according to the traditional theology of Holy Orders, episcopal consecration does not confer jurisdiction.  It only confers the power of Order: the ability to confect the Sacraments.  Jurisdiction must be conferred by someone else with the power to confer it (such as the Pope).  The Society bishops, knowing the traditional theology quite well, take great pains to avoid any pretence of jurisdiction over anyone.  They simply confer those Sacraments that require a bishop.  The \\\"Si Si No No\\\" article was interesting in that it posited that the reason that the Pope said what he did is that he has a novel, post-Vatican II idea of Holy Orders.  According to this idea, episcopal consecration *does* confer jurisdiction.  I lent the article to a friend, unfortunately, so can't tell you more.  I believe they quoted the new code of canon law in support of this idea.  The Pope's thinking on this point remains a great puzzle to me. There's no way there is a schism, according to traditional Catholic theology.  So why does the Pope think this?  As far as the points regarding the nature of Tradition goes, here's the passage in question:      The root of this schismatic act can be discerned in an incomplete     and contradictory notion of Tradtion.  Incomplete, because it does     not take sufficiently into the account the living character of     Tradition, which, as the Second Vatican Council clearly taught,          comes from the apostles and progresses in the Church with the         help of the Holy Spirit.  There is a growth in insight into         the realities and words that are being passed on.  This comes         about in various ways.  It comes through the contemplation and         study of believers who ponder these things in their hearts.         It comes from the intimate sense of spiritual realities which         they experience.  And it comes from the preaching of those who         have received, along with their right of succession in the         espiscopate, the sure charism of truth.      But especially contradictory is a notion of Tradition which     opposes the universal Magisterium of the Church possessed by the     Bishop of Rome and the body of bishops.  It is impossible to     remain faithful to the Tradition while breaking the ecclesial bond     with him to whom, in the person of the Apostle Peter, Christ     himself entrusted the ministry of unity in His Church.      (Papal motu proprio \\\"Ecclesia Dei\\\", 2 July 1988)  It seems to me that the Holy Father is making two points here that can be simplified to the following:  - Vatican Council II has happened. - I am the Pope.  The argument being that either case is sufficient to prove that Archbishop Lefebvre must be wrong, because he disagrees with them. This is weak, to say the least!  It would have helped clarify things more if the Pope had addressed Archbishop Lefebvre's concerns in detail.  What is John Paul II's stand on the social Kingship of Christ, as taught by Gregory XVI, Pius IX, Leo XIII, Pius XI and Pius XII, for example?  Are we supposed to ignore what all these Popes said on the subject?  I don't know what the future will hold, but the powers that be in the SSPX are still talking with Rome and trying to straighten things out.  --------------------------------------------------------------  [Many people would prefer to call a justified refusal to obey \\\"justified disobedience\\\" or even \\\"obeying God rather than man\\\". Calling a refusal to obey obedience puts us into a sort of Alice in Wonderland world where words mean whatever we want them to mean.  Similarly, schism indicates a formal break in the church.  If the Pope says that a schism exists, it seems to me that by definition it exists.  It may be that the Pope is on the wrong side of the break, that there is no good reason for the break to exist, and that it will shortly be healed.  But how can one deny that it does in fact exist?  It seems to me that you are in grave danger of destroying the thing you are trying to reform: the power of the papacy.  What good will it do you if you become reconciled to the the Pope in the future, but in the process, you have destroyed his ability to use the tools of church discipline?  It's one thing to hold that the Pope has misused his powers, and excommunicated someone wrongly.  It's something else to say that his excommunication did not take effect, and the schism is all in his imagination.  That means that acts of church discipline are not legal tools, but acts whose validity is open to debate.  Generally it has been liberal Catholics who have had problems with the Pope. While they have often objected to church sanctions, generally they have admitted that the sanctions exist.  You are now opening the door to people simply ignoring papal decisions, claiming to be truly obeying by disobeying, and to be in communion while excommunicated.

The air flow of small 3.5 inch fans can be reduced by about 50% by using a 1 to 4 uF capacitor.  Use a good grade nonpolarized unit with working voltage rating around 250 volts.  Note that some impriical study is usually required to experimentally determine the best size capacitor for a given application.  For DC powered applications, try the Radio Shack 12 volt box fan. It can run and start reliably from as low as about 4.5 VDC.  It is exceptionally quiet, but at admittedly low flow.

Lankford was hurt, although the announcer said he told Torre he  could pinch hit if they needed him to.  I wondered the same thing.  But giving Joe the benefit of the   doubt, I'd say he was thinking that Lankford is hurt enough that  he didn't trust his ability to bat effectively but he wants his  speed on the bases so pinch run him.  Alicea I was completely  confused about.  Maybe he had a good record hitting against that  particular pitcher?  I don't know.  Anybody got an idea?  Well, so far I haven't seen much to say Whiten shouldn't be playing  but it is too bad that Gilkey is the odd man out when they play   Jordan ahead of him.  That I don't quite understand.  Yup, I looked for this on the replay too.  If I'm Joe Torre, I'm  going to have a talk with Bucky after the game on that one.  He's  got Lankford at third with Todd Zeile I believe - a hot hitter -   coming up - there's no reason to risk giving Lankford the go sign   in that situation unless he was sure the ball is going to the stands.    It's his job to watch the play develop - he should have known Larkin   was there to back up a bad throw.  That seemed inexcusable in my book.    BTW, I saw Dent do the same thing last year with Zeile rounding third   and going into a sure out at home in a critical situation.  On the   replay, there's Dent waving him around.  It looks like this might be a   serious problem.  The Card's weren't good base runners at all last year   and I wonder how much of the fault lies in the base coaching.

Notice, however, that I myself did not FAQ the careful monk.  He was, after all, waiting to press return.   Jack Waters II DoD#1919\",\"I just purchased a Viewsonic 17 and and Orchid P9000.  In short, I am happy with the monitor and unhappy with the card.  I have spent a lot more time futzing with the card, so that is what I am going to write about.  The monitor is pretty.  The moires I had under Simcity on my 17\\\" Magnavox went away.  It isn't as heavy as I thought it would be (45 lbs, I think).  So much for the monitor.  On to the bitch session and test results.  In going with the modern trend, the Orchid P9000 card only supports 16 colors in 640x480 mode without a driver.  Of course, this breaks any DOS program which uses SVGA modes (like most of my CD-ROMs).  The Compudyne Whiplash VGA, Orchid Fahrenheit 1280, and Orchid F. VLB all share this limitation.  Those are all S3 cards, which means it is an S3 problem for them (the P9000 uses a Weitek VGA chip which also doesn't support them).  The Hercules Graphite card does seem to have these modes, but I didn't run the same test cases as I did on the other boards during the brief time I had it.  It was able to print the splash screen for the Grolier's Encyclopedia, though, which the S3 cards just printed as hash, which is why I suspect the SVGA modes are supported.  The supported resolutions really annoy me.  You can do 1280x1024 at 75Hz if you tell the driver you have an NEC 5FG (they only have about six monitors listed plus 'Generic', and if you choose Generic you can't get any high refreshes at ALL).  But at 1024x768 you are limited to 70Hz.  Seems to me that the hardware should be able to support the bandwidth (if it can do 75Hz at 1280 it sure should be able to do it at 1024!).  Higher vertical resolution was the main reason I bought the card over the Orchid F. VLB I currently have, and it will do 1024x768x70 Hz as well.  The higher graphics modes all crash HP Dashboard.  I just got off the phone with Orchid, and with the 1.1 drivers (I don't know what I have) he was unable to recreate the problem.  On the plus side, their tech rep was as helpful as he could be and booted up the program on his computer to verify he didn't have the problem.  He didn't know why they limited the refresh to 70 Hz either.  The board is faster that the OFVLB for most things according to the Hercules Speedy program. This program tests various operations and reports the results in pixels/second.  I don't have the numbers for the Graphite card, but they were close to half of the OFVLB (ie, slower) but that was running in a 20MHz 386, ISA, so the numbers aren't really comparable.  The following numbers were all obtained using a 486, 33 MHz, AIR motherboard (UMC chipset), with 8 MB memory.  I give ranges because the program reports the numbers as it computes them, and these tend to jump around a bit.

I have no idea what is being done internally as far as conversions go.  The memory to screen takes the same face and copies it to the screen, my guess is after it has been rasterized into a bitmap that can just be copied to the video display.  The screen to screen test copies that face from place to place on the screen.  Awesome!  Interestingly, the solid vectors and shaded polygons show no improvement, and hatched polygons (ie, filled with cross-hatching) and Ternary Rops (whatever they are.  Graphics operations like XORs maybe????) are a dead loss on the 9000.  I give two numbers for the 9000 fonts, because I think they are caching.

The problem is the LASTDRIVE command and the way NetWare in general (and in this case NETX in particular) adds drives to the device chain.  Setting LASTDRIVE=Z means there are no \\\"unassigned\\\" (as opposed to \\\"unused\\\") drive letters for NetWare to use, as it tacks its drive mappings -onto the end- of the existing list of drives.  W4WG obviously attaches its network drives to \\\"existing, unused\\\" drive letters.

These are generalizations but for the most part that is what the difference is.\",\" The difference in the litigation environment is reflected in the fees.  Lack of defensive medicine and near-absence of malpractice is really why we spend less using the most expensive approach of pure insurance in Canada (along with France and Germany) without HMO's --- the NYT has admitted that malpractice insurance fees are an order of magnitude lower in Canada but doctors take-home pay is almost equal to American doctors; also, minimal bureaucracy 'cos the system is so-o-o simple (early March).  Part of the deal for using the all-insurance approach like the French and Germans do (hey, why don't they criticize France and Germany?  Is it because too many people take French and German in college to make the accusations stick? (-;) was to preserve the doctors independance. Since the provincial wings of the CMA are the ones that go to bat when the fee schedule hikes are presented, the politically-bent doctors were just cackling when they realized the CMA would grow in strength rather than diminish, especially when unopposed unlike in socialized medicine approaches like Britain's National Health Service.   For non-life threatening things, market arguments adequately cover why certain procedures are in scarcer demand.  I have MD friends who can't make a living as specialists back in Manitoba not due to the insurance rates but because they won't get enough customers -- the CMA medical monopoly's grip on doctors licencing (as in the US) aside -- so they must move to larger places.  However, this does not refute debunking of waiting lines for urgent AND routine care, as has been done in the U.S. by Consumers Reports, health policy studies cited by Prof. Dennis E. Shea on USENET, CNN, NYT, etc.  Doug Fierro has posted a NYT article from 3 weeks ago about Canada's health insurance approach, on Talk.politics.medicine.  There is one small error in the article: not all of our hospitals are private.   Of course, the one thing to note is that in the Canada/France/Germany case, private insurance *offloaded* the basic coverage to the public sector.  They realized they were keeping low-risk/high-profit extra insurance for things like private/semi-private rooms (vs. ward accomodation), dental, glasses, etc. for corporate or personal benefits, they'll have nothing to do with you if you want to be covered for basic care.  At that point, they wouldn't even consider a \\\"voucher\\\" approach to broker the universal coverage and sell policies to make up the difference in the federal guidelines and market stuff.   It is \\\"free\\\" in that there are no deductibles nor copayments (two things which I advocate to make the Canadian insurance look more like real health insurance -- which actually it is).  I know that when working in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec, I was aware that I was paying for health insurance - e.g., in Toronto, OHIP fees were listed on my pay stub; Manitoba did not collect at paycheque time, but only annually at income tax time (built into the tax rate).  Only fiscal naifs will proclaim that it's free, along with the Canadian Left for that is part of their brainwashing agenda.  The French do have copayments, though.  France Magazine's Summer  1992 edition has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance coverage, including a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For  1-30 days, you're covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100% afterward.  With extra private insurance, you can get into a private hospital and be covered for any differences beyond the public hospital rate.  The public insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same cash amount for a private hospital and the difference is paid out-of-pocket or according to your supplementary private insurance. Over 2/3rds of French have some form of extra private insurance.  So, the other 30% of health costs in Europe are out of private funds, not gleaned from other taxes.  The GDP figures are combined public and private expenditures for total outlay using the same methods that yield the 13-14% figure for the U.S.   Health insurance does exist in Canada and in Western Europe, its just that it doesn't cover basic care.  You can opt out in Canada and Germany, but you'll have to go uninsured as a result because there are too few other people that do so --- i.e., no market.  When private insurance realized how much money they'd make without the risks involved in basic insurance (e.g., neurosurgery) versus deluxe amenities (e.g., having to call Granada TV to replace a rental set on the fritz in someone's private hospital room), they started to pat themselves on the back for their social responsibility.  In Quebec last spring, a consortium of private insurers publicly warned against any thoughts of privatizing routine, low cost parts of that province's public health insurance plan.  gld\",\" Yes, and what about Paul saying:  26 Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath: (Ephesians 4:26).

As sickening reports trickled in to the Azerbaijani border town of  Agdam, and the bodies piled up in the morgues, there was little doubt  that Khojaly and the stark foothills and gullies around it had been  the site of the most terrible massacre since the Soviet Union broke  apart.  .......

CORPSES LITTER HILLS IN KARABAKH  ANATOL LIEVEN COMES UNDER FIRE WHILE FLYING WITH AZERBAIJANI FORCES TO  INVESTIGATE THE ALLEGED MASS KILLINGS OF REFUGEES BY ARMENIAN TROOPS...  As we swooped low over the snow-covered hills of Nagorno-Karabagh we saw  the scattered corpses. Apparently, the refugees had been shot down as  they ran. An Azerbaijani film of the places we flew over, shown to  journalists afterwards, showed DOZENS OF CORPSES lying in various parts  of the hills.  The Azerbaijanis claim that AS MANY AS 1000 have died in a MASS KILLING  of AZERBAIJANIS fleeing from the town of Khodjaly, seized by Armenians  last week. A further 4,000 are believed to be wounded, frozen to death  or missing...   Seven of us squatted in the cabin of an Azerbaijani M24 attack helicopter  as we flew to investigate the claims of the mass killings. Suddenly there  was a thump against the underside of the aircraft, a red flash of tracer  ripped past the starboard wing, and the helicopter rocked sharply. We  swung round, and there was a deafening burst of fire from the cannon  under our wing as the helicopter crew returned fire.  We had been fired on from an Armenian anti-aircraft post. We swung round  again, tipped to starboard and appeared to dive straight down into a  valley. The brown earth swooped around our heads, the helicopter swung  round again and followed the contours of the ground. Our cannon fired  repeated blasts.  Later it emerged that a civilian helicopter that we had been escorting  had landed successfully at Nakhichevanik in the east of the disputed  enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, to pick up some of the dead. We had, in  fact, been attacked both by ground fire and by an Armenian helicopter.  I had seen the Armenian helicopter intermittently through the window,  its cannons firing, but had thought - mistakenly - that it was on  \\\"our side\\\". Our group of Western journalists had embarked on a  search-and-rescue flight that had become a combat mission.  Our flight consisted of the civilian passenger helicopter and two  M24 Soviet attack helicopters in the Azerbaijani service, nicknamed  flying crocodiles for their armour. Our party was in the second  crocodile. The civilian helicopter's job was to land in the mountains  and pick up bodies at sites of the mass killings. The attack helicopters  were there to give covering fire if necessary.  The operation showed a striking sign of the disintegration of the Soviet  armed forces because our pilot was a Russian officer. An Azerbaijani  official told us that there were now five former Soviet military  helicopters -and their pilots- fighting for Azerbaijan. \\\"They have  signed contracts to fly for us,\\\" he said. The helicopter we engaged  in combat was most probably flown by a brother-officer of our Russian  pilot, but fighting for the Armenians.  We had taken off just before 5pm on Saturday from Agdam airfield, an  heated for the Armenian-controlled mountains of Karabakh, a sheer  white wall in the distance. The civilian helicopter picked up four  corpses, and it was during this and a previous mission that an  Azerbaijani cameraman filmed the several the several dozen bodies  on the hillsides. We then took off again in a hurry and speed back  towards Azerbaijani lines. Azerbaijani gunners on the last hill before  the plain - and safety - gazed up at us as we passed.  Back at the airfield in Agdam, we took a look the bodies the  civilian helicopter had picked up. Two old men a small girl were  covered with blood, their limbs contorted by the cold and rigor  mortis. They had been shot.  What did our Russian pilot think of the tragedy, our close shave,  and the war in Nagorno-Karabakh? He gave us CHEERFUL GRIN, POLITELY  DECLINED TO ANSWER QUES TIONS, AND MARCHED OFF TO HIS DINNER.

If the (naive) market is flooded with proprietary, but weak, encryption, then truly strong  encryption will be unable to compete. Suppose the govt had a secret TV broadcast standard, and then sold TVs below cost. Private industry has a better standard, but it's not as widespread due to the govt early flooding of the market with cheap proprietary sets. Even though the industry's technology is better, the programming is being broadcast to the govt's unduplicatable standard. Who could compete?    The other flaw, of course, is that making something voluntary today ensures that it will be voluntary in the future.

An Appeal to Mankind  During the last three years Azerbaijan and its multinational population are vainly fighting for justice within the limits of the Soviet Union. All humanitarian, constitutional human rights guaranteed by the UN Charter, Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Helsinki Agreements, Human Problems International Forums, documents signed by the Soviet Union - all of them are violated.  The USSR's President, government bodies do not defend Azerbaijan though they are all empowered to take necessary measures to guarantee life and peace.  The 140,000 strong army of Armenian terrorists with Moscow's tacit consent wages an undeclared war of annihilation against Azerbaijan. As a result, a part of Azerbaijan has been occupied and annexed, hundreds of people killed, thousands wounded.  Some 200,000 Azerbaijanis have been brutally and inhumanly deported from the Armenian SSR, their historical homeland. Together with them 64,000 Russians and 22,000 Kurds have also been driven out, a part of them now settled in Azerbaijan. Some 40,000 Turkish-Meskhetians, Lezghins and representatives  of other Caucasian nationalities who escaped from the Central Asia where the President and government bodies did not guarantee them the life and peace also suffered from these deportations.  One of the scandalous vandalisms directed not only against Azerbaijan science but the world civilization as well is the Armenian extremists' destruction of the Karabakh scientific experimental base of The Institute of Genetics and Selection  of the Academy of Sciences of the Azerbaijan SSR.  We beg you for humanitarian help and political assistance, for the honour and dignity of 7 million Azerbaijanis are violated, its territory, culture  and history are trampled, its people are shot. There is persistent negative image of Azerbaijanians abroad, and this defamation is spread over  the whole world by Soviet mass media, Armenian lobby in the USSR and the United States.   One of the myths is that all events allegedly involves and generated by interethnic collisions and religious intolerance while the truth is that all these shootings and recent  events stem from the territorial claims of Armenia on Azerbaijan.  It is a well documented fact that before the conflict there were no frictions between Armenians and Azerbaijanis on the issue of Karabakh. Hundreds and thousands Armenians placidly and calmly lived and worked in Azerbaijan land, had their representatives in all government bodies of the Azerbaijan SSR.  We are for a united, indivisible, sovereign Azerbaijan, we  are for a common Caucasian home proclaimed in 1918 by one of the founding fathers of the Azerbaijan Democratic  Republic - Muhammed Emin Rasulzade.  But all these goals and expectations are trampled upon the Soviet leadership in favour of the Armenian expansionists encouraged by Moscow and intended to create a new '1,000 Year Reich' - the 'Great Armenia' - by annexing the  neighboring lands.  The world public opinion shed tears to save the whales, suffers for penguins dying out in the Antarctic Continent.  But what about the lives of seven million human beings? If these people are Muslims, does it mean that they are less valuable? Can people be discriminated by their  colour of skin or religion, by their residence or other attributes?  All people are brothers, and we appeal to our brothers for help and understanding. This is not the first appeal of Azerbaijan to the world public opinion. Our previous appeals were unheard. However, we still carry the hope that the truth beyond the Russian and Armenian propaganda will one day reveal the extent of our suffering and stimulate at least as much help and compassion for Azerbaijan as tendered to whales and penguins.

The Armenians are Christians, the Azerbaijanis are Moslems, and Islam is a religion especially unloved by the democrat-westernizers. Besides, at the root of this conflict lie the territorial claims on Azerbaijan, a consequence of which were the blood and suffering of innocent Azeri people, hundreds of thousands of refugees, and gross violations of human rights.   Recently Armenians attacked the Azeri town of Khojaly and massacred thousands of Azeris. The Paris-based 'Association for Democracy and Human Rights in Azerbaijan' puts the number of Khojali victims at 3,145. Some of the dead were scalped and mutilated. This whole thing has now gone entirely too far.   They already did. The scenario and genocide staged by the Armenians  78 years ago in the Ottoman Empire is being reenacted again - this  time in Azerbaijan. There are remarkable similarities between the  plots, the perpetrators, and the underdogs.   Report taken from The New York Times, Tuesday, March 3, 1992                      MASSACRE BY ARMENIANS BEING REPORTED       Agdam,Azerbaijan,March 2 (Reuters) - Fresh evidence emerged today  of a massacre of civilians by Armenian militants in Nagorno-Karabakh,  a predominantly Armenian enclave of Azerbaijan.      The republic of Armenia reiterated denials that its militants had killed 1,000 people in the Azerbaijani populated town of Khojaly last week and  massacred men, women and children fleeing the carnage across snow-covered mountain passes.      But dozen of bodies scattered over the area lent credence to Azerbaijani reports of a massacre.                           Scalping Reported      Azerbaijani officials and journalists who flew briefly to the region by helicopter brought back three dead children with the back of their heads blown off. They said shooting by Armenians has prevented them  from retrieving more bodies.      \\\"Women and children have been scalped,\\\" said Assad Faradshev, an aide to Nagorno-Karabakh's Azerbaijani Governor. \\\"When we began to pick up bodies, they began firing at us.\\\" are lying there like flocks of sheep.

Americans have become so insensitive to the needs of others and so completely wrapped up in themselves that they cannot see straight or think clearly enough to make even the slightest and most obvious moral decisions based on reality.  If a man abandons a woman to care for their child on her own, he is not considered to be a very respectable or decent man by anyone.  This man has fled his responsibility, has behaved like a lazy coward, and has turned away from his responsibility to his wife and child.  However, if a woman decides to kill her unborn child to release her burden, she is not thought of in the same way.  When the man abandons, the woman suffers but the child is free to grow up and live a happy and normal life. When the woman abandons, the child is diced or killed with saline or vacuumed out, and the man has no choice, and the man sometimes suffers so badly that he wishes he could trade places with his child.  Ths root of this whole problem is selfishness--the arrogance that says, \\\"My feelings and desires are supreme and your well being is not worth dung.\\\" And when you come down to it, this is the substance of what hell is made of.

At least I admit what I do.  At least I love myself and we all know that is the greatest love in the world--not that a man lay down his life for his brother...That sounds too \\\"christian\\\".  At the root, this is the substance of what hell is made of.  We've become a self indulgant, backslidden society no longer responsible to our children, to our parents, to our families, to our government, or to our God.  This is the root behind justification of every evil, of every corruption in government, of every slanderous remark, of every lie, and of every murder.  Society cannot continue to live like this long.  it will have to destroy itsself soon, and perhaps in the end, that will be the biggest blessing this world can hope to see.  Why do people see so much evil in trying to turn this situation around?  -- -----------------------------------------------------------------------  \\\"I deplore the horrible crime of child murder...

Smith, D.D.                               (1894-1977)            When Jesus was on Earth, He made an amazing prediction about      Himself, and frequently repeated it.  Let me quote it for you:                   Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son                of Man shall be betrayed unto the chief                priests and unto the scribes, and they shall                condemn Him to death, and shall deliver Him                to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and                to crucify Him; and the third day He shall                rise again\\\" (Matthew 20:18-19).            Wholly different from the normal experience of men, Jesus,      who had *never* done anything worthy of death, even deserving      reproval, knew He would die before He was 40 years of age.  He      knew the very city where He would die.  He knew that the religious      leaders of His own race would condemn Him to death.  He knew that      one of His own would betray Him.  He knew that before His actual      death took place He would be mocked and scourged.  He knew exactly      how He would die--*by crucifixion.*            All this is in itself remarkable.  But more amazing than the      minute particulars of His foreknowledge was what He predicted      would follow shortly after He was buried--*that He would rise      again.*  He even designated the time--on the third day.            But since it is on this central fact--the death and resurrec-      tion of Jesus Christ--that the whole truth or untruth of Chris-      tianity turns, let us examine it more closely.            The body of Jesus was embalmed in long sheets of cloth      between the layers of which a great abundance of spices and      ointments was distributed.  The body was placed in a tomb which      had never before been used, and a great stone was rolled against      the entrance.  The Jewish authorities, fully aware that Jesus had      predicted He would rise again, had the stone officially sealed and      on Saturday placed a guard before the tomb to prevent the      disciples from carrying away the body.  Early Sunday morning some      of the women who were faithful followers of Christ went out to the      tomb to further anoint the body.  To their utter astonishment,      they found the stone rolled away, the body gone.  They rushed back      to tell the disciples.  Shortly two of Jesus' friends, Peter and      John, utterly skeptical about the whole affair, came and found the      tomb empty, just as the women had said.  Even the guards came      hurrying into the city to tell the Sanhedrin that had hired them      to guard the tomb that the body was gone (Matthew 28:11).            How did this tomb become empty?            One of the most famous New Testament scholars in America--      professor of New Testament literature in a large theological      seminary--wrote to the author in answer to my question of *how*      the tomb became empty, and wrote it in a letter *not* marked by      bitterness or sarcasm, that he could no more explain how the tomb      became empty than he could explain how Santa Claus comes down the      chimney at Christmas time.            But he didn't realize that Santa Clause never did come down      any chimney at Christmas time, *because there never was a Santa      Claus!*  ...And there *is* a Jesus.  He died; He was buried in the      tomb of Joseph of Arimathea, and on Sunday the body was gone.            Those are facts of history.  No one can escape the responsi-      bility of coming to some conclusion about what really happened by      mentioning a myth we all abandoned before we were eight years old.            Another professor, Dr. Kirsopp Lake of Harvard University,      tried to explain the empty tomb by saying (what no other scholar      in the field of New Testament criticism has ventured to adopt)      that the women went to the wrong tomb.            The facts are these:            First, so far as we know, there was no other tomb nearby to      which by mistake they could have gone.            Second, it is contrary to all similar experience for three or      more people to forget the place where they have buried their      dearest loved one within less than three days.  Even if the women      did miss the tomb, when Peter and John came, did they too go to      the wrong tomb?            Third, were the soldiers *guarding* the wrong tomb?            There is, of course, a record of an attempt to escape the      evidence of the empty tomb in the New Testament itself.                    Now when they were going, behold, some                of the watch came into the city and showed                unto the chief priests all the things that                were done.  And when they were assembled                with the leaders and had taken counsel, they                gave large money unto the soldiers, Saying,                Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole                Him away while we slept.  And if this come to                the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and                secure you.  So they took the money, and did                as they were taught:  and this saying is com-                monly reported among the Jews until this day                (Matthew 28:11-15).            This is a good illustration of many later attempts to escape the      fact that the tomb was empty.            You will notice at once that the chief priests and the elders never      questioned but that the tomb *was* empty.  They never even went out to      see if what the guards had reported was true--they *knew* it was true.            Another fact about this story makes it ridiculous to maintain that      the tomb was empty--the soldiers were told to say that Jesus' disciples      came and stole the body away *while they* (the soldiers) *were asleep!*            How could they know what was going on while they were asleep?      Obviously, such testimony would be valueless in any court.            Even aside from the shallowness and sordidness that make us reject      the explanation, the very character and the later history of the      disciples compel us to believe they did not steal and secretly carry away      the body of Jesus.            First, as Professor Heffern points out, the leaders of Judaism in      Jerusalem, who had put the Lord Jesus to death, had nothing to offer to      contradict these disciples as they continued to preach Jesus and His      resurrection--because all Jerusalem knew the tomb was empty.  If there      had been trickery here, sooner or later it would have been suspected,      then proved.            Second, surely *one* of the disciples, even *most* of them, would      have confessed the fraud under the terrific persecution they underwent.      It may be possible to live a lie, but men seldom die for a lie--and most      of these men did.            The result ultimately would have been that the message that Christ      had risen would have suffered the fate of all such unfounded stories--it      would have lost it *power.*  Instead, this truth swept the world, closed      pagan temples, won millions of disciples, brought hope to a despairing      humanity, was the very foundation truth of the early church, and is today      as believable and as freshly glorious as ever.            But not only did Jesus come alive again, He did not disappear to      leave the disciples speculating through all the subsequent days as to      what had happened to Him.            Instead, He appeared to them--literally, visibly, frequently.            He appeared to the women at the tomb on Resurrection morning      (Matthew 28:1-10); later that day to Mary Magdalene alone (John 20:11-      18); and to Simon Peter, also alone (Luke 24:34).  In the afternoon He      walked with two of His followers toward Emmaus (Luke 24:13-35); and that      night He appeared to ten of the apostles gathered together in an upper      room at Jerusalem (Mark 16:14-16; Luke 24:36-40; etc.).            A week later He appeared to all eleven of the apostles, probably at      the same place (John 20:26-28).  Once He was seen by above 500 brethren      on a mountain in Galilee (I Corinthians 15:6); and finally to the      apostles just before His ascension (Mark 16:19; Luke 24:50-52; Acts 1:3-      8).            As with the fact of the empty tomb, so in regard to these histor-      ically recorded appearances, all kinds of theories have been proposed      attempting to deny their literalness.  But these theories are      unreasonable, without supporting evidence.  None has ever won the      unanimous approval of those who refuse to believe in the reality of the      appearances.            Moreover, while it is true we are living in an age when may of our      leading scientists and agnostics and many of our philosophers are      antisuperanaturalistic, let us not forget that some of the greatest      thinkers of the ages have firmly believed in this great miracle.      Increase Mather, president of Harvard; Timothy Dwight, president of Yale;      Nathan Lord, president of Dartmouth; Edward Hitchcock, president of      Amherst; Mark Hopkins, president of Williams; John Witherspoon, president      of Princeton--these men and countless others have believed it.            But suppose Christ *did* rise from the dead, what of it?  What has      it to do with *my* life?  What has it to do with *your* life?  Just this:      it seals with certitude the teachings of Christ.            Jesus taught many great truths--especially many about Himself.  He      claimed to have come down *from* God.            He said He was the way *to* God.            He said He was the Son of God, who alone knew God perfectly.            He said that whoever believed on Him had eternal life, and no one      else had it.            He said that whatever we ask God in His name, He would grant it to      us.            Thus when He did rise from the grave on the third day, He revealed      that in these amazing, unparalleled predictions, *He spoke the truth!*            Do you know any reason, *any good reason,* why we should not believe      that His words are all true?            The point is, does not the truth of the Resurrection convince us      that He is none other than the One He claimed to be--the Son of God?            And then, of course, the fact that Christ rose from the dead      testifies that He has broken the power of death, and that He will some      day raise us also up from the grave, as He promised.            In other words, if this Person, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, in all      this, He should be the cornerstone of the foundation of your life.  For      He said a life built on Him would know forgiveness of sins, His compan-      ionship and help, a joy that no circumstances can ever take away, and a      hope that shineth more and more unto a perfect day.\",\"  If anyone gets the New York Times, the Edit page has a transcript of a VHS from Hams describing their methods of torture and  execution.

He came highly touted as a defensive defenseman, but he's clearly much more than that. Great skater and hard shot (though wish he were more accurate). In fact, he pretty much allowed the Kings to trade away that huge defensive liability Paul Coffey. Kelly Hrudey is only the biggest disappointment if you thought he was any good to begin with. But, at best, he's only a mediocre goaltender. A better choice would be Tomas Sandstrom, though not through any fault of his own, but because some thugs in Toronto decided  to threaten his career in order to avoid conceding a goal. Other than that, the award goes to Robert Lang, an uninspiring Czech. Robitaille could easily be MVP, but I'd prefer to give it to Rob Blake who is quietly becoming one of the league's premier defensemen, and if the Kings manage to hold onto him and the  rest of our young defense, it could one day mean that we'll let in fewer goals than Hartford.

I guess for DOS users who think multi-tasking is really _neat_ (add puke here) and are overjoyed to  be able to use more than 64K of memory, its a major improvement. For Windows users its more like an upgrade with facilities most Unix users take for  granted. Most of  Windows users only use PCs for text processing or running  3rd-party applications anyway so the operating system features are not even  a real issue. My ideal operating system:   Binary compatible across all plaforms. It should recognize  binaries and configure on the fly, so I don't have to have  bin/Mac bin/DOS bin/Dec bin/Sun bin/HP etc...   Multi-CPU. So I can use the CPUs on my PC and W/S and Mac   and Transputers and DSPs. I don't know a single site which   has gone for a single vendor. I am not going to trade-in   80Mflops per H1 transputer or ultra-fast FFT on DSP chips.  Note NT runs on Symmetric multi-CPU systems.   Built-in portable GUI/Graphics tools. You can call DrawButton   or DrawLine and it does the same thing no matter what platform   or display. It should also translate graphics commands on-the-fly.  so I can use PC graphics S/W on my workstation and X software on    my PC. I think GUIs are not just nice to have but essential.   Configurable front-end. So you can make it look like Unix or DOS  or NT or OS/2, and run shell scripts or command/BAT files.   Object oriented. So I can program easily under it and not have  to re-invent the wheel if the networking is not up to scratch  or my application needs to access source/object code on the fly.  In other words it should have some AI capability. That and a tight, clean kernel so you can actually understand it.

The followup isn't \\\"news\\\" ...\",\" The Centaur that is being built for T4 would be a better bet to integrate  onto the Proton as the T4/Centaur is designed for the Extremely Harsh  envorinment of the T4 launch. It is also closer to 4 m in diameter.   You've hit on the real kicker, however. The Centaur is pressure stabilized.  It cannot hold up its own weight without pressure in the tanks. Additionally,  the pressure difference between the two tanks must be maintained to ~+/- 5 psi.  That is rather tight to be rocking and rolling on the train. The pressure  stabilization is how centaur achieves the performance. On numerous occasions (when I was there 88-91) the AF wanted to see what it would take to make  a non-pressure stabilized centaur. The answer -- a centaur not worth launching.   The Atlas/Centaur does not require on-pad integration, however the T4/Centaur does. I believe the on-pad integration is to a great extent due to the  cleanliness requirements and PFL configuration, so maybe something can be  done there........    The addition of LOX/LH facilities is critical as the centaur tops off as it  lifts off. A LHe facility is also needed. I don't know what the proton uses  for fuel, but since they are derived from ICBM's I would suspect that they  use storable propellants which don't have the ullage problem that cryo's  do. If there is no cryo at the sight at all, the addition of these systems  could be big $$, not to mention the real tech transfer issues involved with  providing centaur GSE to Russia.

This is regardless of technology.  Be careful to separate the issues of related to speed and dispersion of technology (how far the letter went and how quickly it got there) and the message being passed in the technology (something that seems to be totally wrong.)   When lecturing in this area I challenge my (non-christan/atheistic) class about the impact technology has on life, quality of life and the rights that they consider important.  Depending on how you work out your faith will determine your response to the use of technology.  For example friends of mine are considering IVF due to a life threatening situation the wife is going through; when it is over they will have the baby. (God willing).  In this case the technology is available and my friends have to decide what to do.  In all cases though you must decide if the technology is against God's revealed word.  Regards  David\",\" If you write a second time to a CD you need to have multi-session capability to read the second session.  Whether it is photos or just data or whatever.  Here is a simplified way of looking at it: The first session has the directory structure burned at some tracks.  The second session has a newer directory structure, but the first directory still exists, because you cannot change, only add.  So if you put that in a 'normal' drive and it will only look to the first directory and think it has found all data.  Multisession kindof means that the drive will look for the last directory written to the disc, older systems look only for 'the' directory, not taking multiple directories into account.\",\"       Yes, please create the group alt.raytrace soon!!

(2)  It seems probable that no one displayed the body of Jesus because no one knew where it was.  I personally believe that the most likely explanation was that the body was stolen (by disciples, or by graverobbers). Don't bother with the point about the guards ... it only appears in one gospel, and seems like exactly the sort of thing early Christians might make up in order to counter the grave-robbing charge.

Mine already works fine (albeit slow) and after having blown up a monitor I found  out which switch controlled the interlace/non interlace facility..   But I'm curious as to why there are 8 dip switches on the card with apparantly little use..  2) Secondly, does anyone know why Commodore had to be so crazed in their design of the PC-40 motherboard with respect to the RAM.. (IE 512 + 512 or 640 +0K) ??  3) Can anyone supply pin details for the expansion ports for a pc (8 or 16 bit ) .. or even a sample circuit to cause an irq when a button is pressed... (Yeah I know its a piece of cake.. I'm lazy 8)  4) Software wise.. Anyone care to divulge some tips on accessing expanded RAM on a PC (from a program written in Turbo C++)....   For instance, using farcoreleft() and coreleft() return only memory available from the base 640K regardless of combinations of EMM386 etc etc...

So do you also oppose all ideologies?  I don't think your argument is an argument against religion at all, but just points out the weaknesses of human nature.   I would like a reference if you have got one, for this is news to me.   One must approach the Qur'an with intelligence.  Any thinking approach to the Qur'an cannot but interpret the above verse and others like it that women and men are spiritual equals.  I think that the above verse does clearly imply that women have souls.  Does it make any sense for something without a soul to be forgiven?  Or to have a great reward (understood to be in the after-life)?  I think the usual answer would be no -- in which case, the part saying \\\"For them has God prepared forgiveness and a great reward\\\" says they have souls.    (If it makes sense to say that things without souls can be forgiven, then  I have no idea _what_ a soul is.)  As for your saying that the quote above may not be given a high priority in all interpretations, any thinking approach to the Qur'an has to give all verses of the Qur'an equal priority.  That is because, according to Muslim belief, the _whole_ Qur'an is the revelation of God -- in fact, denying the truth of any part of the Qur'an is sufficient to be considered a disbeliever in Islam.   Look, any approach to the Qur'an must be done with intelligence and thought.  It is in this fashion that one can try to understand the Quran's message.  In a book of finite length, it cannot explicitly answer every question you want to put to it, but through its teachings it can guide you.  I think, however, that women are the spiritual equals of men is clearly and unambiguously implied in the above verse, and that since women can clearly be \\\"forgiven\\\" and \\\"rewarded\\\" they _must_ have souls (from the above verse).  Let's try to understand what the Qur'an is trying to teach, rather than try to see how many ways it can be misinterpreted by ignoring this passage or that passage.  The misinterpretations of the Qur'an based on ignoring this verse or that verse are infinite, but the interpretations  fully consistent are more limited.  Let's try to discuss these interpretations consistent with the text rather than how people can ignore this bit or that bit, for that is just showing how people can try to twist Islam for their own ends -- something I do not deny -- but provides no reflection on the true teachings of Islam whatsoever.\",\"As an animal science student, I know that a number of animals transfer immunoglobin to thier young through thier milk.

However, from what I have seen, it is not often presented in this manner. It is usually presented more in the form, \\\"And *besides*, I cannot see... ...nor have I ever been offered a convincing explanation.\\\"  Moreover, it is not unreasonable to ask for an explanation for such phenomena.

I have tried to find info on this but I could not get precise answers.  On one hand, we have a Quadra 950 with a 16\\\" monitor, which is capable of 32-bit color. How much VRAM does it have? On the other hand, we have a Quadra 800 with a 16\\\" monitor, which is capable of 8-bit color only, so it must have 512 Ko of VRAM.

There are several different speeds of SMD, and I think that the  Fuji drive you have is rated at about 24 Mb/sec (thats megabits).  There used to be several companies that made couplers for the PC (Interphase in Texas being one), but I think that the market pretty much has dried up. Controllers for this type of drive are readily available for VME buses though.  Rumor has it that there is a SMD to SCSI adapter available, but I think that it was designed for slower SMD devices.  In other words, if you have a PC or Mac, that drive is pretty much dogmeat. Cheers, Corwin \",\"  Say, you bought your Saturn at $13k, with a dealer profit of $2k. If the dealer profit is $1000, then you would only be paying $12k for the same car.  So isn't that saving money?  Moreover, if Saturn really does reduce the dealer profit margin by $1000,  then their cars will be even better deals.  Say, if the price of a Saturn was already $1000 below market average for the class of cars, then after they reduce the dealer profit, it would be $2000 below market average.  It will:  1) Attract even more people to buy Saturns because it would SAVE THEM MONEY.   2) Force the competitors to lower their prices to survive.  Now, not only will Saturn owners benefit from a lower dealer profit, even  the buyers for other cars will pay less.

From  the writings  of tye biographers  you  quoted,  I can  perceive,  maybe chauvinistically,  the  remnants of  her  Armenian genes. Even  though she  is only  1/64th Armenian, she   seems   to   have   many   of   the   strong characteristics  of Armenian  women. Her  Armenian ancestry is  traced to Eliza Kewark  (an Armenian from  India), who  married  the Scottish  merchant Thedore Forbes.  From the union was  born Kathleen Scott  Forbes,  who  married  James  Crombie  from Aberdeen. They  had a  daughter Jane,  who married David  Littlejohn.  Their  daughter  Ruth  married William Gill. Ruth Silvia Gill, the grandmother of Lady  Diana,   married  Lord  Fermoy,   and  their daughter, Frances  Ruth Burke Roache,  married the eight Earl of Spencer, who  was the father of Lady Diana. It is noteworthy  that Eliza Kewark was also referred  to as  Mrs. Forbesian  (a characteristic Armenian  surname  ending).  An  Armenian-Scottish gene mix is dynamite.  Levon K.

Anyway, the Armenians tore apart the Ottoman Empire's eastern provinces, massacred 2.5 million defenseless Turkish women, children and elderly  people, burned thousands of Turkish and Kurdish villages and exterminated  the entire Turkish population of the Armenian dictatorship between  1914-1920. Such outrageous sleight of hand that is still employed today  in Armenia brings a depth and verification to the Turkish genocide  that is hard to match. A hundred years ago Armenians again thought  they could get whatever they wanted through sheer terror like the  Russian anarchists that they accepted as role models. Several Armenian  terror groups like ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle  resorted to the same tactics in the 1980s, butchering scores of innocent Turks and their families in the United States and Europe.

No help there. Then, not having anything better to try, I changed Normal IRQ to Delayed IRQ on the disk controller (didn't make any difference) and IOCHRDY_not_ driven to IDE_drive_controls_IOCHRDY (also had no effect).  So I put  everything back to the way it was and re-installed the cards.  I then unplugged the floppy drive cable from the disk controller.  Voila!, the PC booted from power up, although it seemed to take several seconds  before the first access to the hard disk.  Plug the floppy cable back to the controller and the original (non-boot) behavior returns.

They also practice their missionary work with zeal among Catholics in the United States, but to someone who is or was raised Catholic such rhetoric is pretty off-putting.  It may work better in an environment where there's a lot of popular anti-clericalism.

It was looking sparse (about 40 people) until the speaker began, whereupon about 120 more people followed the loudspeakers from wherever they had been lost, and filled out the area something proud.  Mike Yacino of GOAL spoke.  One of his best throwaway lines was to remind us that all of us holders of carry permits there had been checked and certified clear of all crimes by the state; while the people in the Statehouse behind us only had to be certified clean of \\\"election fraud\\\" to hold their jobs.  Nancy Snow and Amos Hamburger were busy handing out ID buttons and sheets describing all the bills to be presented at the hearings, and telling people where to find their own representatives (and in too many cases, who they were).  Mike warned us that the committee was going to suspend its rules and discuss a bill that hadn't made it onto the official list.  It seems a delegation of students from Simon's Rock of Bard College (alma mater of Wayne Lo, who shot up the place with an SKS late last year) was being bussed in to testify for a bill to ban all sales of firearms or ammo to anyone who is not a state resident.  The hearings were originally scheduled in the (large) Gardner Auditorium at 10:30, but that had been pre-empted by the Governor's hearings on the Framingham Eight (women in prison for killing abusive husbands, and seeking release).  So we had until 1:30 to buttonhole our representatives, after which we would be squashed into an inadequate hearing room.  One of my representatives' staffers was somewhat offensively smarmy. He said, \\\"Oh, it must be gun hearings day again!  The gun lobby is always so organized every year.\\\"  I got a little pissed, and replied, \\\"I'm not from the gun lobby -- I'm from your district.\\\"  At 12:30, your second reporter arrived in time to notice a demonstration going on in front of the statehouse (where the pro-gunners weren't).  Randy Price from the TV News was there, in his mirror reflective shades, talking to one of the anti-gun types, and several Simon's Rock anti-gun \\\"close-the-loophole\\\" protestors. (Earlier, Randy had covered the GOAL rally.)  The room we had been assigned seated about 50.  Remember, there were about 160 gun owners there, plus another 20-30 students and teachers from Bard.  One of us had already reserved a seat; the other never got closer than the atrium outside -- and there was a crowd behind HIM.  A cop took up station at the entrance and prevented the rest of the crowd from coming in.  Soon after the debate started, a loudspeaker was set up outside in the hall for the benefit of everyone else.  Everyone who was there (inside and outside) got to sign up on a sheet saying what their position was on which bills.  Most of us signed up to \\\"support GOAL's position\\\" on \\\"all bills.\\\"  First, because of their time constraints, public officials got to testify.  And first up was the bill that nobody had seen (the students had some curfew, I guess).    Currently, Massachusetts law allows a non-resident to purchase long guns or ammo from a local dealer provided he complies with the laws of his own state.  Previously, the law was similar, but applied only to non-residents from states adjoining Massachusetts.  The Simon's Rock folks called the current law a \\\"loophole\\\" and wanted it closed.  Two of their reps spoke about Wayne Lo and his \\\"SKS assault rifle.\\\" The second one, Hodgekiss, a co-sponsor, had done his homework so well that he kept confusing Montana (Wayne Lo's home state) with Missouri, and became belligerent when about five gun owners in the gallery corrected him after his second muff.  Carr, from Gloucester, claimed that the new bill would put the law back the way it was, but he was lying: the new bill allows purchases by non-residents of adjoining states ONLY if they have licensing in their own state \\\"as strong as\\\" that in Massachusetts.  Since none of them do, that's that.  Some of the things these two said were really offensive.  \\\"In some of these other states, anyone can buy a gun as long as he's breathing!\\\" (Oooooo!)  \\\"We have some very, very good gun laws in Massachusetts; if only the other states would adopt the same type of laws, we wouldn't be having this situation -- but they won't.\\\"  (Naughty, naughty!)  Next up was Boston city councilman Albert \\\"Dapper\\\" O'Neill.  He was there to testify pro-gun, but in some ways he was a liability.  He's reasonably elderly and tends to wander and repeat himself, plus he's almost a caricature of a law-n-order politician.  He badmouthed the ACLU, said violent criminals should be executed, and that if he were judge, he'd give arrestees their \\\"last rights\\\" (pun intended) on the spot (at which many of the gun owners applauded, which bothered me.) He said that all the proposed gun restrictions were a step in the right direction -- for the criminals.  He said this FOUR times :-(  Two of the bills under consideration would allow police to rescind a CCW or FID, and confiscate all your guns, if someone had filed a restraining order against you.  (Note that the filing of a restraining order requires no warrant, no hearing, no evidence, and no conviction -- just an accusation.)  Senator Barrett of Reading testified in favor of it, and patronized the pro-gunners there several times by saying, \\\"I'm sure all the gun owners here will agree with me that we have to get these weapons out of the hands of people that our courts have convicted.\\\"  I haven't seen such a disgustingly disingenuous performance since Nixon whined that he wasn't a crook.  Barrett also spoke in favor of the bill making the FID card renewable every five years, instead of permanent as it is now.  The stated purpose is to remove FID cards from those who have become ineligible. \\\"Revenue has nothing to do with it.\\\"  (Yeah, right.)  Apparently, some congressmen think we're stupid enough to swallow the argument that it's preferable to process 1.6 million renewals every cycle in the vague hope of catching a recent felon than to simply take the goddamn card away from a criminal at conviction time.  As usual, hassle the law-abiding instead of the crook.  The two co-chairs of the committee were Rep. Caron and Sen. Jujuga. Jujuga didn't say much (he was a co-sponsor of both \\\"restraining order\\\" bills) but Caron struck me as a sharp guy that wouldn't let any bad logic or lies on the part of either side to go unchallenged.  (He  was a co-sponsor of one of the \\\"restraining order\\\" bills as well.)  One of the younger reps on the committee (forgot his name) was vociferously pro-gun, somewhat embarrassingly so.  His heart was in the right place, but his arguments seemed to be confined to, \\\"every year it's the same damn thing, you come in here with this crap...\\\" It's nice to have a friend on the committee, but he could have been more effective.  At about 3:00, it was clear that the hall-jam couldn't continue. Someone came out of another meeting hall and yelled at the cop because the loudspeaker was disturbing their meeting, so the loudspeaker was disconnected.  So they found a bigger hall upstairs.  One of us had to leave to catch his charter bus, and so missed the \\\"public\\\" testimony; the other got a seat this time.  Caron began by talking about how he got his FID 16 years ago, left the state, and then returned without notifying them of his address change. He complained that the state record system was not up-to-date and that his PD back in his city of birth still thought he lived there.  Great quote: \\\"If you purchase a gun today, it will not get into the state computer system until 1999.\\\"  (This was also an argument he used against the renewable FID card.)  Testimony was heard from several \\\"battered women,\\\" one of whom had been attacked by some guy in his 20's who had an FID card because he got it when he was 15 or thereabouts.  They used a lot of emotion and said how they were scared of these men.  A staffer of Attorney General Harshbarger testified in favor of this anti-gun bill, saying how 50,000 restraining orders were granted last year, and how these women needed to be protected.  Caron noted that a restraining order was granted for 10 days, and then a hearing was held to determine whether the order would be extended to a year.  He asked whether she would be satisfied if the FID were revoked at the time of this hearing rather than after the initial issuance of the FID.  She gave some long rambling circumlocution in response.  Then testimony against the bill was heard.  Mike Yacino (who looks something like Einstein) got up and made the point that restraining orders were issued on too little evidence, that judges like to issue restraining orders just to let things cool off no matter who they think is right (man or woman), and that the hearings for restraining orders are lightning sessions with little time to consider facts. Atty. Karen McNutt spoke with him a few times during his testimony.  Other pro-gunners got up to testify.  One said he had had to file a restraining order against a tenant to clear her out, and that she countered by filing one against him!  He noted that this would have allowed the state to confiscate his guns if the new bill became law. One of the junior reps noted that \\\"this is America\\\" and we have to be certain that individual rights are respected.  Senator Jujuga reiterated this, saying that \\\"people who abuse smaller people can go to Hell as far as I care, but we have to be careful about equating conviction with a restraining order.\\\"  (Point and match, Senator.)  Another pro-gunner got up and testified that he didn't know his citizenship \\\"expired every 5 years,\\\" and that a driver's license was a privilege, not a right like the right to keep and bear arms.  A third got up and said the problem was with the criminal justice system, and argued in favor of a death penalty bill and public hangings.  Senator Jujuga said he had himself tried to get a death penalty bill passed, and joking responded that he, too, favored public hangings.  The speaker then responded, \\\"I'll make you a deal.  You get me the rope, and I'll tie the noose.\\\"  Next came public testimony on the Simon's Rock bill.  A teacher testified that she had been the teacher of Wayne Lo, and that \\\"he wouldn't have been able to shoot people inside a building while he was outside\\\" without his evil gun.  She said that the \\\"loophole\\\" should be closed to prevent something like this from \\\"ever happening again\\\".  Four or five other kids testified in favor of this bill, one of spilling tears for the good legislators.  One of the students actually shot by Wayne Lo was also there.  Many of them had T shirts on, saying, \\\"As long as one person can buy a gun in anger, none of us are safe -- support gun control.\\\"  The committee was reluctant to grill or correct the kids, except for Caron, who corrected one student who had claimed that anyone could apply for an FID.  \\\"Only residents can get FID's,\\\" he said.  (How much do you want to bet that this kid had no idea he had been conned into testifying for a bill that would cut out-of-staters completely off?)  Yacino and McNutt spoke again, this time noting that the bill as written would affect both ammo AND ALL guns possessed by out-of-staters.  Karen also noted that hunters in CT, NH, and VT could be put away for a year if they wandered across the MA boundary somewhere in the woods and got challenged by game wardens.  Yacino underscored the fact that Lo COULD have gotten an FID as a resident student -- and, hell, even an CCW, as he had NO criminal or mental record.  One junior rep was upset that it would take MA residents longer to buy a gun than out-of-staters, and thought it was \\\"elitist\\\".  Another (Caron?) said that we need the protection of preventing non-residents from buying without an FID because only two other states in the union had \\\"FID-type\\\" cards, so complying with all the laws of one's home state was \\\"not enough.\\\"  One pro-gun speaker replied that this resembled a mother watching her son in a marching band and exclaiming, \\\"Everyone's out of step but Johnny!\\\"  All the Bard College people were filing out as the pro-gun testimony for this bill was made, and thus only pro-gunners were around when the other bills came under consideration.  The main bills remaining (and GOAL's position) were:  o  H.4375 and four others: Notify police chiefs so they can pull     licenses when a holder is convicted (strongly supported)  o  H.1732: Require trigger locks on all handguns sold (opposed)  o  H.962: Require trigger locks on all loaded firearms (strongly    opposed)  o  H.1350: Allow every municipality to enact their own gun laws     (opposed)  o  H.1731: Fund bullet-proof vests for municipal police (supported)  o  S.1097: State Constitutional Amendment for the RKBA (supported)  o  Several on police discretion in the issuance of FID cards (opposed)  o  Several altering non-resident license conditions (supported)  o  H.1135: Ban damn near all guns everywhere in the state (guess!)  Some of these took only 30 seconds to consider, as the remaining pro-gunners raised hands in unison either for or against them.  Mike Yacino noted that, besides the danger in screwing with a trigger lock on a loaded gun, that bill would make it illegal for a licensee to carry his concealed handgun unless it were locked.  Caron blew right through H.1350 when he saw that we opposed it. Again, he brought up the state's archaic records capability and said, \\\"This would create hundreds of different licensing systems.\\\"  The session ran late -- since it was the last scheduled hearing, it could not be adjourned until everyone who wanted to had testified.  It ended at about 6:30. -- \",\"     Okay... I argued this thoroughly about 3-4 weeks ago.  Men and women are different ... physically, physiologically, and psychologically.  Much recent evidence for this statement is present in the book \\\"Brainsex\\\" by Anne Moir and David Jessel.  I recommend you find a copy and read it. Their book is an overview of recent scientific research on this topic and is well referenced.   Now, if women and men are different in some ways, the law can only adequately take into account their needs in these areas where they are different by also taking into account the ways in which men and women are different.  Maternity leave is an example of this -- it takes into account that women get pregnant.  It does not give women the same rules it would give to men, because to treat women like it treats men in this instance would be unjust.  This is just simply an obvious example of where men and women are intrinsically different!!!!!  Now, people make the _naive_ argument that sexism = oppression. However, maternity leave is sexist because MEN DO NOT GET PREGNANT.  Men do not have the same access to leave that women do (not to the same extent or degree), and therefore IT IS SEXIST.  No matter however much a man _wants_ to get pregnant and have maternity leave, HE NEVER CAN.  And therefore the law IS SEXIST.  No man can have access to maternity leave, NO MATTER HOW HARD HE TRIES TO GET PREGNANT.  I hope this is clear.  Maternity leave is an example where a sexist law is just, because the sexism here just reflects the \\\"sexism\\\" of nature in making men and women different.  There are many other differences between men and women which are far more subtle than pregnancy, and to find out more of these I recommend you have a look at the book \\\"Brainsex\\\".  Your point that perhaps some day men can also be pregnant is fallacious. If men can one day become pregnant it will be by having biologically become women!  To have a womb and the other factors required for pregnancy is usually wrapped up in the definition of what a woman is -- so your argument, when it is examined, is seen to be fallacious.  You are saying that men can have the sexist maternity leave privilege that  women can have if they also become women -- which actually just supports my statement that maternity leave is sexist.   There is no official priesthood in Islam -- much of this function is taken by Islamic scholars.  There are female Islamic scholars and female Islamic scholars have always existed in Islam.  An example from early Islamic history is the Prophet's widow, Aisha, who was recognized in her time and is recognized in our time as an Islamic scholar.   You have no evidence for your blanket statement about all religions, and I dispute it.  I could go on and on about women in Islam, etc., but I recently reposted something here under the heading \\\"Islam and Women\\\" -- if it is still at your news-site I suggest you read it.  It is reposted from soc.religion.islam, so if it has disappeared from alt.atheism it still might be in soc.religion.islam (I forgot what its original title was though).  I will email it to you if you like.    Your statement that \\\"other religions are no different\\\" is, I think, a statement based simply on lack of knowledge about religions other than Christianity and perhaps Judaism.   Aisha, who I mentioned earlier, was not only an Islamic scholar but also was, at one stage, a military leader.   The Prophet's first wife, who died just before the \\\"Hijra\\\" (the Prophet's journey from Mecca to Medina) was a successful businesswoman.  Lucio, you cannot make a strong case for your viewpoint when your viewpoint is based on ignorance about world religions.\",\"THE WHITE HOUSE                      Office of the Press Secretary ______________________________________________________________ For Immediate Release                             April 13, 1993                                    REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT,                SECRETARY OF EDUCATION RICHARD RILEY AND                    SECRETARY OF LABOR ROBERT REICH  IN                  GOALS 2000 SATELLITE TOWN HALL MEETING                             Chamber of Commerce Building                            Washington, D.C.       8:30 P.M. EDT                     SECRETARY RILEY:  Good evening and welcome to all of you  in the thousands of communities around the country that are taking  part in this satellite town meeting for the month of April.              You know, today is April 13th.  In 1743, Thomas  Jefferson was born, 250 years ago.  I think that's appropriate to  mention at the beginning of this meeting because since that time he  has been, of course, a person who has been one that we've all  followed in terms of our democracy and the importance of education  here in this great country.  The success of our democracy according  to Jefferson really depends upon the success of our educational  system.              His philosophy of government, his belief in the  importance of education is also very meaningful to our special guest  here this evening.  Tonight we're so pleased to have with us  President Clinton.  He's come over from the White House to join us in  the Chamber of Commerce studios.                Mr. President, it's good to have you.  We thank you for  taking the time to visit with these communities here on the satellite  network and we welcome you here this evening.              Also we have with us Secretary of Labor Robert Reich.   And, Bob, it's certainly pleasant to have you with us this evening  also.              I have some questions for our two guests, and I'm sure  many of you do, too.  So please call us if there's something that  you'd like to ask.  The number is 1/800/368-5781 or 5782.  In  Washington, D.C. the number is 202/463-3170 or 3171.              I believe the President has a few words that he might  want to share with us.  And, Mr. President, I'll ask you to do that  at this time.  It's great to have you.              THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.              I'm glad to be here with my friends, Dick Riley and Bob  Reich -- also members of my Cabinet -- at the headquarters of the  Chamber of Commerce to support the effort that the Chamber is making,  along with its Center for Work Force Preparation, to help to examine  tonight the whole critical question of how to move our young people  from school to the work place.              I want to compliment the Chamber on all their efforts,  recognizing that without an educated work force we can't grow this  economy or remain competitive, and recognizing that we all have to  work together -- business and government, labor and educators -- to  make things happen.              This satellite town meeting is a good example of that  kind of working together.  And if you'll forgive me a little home  state pride, I want to say a special word of thanks to the Wal-Mart  Corporation, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas, for providing  several hundred of the sites for this town meeting tonight.  I  appreciate that a lot, as well as the sites that are provided for all  the rest of you.              I have tried as hard as I could to move toward  constructive change for this country.  Secretary Riley talked about  this being Thomas Jefferson's 250th birthday.  If Thomas Jefferson  believed in anything, he believed in these three things:  first, in  education; second, in real personal liberty, freedom of religion,  freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of the press; and  third, in the absolute imperative of changing as times change.                If you go to the Jefferson Memorial here in this  beautiful city, which is now bedecked with all of its wonderful  cherry blossoms, you will see Jefferson saying that we have to change  with changing times.              For us here in America, that means reducing our deficit  and increasing our investment and putting our people first so that we  can compete in the world.  We're here to talk about that tonight -- about what we can do to educate and train our people better.  Unless  we do that, none of the efforts that all the rest of us make in  government, even to bring the budget into balance, even to increase  our investment in other things which will grow jobs, will last in the  long run.              We also have to have people who can carry their load.   And in a world where the average young person will change jobs seven  or eight times in a lifetime, that begins with the education system  and continues into the work force where education must go on for a  lifetime.  It's not just important what you know, but what you can  learn.              And if I might, I'd like to close just by emphasizing  we're doing our best to try to have the most innovative partnership  between the Labor Department and the Education Department and the  private sector to build a good school-to-work transition.  And we're  trying to get off to a good start this summer with a program that  would create more than 700,000 new summer jobs, including many  thousands that have a strong education component so our young people  can be learning and working at the same time.              Dick, I think I ought to stop there.  That's a good  place we can begin, I think, the discussion.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you so much, Mr. President.              Each month we get together and talk about ways that all  citizens can work towards reaching the national education goals.  And  tonight, we'll focus on goal five, and how communities such as yours  can prepare students for this world of work.              This week, the Education Department and the Labor  Department are hosting a conference here in Washington, D.C. called  Summer Challenge, a program of work and learning, to America's youth.   The aim is to use some special funds from President Clinton's  proposed economic stimulus package to provide educationally-enriched  jobs and summer school programs for young people in disadvantaged  areas of the country.                Mr. President, let's talk a minute -- you alluded to it  somewhat -- about the  Summer Youth Challenge.  Your program calls  for more educational enrichment in the summer jobs.  And why in your  words is that so important?              THE PRESIDENT:  I think it's important for two reasons.   First of all, a lot of the young people we're trying to reach may  have had trouble adjusting to school and learning.  And while we want  them to have a good experience with a real job, we also want them to  continue to learn during the summer because we know from a lot of  research that a lot of kids that have trouble learning in school may  forget as much as 30 percent of what they learned the previous year  over the summertime.  And that is a very unproductive thing for  schools to have to take up a lot of time teaching what they already  taught before.              Secondly, we want to help these young people progress,  not only in terms of work, but in terms of learning.  We want to  abolish the artificial dividing line between what is work and what is  learning because we think that the best and most productive workers  will have to be lifetime learners.  And we think that this experience  could maybe drive that point home and prepare these young people to  succeed in school, or at work, or in college as they go on.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I think the fact that these are  disadvantaged kids -- that gap, that lag you mentioned as they go  into the next year, is really even greater.                Secretary Reich, of course, you have training programs  throughout the year.  And I wonder is you have any comment about this  educational component of training.              SECRETARY REICH:  Well, what we've learned, Mr.  Secretary, is that for many young people, whether it's for the summer  or for the year, actually on-the-job work experience combined with  education is one of the best ways of learning.  Many young people,  for example, have a lot -- they have a difficult time learning  geometry.  But when they actually are there building something or  working on something, and they can see the exact and direct  application of geometry, they understand what it's used for.  And a  lot of young people -- just that sense of connection between  education and the world of work is terribly, terribly important.   It's important during the summer, but it's important for a lot of  young people even beyond the summer.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you.                Mr. President, you've called for a youth apprenticeship  program, school-to-work transition.  And I wonder if you would tell  us a little bit about your concept of that and how you see it  developing.              THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, let's talk about why  it's important.  Most new jobs that will be created in this decade  will not require a four-year college degree, but most of them will  require some learning and skills that go well beyond what most people  get in a high school diploma.                If you look at the last 10 years, the average salaries  of young people that had at least two years of good post-high school  education was a good salary that went up over the decade.  The young  people who had less than that tended to have lower wages that did not  go up, and in many cases in real terms fell over the decade, because  they weren't productive, they weren't more valuable to their  employers.              So we think America has a big economic interest in  trying to ensure that all the young people who get out of high school  but don't go on to college make a transition to work, which includes  two years of further training either in a community college, a  vocational setting, or perhaps on the job.  And what I have done in  this budget, as you know, is to give you and Secretary Reich some  funds and some incentives to try to work in partnership with states  and with the private sector to build these programs state-by-state in  a way that would be customized essentially by the business community,  based on the needs of the economy in any given area.  It could  revolutionize long-term the quality of the American work force and  the earnings of American workers.              SECRETARY REICH:  I should add, Mr. President -- I think  you know this from your experience in Arkansas -- and many of the  people watching this program -- that the business community and  educators, labor groups are already in many of our communities, many  of our states, building a school-to-work transition program.  In  fact, there's an awful lot of ferment, a lot of excitement.  The  people watching this program probably are the ones who are most  directly involved in that.  And more power to them.  Secretary Riley  and I are going to do everything we can to build on the successes  already out there.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Bob, we're going to be talking tonight  about youth apprenticeship and tech prep, the co-op learning   career academies.  And what features all those programs that deal  with this subject -- what are some of the features that every one of  these school-to-work programs might have that   are important?              SECRETARY REICH:  Well, one thing that we've seen -- and  you and I have been working at this for a long time, and you much  longer than I -- we've seen that active involvement of the business  community is absolutely essential.  And I'm so delighted that we're  doing this in the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce.  The  Chamber of Commerce of the United States is committed to doing these  kinds of programs -- training, education, retraining -- and we've  aimed to work very closely with the Chamber.              The business community is going to be actively engaged  in developing almost an audit of the kind of jobs that are needed and  helping the educators, community colleges, technical institutions  develop curricula that are relevant for the jobs of the future.              Communities have got to come together.  I mean, this is  one of the most important things.  You've got to have all of these  players in a community come together and work together and cooperate  together.  You know, too often we have the educators over here and  the business leaders over here, labor groups over here and everybody  is talking, but they're not really working together in a common  strategy.              And the third and final ingredient I would say, Dick,  would be a commitment to excellence -- a commitment both to academic  excellence and also to skills development excellence.  This is not a  tracking program we're talking about for kids who are not going to  make it.  This is a program that every young person ought to be  eligible for.  If they want to go on beyond that to four-year  college, that's fine.  That ought to be permissible.  But we're  talking about the foundation of learning about jobs, the foundation  skills for on-the-job learning.              And again, those are the critical components.  It's  already being done.              THE PRESIDENT:  I think -- if I might just interject one  point based on my personal experience at home -- the business  community has a critical role to play, not simply in saying here are  the job skills that are needed and here's what ought to be taught,  but also in monitoring that excellence.  If you have the right sort  of partnership there, the people who are paying the taxes and who are  going to then be hiring the workers are not going to permit the  second-rate programs to survive if they have any way to shape and  influence them.  So I think that's very important.              And when we try to, if you will, fill in the blanks at  the federal level, trying to set some standards and provide some  funds, one of the things that we want to be sure and do is to make  sure that the employer has a heavy amount of influence over the  quality of these programs, because that's really what's going to  determine whether the whole thing is worthwhile.              SECRETARY RILEY:  That's great.  We've been talking, of  course, about school-to-work and also the jobs and economic recovery  program for this summer and fall.  But let's talk just a moment about  long-term school reform.  It's something especially close to me.  Mr.  President, I wonder if you would give us some of your ideas for the  communities out here on Goals 2000 legislation that I think will be  coming forth before too long.              THE PRESIDENT:  Well, as you know, back when you and I  were both governors, we spent a lot of time working on our public  schools and we tried to be very candid with our people in saying that  a lot of these things were going to take some time to materialize.                I had a hand in writing the National Education Goals  that the governors drafted, along with representatives of President  Bush's administration back in 1989.  And what we're going to try to  do this year with your leadership is to introduce legislation in  Congress that will actually define the things that the national  government ought to do to try to help the local schools and the  children of this country and the adult learners, too, meet those  goals -- making sure that when -- by 2000, people show up for school  ready to learn; that we get a 90 percent on-time high school  graduation rate; that children at the 4th, 8th, and 12th grades are  confident in the subjects they're supposed to know; that they are  second to none in math and science; that are schools are safe,  disciplined, and drug-free.  And, of course, the fifth goal --I took  them out of line to say this the last -- is that we have a system of  life-long learning in this country.              And each one of those goals there's a national role, a  state role, a school role, school district role, and a private sector  role.  And what you've attempted to do in this bill you're going to  introduce with me in the next few weeks is to define what our job is;  and then to give the rest of America a way of defining what their job  is and seeing whether we're actually meeting the standards of quality  that we need to meet.              It's very exciting.  So far as I know, nothing quite  like it has ever been done in the form of federal legislation before.   Not mandating and telling people what they have to do with their  money, but actually setting up a framework for excellence and  partnerships so that we can do our job.  I'm really excited about it.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I am, too.  And I think really  it will be an entirely new role for the federal government in terms  of its relationship with states, serving as a partner really to  support and facilitate and to help out in these education reform  efforts, all driven by high standards.  That's the point.              Bob, let me ask you one question, and then we'll get to  the telephone calls.  It's about the same subject.  We have, of  course, skills standards that are going to be part of Goals 2000, and  I wonder if you would comment on that.              SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you know, we have 75 percent of  our young people who don't graduate from college.  Very often they  don't have very many alternatives.  They do have a wonderful system  of community colleges and technical institutions, but if we had  national skill standards to which they could aspire and which  employers would understand as a national credential, many of these  young people would actually find that they were much more eligible  for jobs.              Everybody doesn't have to go to college.  Other  countries you have smaller proportions of their population going to  college, but you have a whole level of people who have certain  technical, preprofessional skills.  We can do it in this country.  If  you don't go to four-year college you're not a loser.  And we want to  develop those national skill standards.  We're going to be working  with the states, with the Education Department, with a lot of private  industry in developing those standards.  And I think they will be the  kinds of things that enable our vocational and technical and other  institutions to rally around, as well as our business community.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, that's great.  Why don't we go  ahead and go to the telephone.  We have a call, I see -- Mayor Bruce  Todd of Austin, Texas.              Q   Yes, Mr. President and Mr. Secretary Reich and  Riley, we certainly appreciate the opportunity to join you today.  We  have some dedicated professionals and volunteers here in Austin who  have heard what you have said and are very appreciative.  Let me  simply say, amen to some of the comments made already.  We agree with  much of the tone that the Clinton administration has taken, and are  very supportive.                We have been successful here in Austin of tripling our  summer employment program over the last four years.  We expect to  have over 2,000 employed this year in the summertime; perhaps as much  as 3,500 with the federal assistance.                Much of the question that we had designed you have  answered in your opening comments, so we must be thinking alike.  But  the question essentially involved what initiatives after Labor Day  would be appropriate.  We know summertime is important.  Year-round  is even more important.  And what kind of initiatives at the federal  level might be proposed to meet the needs of the youth on a year- round basis?  And perhaps more importantly, how can families and the  local community be more involved using the federal initiative? That's  something that we believe is very important to success in this  effort.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Mr. President.              THE PRESIDENT:  I think I'll give everybody a chance to  answer the question, Bruce, but let me first thank you for calling,  and thank you for all the great work that you're doing in Austin.   I've seen some of it and I've always been very impressed.                First, with regard to the summer program, we hope we can  structure it in a way that will enable us to continue the summer  program and that will move a lot of these young people back into  schools under circumstances that might allow them to do some work in  the private sector, too.  We hope that -- Secretary Reich is going to  try to set up a system where we create a lot of private sector jobs  to be matched with the public sector jobs this summer.  And we're  working on that.              Secondly, in the program that I have presented to the  Congress over the next five years, what we are attempting to do is to  build in an amount of investment that's quite substantial for job  training programs, for school-to-work programs, all of which give  heavy, heavy weight to local community input -- just the question you  asked -- but do provide some federal investment dollars, which we  hope you can put with local dollars to keep people working and being  trained on a year-round basis.              And I will say again, to echo what Secretary Reich said  a moment ago, to try to break down the barrier between what is seen  as work and what is seen as learning.  An awful lot of young people  actually have quite high IQs, but actually learn so much better when  they're doing than when they're reading or just listening.  So we  hope that the community involvement part of it will be permanent, and  we hope that if the whole budget passes -- and we do have 200 budget  cuts and more than 200, actually, in the budget -- and some revenue  raisers, and some new money for education and training, that we'll be  able to do just what you seem to want based on your question.              Bob, do you want to say anything?              SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you took most of the words out  of my mouth, Mr. President, as usual.  But let me just add one thing,  and that is that one of the most important aspects of post-high  school for a lot of young people who are not going on to college, in  addition to the school-to-work program, simply is the availability of  jobs.  And we've got to get this economy moving again, obviously.   It's terribly important to get this recovery program, to get the  economy back on track.  That's sort of the prerequisite to everything  else.  If we don't get the economy back on track -- we have -- I  think this is the 16th -- correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. President -- I  think is the 16th month we have had seven percent unemployment or  greater.  This is a jobless recovery.  A lot of those kids are going  to be getting out of school in June.  And even if we did everything  right, they would have a very, very hard time getting jobs.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you both.  Of course, Goals 2000  will be a permanent, long-term thing that will certainly reach into  next year.  It will involve, if passed -- and we certainly hope it  will be -- action plans with every state where we can be working  together to reach for the goals in a number of different ways.  And  then the state, with all the various school districts, a very  important part of that will be citizen and parent involvement.  And I  think everybody will see a great energy out there, once we get that  moving.              The next call is Dr. Harry Heinemann, New York.                Doctor?              Q   Good evening, Mr. Secretary.  It is a pleasure to  be on with you this evening.  As you may know, bridging the school  and work has been central to La Guardia's educational program since  its inception in the 1970s, and that includes the college, the two  alternative high schools that operate on our campus, and the linkages  we have forged with the local schools.  We have found this to be an  extremely effective learning strategy.              And over the years, we've come to believe that there are  several principles that are very important in bridging the school and  work.  And these include integrating theory in the classroom with  practice in the workplace, with providing all students early exposure  to careers, as well as providing opportunities for them to reflect  upon these experiences while they strengthen their skills; and  lastly, the critical role of the liberal arts, particularly in the  development of high performance competencies.                My question, then is:  How can the general education  faculty and the academic curriculum be more closely integrated with  transition to work experience?  And what mechanisms and strategies  can you suggest to achieve this integration?              SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, thank you very much.  I think --  and we'll get a response from you all on that, and very interesting  work going on there.  We're going to have three people, our next  guests on the program this evening, that will be some specialists    in that area that you're speaking, and I'll certainly pass that on to  them and we can discuss it later.              You all care to comment -- any comments you might have?              THE PRESIDENT:  I'd just like to say, if I might, one  thing.  I want to reemphasize this and I don't think I'm being as  clear about it as I'd like, although I think at least one of the  people who will be on the second panel will be able to say it more  explicitly than I.  I think this whole concept of applied academics  is very important.  And I think that we have to basically abolish  what I consider to be a very artificial distinction between what is  vocational learning and what is academic learning.              I think we should keep the liberal arts going.  I think  we should have a strong component for people who are in the  vocational program.              SECRETARY REICH:  It seems to me that we also need to  rethink our entire tracking system, because a lot of these school and  work combinations are important for mainstream students.  They're  important for all students.  It's not just a special group of  students that needs them.              Some of the experiments that I've seen around the United  States -- Dick, I'm sure you've seen them as well -- are mainstream  experiments.  They're mainstreaming all the students.  At 11th and  12th grades they're giving them a combined work and school experience  and then a transition program.  And again, the kids can either go on  to college if they want; they can go on to technical community; they  can go on to an entirely -- a large variety of possibilities and  career directions.              But we have to get away from the stigmatizing that often  goes on with young people who simply are doing job-related or work- related work within the classroom, within our schools.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you, very much.  I think that's  going to be the last call that we have time for.  Mr. President, I  think you've got to move on to another matter, and I want to thank  you and Secretary Reich for being here.  We appreciate your time and  your ideas, and it's been a tremendous help to us.  \",\"Hi there,  I am looking for a wide band analog time delay (not phase delay) variable from 200 microseconds to 2 milliseconds.\",\"The r.s.h FAQ sheet never fails to crash my newsreader.

I bought my machine a couple of weeks ago as well and started to experience these problems.  Apple Australia via my dealer said that this problem has a number of potential causes - Faulty applications, faulty third party hardware (modems, memory etc), system software, PRAM corruption and power manager corruption, and the Duo hardware itself.  None of the above are relevant in my case except the last two maybe (no applications were running, the system software was re-installed, I have no additional hardware). I have found that clearing PRAM appears to help for a while at least (hold down command option P and R on startup). Unfortunately the problem returns suggesting that PRAM is being corrupted by something (system software bug ? - I don't have any non-issue inits in my system). Apparently the Power Manager can be reset by \\\"holding the reset and interrupt buttons while powering up\\\" - Apple's advice - but since the Duo does not have an interrupt button I'm not sure what they mean in this case. This may also help if someone can decipher Apple's advice for me.  Beyond this Apple suggest that \\\" you should follow the technical procedures to check the hardware of this Duo\\\". Since so many others appear to be having the same problem it would seem to me that there has been a system software bug introduced somewhere along the line - and quite recently too - since it only seems to be recent Duo 230 purchasers who have this problem.  Any more comments from others in the same boat are welcome, particularly Apple Duo engineers :-)  cheers  brucet \",\"Actually, with several sharware utilities, you cn change both.

Jagr did not have a better season than      Francis ... to suggest otherwise is an insult to those with a modicum of      hockey knowledge.  Save your almost maniacal devotion to the almighty      plus/minus ... it is the most misleading hockey stat available.       Until the NHL publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice      time per game and some measure of its \\\"quality\\\" (i.e., is the player put out      in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game; is he matched up      against the other team's top one or two lines; short-handed, etc), I would      much rather see the +/- disappear altogether instead of having its dubious      merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications.  Thank you for posting this.  As the person who first brought up the fact that Jagr has a much higher +/- than Francis, I can assure you that I brought it up as an example of the absurdity of +/- comparisons, even on the same team.  I never, ever thought that anyone would argue that Jagr's higher +/- actually reflected better two-way play.  In my opinion, Francis's low +/- is purely a result of him being asked to play against opponents top scorers at all times; the fact that he can chip in 100 points while neutralizing the other team's top center is a testament to how valuable he is, even if his +/- suffers.  On the other hand, Jagr, for how big, fast and skilled he is, can't even get 90 points, no matter how inflated his +/- is.  (By the way, don't get me wrong -- I like Jagr.  He may be a lazy floater, but he turns it on at exactly the right times -- like overtime of playoff games). \",\"for SRC  In most languages, the Feast of the Resurrection of Our Lord is known as the PASCH, or PASQUE, or some variation thereof, a word which comes from the Hebrew PESACH, meaning \\\"Passover.\\\" In English, German, and a few related languages, however, it is known as EASTER, or some variation thereof, and questions have been asked about the origin of this term.  One explanation is that given by the Venerable Bede in his DE RATIONE TEMPORUM 1:5, where he derives the word from the name of an Anglo-Saxon goddess of Spring called EASTRE. Bede is a great scholar, and it is natural to take his word for it. But he lived 673-735, and Augustine began preaching in Kent in 597. The use of the word EASTER to describe the Feast would have been well established before the birth of Bede and probably before the birth of anyone he might have discussed the subject with. It seems likely that his derivation is just a guess, based on his awareness that there had been an Anglo-Saxon goddess of Spring bearing that name, and the resemblance of the words. Thus, if the said resemblance (surely it is not surprising that a personification of Spring should have a name similar to the word for Dawn) is not in istelf convincing, the testimony (or rather the conjecture) by Bede does not make it more so.  Assuming that Bede was right, that would not justify saying that the Christian celebration (which, after all, had been going on for some centuries before the name EASTER was applied to it) has pagan roots. It would simply mean that the Anglo-Saxons, upon becoming Christians and beginning to celebrate the Resurrection by a festival every spring, called it by the name that to them meant simply \\\"Spring Festival.\\\"  However, Bede's is not the only theory that has been proposed.  J Knoblech, in \\\"Die Sprach,\\\" ZEITSCHRIFT FUER SPRACHWISSENSCHAFT 5 (Vienna, 1959) 27-45, offers the following derivation:  Among Latin-speaking Christians, the week beginning with the Feast of the Resurrection was known as \\\"hebdomada alba\\\" (white week), since the newly-baptized Christians were accustomed to wear their white baptismal robes throughout that week. Sometimes the week was referred to simply as \\\"albae.\\\" Translaters rendering this into German mistook it for the plural of \\\"alba,\\\" meaning \\\"dawn.\\\" They accordingly rendered it as EOSTARUM, which is Old High German for \\\"dawn.\\\" This gave rise to the form EASTER in English.

I read once that the Babe made $80,000 one year and that was about as good  as it got for him.  Let's assume he made that in 1928 (I'm not sure of the figures, but I know I'm in the ballpark--pun intended). :-)  Today, assuming a 4% yearly inflation rate, which is an understatement if not accurate, his measly $80,000 salary would be worth.  FV = $80,000 x (1+4%)^(1993-1928)    = $80,000 x (1.04)^65    = just over $1,000,000.  Assuming inflation is average of around 5%.  FV = $80,000 x (1+5%)^65    = almost 2,000,000.  (I didn't crunch these numbers beforehand).  These numbers might lead one to believe that today's players are slightly  overpaid.  The Babe appears to have made then what today's average to above average players make now.  Perfectly accurate salary, year of salary, and  average inflation rate would make this analysis more accurate, but I don`t  think I'm off by much.

Going into the 1992/93 season, the numbers of Euros on NHL teams have escalated to the following stats:  Canadians: 400 Americans: 100 Europeans: 100     Please note that these numbers are rounded off, and taken from the top 25 players on each of the 24 teams. My source is the Vancouver Sun.     Here's the point: there are far too many Europeans in the NHL. I am sick of watching a game between an American and a Canadian team (let's say, the Red Wings and the Canucks) and seeing names like \\\"Bure\\\" \\\"Konstantinov\\\" and \\\"Borshevshky\\\". Is this North America or isn't it? Toronto, Detriot, Quebec, and Edmonton are particularly annoying, but the numbers of Euros on other teams is getting worse as well.       I live in Vancouver and if I hear one more word about \\\"Pavel Bure, the Russian Rocket\\\" I will completely throw up. As it is now, every time I see the Canucks play I keep hoping someone will cross-check Bure into the plexiglassso hard they have to carry him out on a stretcher. (By the way, I'm not a Canucks fan to begin with ;-).       Okay, the stretcher remark was a little carried away. But the point is that I resent NHL owners drafting all these Europeans INSTEAD of Canadians (and some Americans). It denies young Canadians the opportunity to play in THEIR NORTH AMERICAN LEAGUE and instead gives it to Europeans, who aren't even better hockey players. It's all hype. This \\\"European mystique\\\" is sickening, but until NHL owners get over it, Canadian and American players will continue to have to fight harder to get drafted into their own league.      With the numbers of Euros in the NHL escalating, the problem is clearly only getting worse.

Indeed, allow them freely to give advice on anything and they will fritter away one's wealth and disobey the wishes of the owner of this wealth.   We see them without religion, when, alone, they are left to their own devices; they are lacking in both pity and virtue when their carnal desires are at stake. It is easy to enjoy them, but they cause great anxiety. The most virtious among them are libertines. But the most corrupt are whores. Only those of them whom age has deprived of any charm are untainted by vice. They have three qualities particular to miscreants; they complain of being oppressed, whereas it is they who oppress; they make oaths, whereas they are lying; they pretend to refuse men's solicitations, whereas they desire them most ardently. Let us beg the help of God to emerge victorious from their evil deeds. And preserve us in any case from their good ones.\\\"  (Quote from Mas'ud al-Qanawi, ref. A.

A few points need to be clarified:  The Equipment GROUNDING conductor, Green, green with a yellow stripe, bare, or the metal sheath or pipe of SOME wiring methods, is used as a safety ground, to carry fault currents back to the circuit breaker panel, and to limit the voltage on the metal case of utilization equipment or other metal objects.  It should never (except for a few exceptions to be discussed later) carry the normal operating current of a connected load.  Some equipment has filters in the power supply which may cause some slight current flow through the grounding conductor.    Much communications or audio equipment is sensitive to noise or slight voltages on the grounding conductor, and may require special wiring of the grounding conductors to provide reliable operation  (\\\"orange\\\" outlets are often used for this, with insulated grounding conductors wired back to the panel box, and in many cases back to the service.  Anyone installing such a system should read both the section on grounding in the National Electric Code and publications on installing quiet isolated ground systems.  The code requires the insulated grounding conductors (green wires) to run with the current carrying conductors back to the panel box, and, if required, back all the way to the service entrance , where it is bonded to the service ground (water pipe or rod)  Many of these systems are installed illegally or unsafely, where they do not provide a safe ground or a quiet ground or either.   The GROUNDED conductor of a circuit, often called the NEUTRAL, which is referred to in the code as the \\\"identified\\\" conductor and is supposed to be white or natural grey.  This conductor is supposed to be connected to ground in most electrical systems at a single point, generally at the service entrance panel.  This connection is through the Main Bonding Jumper.  (In many household service panels, the main bonding jumper is actually a bonding screw which attaches the neutral busbar to the case of the panel)    The Grounded conductor (neutral) is generally a current carrying conductor.  In the case of a 120 volt circuit it is one of the two conductors completing the circuit from the panel to the load device.    Since the grounded conductor (neutral) is only connected to the grounding conductor (bare or green) at the service entrance, if the load is any distance from the service and draws any significant current, there will be a small but measurable voltage between the grounded and grounding conductors at the load, under normal operating conditions.  If you should (incorrectly) connect the grounded (neutral) conductor to the grounding conductor at the load, some of the neutral current will flow instead through the grounding conductor.  Since there will now be current flowing through the grounding conductor, it will also no longer be quite at ground potential at the load end.  If the load equipment has a metal case, which is connected to the grounding conductor through the \\\"U\\\" ground plug, the metal case is now also no longer quite at ground potential.  The difference (under normal, non short-circuit conditions) may be only a few tenths of a volt, but it could also be a volt or two.  This normally does not present a shock hazard.    HOWEVER, if you let the metal case of the grounded equipment come into contact with an independently grounded object such as a water or gas pipe, a radiator, a metal air conditioning duct or such, part of the neutral current will try to flow through this aalternate ground path.  If the contact is not solid, you will get a significant arc (a low voltage, but possibly moderate current arc) Under the wrong conditions, this arcing could start a fire.  It is possible in some cases that the sneak ground current   could also flow through a wire of inadequate size, causing it to overheat.  With the incorrect non single-point grounding of the neutral, if there is a short circuit from hot to neutral, the high short circuit current which may flow will cause a much higher voltage on the grounding conductor, which increases the possibility for shock or fire.    Also if you incorrectly multiply connect the neutral and ground, the voltage on the ground system is seen as noise bu computer or audio equipment, often causing malfunction.  I have spent some hours tracking down such shorts in technical facilities where they were inducing severe hum into equipment.  The Neutral is usually bonded to the ground at the distribution transformer as well as at the service entrance of each dwelling.  This is done primarily for lightning protection, so that induced lightning currents have a short path back to ground, and also to assure that the currents drawn by shorts to grounded objects like pipes draw enough current to trip circuit breakers or blow fuses quickly.  The bad side of this is that not all the neutral current from the dwelling goes through the neutral wire back to the transformer.  Some of it flows through the grounding electrode (water pipe, etc.) this may cause corrosion in the pipes and possibly in things like underground fuel oil tanks, and it may also cause measurable AC magnetic fields due to the large loop between the \\\"hot\\\" conductors in the service and the neutral current in the water pipe and ground.  There are those who feel these fields may be unhealthy.  (don't flame ME on this, I'm just telling you where the field comes from, not it's health effect, as far as I'm concerned, the jury is still out on this.)  Note that the bonding jumper is only installed at the main panel, NOT at any sub distribution panels.  This is one reason why it is illegal to run service entrance cable with the sheath used as a neutral to a sub panel, you must have a seperate insulated conductor for the neutral.  The sheath can be used in this application only as the groundING conductor.  If the neutral is bonded to the grounding conductor in the sub panel, say by forgetting to remove the bonding screw, all the grounding conductors of the loads on that panel will be above ground, with the possible problems listed above.  The code makes exceptions for ranges and dryers, as well as feeds from one building to another.  In the cases of the range and dryer, the neutral may be used as the equipment ground under certain conditions, instead of a seperate wire.  Every time the code is revised, these exceptions come up for review.  These exceptions were, in fact the first required safety grounds, in the days before U ground outlets and such.  The appliance manufacturers don't want to have to redesign their ranges and driers, and the contractors don't want to have to run four wire cable (with four fairly heavy, expensive wires) in place of three wire to the appliances.  No question it would be safer with seperate neutrals to the stove, but the neutral current is low for most burner settings (since most current is in the 220 volt \\\"hots\\\" except at some low settings, the wires are large gauge, and there are few reported cases of injury or damage.  So far, the exceptions have survived. In the case of feeds between buildings, it's primarily for lightning protection.  People doing wiring should be aware what is and what isn't a legal grounding conductor.  Obviously, the bare wire in \\\"romex\\\" 'with ground' is.  Anywhere there is a green wire installed, such as in a portable cord, that is a good grounding conductor.  The sheath of BX clamped in BX connectors in metal boxes is a legal grounding conductor (in the US). (BX has an aluminum band run under the steel sheath to lower the resistance of the sheath.  You can just cut this aluminum band off at the ends, you don't have to bond it to anything, it does its job by touching every turn of the BX sheath.) Conduit or EMT (thinwall tubing) is generally a legal grounding conductor, but may require a bonding locknut where it enters a box or panel, particularly for larger pipes.    \\\"Greenfield\\\" (looks like big BX, but you pull your own wires in the empty sheath after you run it) is NOT a legal grounding conductor, as it doesn't have the aluminum band to bond it, and the spiral steel has too much resistance and inductance.  You have to run a seperate green grounding conductor inside the greenfield.  \\\"Wiremold\\\" is also not a legal grounding conductor, as the paint on the boxes often prevents good contact, and the \\\"feed\\\" to the wiremold extension is often from a box in the wall that may not be well connected to the first wiremold box.  I have personally discovered cases where the entire run of wiremold and the cases of everything plugged into all the outlets on the run were \\\"hot\\\" with 120 volts (Why do I get a shock every time I touch my computer and the radiator here in the office?) because there was no ground wire in the wiremold and one of the outlets had shorted to the edge of the wiremold box.  You must run a ground wire back in the wiremold from the outlets at least to the first box in the original wiring (conduit, BX, etc.) where you can \\\"bond\\\" the wire to the box with a screw, bnding clip, or whatever.  On another issue, while you should ground the green wire/lug on GCFI outlets when ever there is a place to ground them, it is legal in the NEC to use them without a ground if no ground is available.  It is better to have the protection of the Ground fault interrupter than no protection if you don't install it.  The interrupter doesn't depend on the ground to trip.  It is desirable to connect the ground if available, because if the ground is connected, the interrupter will trip as soon as a faulty device is plugged in, whereas without the ground, it will not trip until someone or something provides a ground path.  For those questioning the legal use of ungrounded GCFI's, read in the NEC, 210-7 (d) exception. (This is the 1990 code, my '93 code is in the city, but I know the rule hasn't changed.  It might be renumbered though.)   We have only touched the surface concerning grounding ;-} , there is much more to this subject, but most of you have fallen asleep by now.

All Read/Write support full color(8 bits), grey scale, b/w dither,       and 24 bits image, if allowed for that format.   (7) Detail:     Initialization:       Set default display type to highest display type.       Find allowable screen resolution(for .grn video driver only).     1. When you run this program, you will enter 'read' menu. Whthin this       menu you can press any function key except F5. If you move or copy       files, you will enter 'write' menu. the 'write' menu is much like       'read' menu, but only allow you to change directory. +       The header line in 'read' menu includes \\\"(d:xx,f:xx,t:xx)\\\". +         d : display type. f: number of files. t: number of tagged files.       pressing SPACE in 'read' menu will let you select which format to use         for reading current file.       pressing RETURN in 'read' menu will let you reading current file. This         program will automatically determine which format this file is.         The procedure is: First, check magic number. If fail, check         standard extension. Still fail, report error.       pressing s or S in 'read' menu will do 'Slide Show'.         If delay time is 0, program will wait until you hit a key           (except ESCAPE).         If any error occurs, program will make a beep.         ESCAPE to terminate.       pressing Ins in 'read' menu will change display type.       pressing ALT-X in 'read' menu will quit program without prompting.     2. Once image file is successfully read, you will enter 'screen' menu.       Within this menu F5 is turn on. You can do special effect on image.       pressing RETURN: show image.         in graphic mode, press RETURN, SPACE or ESCAPE to return to text         mode.       pressing TAB: change processing target. This program allows you to do         special effects on 8-bit or 24-bit image.       pressing Left,Right arrow: change display type. 8, 15, 16, 24 bits.       pressing SPACE: save current image to file.         B/W Dither: save as black/white image(1 bit).         Grey Scale: save as grey image(8 bits).         Full Color: save as color image(8 bits).         True Color: save as 24-bit image.          This program will ask you some questions if you want to write image         to file. Some questions are format-dependent. Finally This program         will prompt you a filename. If you want to save file under another         directory other than current directory, please press SPACE. after         pressing SPACE, you will enter 'write2' menu. You can change         directory to what you want. Then,          pressing SPACE: this program will prompt you 'original' filename.         pressing RETURN: this program will prompt you 'selected' filename                       (filename under bar).     3. This program supports 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display.    4. This Program is MEMORY GREEDY. If you don't have enough memory,      the performance is poor.    5. If you want to save 8 bits image :        try GIF then TIFF(LZW) then TARGA then Sun Raster then BMP then ...       If you want to save 24 bits image (lossless):        try TIFF(LZW) or TARGA or ILBM or Sun Raster        (No one is better for true 24bits image)    6. I recommend Jpeg for storing 24 bits images, even 8 bits images.    7. Not all subroutines are fully tested    8. This document is not well written. If you have any PROBLEM, SUGGESTION,      COMMENT about this program,      Please send to u7711501@bicmos.ee.nctu.edu.tw (140.113.11.13).      I need your suggestion to improve this program.

Yes, it is true that he refused to buy a franchise from the NHL for $50M; but at the time the reason was that the established market for teams was much  less than that. He felt that no one would pay $50M for an expansion team, and that he would simply wait to buy an existing franchise for less than that. But the market fooled him, and 5 teams have been created for $50M apiece in the last three years, and even the existing teams can't be moved for less than  $50M and I doubt that he could get one for that little.

Windows will use a swap file larger than the recommended size.  Last summer I went to a Microsoft Windows 3.1 Technical Workshop and they distributed A LOT of information that the general public might not be aware of.  Anyway in the main book they handed out they have a section on \\\"Creating larger than recommended swapfile\\\".  I'll quote the information    If you create a permanent swapfile larger than the recommended size, you   will receive a message telling you that Windows will not use anything   larger than the recommended size.  THIS ERROR MESSAGE IS INCORRECT, we   will allow the use of the larger swapfile, up to four times the amount   of RAM on your machine.  So as you see, Microsoft does know that the information is incorrect.  You probably just ran into some doofball who was new on the job and was only telling you what little he knew.  Be that what it may, I would really suggest to everyone to take the opportunity to go to these Technical Workshops.  They aren't actually incredibly in-depth, but you do get a lot of material about bugs and optimization straight from those in the know.  Besides that they offer you HUGE discounts on software.  If I remember correctly, you could pick up Word 2.0, Excel 4.0, or whatever their presentation program is for $130. That is the full blown version, not an upgrade or educational version.  You could also pick up Microsoft Office for $500 or something like that.  Myself I sprang for Word.  Well, hope that was helpful to someone.  And besides that I hope someone will go to a workshop and save a little money.  And if anyone at Microsoft is reading this -- I really love your products.

Please reply.  Regards,\",\"You are making the same mistake I did: you are confusing the DRIVE interface to the DATA THROUGHPUT interface.  Again from my Mac & IBM info sheet {available by FTP on sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6) in the info-mac/report as mac-ibm-compare173.txt}: Expansion Both Mac & IBM SCSI: only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM.  Allows the use of any device: hard drive, printer, scanner, Nubus card   expansion {Mac Plus only}, some monitors, and CD-ROM.  Apple developed some   specifications for SCSI controlers while IBM has no exact controller   specifications {which results in added incompatibilities on IBM machines}.    Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal   terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port   {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and at the   end.  Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}.  SCSI-1:  7 devices per SCSI controller.  8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}  and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfer base.  16-bit SCSI-1 requires a  SCSI-2 controler chip and can provide only fast SCSI-2 not wide SCSI-2  which are both 16-bit interfaces {see SCSI-2}. SCSI-2: 10 devices per SCSI controller in SCSI-2 mode.  SCSI-2 is fully  SCSI-1 complient and tends to be implimented as a very fast SCSI-1 since it   needs a different controller interface in both hardware {which tends to be   very expendsive} and software.  Transfer speeds are 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst   {8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst  {32-bit/wide and fast}.  SCSI-2 in SCSI-1 mode is limited to 7 devices and  reduced 8-bit or 16-bit {fast only} throughput due to the difference between  SCSI-1 and wide SCSI-2 ports.  IBM HD Interfaces {limited to hard drives by design or lack of development}: [...] IDE:  Integrated Device Electronics   currently the most common standard, and is mainly used for medium sized   drives. Can have more than one hard drive. Asynchronous Transfer: ~5MB/s max.  So at its LOWEST setting SCSI-2 interface in Asynchronous SCSI-1 mode AVERAGES  the through put MAXIMUM of IDE in asynchronous mode.  In full SCSI-2 mode it blows poor IDE out the window, down the street, and into the garbage can. The problem becomes can the drive mechanisim keep up with those through put rates and THAT is where the bottleneck and cost of SCSI-2 comes from.  NOT the interface itself but more and more from drive mechanisims to use the SCSI-2 through put.  The cost of SCSI interface is a self fulliling prophisy: few people buy SCSI because it is so expencive for the PC, which in turn convices makes that mass producing SCSI {which would reduce its cost} is unwarented, and so SCSI is expencive. {That is the effect of the Rule of Scale: the more items sold the less EACH item has to bare the brunt the cost of manufacture and so the less each item has to cost}\",\"As it says, I'm interested in buying one of the little label-makers, and I can't afford a new one.

There is no question about it.    We must be reading different public opinion polls. I agree that the misguided public would like to see assault weapons banned (mainly because they are being lied to by the media about the frequency of their use in violent crime ... ~1%), but if public opinion were so dead-set against the RKBA you can bet that idiots like Metzenbaum and Schumer would be seeing their foolish bills getting passed through Congress a LOT easier than they are. And as governments go broke and can no longer protect their citizens you can bet that the American people will start to really appreciate the usefulness of firearms. Contrary  to what you might think, time is probably on OUR side, not YOURS.    Yeah, right. Don't hold your breath. My condolences on the discovery of uncomfortable resilience in your mammary glands, but this has nothing to do with the issue at hand.  ... ridiculous tripe deleted ...     Yeah, the liberal press doesn't like us much, but you can't really expect coherent thought from them anyway. Their opinions are based more on a desire to appear politically correct than on facts (which are generously provided by the FBI, if they'd bother to put on their Birkenstocks and go to the library to read them). Most of my friends are anti-gun, and without exception NONE of them bases his/her opinions on facts. They would rather believe (despite all evidence to the contrary) that disarming law-abiding citizens would make the world more civilized, when all it really does is make us all sheep. They  would rather wallow in their pitiful liberal white guilt about how society has driven the criminal to rob, rape, and murder. They  support spending millions of public dollars protecting the rights of scum who have already demonstrated that they have no regard for society or its laws. They ignore the fact that areas with the strictest gun control (NYC,DC) have the worst crime and areas with little gun control (VT,NH,ID) have very little crime in comparison. But they have to ignore this because otherwise they would need to confront the fact that law-abiding citizens who own guns are not the ones that are causing most of the trouble in society. Oh no, we certainly can't accept that! But I guess I have faith that when crime starts making significant inroads into their neighborhoods and starts directly hurting them and their families, they will probably whistle a different tune. They just better hope it isn't too late then.    Hmmm. I wasn't expecting company tonight. I might be able to whip up a quick cheese and cracker plate, but they should probably bring their own drinks. Do I have time to vacuum the rug?   I'm glad you ended the posting here. Your medication seems to have worn off ...  ----------------------------------------------------------- Lee Gaucher    NRA               | My opinions. gaucher@sam.cchem.berkeley.edu   | No one else's.\",\" Something else to consider:  Alomar's H-R splits were .500-.363 SLG, .444-.369 OBP! Baerga's was .486-.424 and .392-.318. Pretty clearly, Alomar got a HUGE boost from his home park.  I'd say you could make a good for them being about equal right now. T&P rated Baerga higher, actually.  Mike\",\" Perhaps instead of this silly argument about what backup lights are for, couldn't we agree that they serve the dual purpose of letting people behind your car know that you have it in reverse and that they can also light up the area behind your car while you're backing up so you can see?  Backup lamps on current models are much brighter than they used to be on older cars. Those on my Taurus Wagon are quite bright enough to illuminate a good area behind the car, and they're  MUCH brighter than those on my earlier cars from the 60s and 70s.   Insofar as Vettes having side backup lights, look at a '92 or '93 model (or perhaps a year or two earlier too) and you'll see red side marker lamps and white side marker lamps both near the car's hindquarters.  Those aren't just white reflectors. \",\"I am coordinating the Space Shuttle Program Office's e-mail traffic to NPO Energia for our on-going Joint Missions.

That being said, I still think Baerga was VERY SLIGHTLY better last year, but I think this is as close to a wash as you're likely to find.  I personally don't care much for Alomar's defense.  I don't think he's nearly as good as people make him out to be, and he can't turn the DP to save his life.  He comes across the bag improperly, and his release is slow.  Considering the high leverage of the DP, this is a shortcoming I can't overlook.  In the long term, I'd move Alomar to another position.  If the Jays could trade a hot Devon White for something, I'll be Alomar could be a hell of a CF.  In the long run, I think I'd rather have Jeff Kent at 2B and Alomar in CF than Alomar/White.    \",\" Just thought I would mention that Sony no longer manufactures the CPD- 1304 because of several manufacturing flaws.  The new model is now the 1430, which just like Apple's new Sony Trinitrom CLAIMS to be 14 inches. I'm not sure of the details on the defects, but I work at our schools bookstore and can tell you that nearly half of them were returned with some kind of  defect or another.\",\"OK.  Instead of holding an auction, I have decided to compute prices for each comic (after many suggestions).  These are the most reasonable prices I can give (not negotiable).  If you would like to purchase a comic (or group), simply email me with the title and issue #'s you want.  The price for each issue is shown beside each comic.  First come, first served!!!  There is no more bidding.  Meet my price and it is yours.  I can be reached at this email address:  02106@chopin.udel.edu or 02106@ravel.udel.edu or 02106@bach.udel.edu or 02106@brahms.udel.edu  NO MORE HAGGLING ABOUT THE PRICE!!!!!!!! LOTS OF COMICS FOR $1, $2, or $3 LOOK AT LIST!!!!!  Shipping is $2 for 1-3 comics.  For more than 3, the price will be determined by the volume of the purchase (I may have to use a big heavy box for large orders which costs more to mail).  For all those who have bought comics from me, thanks!!!  All comics are near mint unless otherwise noted (my books were graded by mile high comics and other comic professional collectors, not me!)

They enligthen ??? the use of S1 and S2 for keygeneration. ------------------------------------------- Date: Mon, 19 Apr 93 08:51:57 EDT From: denning@cs.cosc.georgetown.edu (Dorothy Denning) Subject: Re:  Clipper Chip  I just had another conversation with NSA to clarify some of the features of Clipper.  Please feel free to distribute this and my other messages on Clipper.  The name of the encryption algorithm is \\\"Skipjack.\\\"  Martin Hellman had written                  and the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part                 message which will then be encrypted under the system key SK                 producing                       E{ E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number;  SK}  To which I responded:          My understanding is that E[M; K] is not encrypted under SK (called the         \\\"family key\\\") and that the decrypt key corresponding to SK is held by         law enforcement.  Does anyone have first hand knowledge on this?  I was correct in that E[M; K] is not encrypted under SK.  However, Skipjack being a single-key system, there is, of course, not a separate decrypt key for the family key SK.          The unit key, also called the \\\"chip key,\\\" is generated from the         serial number N as follows.  Let N1, N2, and N3 be 64 bit blocks         derived from N, and let S1 and S2 be two 80-bit seeds used as keys.         Compute the 64-bit block                  R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1]          (Note that this is like using the DES in triple encryption mode with         two keys.)  Similarly compute blocks R2 and R3 starting with N2 and N3.         (I'm unlear about whether the keys S1 and S2 change.  The fact that         they're called seeds suggests they might.)  Then R1, R2, and R3 are         concatenated together giving 192 bits.  The first 80 bits  form K1 and         the next 80 bits form K2.  The remaining bits are discarded.  The seeds S1 and S2 do not change.   The whole process is performed on a laptop computer, and S1 and S2 are supplied by two independent people so that no one person knows both.  The same S1 and S2 are used during an entire \\\"programming session\\\" to generate keys for a stream of serial numbers.  Everything is discarded at the end (the computer could be thrown out if desired).  The serial number is 30 bits and the values N1, N2, and N3 are formed by padding the serial number with fixed 34-bit blocks (separate padding for each value).  The resulting keys K1 and K2 are output onto separate floppy disks, paired up with their serial number.  Each pair is stored in a separate file.  The floppy disks are taken away by two separate people on behalf of the two escrow agencies.

So don't swamp my mailbox :-)  I just think this is an valuable addition to the less than technical discussion that is rising here. And, no, I don't mind if you call S1 and S2 'backdoor', as I could imagine the key-generation process working without these seeds and the dependency of K1,K2 from the Serial-Number.

The specific recommandation cited in the Hurt study was that a formal \\\"street strategy\\\", like SIPDE for example, was the most important component of any rider education curriculum.  The specific skills of emergency braking, cornering and swerving must be taught and practiced as well, but more significant was that 35% of rider did NOTHING confronted with a potential accident, and another third collided or fell over as a result of rider error.  The choice of specific maneuver is much less significant to the outcome than early detection and the proper execution of ANY effective countermeasure.\",\"Any comments of AMD microprocessors?  good?, bad?\",\" That's nothing.

Reproduced under open license granted by Audio Books, Inc.  -----------------------------------------------------------------  This is the Dr. Beter AUDIO LETTER(R), 1629 K St. NW, Washington, DC  20006.     Hello, my friends, this is Dr. Beter.  Today is April 30, 1982, and this is my AUDIO LETTER(R) No. 74.    It's now been almost one month since war broke out in the South Atlantic.  On the surface it seems that it's only a dispute between Argentina and Great Britain over the barren, wind-swept Falkland Islands and South Georgia Island.  In reality, it's far more than that.     The so-called Falklands crisis is just the visible tip of a giant military operation.  During this month of April 1982, fierce naval battles have taken place--not only in the South Atlantic but also in the South Pacific.  Up to now most of the hostilities have been kept under wraps by wartime censorship on all sides.  But as I say these words, the naval war in the Southern Hemisphere is about to come to the surface.     Beginning today, April 30, a total naval and air blockade of the Falklands by the Royal Navy has begun.  At the same time a counterblockade has been declared by Argentina in the same area.     To be effective, a blockade must be imposed over a period of time, but the Royal Navy does not have that much time.  Winter is coming on in the South Atlantic, and the British supply lines are overextended.  Having come this far, Her Majesty's navy cannot simply drop the blockade and sail away in a few weeks time without drawing blood from Argentina.  As a result the British will be forced to undertake military operations very soon no matter how risky they may be.     There is also another reason why the Royal Navy now has no choice but to engage the Argentine forces in combat.  That reason, my friends, is that the Royal Navy has already suffered losses in secret combat this month.  Up to this moment there will be no way to explain away the damage which has been sustained by the British fleet.  Only when publicly admitted fighting erupts will the British dare to admit that they have suffered battle losses.  To obtain that cover story, the British have no choice but to sail into combat; but in doing so, they will be risking even heavier losses on top of those already sustained.  In short, my friends, Her Majesty's navy has sailed into a trap.     The events now unfolding in the South Atlantic carry strange, ironic echoes of the past.  For weeks now we've been hearing countless commentators referring to the British task force as an \\\"armada\\\" (quote).  The British of all people ought to be very uneasy with that description.  The original Spanish Armada 400 years ago was renowned as a seemingly invincible fighting force, but it came to grief in a naval disaster so complete that it changed the course of history--and it was none other than the English navy that destroyed the Spanish Armada.     The original Spanish Armada put to sea in 1588 during the reign of England's Queen Elizabeth I.  The Armada was an invasion fleet carrying thousands of crack fighting men to invade England.  They were met by the daring sea dogs of Sir Francis Drake.  Drake and his small, fast ships turned the tables on the Spanish Armada by changing the rules of battle.  The English fleet was equipped with new longer-range guns, and it stayed upwind and out of reach.  From there the English pounded, smashed, and shattered the big ships of the mighty Armada.  When it was all over, barely half the Spanish fleet was left to limp back to port.  Drake's defeat of the Spanish Armada was a shock to the world.  It opened the door for England under Queen Elizabeth I to start its expansion into a truly global empire.     Today, 400 years later, history seems to have come full circle.  Queen Elizabeth II is witnessing the dismantling of the world empire whose heyday began under Queen Elizabeth I, and now the cultures of England and of Spain are once again in confrontation.  Once again a so-called armada is preparing for invasion, but this time the armada is British, not Spanish.  Four hundred years ago Sir Francis Drake was the hero of the day; today, the ghost of Francis Drake is once again on the scene.     The South Atlantic war zone is at the eastern end of the Drake Passage around the southern tip of South America.  The defeat of the Spanish Armada four centuries ago broke the back of Spain's naval supremacy, and now the defeat of the new British armada may well break the back of what remains of the once glorious Royal Navy.     My three special topics for this AUDIO LETTER are:  Topic #1--THE MILITARY SECRET OF SOUTH GEORGIA ISLAND Topic #2--THE SECRET NAVAL WAR OF THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE Topic #3--THE ROCKEFELLER FEAR CAMPAIGN AGAINST NUCLEAR WAR.  Topic #1--When the Falkland Islands crisis began early this month it looked at first like a tempest in a teapot.  For a century and a half since 1833, the Islands have been controlled by Great Britain.  During that entire time, British sovereignty over the Falklands has been disputed by Argentina.  There have been countless threats by Argentina to seize the Islands, which it calls the Malvinas, but the threats have always come to nothing in the past and Britain has never even gotten very worried about them.     The Islands are four times as distant from Argentina as Cuba is from the United States, and they are not much of a prize.  After 150 years of occupancy, the Falklands are home to fewer than 2,000 British settlers and a lot of sheep.  In short, the remote Falkland Islands hardly look like something to fight over, and yet here we are watching another crisis take place.  We are watching as war erupts between Great Britain and Argentina.     The Thatcher government is acting as if it has forgotten all about its usual preoccupation with the Soviet threat at NATO's doorstep.  Instead, Britain is throwing almost everything it's got at Argentina---aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, submarines, assault ships--you name it.  Luxury cruise ships have even been commissioned and turned into troop carriers overnight.  Wave after wave of additional assault troops have been activated and sent to join the fleet even after it sailed.  Ships and submarines have been pulled off station from normal NATO duty and sent to reinforce the task force.  The initial 40-ship force has grown steadily over the past several weeks into an armada numbering over 70.  Over two-thirds of the entire Royal Navy has already been deployed to the South Atlantic off Argentina.     Watching all this, a lot of people are asking: What's this fight really all about?  The most popular answer suggested in the major media is \\\"oil.\\\"  Vast deposits of oil are known to exist under the continental shelf between Argentina and the Falklands, but that has been known for nearly 10 years.  In no way does it explain the timing of the sudden military offensive by Argentina this month, and oil explains even less about the Argentine seizure of South Georgia Island.     South Georgia Island is 800 miles east of the Falklands with no known oil deposits anywhere near it; and compared to South Georgia, the Falklands are an island paradise.  South Georgia Island is covered with rugged mountains, treacherous valleys, glaciers, and semi-permanent snow.  Most of it is uninhabitable.  On top of all that, Argentina has absolutely no legal or historical claim to South Georgia Island.  In that respect it stands in sharp contrast to the Falklands.     In the early 1830s the Falklands were occupied for a while by Argentine colonists.  In 1833 the British expelled them and took over the Island.  For that and other historical reasons, Argentina argues that the Falklands really belong to Argentina, not Britain.     But no such argument is possible for South Georgia Island.  It has always been controlled by Britain, never by Argentina or Spain.  The Argentine seizure of South Georgia Island looks even more unreasonable from a military point of view.  Argentina's leaders are military men and they think in military terms.  They were well aware ahead of time that far-off South Georgia Island could not possibly be held for long.  By seizing it they were setting themselves up to absorb a military defeat, as the Island was retaken by Britain.  So the question is: Why did Argentina's military junta bother with the seemingly worthless South Georgia Island at all?     My friends, the answers to all these questions are military, not political or economic.  South Georgia Island possesses an enormous military secret.  It's a giant underground installation buried under the mountains at the northwest end of the Island.  The real reason for the so-called Falkland crisis is this secret installation, together with two other similar installations which I will describe shortly.     The secret military complexes have been in existence for many years; they are not new.  What is new is the accelerated nuclear war timetable of the American Bolshevik war planners here in Washington.  For the past two months I've been reporting the details of this new war plan to you as quickly as I can obtain and verify them.     The plan calls for NUCLEAR WAR ONE to erupt by September of this year 1982!!  It is this fast-approaching nuclear war threat that caused the so-called Falklands crisis to erupt now.     What is going on now is a coordinated effort to spoil part of the Bolshevik grand strategy for the coming nuclear war.  The mutual enemies of the American Bolsheviks here--namely, the Rockefeller cartel--and Russia's new rulers in the Kremlin are behind the present crisis.  They are trying to ruin Phase #3 of the \\\"PROJECT Z\\\" war plan which I revealed last month.  That phase is to be world domination by the American Bolsheviks after both Russia and the United States have been destroyed in NUCLEAR WAR ONE.  As I mentioned last month, the key to this plan is the existence of secret weapons stockpiles in various places around the world.     The American Bolshevik military planners here in America are working with other Bolshevik agents in key military positions of other countries to set off war.  Having done that, they intend to ride out the nuclear holocaust they have caused, safe and cozy in Government war bunkers!  When the warring nations finally lie smoldering and exhausted, the Bolsheviks will leave the shattered remains of their host countries.  They will rendezvous at the secret weapons installations and bring their weapons into the open.  They will confront the world with the only remaining fresh, up-to-date, powerful military force on earth; and using that military power, they will become the undisputed rulers of the world--that is, they plan to do all this, and they plan to pave the way for world domination very soon by setting off NUCLEAR WAR ONE in a matter of months.  The Rockefeller cartel and Russia's new anti-Bolshevik rulers are working together in a race against time to try to head off the Bolshevik war plan.     Last month I mentioned that the Bolsheviks here are benefitting from war preparations which were started by the Rockefellers long ago.  It has only been about three years since the Rockefellers were dislodged as the prime movers of the United States Government by the Bolsheviks.  Since that time the United States Government has been a house divided, torn by internal power struggles between rival Bolshevik and Rockefeller factions.  But before that, the United States had been dominated for decades both economically and politically by the Four Rockefeller Brothers.     In 1961 the Brothers launched a new long-range plan for world domination.  It was a two-prong strategy, half visible and half secret, which I first described long ago in AUDIO LETTER No. 28.  It was a plan for the United States to arm to the teeth in secret while appearing to disarm gradually.  Without repeating all the details, the basic idea was grandiose yet simple.  By deliberately appearing weak, the Rockefeller-controlled United States would maneuver itself into a nuclear war with Russia.  Then the secret weapons, including superweapons, would be unleashed to smash Russia and take over the world.     When they set the grand plan in motion in 1961, the Rockefeller Brothers were looking ahead to a nuclear war by the late 1970s.  Their military analysts concluded very early that the war being planned would have very different effects on the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.  Both superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, are located well up in the Northern Hemisphere; so are the other full-fledged nuclear powers--Great Britain, France, Red China, and India.  By contrast, the strategic targets for nuclear war in the Southern Hemisphere are relatively few and far between.  In other words, it was expected that the coming nuclear war would be essentially a Northern Hemisphere war.     In an all-out nuclear holocaust it is known that serious radioactive fallout will gradually spread to affect even areas not initially hit by war.  But there are limits to how far the war clouds can spread.  It was discovered long ago that there is very little mixing between the air of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.  In the northern half of our planet, cold air from the North Pole works its way southward towards the equator, then it works its way back to the north as warm air.  A mirror image of this process takes up the southern half of the planet.  Northern and Southern Hemisphere air meet in the equatorial zone, but very little of the air changes places.     The military conclusion, my friends, is this: the coming nuclear war could ruin large areas of the Northern Hemisphere for generations to come; but if the calculations are right, the Southern Hemisphere could escape virtually unaffected by the war.  This was music to the ears of the Four Rockefeller Brothers.  A quick look at the globe of the world shows why.  The Rockefeller cartel has dominated Latin America ever since World War II.  As I discussed in my very first monthly AUDIO LETTER, Nelson Rockefeller solidified the cartel grip on Latin America during the war.  He accomplished this as so-called \\\"Coordinator of Hemispheric Defense\\\" for then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt.  So that takes care of the South American continent and its natural resources.     Then there is the African continent.  There, too, Rockefeller control was already in effect over wide areas of Black Africa, especially south of the equator.  All this was thanks to the efforts of John D. Rockefeller III, as I detailed in AUDIO LETTER No. 36.     Looking around the globe, the most important remaining land masses from the standpoint of world domination are Australia and New Zealand.  Thanks to World War II, both were wide open to the Rockefellers.     The Rockefeller Brothers decided to establish secret military installations in the Southern Hemisphere for use after the coming war.  By this means they expected to become the masters of the surviving southern half of planet Earth after the Northern Hemisphere war.  Then, as the Northern Hemisphere gradually recovered from the nuclear holocaust, the Rockefeller empire would be able to pick up the pieces.  In this way the third generation Rockefeller Brothers expected their family dynasty to inherit the Earth.     In order to control the Southern Hemisphere militarily after the war, some means would have to be available to project military power onto any land mass.  For example, revolts against Rockefeller domination would require troops--not a blast from the beam weapons on the Moon.  The most critical factor for postwar military domination of the world was found to be a navy.  A minimum of two secret naval fleets would be required--one based in the South Atlantic, the other in the South Pacific.  Since the reserve naval fleets were to be kept secret until after the Northern Hemisphere nuclear war, they could not be built in existing shipyards.  New construction facilities had to be built and they had to be hidden.  To hide an entire shipyard is no small task; they take up a lot of space.  On top of that, it was essential that the ships remain hidden after they were built.  The best way to achieve that was to combine the shipyard and naval base into one over-all secret installation.  Finally, the secret naval installation had to be invulnerable to nuclear attack; otherwise if its existence were ever discovered prematurely, the secret navy might be wiped out.     The combined requirements for secrecy, space, and protection against attack were formidable; but one day in 1959, while all these plans were still in the early stages of development, the answer presented itself.  During a so-called banking trip to Sweden, David Rockefeller was given a tour of a unique hidden naval port.  The port is hollowed out from solid granite cliffs which come right down to the water.  The entrance to the port is a gigantic hole in the side of the cliff which can be sealed off with enormous steel doors.  Inside this big doorway on the water a huge cavity has been hollowed out to accommodate ships.     The Rockefeller Brothers and their military adviser decided that a bigger, more secret, better protected version of the Swedish hidden port was just what they wanted.  A survey of candidate sites was then initiated.  The site survey covered coastal areas throughout the Southern Hemisphere.  Many areas were rejected very quickly because the topography was wrong.  Other areas were rejected because they were too close to the equator.  Still others had to be ruled out because there were too many people living nearby, making the desired level of secrecy impossible.  Finally, it was essential that the sites chosen for the secret naval installations be totally secure politically.     At last the sites for the secret naval installations were selected.  In the South Pacific, extreme southern New Zealand was selected.  This is what I was alluding to in AUDIO LETTER No. 71 three months ago when I called attention to New Zealand's extreme importance in the coming war.     In order to obtain the necessary space, the secret New Zealand naval installation had to be divided up into two sites located close together.  One is at the extreme southwest tip of South Island where the mountain range known as the Southern Alps comes down virtually to the water's edge.  The other part of the installation is built into the northwest tip of Stewart Island, which is off the tip of South Island.  The Stewart Island facility is hollowed out within a rise known as Mt. Anglem.     The New Zealand location met all the requirements.  Ever since World War II the government of New Zealand has been tied even closer to the United States than to Great Britain.  The location is far from the equator, and the installations are buried deep under mountains, protected from nuclear attack.  They are also too deep to be reached by particle-beam attacks, and the New Zealand site is well situated to command the entire South Pacific.     In the South Atlantic an even more perfect site was found.  That site, my friends, is South Georgia Island.  It is located perfectly for naval domination of the entire South Atlantic.  The tall, rugged mountains provided a perfect location for the secret installation at the northwest tip of the 100-mile long island.  It is controlled by Great Britain whose government, like that of New Zealand, was willing to cooperate; and South Georgia Island was virtually uninhabited except for a whaling station on the northeast coast.  The whaling station was some 50 miles away from the secret new installation which was being built, but Britain took no chances.  In 1965 the whaling station was closed down.  Since that time there have been no inhabitants on South Georgia Island except for a few dozen alleged Antarctic scientists.     Construction of the secret naval facilities--two in New Zealand, one on South Georgia Island--began in the early 1960's.  The techniques were adapted from those used previously to build other large underground facilities, such as the NORAD installation inside Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado; however these techniques were adapted in radically new ways to achieve construction access directly from the sea instead of overland.  In this way, the sheltering mountain was left undisturbed in appearance both during and after construction.     The cuts in the mountain side which were necessary to let ships in and out were kept as small as possible and were well camouflaged.  Like the Swedish hidden naval port arrangement, the entrances to the secret installations can be sealed up.  When sealed, the entrance is virtually impossible to detect unless you know exactly where it is; and unlike most large construction projects, there are no tailings or piles of leftover rock lying around to attract attention.  The man-made caverns which house the secret naval installations are enormous, but all the rock and debris was disposed of at sea.     Once the secret naval facilities were built, they had to be outfitted for ship construction and docksite storage.  The fake disarmament of the United States during the 1960s contributed greatly to this task.  From 1961 to 1968 one man played a pivotal role in this elaborate Rockefeller scheme.  He was then-Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara.  All through the 60's McNamara presided over the public paring back of America's visible military power.  This included the closing down and dismantling of entire shipyards.  What we were not told was where all that shipyard equipment went afterwards.  Where it went, my friends, was to the new secret installations which were being outfitted in New Zealand and South Georgia Island!     The secret naval installations have been used as duplication facilities to reproduce certain ships and submarines designed and built here in the United States.  As Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger told Congress recently, it is cheaper to build two ships at a time.  That is especially true if the second ship is an exact duplicate of the first.  This has become even more true in recent years through the use of computerized manufacturing techniques.     The secret naval fleets which have been built at the secret installations are made up of duplicates--exact duplicates of certain other ships and submarines.  They are all nuclear powered--nuclear \\\"subs\\\"; nuclear cruisers; nuclear destroyers; and yes, nuclear aircraft carriers, three of them.  A secret twin was built for the U.S.S. Nimitz, for the U.S.S. Eisenhower, and for the newly-launched U.S.S. Carl Vincent.  All have been financed through the gigantic cost overruns, so called, that we constantly hear about in the Defense Department; and all three carriers have been provided with a full complement of aircraft whose manufacture was financed the same way!     The ships of the secret American Bolshevik naval fleets are all duplicates of other nuclear-powered vessels.  Even so, the secret naval ships possess one key difference.     Last month I revealed that the so-called \\\"Stealth Program\\\" has succeeded in developing a kind of electromagnetic invisibility shield.  This technique makes an object invisible from a distance by distorting light waves in its vicinity.     A whole new fleet of Phantom war-planes are now going into crash production that use this principle; and, my friends, all of the secret American Bolshevik navy ships have already been outfitted with similar Stealth-field equipment!  The Stealth principle is actually easier to apply to ships than to airplanes because there is more room for the powerful equipment that generates the field.     After NUCLEAR WAR ONE, the secret Stealth navy of the American Bolsheviks would be light years ahead of any other navy left on earth.  It would be perfect for the intended role of world domination.  The Rockefellers set it all in motion long ago, my friends, but three years ago they lost control of the United States Military.  Now it's the American Bolsheviks who are in control, and they are bent on war.     These secret naval installations have precipitated what is being called the \\\"Falklands crisis.\\\"  Topic #2--In AUDIO LETTER(R) No. 73 last month I described \\\"PROJECT Z\\\", the new Bolshevik three-phase strategy for NUCLEAR WAR ONE.     An elite group of American Bolshevik military planners here are flushing out the plan right now at a secret war-room here in Washington.  It's a plan by which the United States will strike the first nuclear blow, followed by all-out thermonuclear war with Russia.     Having set off the holocaust, the Bolsheviks here and in certain other countries plan to rise it out safe in comfortable war bunkers.  Finally after NUCLEAR WAR ONE fizzles out in stalemate, they plan to leave behind the ashes of the United States and her allies.  Activating Phase #3 of their grand strategy, they plan to unveil their secret weapons, especially their secret naval fleets.  With these they plan to conquer and rule what is left of the world.  The United States as we know it will be dead and gone; but in the eyes of the Bolsheviks themselves, this outcome will constitute victory.     Up to now the nuclear war timetable which I first revealed two months ago is still on track.  They are still shooting for nuclear war to begin by September of this year 1982!  Time is fast running out.     The Bolsheviks here are sprinting as fast as they can toward war; but, my friends, the Bolsheviks are not the only runners in this race.  They have two deadly enemies, both of whom are equally determined to trip up the Bolsheviks.  One enemy of the Bolsheviks here is the Rockefeller cartel; the other enemy is the new anti-Bolshevik ruling clique in Russia; and now these two mutual enemies of the Bolsheviks are pooling their efforts in certain ways.     In AUDIO LETTER No. 71 three months ago I reported that a limited, new anti-Bolshevik coalition was in the works between the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians.  The January 26 meeting between Haig and Gromyko in Geneva, Switzerland, was a turning point in the formation of this coalition.  It is now a reality, and is responsible for the so-called \\\"Falkland crisis\\\" now dominating the headlines.  It should be emphasized that this new relationship between the Rockefeller cartel and Russia falls far short of a true alliance.  They have very major disputes to be settled between them, but for the time being they have called a truce between themselves to deal with their mutual deadly enemy--the Bolsheviks here in America.     The first priority of the Russians and the Rockefellers is to slow down the Bolshevik preparations for imminent nuclear war.  If they can do that, time is on the side of the Rockefeller cartel in certain political movements which I discussed last summer in AUDIO LETTER No. 67.  A slow-down in the nuclear war timetable will also give more breathing space for additional anti-Bolshevik actions to be implemented.     The joint Rockefeller-Russian planners decided by mid-February that military action against the Bolsheviks was essential very quickly.  No other type of action had any hope of taking effect fast enough to prevent nuclear war by the end of this summer.     The exact details of the \\\"PROJECT Z\\\" war plan are not known to either the Rockefellers or the Russians, but the general outlines are known to be as I described last month.     It was decided that military action should be devised that would undermine Phase #3 of the Bolshevik war plan--that is, the Bolshevik-controlled secret naval installations and fleets in the Southern Hemisphere should be attacked and crippled.  By working together, the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians were able to devise an attack plan which neither could have carried out alone.  The Rockefeller group, who built and originally controlled these bases, provided detailed Intelligence about the best way to attack them.  The Russians with their enormous military machine provided the muscle to actually carry out the attack.     It was essential to devise a scheme that would enable both secret fleets in the South Atlantic and South Pacific to be attacked.  Survival intact of either fleet would leave the Bolshevik war plan still workable.     Military analysts concluded very quickly that a direct assault on the New Zealand facilities was out of the question.  There was no combination of commandos, frogmen, or other military force which could possibly keep an attack secret from the outside world.  Any attack on the New Zealand bases would set off the very war which the Rockefellers and Russians want to prevent.     But the situation in the South Atlantic was a different matter.  In a way, the greatest asset of South Georgia Island was also its Achilles' heel.  The extreme isolation which protected the secrecy of the South Georgia base also made a covert military assault feasible.  The key lay with Argentina and her long-standing claims to the Falkland Islands.     As I mentioned in Topic #1, the Rockefeller cartel has dominated all of Latin America for decades.  Cartel operatives were sent to Argentina to work out a deal with the government military junta there.  The historic dispute over the Falkland Islands was to be used to provide a ruse, a military cover, to enable the South Georgia base to be attacked.  The Argentine generals were not told everything about the situation by any means, but they were told enough to make clear what they were to do.     As an inducement to cooperate, the Argentine leaders were promised handsome rewards.  They were guaranteed that after the shooting was over, the Falkland Islands would remain in Argentine hands.  This guarantee included the promise of covert military assistance as needed against the Royal Navy.  And to bolster the troubled Argentine economy, it was promised that the Rockefeller cartel will help develop the immense offshore oil reserves.  With these combined promises of military glory and financial rewards, the Argentine military junta agreed to the plan.     On March 19 Argentina carried out Act #1 in the joint attack plan.  A group of Argentine scrap-metal merchants, of all things, landed at the abandoned old whaling station on South Georgia Island.  Supposedly they were there to dismantle the old buildings and cart them off to sell.  While they were at it they also raised the Argentine flag over the work-site.  The British, always nervous about South Georgia Island, promptly reacted as expected.  The British Antarctic survey ship \\\"Endurance\\\" put 22 Marines ashore.  They drove off the scrap merchants and tore down the Argentine flag.     The incident provided the desired excuse for the Argentine Junta to bring the simmering 150-year-old Falklands dispute to a boil.  From time to time in the past, Argentina has claimed that South Georgia is part of the Falklands because it is administered that way by Britain.  That argument is very flimsy but it now came in very handy.  It was nothing new to hear this from Argentine leaders, so there was no hint of what was really afoot.     During late March, Argentine military forces started assembling for an assault on the Falklands.  \\\"Nothing new\\\", thought the British high command.  Argentina has carried out threatening maneuvers in the past many times.  It was believed that they were about to do it again; but on April 2 Argentine forces did the unexpected.  After many past false alarms, this time they actually invaded and seized the Islands.  All Argentine public statements emphasized the long-standing historical claims to the Falklands themselves; but just for good measure, the next day a small Argentine force also seized far-off South Georgia Island.  The force was so small that it gave the appearance initially that it was just a side show from Argentina's point of view; however, the small contingent of 22 Royal Marines were overpowered and bundled off the Island along with a group of 13 alleged scientists.  That was the moment of payoff in the joint Rockefeller-Russian attack plan.     Thanks to the elaborate distraction staged by the Argentine forces, a special commando team got onto the Island undetected.  Based on the detailed Rockefeller information about the base, the team moved to a location on the mountain directly above the cavernous secret base.  Special high-speed drilling equipment was set up by the Rockefeller members of the team while the Russian members concentrated on military defense.  By late that evening, April 3, the military high command in London finally learned what was really taking place.  The secret South Georgia base was under attack by virtually the only means possible.  The joint Rockefeller-Russian team were drilling a shaft down through the mountain toward the hollowed out cavern inside.  It was only a matter of time until their drill would break through the ceiling of the giant hidden naval base.  Once the hole was made, the next step was obvious.  The Rockefeller-Russian team would put a weapon of some kind through the hole.  The best guess was that it would be a nerve gas.     The shock waves that went through the highest levels of the British government on the evening of April 3 can hardly be described, my friends.  The Thatcher government, like the so-called Reagan Administration here in America, is Bolshevik controlled.  That's why Margaret Thatcher always says, \\\"Me, too\\\" any time the Reagan Administration says or does anything against Russia.  Both governments are party to the secret nuclear war plan in complete betrayal of the people of their respective countries, and on the evening of April 3 they suddenly discovered that their precious war plan was in deep, deep trouble.     Immediately the Thatcher government started assembling a naval armada to sail for the South Atlantic.  Haste was the order of the day.  The drilling on South Georgia Island was proceeding around the clock.  The best estimates were that the drilling would break through into the roof of the naval base in about three weeks, on or about April 24.  If help did not reach South Georgia by then, the secret installation might be doomed.  The forces stationed at the installation itself were unable to defend themselves under the circumstances.  Their mighty naval ships were ships in a bottle.  They did not dare open the bottle to sail out to fight because the Russian commandos were armed with tactical and nuclear weapons.  To open the blast-proof entrance doors would be suicide.     On April 5, just two days after South Georgia Island was seized, some 40 naval ships began moving out of British ports.  The same day Lord Carrington was sacked as Foreign Minister.  He was forced to resign, my friends, because he had assisted the Rockefeller attack plan by downplaying the Argentine attack preparations.     That same day, April 5, New Zealand, the home of the other secret naval fleet, broke diplomatic relations with Argentina.  The two hidden New Zealand facilities had been placed on \\\"Red Alert.\\\"  As a precautionary measure, all submarines at the twin base were ordered to sea.  Several surface ships were already at sea undergoing \\\"sea trials\\\", but that still left seven (7) major ships inside the hidden twin naval base including one of the nuclear aircraft carriers I mentioned earlier.     On that busy day of April 5, Argentina's Foreign Minister, Costa Mendez, was at the United Nations in New York.  He was alarmed by the deployment of such a large part of the Royal Navy.  Costa Mendez hurried here to Washington to seek reassurances from certain officials.  He got them!     For the next two weeks or so the news was filled with stories about the allegedly slow movement of the British fleet while negotiations went on.  That, my friends, was only a cover story.  The Royal Navy was actually joining up and moving as rapidly as possible toward South Georgia Island.  If the task force arrived in time to save the secret base, a major battle was likely.  The official stories about \\\"slow movement\\\" of the British armada were intended to give a cushion of time for that battle.  If need be, the fleet would have several days to retake South Georgia Island, then it could move on to arrive near the Falklands on the announced schedule.  In this way the crucial importance of South Georgia Island would be hidden and the big secret preserved.     It was initially expected that advance elements of the British fleet would reach the vicinity of South Georgia Island within two weeks.  That would have been soon enough to attack the joint Rockefeller-Russian commando team and stop the drilling before it was completed.  But Russian Cosmospheres and submarines made a shambles of the plan.     Key advance elements of the South Georgia attack contingent left Ascension Island early April 14, two days before it was announced officially.  Shortly after they did so, they ran into trouble.  Russian Cosmospheres and attack submarines closed in on a single ship which was critical to the planned counterassault on South Georgia Island.  The Cosmospheres bombarded the bridge and combat information center of the ship with neutron radiation.  In moments the ship was without any command, its communications and radar silenced.  Then a Russian \\\"sub\\\" closed in and quickly finished off this key British ship with torpedoes.  It broke apart with secondary explosions and sank rapidly.  So far as is known, there were no survivors.     This unexpected shock in the mid-Atlantic produced two results, both important:  First, it caused a slowdown in the race toward the South Atlantic by the British armada.  The task force had to be regrouped into a configuration better suited for an enroute defense, but that cost valuable time.  Public announcements from London about the progress of the fleet reflected this slowdown.  The timetable for arrival on battle stations near the Falklands started stretching out longer and longer.  All this bought extra time for the joint commando team on South Georgia Island.  The drilling continued.  The other result of the sinking was equally important.  Word was flashed to the South Pacific Stealth navy to prepare for possible action.  It was obvious that the Russian Navy was getting involved in the Atlantic, which meant that the Royal Navy could be in big trouble.  During the dead of night, early April 15, the seven Stealth ships put to sea from their twin secret bases in southern New Zealand.  They deployed to a secret operational headquarters area in the Antipodes Islands, 450 miles southeast of New Zealand.  Their electromagnetic shields were operating to provide protection from attack.  These shields make it impossible to communicate with the outside world or even to see it, as I explained last month; but once they arrived at the Antipodes, the Stealth ships hooked up to buoys equipped with shielded communication cables to the Island headquarters.  The Antipodes headquarters, in turn, was in constant touch with the South Georgia base by way of a transoceanic cable around the tip of South America.  The deployment of the available ships of the South Pacific Stealth fleet was exactly what the joint Rockefeller-Russian planners had hoped for.  The ships had been flushed out from their essentially invulnerable hiding place in New Zealand!     The British ship's sinking of April 14 was also followed by other events.  On April 15 the Argentine Navy started moving out of port.  The same day, Alexander Haig arrived again in Buenos Aires.  Supposedly he was there as a diplomat, but in reality he was there as a General, dealing with Generals.  Haig is the top Governmental operative of the Rockefeller cartel, as I have revealed in the past.  He was making sure that the Argentines did not get cold feet and back down at that critical moment.  Four days later, April 19, Haig left for Washington.  As he boarded his plane, Haig somberly told reporters, \\\"Time is running out.\\\"  And so it was, my friends, for the secret South Georgia base.     The very next day, April 20, the drill broke through into the hollowed-out cavern of the naval base.  Bolshevik military analysts in London had not expected that it could be completed until at least the following weekend.  The British fleet was still out of range.     The weapon which the commando team inserted down through the long hole was a small, compact Russian neutron bomb.  When it was detonated inside the confines of the huge artificial cave, the effects were devastating.  The intense radiation instantly killed everyone inside the base.  Also the heat and blast effects of the bomb are believed to have damaged all the ships inside sufficiently to badly disable them.     Meanwhile, Russian Cosmospheres and submarines were converging on the Stealth ships which were near the Antipodes Islands awaiting orders.  From a distance, the ships were invisible to the eye due to their protective shields, which also protect against beam-weapon attack; but they were sitting ducks for the tactics which the Russians employed.     Floating overhead, the Cosmospheres located the seven ships using their Psychoenergetic Range-Finding equipment known as PRF.  As I have reported in the past, there is no method known by which PRF can be jammed.  The Cosmospheres radioed the exact locations of the ships to the attack submarines.  The \\\"subs\\\" were armed with special non-homing, non-nuclear torpedoes designed to explode on impact.  More sophisticated torpedoes would have been thrown off course or detonated prematurely by the protective shield of each ship; but these simple torpedoes just cruise right through each invisibility field to strike the ship and explode.  Within 15 minutes after the attack began, all seven Bolshevik Stealth ships were on their way to the bottom, and with them went their Bolshevik Commanders and mercenary crews collected from around the world.     The South Pacific action took place just after sunset local time.  The time here in Washington was around 2:00 P.M. April 23.  That evening Secretary of State Haig was seen briefly in public with the new British Foreign Minister, Francis Pym.  Pym was wearing the artificial pseudo-smile which diplomats are taught always to display in public.  But not Haig.  Haig was grinning from ear to ear, and no wonder.  The joint Rockefeller-Russian military operation had been a brilliant success.  The secret Bolshevik South Atlantic fleet had been virtually wiped out, bottled up inside South Georgia Island; and the South Pacific fleet, while not totally wiped out, had been badly crippled.  By working together, the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians had won the secret naval war of the Southern Hemisphere.  Topic #3--As I say these words, news reports give the impression that war is about to erupt in the South Atlantic, but the real war in the Southern Hemisphere is already over.  What we are watching now is the beginning of its bloody aftermath.  That aftermath is the battle for the Falkland Islands.  They have been promised to Argentina as a reward for her role in the secret war.     At this moment the Bolsheviks here in Washington are pressing for a public announcement that the United States will side with Britain.  As soon as that takes place, military action will heat up fast around the Falklands.  Britain has no choice but to fight.  She has already suffered casualties which cannot be explained without a public battle; but by fighting, the Bolsheviks in Britain are running the risk of a humiliating and tragic defeat for the Royal Navy.     Meanwhile, the Rockefeller strategists here are now concentrating on a fast-building, anti-nuclear-war campaign.  On all sides now we are hearing about the so-called \\\"nuclear freeze movement.\\\"  There are documentaries, articles, publicity of all kinds to sensitize us to the terrors of nuclear war.  In recent months, there have even been referenda popping up on election ballots dealing with the nuclear war issue.  Medical doctors are banding together to warn the public about what would happen if there were a nuclear war.     We are being told that all this is just popping up spontaneously.  We are now 37 years into the nuclear age and nothing like this has ever gained so much momentum before, yet now we are supposed to believe that millions of Americans have spontaneously gotten the same ideas at the same time.  If you believe that, my friends, I give up.  Movements like this never, and I mean never, develop without leadership, organization, and money--and plenty of it.     What we are watching is the Rockefeller public relations machine at work.  As I've explained in the past, the Rockefeller cartel cannot afford to let a nuclear war take place.  If it does, they will lose everything because they are not in a position to control it.  Instead, the deadly enemies of the Rockefeller cartel, the Bolsheviks here, will win out if there is a war; and so the Rockefeller faction is now doing everything in its power to prevent a nuclear war.     The present anti-nuclear-war orientation of the Rockefeller cartel creates certain temporary common interests between them and Russia; but as Russia's new rulers know very well, this does not spring from any great moral perspective on the part of the Rockefeller group.  It's purely a matter of practical necessity right now for the Rockefellers.     The Russians regard the United States as a house divided, and they are exploiting that division by working in careful ways with the Rockefellers.  Their first priority is to rid the world of the deadly Bolshevik menace of all-out, even suicidal, nuclear war; but once that is done, they know that there will be a day of reckoning with the Rockefeller cartel some day.     The Rockefeller group is working toward a definite objective with their new anti-nuclear-war propaganda.  That objective is renewed power--and power that moves them closer to their old dream of WORLD GOVERNMENT.  The Bolsheviks here have unwittingly provided fertile ground for the powerful new Rockefeller antiwar campaign.  Under Bolshevik control, the so-called Reagan Administration has become so hawkish that it's scaring people.  The Rockefeller antiwar campaign is designed to capitalize on that latent fear as a tool of power.     These days the smell of war is in the air.  The Falklands crisis is helping to make that more intense.  The Rockefeller propaganda machine is now paving the way for the argument that surrender of sovereignty is the only way to avoid war.  A new super-United Nations of sorts is now in the works to fill the bill.  It will have teeth!  As presently envisioned, the new organization will be based in Geneva, Switzerland.  The working name, though this may be changed, is the \\\"World Nonproliferation Council.\\\"  The plan is to bring it into being as the outgrowth of nuclear nonproliferation treaties, but its true purpose will be to use fear--the fear of war--to control us all.                         LAST MINUTE SUMMARY     Now it's time for my Last Minute Summary.  In this AUDIO LETTER I have reported on the reasons behind the so-called Falkland Islands crisis.  The crisis erupted because of secret Bolshevik-controlled naval installations in the Southern Hemisphere.  These have been attacked by joint action of the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians in an attempt to slow down the nuclear-war timetable.  The attacks were successful, but the results remain to be seen.  One result, though, is that the Royal Navy has now been drawn into a trap.  Britain's Waterloo at sea may well be at hand.     My friends, two factions are struggling for control over our United States--the Rockefeller cartel and the Bolsheviks.  They differ in style but both seek to control us through fear.  If we are ever to rise above their trickery, it must be through the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, our only hope.  As the Scripture tells us, our Lord \\\"...has not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, of love, and of a sound mind.\\\"  We must learn to wage peace.  As our Lord declared long ago, \\\"Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called sons of God.\\\"\",\"From: payne@crl.dec.com (Andrew Payne) Message-ID: <1993Apr20.004418.11548@crl.dec.com> Organization: DEC Cambridge Research Lab Date: Tue, 20 Apr 1993 00:44:18 GMT   Does anyone know if a source for the TCM3105 modem chips (as used in the Baycom and my PMP modems)?

No motherboard can sense the speed of the RAM installed, unless you call failing as a sort of auto-sense.  This is how you can sometimes use \\\"slower\\\" RAM in a machine.  You either set the number of wait states to accomodate the slow RAM (in which case, all memory will run at that slower rate) or you reduce the wait states and take the chance that the slower RAM will act like faster RAM and you won't crash.  Putting faster RAM in won't speed things up unless you tell the machine it has faster RAM.

Scott --  Scott Snowiss sasst11+@.pitt.edu\",\"The following are my thoughts on a meeting that I, Hugh Kelso, and Bob Lilly had with an aide of Sen. Patty Murrays.  We were there to discuss SSTO, and commercial space.  This is how it went...    After receiving a packet containing a presentation on the benifits of SSTO, I called and tried to schedule a meeting with our local Senator (D) Patty Murray, Washington State.  I started asking for an hour, and when I heard the gasp on the end of the phone, I quickly backed off to 1/2 an hour. Later in that conversation, I learned that a standard appointment is 15 minutes.  We got the standard bozo treatment.  That is, we were called back by an aide, who scheduled a meeting with us, in order to determine that we were not bozos, and to familiarize himself with the material, and to screen it, to  make sure that it was appropriate to take the senators time with that material.  Well, I got allocated 1/2 hour with Sen. Murrays aide, and we ended up talking to him for 45 minutes, with us ending the meeting, and him still listening. We covered a lot of ground, and only a little tiny bit was DCX specific.   Most of it was a single stage reusable vehicle primer.  There was another woman there who took copius quantities of notes on EVERY topic that we brought up.  But, with Murray being new, we wanted to entrench ourselves as non-corporate aligned (I.E. not speaking for boeing) local citizens interentested in space. So, we spent a lot of time covering the benifits of lower cost access to LEO.  Solar power satellites are a big focus here, so we hit them as becoming  feasible with lower cost access, and we hit the environmental stand on that. We hit the tourism angle, and I left a copy of the patric Collins Tourism paper, with side notes being that everyone who goes into space, and sees the atmosphere becomes more of an environmentalist, esp. after SEEING the smog over L.A.  We hit on the benifits of studying bone decalcification (which is  more pronounced in space, and said that that had POTENTIAL to lead to  understanding of, and MAYBE a cure for osteoporosis.  We hit the education  whereby kids get enthused by space, but as they get older and find out that they havent a hop in hell of actually getting there, they go on to other fields, with low cost to orbit, the chances they might get there someday  would provide greater incentive to hit the harder classes needed.  We hit a little of the get nasa out of the operational launch vehicle business angle.  We hit the lower cost of satellite launches, gps navigation, personal communicators, tellecommunications, new services, etc...  Jobs provided in those sectors.  Jobs provided building the thing, balance of trade improvement, etc.. We mentioned that skypix would benifit from lower launch costs.  We left the paper on what technologies needed to be invested in in order to make this even easier to do.  And he asked questions on this point.  We ended by telling her that we wanted her to be aware that efforts are proceeding in this area, and that we want to make sure that the results from these efforts are not lost (much like condor, or majellan), and most importantly, we asked that she help fund further efforts along the lines of lowering the cost to LEO.  In the middle we also gave a little speal about the Lunar Resource Data  Purchase act, and the guy filed it separately, he was VERY interested in it. He asked some questions about it, and seemed like he wanted to jump on it, and contact some of the people involved with it, so something may actually happen immediatly there.  The last two things we did were to make sure that they knew that we knew a lot of people in the space arena here in town, and that they could feel free to call us any time with questions, and if we didn't know the answers, that we would see to it that they questions got to people who really did know the answers.  Then finally, we asked for an appointment with the senator herself.  He said that we would get on the list, and he also said that knowing her, this would be something that she would be very interested in, although they do have a time problem getting her scheduled, since she is only in the state 1 week out of 6 these days.  All in all we felt like we did a pretty good job.\",\"Hi there netters, I have a question I would very much like to see some discussion on: Is there such a thing as a 'justifible' war?   What I would love to see it some basis from scripture for either: \\\"All war   is wrong\\\", or \\\"Some war is justifiable\\\".   To get things started I would like to outline why I am asking the   question. In my high school days I had been quite involved in the the New   Zealand Cadet Forces (This is a bit like ROTC from what I understand of   it, but with a lot more emphasis on fun than military career training).   Through this I became extremely enamoured of flying, have become involved   in the sport of gliding, and have a great interest in military aviation   hardware as the very best a 'real' flyer could ask for. My favourite   computer games are the accurate simulations of military aircraft, both   past and present.   I became a Christian about 10 years ago, and at the time rejected all   military activity as immoral. For me, all war was in complete opposition   to God's commandments to love one another, especially one's enemies.  During the war in Iraq, I found myself with great excitement listening to   the reports of the effectiveness of the the attacks using the aviation   technology I so admire - The F117A 'Stealh' bomber, the F14, F15 and F16   strike aircraft, etc. After the war concluded I began to really enjoy   simulations based around this conflict - Great to go and bomb Saddam's   bio-weapons plants in an F117A on my computer, or shoot down some of his   Mig's in an F16. The simulation of the death of people was a wonderful   game. I imagine the real pilots view the real thing in much the same way.   One only has to look at the language used to see that the personal impact   of war is ignored: A building containing people, or an aircraft flown by a   pilot is simply a 'target'. Dead civilians are 'collateral damage'. These   euphanisms are a way of removing the reality of war from the people whose   support are necessary for the continued waging of war - One only has to   look at Vietnam to see how important public opinion is.  Now we see troops sponsored by the United Nations entering Somalia, and   the prospect of military intervention in the Muslim/Croat/Serb conflict in   the former Yugoslavia. My revulsion in particular to the siege of   Sarajevo, and in the last few days of (sorry 'bout spelling) Sebrenitsa,   has caused me to rethink where I stand on 'justifiable' war.  I will list several wars in the last 50 years I can look at each, and say   - Yes this may have been justifible, this may not. These are simply my gut   reactions to each - In many cases with the benefit of the impartiality   history brings. Let me go through a few and state some of my reasons for   my reaction - I am not a historian, so excuse any historical blunders, I   am working from popular history as it is known in New Zealand.  1. The Second World War  - Murder of Jews - Hitler had to be stopped.  - Massive civilian casualties on both sides    - Dresden, Hiroshima/Nagasaki  - Probably justifiable.  2. Korean war  - Political expansionism by North Korea, basically    communism vs. capitalism.  - Probably not justifiable.  3. Vietnam  - As above, worsened by US involvement.  4. Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia.  - Genocide by Khmer Rouge.  - Probably justifiable.  5. Iraq (Desert Storm)  - Political expansionism, threat to world oil supply  - Other factors such as genocide.  - Not sure, but probably justifiable  6. A future involvement in Bosnia  - Genocide - so called 'Ethnic Cleansing'  - Emotive - much TV coverage of atrocities and civilian casualties.  - Probably justifiable  7. Possible future use of nuclear weapons - tactical or strategic,   somewhere in the world by the US in response to someone else - e.g. Libya   or Israel.  - My feelings in this are simple  - Nuclear war/weapons are abhorrent  - I love the New Zealand government's stand on banning all nuclear    armed or powered warships from NZ port.  - Never justifiable.  These are my own views, I have looked at scripture, and I am confused. I   would appreciate others view, particularly those based on scripture. I   *don't* want a - Naaahh, yer wrong - I think answers 8-).

It is     disingeneous to compare their death to that of athletes in Munich    or any other act of terrorism or mrder.  This exercise is aimed     solely at diverting the issue and is far from the truth.  I agree that the death of three soldiers on a patrol etc... is not terrorism.  That having been said, lets continue.     [snip]    imagine ????  It is NOT a \\\"terrorist camp\\\" as you and the Israelis like     to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer    in the streets, women preparing lunch, men playing cards, etc.....  I would not argue that all or even most of the villages are \\\"terrorist camps\\\".  There are however some which come very close to serving that purpose and that is not to say that other did not function in that way prior to the invasion.      SOME young men, usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members of    the Lebanese resistance.  Even the inhabitants of the village do not     know who these are, they are secretive about it, but most people often    suspect who they are and what they are up to.  These young men are    supported financially by Iran most of the time.  They sneak arms and    ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps    for Israeli patrols.  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured    by these traps, Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages    of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians.  Once they    are back they announce that they bombed a \\\"terrorist  hideout\\\" where    an 8 year old girl just happened to be.  Some of the villages, and yours might well be among them, are as you describe.  Not all are.  There are a large number of groups in the area, backed by various organizations, with a wide range of purposes.  Hizbollah and Amal were two of the larger ones and may still be.  As to retaliation, while mistakes may be made, that is still a far cry from indiscriminate bombing, which would have produced major casualties.     Israel's retalliation policy is cold hearted, but a reality that    we have come to accept and deal with, the Lebanese Resistance    on the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING     ISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw, this is the only real     leverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw.  Well, here we disagree.  I think that Israel would willingly withdraw if the Lebanese gov't was able to field a reliable force in the area to police it and prevent further attacks.     This is the only realistic solution, it is time for Israel to    realize that the concept of a \\\"buffer zone\\\" aimed at protecting    its northern cities has failed.  In fact it has caused much more    Israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel    would have resulted in.    Actually that is not clear at all.  I will agree that the death toll is no longer civilian and now primarily military though.     There seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese    goovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such     circumstances, and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is    capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did    in all other parts of Lebanon.  No, the Syrian gov't is more than happy to have Israel sink into another Lebanese morass.  I could elaborate if necessary.     I agree, only in the case of the Isareli soldiers their killing    CANNOT be qualified as murder, no matter what you say.  No, but it is regretable, as is the whole situation. \",\"Subject says it all :)  I'm looking for the jumper settings for an SMS OMTI 8610 AT-bus ESDI  controller card.

That leaves Germany, Japan and the UK as examples of a country where the right wing government is on the verge of collapse. Oh and of course the USA which just elected a socialist government :-)   Etc, unfortunately you can't pin this on the left or the right, both are to blame. Both sides are equally deep into the corruption scandal. The only  untained party is the northern league which is a bunch of nationalist separatists and the communist party which has collapsed.    Ed should take a look at the budget deficit Regan and Bush created together before he starts to make claims about europe collapsing based on the budget deficits here. None of them are serious on the USA scale.  And here in Europe we have zero interest in Ed-Ipser type freed thank you. We do not want our countries to be run by a narrow elite of rich lawyers for the benefit of the super wealthy. We are quite happy with social  democracy and despite the fuss made in Time and Newsweek there is remarkably little being done to reverse the social welfare reforms brought in by socialism.  The problem with socialism is that it started with the aims of free education and health care and provision of the welfare state. This has been achieved across the whole of Europe, only the USA is struggling to catch up. The problem for socialism is what to do now it has succeeded.    Ed starts to discus LA, presumably he thinks that it is in Europe. On the other hand he most probably hasn't heard of a European city.   Rather the opposite. What is happening in Italy is that the communist party has collapsed. This has meant that the grand coalition between right and left wing parties to keep out the communists has also collapsed. The  magistrates have seized this opportunity to crack down hard on fraud and  corruption and have arrested half the politicians. The fact that the socialists are in charge this week is incidental, the right is into the corruption just as baddly.  What looks likely to happen is the fringe parties are going to do much better in the next election. Most of the parliamentary deputies are going to get replaced and the parties are going to be forced to look to people who are free of any hint of corruption.

Why do you say that? It sounds like you're suggesting  Bill James had something to do with overhyping the kid to death. Au contraire; he was fairly critical of him after his ROY campaign, noting that he wasn't all-world as a catcher or a hitter. He called him basically average when everyone *else* in the media was predicting the next Johnny Bench or Roy Campanella.      Which reports are those?      I like Hernandez a lot, but if Piazza can catch the ball, you've gotta play him IMHO. He's a much better hitter, although Hernandez isn't a *bad* hitter. Right now, it sounds like Piazza will catch most of the time and Hernandez will be Candiotti's caddy since he can catch the knuckler. As long as they play up to their abilities, the Dodgers could have a very good catching tandem.       I think both are overrated defensively (see Nichols' Law of catcher defense), but that's something that's difficult to prove or disprove from your viewpoint or mine. About the only tangible thing we can look at is opponent's SB%, and that's clouded by how well your pitchers hold runners. Catchers ERA is a possibility, but it's subject to way too many biases.     As for them 'playing on a team that is not so much in need of another big bat', I disagree here too.

From the March 1993 \\\"Aero Vision\\\" (The newsletter for the Employees of McDonnell Douglas Aerospace at Huntington Beach, California).      SPACE CLIPPERS LAUNCHED SUCCESSFULLY      \\\"On Monday, March 15 at noon, Quest Aerospace Education, Inc.   launched two DC-Y Space Clippers in the mall near the cafeteria.   The first rocket was launched by Dr. Bill Gaubatz, director and   SSTO program manager, and the second by Air Force Captain Ed   Spalding, who with Staff Sgt. Don Gisburne represents Air Force   Space Command, which was requested by SDIO to assess the DC-X for   potential military operational use.  Both rocket launches were   successful.  The first floated to the ground between the cafeteria   and Building 11, and the second landed on the roof of the   cafeteria.      Quest's Space Clipper is the first flying model rocket of the   McDonnell Douglas DC-X.  The 1/122nd semi-scale model of the   McDonnell Douglas Delta Clipper has an estimated maximum altitude   of 300 feet.  The Space Clippers can be used in educational   settings to teach mathematics and science, as well as social   studies and other applications.  The Space Clipper is available   either in the $35 Space Clipper outfit, which includes everything   needed for three launches, or as individual rockets for $12 each.   Both are available through hobby shops or by calling 1-800-858-   7302.\\\"    By the way -- this is not an endorsement to buy the product nor is it an advertisement to buy the product.

A friend and I are designing the chip as the final course project for an advanced computer architecture course taught by Dr. Fred Brooks at UNC-Chapel Hill.  While we feel that we've got a pretty solid design currently, we'd really like to get ahold of some frequency data from an X-Windows server so that we can make the most effective use of our bit budget.    Unfortunately, I've been unable to find anything of this sort in the various X FAQs, or X manuals that I've seen.  Does anyone have some type of frequency data, like how many Copy-rectangle operations vs draw-lines, and things of that sort?  Or, barring that, a program that records requests to the server into a logfile that I can munge on myself?  Any and all help would be very appreciated.  Many thanks,     ---Mark\",\"  Let's see...

It's scary to think just how much he'll produce if he were to stay healthy all year.  The Yanks have a lot going for them this year: good starting rotation, good bullpen, good defense and a good lineup. Also, I like Buck Showalter. Frank Howard on 1st is also a good move. Everything sounds good so far.   If the Yanks stay healthy, they have a good chance at winning the pennant.

As a flaming libertarian paranoid extremist (:-), I'at a loss for specific objections that don't sound frighteningly technical.  Any suggestions?  Perhaps somebody could post a list of these?    One way to do this might be to suggest that these companies should be implementing their own schemes, not being limited to the govt's scheme.  I find that most of my reasons for opposition to the CLipper scheme are algoritm insecurity and mistrust of the govt/NSA.  These are hard  to sell in letters to the editor and to nontechnical people.  Any hints or advice.  Maybe a small FAQ-type thing \\\"Why should I Hate Clipper\\\" would be a good idea.\",\"  Sure.
